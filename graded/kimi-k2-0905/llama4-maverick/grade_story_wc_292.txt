<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Interiority is vivid—“copper nail pulsing” embodies ancestry—but contradictory impulses stay latent; no micro-choice forces trade-off. Emilia’s desire to “honor bravery” remains abstract until final line; cost is intellectual, not visceral. No relationship crucible; station is solitary. Closure is a suspended question, not earned renunciation—so the 9+ quick test fails.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: final image of “great unknown” reweights stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—dread thickens by iterative motif rather than causal chain. Orientation clean by 120 w; no teleporting props. Mild causality gap: reversible exile rule never tightens options on-page, only reframed as theme.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Weather-station dome, copper nail, and yellowed journals anchor every beat; nail’s evolving tactile states charge the final image. Selective sensory triage—humming systems, spongey air—mirrors narrowing attention. Spatial choreography stable in single-room frame. No occupational depth requested; environment felt, not explained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: decode sailor’s map-before-exile or be trapped in same pattern. Pressure escalates via density, not events—dread sponges up paragraph space until options shrink to “confront the truth.” No visible resource loss; cost is atmospheric. Reversible exile concept stays thematic, never narrows tactical choices, capping intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: maps as both liberation and cage; ancestry as reversible exile. Subtext carried through object handling and coded gaps between words. No explicit moral; final question invites counter-reading. Emotional aftereffect strong—reader left inside same fog—though insight slightly generalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight psychic distance; perceptual signature filters through cartographic metaphors (“lines between words”). Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences under dread, then staccato questions. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs sparse; diction stays within librarian lexicon. Distinctive texture achieved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers ancestral relic, meteorological anomaly, and textual puzzle. No scaffold loops; metaphors coherent (“spongey dread” sustains tactile image). Occasional elevated phrase (“metaphysical displacement”) nudges above POV ceiling but brief. Final line cadence decisive—earned pause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climate-science outpost with ancestral occult artifact feels non-obvious. Reversible exile trope refreshed through bibliographic decryption rather than portal mechanics. Risk confined to mood-piece drift, but coherence holds. Specificity—copper nail, jet-stream shift—prevents generic overlay.</comment>
