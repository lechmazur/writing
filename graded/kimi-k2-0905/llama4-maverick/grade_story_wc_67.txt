<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is evocative but remains observational; the scattering act is reverent yet lacks a visible cost that alters her stance. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the “earned” beat feels asserted rather than lived. The Eli exchange supplies status tilt, yet both voices converge toward the same gentle philosophy, flattening distinction.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the portrait→ash progression layers density until the final ash drift delivers a Conceptual Repricing (safety = mirage). Causality is lyric rather than plot, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last sentence. The Orientation Test is met inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<comment>The gallery is sketched with spare but biased detail—powder on frame, somber wall tones—filtered through Lena’s ritual gaze. Bodies track cleanly; no white-room syndrome. The mask’s porcelain shards function as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—impermanence of safety—surfaces early and tightens through ash scattering as literal forfeiture of permanence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena realizes transience is the value, not the loss. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, adequate for this lyric design but short of 8.8+ urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via iterated fragility images (shattered mask, charcoal dust, powder) rather than exposition. The final reconfiguration—safety as vanishing mirage—feels earned because the ash drift makes the concept tactile. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, landing in resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—Lena notices texture, decay, ritual. No head-hopping. Prose rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences build to short, almost liturgical ash release. Minor register lift in “conceptual reweighting” phrases but within POV’s art-world lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers motif or stakes; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. Final line anchors closure without overwriting. Minor participle simultaneity (“eyes appear to hold…”) but no clarity break.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Ash scatterer” occupation is fresh and makes the familiar art-of-transience theme specific. Shattered porcelain mask as emotional lattice feels novel yet inevitable. Conceptual risk—quiet lyric over plot—pays off in closure. Could push further into sensory specificity of ash texture to reach 8.8.</comment>
