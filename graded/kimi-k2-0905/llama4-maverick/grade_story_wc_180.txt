<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is warm and specific—muttering to trees, ribbon on branch—but her contradictory impulses are told, not dramatized (“vows… had flourished”). Aria’s return is off-stage summary; no moment shows Elara choosing against an alternative, so the renunciation feels foregone rather than paid for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens: orchard’s revival is textured through seed-planting, visitor influx, ribbon reprise. Closure is a soft Charged Poise: daughter’s touch on ribbon reweights earlier breach, but cost is asserted (“deep sense”) rather than dramatized; no path is foreclosed for Elara, blunting the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Cathedral-orchid fusion is vivid—“lush orchard spanning its rafters”—and constrains Elara’s movements (ladders, soil baskets). Spatial anchoring clear by 120 words; micro-setting (ribbon on branch) charges final image. Some floral descriptors verge on brochure (“deeper shade of green”) but overall atmosphere integrates with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring generational contract through orchard—is declared early, yet pressure stays flat. Seeds sprout off-page; visitors arrive by summary; no tightening forces Elara to risk anything tangible. Escalation is observational, not agency-driven; coincidence (Aria’s return) delivers resolution without on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal-through-remnants emerges via ribbon, seeds, cathedral reclamation. Subtext is quiet but coherent: living memory grafted onto stone. Final paragraph nudges toward moral summary (“ testament to the accidental wisdom”) yet still lets image carry weight; could risk more ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter—sound of leaves, feel of soil. Syntax stays fluid, no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“deciduous in nature”) slightly jars against homely muttering, but rhythm remains controlled; no dialogue to distort voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, occasionally lush without purple overload; sentences advance. Few soft loops—“tended… with a gentle reverence” then “worked with gentle reverence”—but not dense enough to stall. Metaphors stay organic (contract “withered”). Final line lands crisply, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Abandoned-cathedral-orchard is fresh architectural image; deciduous contract literalizes legal decay into vegetal metaphor. Execution leans pastoral-feel-good rather than risky; Aria-return feels standard reconciliation beat. Specificity of quartz-eye mender could push further into mineral/plant hybrid lore.</comment>
