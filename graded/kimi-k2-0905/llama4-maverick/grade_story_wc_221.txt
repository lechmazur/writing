<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s “blessed pariah” status is asserted, not dramatized; she never collides with another being, so the social cost of pariah-hood is absent. Interiority drifts into stock cosmic awe (“stars twinkling like diamonds”) and therapeutic self-diagnosis (“weight of her temporally stretched existence”). The only embodied choice—sketching—repeats the family custom without visible friction or escalation; the stance shift remains abstract. The ending earns a micro-stance of wonder, but the cost is asserted, not paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the compass glow aligns with the horizon light, re-weighting stillness into forward motion; cost is felt as the “echoed silence” yielding to “soft whisper of possibility.” Causality is accumulative/textural; the sketch act and compass glow accumulate until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by word 50; no penalty. The sketch custom is the single reflective block, anchored and within limits. No meaningful tightening mid-text; escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing, but suffices for this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The deck is sketched with selective sensory strokes—metallic echo, gilded compass, void stars—that filter through Aria’s stargazer eye. Spatial choreography is minimalist yet coherent: floor, railing, horizon line track cleanly. The compass rose constrains the final gaze direction, charging the closure image; environment thus guides choice. No micro-prop is handled tactilely, but the compass fulfills the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: convert disorientation into purposeful motion. Pressure is atmospheric—silence, starlight, compass glow—rather than option-narrowing; no resource is lost or path foreclosed. The single “tightening” is the alignment of compass and distant light, a poetic rather than tactical narrowing. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; acceptable under Accumulative lens but keeps score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of navigation—cosmic and personal—emerges through the compass, sketching, and horizon light without explicit sermon. The final image reweights “true north” from literal direction to metaphorical forward motion, offering quiet resonance. ambiguity is modest but present: is the glow a ship, a star, a mirage? The memory of family stargazing supplies bittersweet counterpoint, avoiding tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a star-hushed cadence; diction stays within Aria’s poetic lexicon. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Sentence rhythm varies: longer star-catalogue lines versus clipped “She took her first step.” Filter verbs are minimal; perception is immediate. The compass glow repetition risks incantatory loop but reads as purposeful pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, faintly lyrical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are conventional (“stars twinkling like diamonds”) but unobtrusive. One simultaneity slip: “As she worked, the gilded compass rose applique seemed to glow” compresses cause and effect. Final paragraph drifts toward inspirational uplift (“brighter tomorrow”) that edges sentimental but stays within voice contract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Time-dilated ghost deck is familiar SF furniture, yet the fusion with family sky-sketching ritual gives it a quiet, personal slant. The compass rose as both setting piece and thematicGPS is not new, but its glow aligning with unknown horizon light supplies a gentle reconfiguration. Risk is low; the piece chooses meditative lyric over speculative rigor. Specificity of the gilded applique texture saves the image from genericness.</comment>
