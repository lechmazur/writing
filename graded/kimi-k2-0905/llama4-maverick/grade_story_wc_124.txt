<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush—her olfactory memories are concrete and character-specific—yet her arc is almost entirely internal, lacking micro-choices that visibly foreclose options. The single decision (returning the emptied vial) is quiet but not driven by a prior causal dilemma on the page. Aromatic caution is shown in perception, not in a beat where it costs her anything. The grief is embodied, yet no contradictory impulse complicates it; the emotion is performed rather than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emptied yet glowing vial crystallizes a Charged Poise—memory’s beauty and fragility reweighted with undeniable cost. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent: scent-memories accumulate until the UV-reveal pattern breaks and deepens the stake. The curator is never anchored spatially, so orientation wobble at ~120 words is minor and does not disturb the ending lens. One meaningful tightening occurs: the UV lights shift nostalgia into awe, then grief, then peace—each cadence legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: UV-lit extinct petals constrain Elara’s emotional tempo and supply the exact sensory trigger for her grief-release. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—olfactory details dominate, visual patterns arrive only under UV reveal. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The vial as recurring object charges the final image; its emptied glow is inseparable from the earned poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making peace with memory’s ache—is signaled early and deepened once via the UV-reveal pattern break. Agency is present but soft: she breathes, weeps, and replaces the vial—an endurance that forecloses lingering sorrow. Cost is felt (tears, empty vial) yet not visibly persistent; no external consequence alters later tactics. Escalation is a single cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options; still, it satisfies the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: scent as time’s unextinguishable bloom. The vial’s final empty glow reweights the premise—memory’s essence is spent yet luminous. No character articulates a thesis; the reader feels the aftereffect through image alone. Ambiguity is purposeful: peace is real yet fragile, refusing a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—olfactory metaphors, lantern-light vocabulary—without head-hop. Syntax modulates: longer fragrance-laden clauses in calm moments, shorter breath-units under UV pulse. No dialogue, so voice is carried by narrative rhythm; it holds. Register stays within her sensuous, wistful lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Figurative language clusters around scent and light, never breaking physical logic. Minor scaffold: “washes over her” appears twice; proximity paraphrase but not in closure beat. Density is high; each sentence layers sensory and emotional information. Read-aloud rhythm supports the incense-like cadence without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Extinct-plant greenhouse + inherited perfume vial + UV reveal is a fresh synthesis; not a stock combo. The emotional engine—grief released through scent-triggered botanic awe—avoids familiar templates. Risk is quiet rather than structural; freshness lies in olfactory specificity. Proximity to “memory-evoking scent” trope is offset by UV-botanic frame.</comment>
