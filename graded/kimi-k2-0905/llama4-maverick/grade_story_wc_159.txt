<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The caretaker’s motive to “preserve the sound of forgotten names” is stated repeatedly but never tested; she sings, orchids glow, and the moment ends without a visible cost or trade-off. Interiority stays atmospheric (“foxglove regret”) rather than contradictory under pressure. No micro-choice forecloses a path; the action is circular maintenance, not escalation. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the song ends, light lingers, and the caretaker accepts perpetual return. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and cadence reweight the stake rather than causal chain. Cost is present (“lonely…labor of love”) but abstract; no concrete forfeiture is shown. Orientation is clear by line 20; no transitions or shard breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The opal library, wind chime, and glass orchids are rendered with tactile specificity and filter every beat; the cracked bamboo’s light-constraint directly shapes the final image. Micro-setting (the cracked tube as light-source) charges closure. Spatial choreography is tight; bodies, chimes, and orchids track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and filtered luminosity, matching the caretaker’s auditory obsession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stake is atmospheric preservation; pressure is static—no live option narrows, no tactic changes. The song’s echo intensifies mood but does not raise cost or risk failure. Escalation is lyrical density, not consequential tightening. The conflict remains an elegiac loop without visible price or irreversible turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-sound emerges through iterated auditory motifs rather than statement. Subtext operates in the cracked tube’s mournful timbre and the orchid’s responsive glow. Final image reframes maintenance as love-inflected loss, avoiding moral. Ambiguity is purposeful: the library will outlast her, yet she persists. No tidy thesis; resonance stays sonic and visual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains velvet, cadenced syntax that mirrors caretaker’s gentleness. Perceptual signature is auditory-biased, drawn to shimmer and reverberation. No dialogue; narrative diction stays within plausible caretaker lexicon. Rhythm swells and subsides with song beats, tightening under micro-pressure then exhaling into wistful cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; no synonym loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors (“glass orchids…essence of clouds”) stay coherent and physically apt. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. Occasional softeners (“seemed to”) are voice-consistent, not scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Premise of a cloud-top library preserving extinct emotions via glass flora and damaged chime is fresh, yet concept risks preciousness. Specificity of the cracked bamboo emitting light under song saves it from abstraction. Emotional angle—caretaker’s foxglove regret—adds botanical-exotic shading. Risk is moderate; payoff is atmospheric rather than stakes-altering.</comment>
