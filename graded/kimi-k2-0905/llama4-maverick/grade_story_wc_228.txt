<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The painter’s nostalgic pull and quiet rebellion after the mirror crack are credibly evoked, but her interiority drifts into generic “freedom” abstractions; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the renunciation feels predetermined rather than wrested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—the finished canvas holding “temporary eternity”—with conceptual cost legible, yet the middle pivot (wrong-turn oasis) is coincidence-heavy and the causal chain from cracked mirror to vow to hidden cave remains asserted, not dramatized; orientation within the cave network is vague past the 120-word window, triggering −0.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Coastal textures—salt-stiff brush, luminescent moss, worn quay stone—are selective and POV-filtered; the cave oasis functions as a micro-setting that re-weights stakes. Spatial choreography is loose during the “winding path” stumble, but the final canvas detail re-anchors the painter’s body and tool, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture fleeting beauty vs. keep inner promise—surfaces early, but pressure plateaus: the cave discovery drops external opposition and the final beat is serene completion rather than trade-off. No visible price is paid on-page; the tightening is poetic, not tactical, capping escalation short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>“Temporary eternity” emerges through image, not assertion, culminating in the canvas that outlives the painter. The theme avoids sermon, yet the mirror-crack catalyst is named more than dramatized, muting the personal cost beneath the aesthetic meditation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to painter perception; diction leans sensuous without purple drift. Rhythm breathes with light shifts, and perceptual signature—“intimately aloof”—threads syntactically through clipped, observant clauses. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal texture is consistent and modulated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; figurative layer is restrained, never clogging the final third. One scaffold loop: “world around her melted away” appears twice with near-identical phrasing—−0.2. Otherwise crisp, high-density lines propel without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The cracked-mirror freedom trope is familiar, yet the coastal-cave oasis inflects it with painter-specific geography and ethics of secrecy. Risk is moderate—lyric meditation inside hidden grotto—but the conceptual reprice feels inevitable in hindsight, not startling.</comment>
