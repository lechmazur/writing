<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The map-maker’s curiosity is vivid early, but once the shard activates she becomes a passive tourist through kaleidoscopic worlds; no micro-choice alters the itinerary and her interiority turns repetitive (“she felt… she knew… she sensed…”). The withheld-truth motive is declared, never tested by a risky decision; the ending’s clarity lands as gift, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is present—she re-enters home bay with irreversible knowledge—but the causal chain is fuzzy: the shard’s rules, doorway timing, and her agency inside the weave are all asserted, not demonstrated. Orientation is waived yet lens stays Accumulative/Textural; however, the lack of a visible cost or constraint in the final beat keeps the reconfiguration lightweight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rust-stink air, grimy light, and tangled hulks give tactile ruin; the bay later re-appears as charged mirror of her changed gaze. Micro-setting works: the green shard is handled, weighed, re-handled—its glow tracked like a local light-source that alters visibility. Good sensory hierarchy; spatial choreography clean across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“discover the withheld truth”—stays abstract; pressure is atmospheric (shifting worlds) rather than a narrowing of options she can accept or refuse. No tightening beat forces trade-off; cost is existential wonder, not a denied path, so escalation feels diffuse under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of cartographic hubris vs. un-mappable multiverse emerges imagistically, never sermonized. The green shard’s reprise at return subtly reweights “home” as just one more contingent map. Ambiguity is purposeful; however, without a tangible sacrifice the resonance feels mid-register rather than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrid, slightly elevated diction (“murmur of half-remembered dreams”) is consistent and attuned to POV. Sentence rhythm modulates—long, breathy clauses for drift, abrupt fragments when worlds blur. No dialogue, so voice distinction test N/A; internal monologue avoids filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is fluid, but repeated “she” stems and “as she…” scaffolding create template echoes that dull propulsion. Figurative layer is restrained, coherent. Density adequate; minor paraphrase loops (“she felt… she knew”) in final third cap rise above 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Wandering cartographer + orphaned spaceport + spontaneous doorway is a fresh triangulation on familiar multiverse trope. The shard-as-handheld-lens repurposes portal MacGuffin into perceptual tool; however, the absence of an idiosyncratic world-variant scene keeps the angle from feeling fully non-obvious.</comment>
