<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is consistent—her “confidently uncertain” stance shows in micro-choices like planting the wrong seeds and unbending the nib—but the emotional cost is stated (“grave mistake”) rather than embodied; the pen’s reactivation feels more conceptual than tactile, so the final charge is muted, not crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unbent pen plus anomaly ink rewrites her garden’s meaning, showing editing history as self-revision; cost is felt in the thickened air and louder whispers. Causal chain holds: bad seeds → pen restoration → new narrative control. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of whispers and ink reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: it thickens air, modulates cosmic whispers, and literally lets ink rewrite reality—its rules are learned through Aria’s body and pen, not exposition. Sensory triage is POV-driven; the fountain pen’s materiality (dried, exotic nib) anchors tactile specificity. Final image of anomaly-as-sanctuary recharges the opening “fragile spider-web” line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over narrative/history—is signaled early; escalation is the pen’s gradual reactivation under anomaly pressure, tightening options from passive interpretation to active authorship. Agency visible: unbending nib, mixing celestial ink, writing new page. Cost is conceptual—once she writes, she accepts responsibility for edited realities—but not viscerally felt; hence stays below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of narrative-as-reality emerges implicitly through pen mechanics and anomaly ink, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext in “weeds that repelled them” reframes failure as necessary deviation; final “guardian of this threshold” image offers Charged Poise without moralizing. Resists tidy comfort—strange comfort is tonal, not didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is stable third-person limited, perceptually skewed to Aria’s celestial-mechanic lexicon (“contingent relationships,” “cosmic whispers”). Rhythm breathes with action—short clauses during nib manipulation, longer cadences for reflection. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; register stays within interpreter’s plausible diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence advances image or causality. No scaffold loops; figurative language is sparse and functional (“fabric… spider’s web”). Opening and final lines carry echoing charge. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she began”) in mid-section dull immediacy but do not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise refreshes the trope of reality-writing by marrying celestial signal interpretation to gravitational anomaly; pen-as-editor is familiar but retooled through cosmic mechanics and interpreter POV. Transformation test: swap anomaly for vanilla fantasy portal and the emotional arc collapses—setting is integral. Risk in quiet lyric ending pays off via Charged Poise.</comment>
