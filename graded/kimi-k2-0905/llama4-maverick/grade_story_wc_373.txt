<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena’s motives—recover the fob, shield her father’s trade—stay coherent, but her interiority drifts into generic “determination” labels; the climactic stare-down with The Shadow is more posture than embodied choice, so the cost feels asserted rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sunrise light and the unbroken gaze re-weight the market’s fragile peace with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—fob purchase triggers hush, stare-down sustains it—but the lens tilts Accumulative; the tightening is more atmospheric than consequential, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rotting-pier market is evoked through salt-stink, clinking junk, slit-light geometry; the fob’s glint and the sunrise slats physically charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the family shine operation—signals early; the sunrise clock tightens the standoff, but the false-sabotage pressure is off-stage, so escalation is felt more as mood spike than tactical narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust-as-currency emerges through the hush-truce image; the final poise lets ambiguity linger without moralizing, though the “sound of trust breaking” motive stays abstract rather than repriced on the body.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays stable; diction leans poetic but stays anchored to Lena’s sensory filter; rhythm modulates with tension, no head-hop. Voice is competent, not yet idiosyncratic enough for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>High density early—every sentence feeds image or tension; minor loop intrusions (“the air was heavy… the tension was palpable”) and two mixed metaphors dock 0.3. Closure line breathes cleanly, artifacts avoid the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Pirate-market-plus-moonshine is fresh texture; the “truce of hush” twist on criminal etiquette offers a sharp micro-reconfiguration. Yet the Shadow remains hooded cipher, leaning on trope, so ingenuity is partial, not transformative.</comment>
