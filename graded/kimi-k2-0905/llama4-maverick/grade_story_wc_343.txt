<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Eli’s curiosity is stated repeatedly but never crystallizes into a risky choice; the decoding happens off-stage and the final “ready to set course” is still only intention. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to the discovery, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is a declared future intention (“Eli knew that they were ready to set course”) rather than an on-page decisive change or charged poise; no option is foreclosed and no cost is felt. The luminance map is completed but never tested against reality, so the story ends in forecast, not reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Airship cabin is sketched with tactile relics—hopscotch board, charts, phrasebook—that integrate into Eli’s process; starling murmuration outside supplies atmospheric motion but never constrains action or timing. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual) and the world rules remain generic steampunk; specificity is adequate but not choice-limiting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes are announced as “discovery of a lifetime” yet never sharpen into a concrete trade-off or risk; the code is cracked without obstacle, opposition, or resource spent. Pressure plateaus once the message is read—no escalation, reversal, or cost appears under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of solitary knowledge-seeking is coherent but thin; the phrasebook and hopscotch code gesture at buried voices yet never complicate Eli’s stance. Final image reprises luminance and starlings as wonder-symbols, but without cost the resonance stays ornamental rather than repricing the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice stays steady and filtered through Eli’s map-minded attention; diction is clean but rhythmically flat, leaning on participial openings that dull urgency. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness rests on interior diction—adequate yet not idiosyncratic enough to be memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is competent and clear; however, repeated scaffold phrases (“Eli’s fingers absently turned,” “Eli’s eyes wandered,” “Eli’s heart swelled”) create template cadence that slows momentum. Figurative language is sparse and safe, producing neither clarity gains nor texture risks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing starling murmuration with antique airship cartography gives a fresh visual frame, but the plot engine—found light + floor-game code—feels like a gentle remix of puzzle-box tropes without subversion. Specificity is present yet not transformative; the concept never risks its own beauty.</comment>
