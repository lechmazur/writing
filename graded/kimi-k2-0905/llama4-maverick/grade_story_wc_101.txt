<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Akira’s “gentle determination” is asserted, not embodied; her single micro-choice—ringing the bell—does not cost her anything or foreclose a path. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the interior is flat. The community’s gratitude is collective scenery; no individual relationship tests her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a declared rallying cry (“We will not be broken…”) rather than a visible decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the cost is rhetorical, not on-page. The piece is accumulative/textural, but the final cadence merely restates earlier sentiment without tightening or deepening. No option is foreclosed, no tactic altered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Terra-cotta arbor, lantern light, and distant pot-clang give tactile grounding and mirror communal warmth. However, the setting never constrains movement or resources; sanctions remain abstract, and the ridge offers no tactical limit. Micro-setting (bell, lanterns) is vivid but inert.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Stake—community survival under sanctions—is declared, yet no on-page shortage, conflict over distribution, or risk appears. Pressure is static; the midnight food runs are summarized, not dramatized, so no tightening or trade-off is felt. Escalation is replaced by iterative affirmation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of anonymous solidarity is overtly named twice, crowding out subtext. The bell’s chime is intended as motif, but its meaning never shifts; it simply punctuates mood. Resonance is asserted, not re-weighted by the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Akira, with calm, measured cadence that matches “quiet confidence.” However, perceptual signature is generic—“soft orange glow,” “gentle hum”—lacking idiosyncratic filter. No syntactic risk or rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, free of loops or mixed metaphor, but leans on abstract feel-good phrasing (“spirit of solidarity,” “beacon of hope”) that blunts specificity. Sentence rhythm is uniform; no density spike or breath variation. Functional, not memorable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>Exile solidarity under sanctions is timely yet treated with familiar uplift tropes—lantern-lit arbor, silver bell, communal pledge. No fresh angle on distribution dilemmas, donor anonymity tension, or intergenerational sacrifice. Could swap setting and object without altering arc.</comment>
