<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The clock-maker’s hunger for the arcane is declared but never tested; he never hesitates, fears, or sacrifices. Interiority stays generic (“neatly inventive mind” repeated) rather than showing contradiction under pressure. No cost for claiming the stone or solving the yoyo is dramatized—success feels preordained. The ending assertion that he is “forever changed” is unsupported by any visible loss or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure gives a Charged Poise: the lighthouse now glows and the keeper carries “latent radiance,” a legible before/after under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality, however, is soft—finding the yoyo is accident, not choice, and the stone’s activation reads like magic without price. Orientation is secure within 120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone flares, but the cost is only asserted, not felt.</comment>

<comment>Salt-tide, dust-shelf, flickering candlelight—sensory hits are selective and POV-filtered. The lighthouse’s cramped spiral and hidden compartment constrain movement and discovery. “Counter-clockwise” mechanic never surfaces as tactile detail, a missed opportunity. Final golden wash is an atmospheric payoff that re-images the bleak opening, earning its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“unlock latent radiance”—is clear early. Pressure is purely cognitive: solve yoyo = get glow; no external antagonist or time squeeze. One micro-turn when stone first flares, but escalation plateaus; the puzzle-solving scene is summary, not narrowing. Cost is promised but not displayed; glow arrives as gift, not trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of forbidden knowledge vs. transformative risk is present but stated (“step beyond fate’s design”) rather than dramatized. Hunger stone / yoyo duality never accrues shifting meaning; symbols stay decorative. Final image of glowing lighthouse offers quiet repricing, yet moral ambiguity is absent—story side-steps whether radiance is blessing or curse. Insight feels pre-packaged, not earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person attaches cleanly to the clock-maker’s perceptual quirks—he clocks gears, carvings, dust. Syntax stays measured, slightly antique, suiting an artisan. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Filter verbs ("he felt", "he knew") intrude in peak beats, dulling immediacy; compression under pressure is only moderate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Paragraph rhythm breathes—short bursts for descent, longer roll for glow reveal. Metaphors (“wind whipping hair into a frenzy”) are familiar but serviceable; no mixed vehicular crashes. Recurrent “neatly inventive mind” becomes template cadence; synonym churn around “mysterious” and “ancient” weakens diction. No scaffold obscures causality; clarity holds to final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing clock-work logic with folkloric hunger-stone is fresh; yoyo-as-cipher less so, yet treated as gear-puzzle fits maker mindset. Concept risks gimmick but commits—no winking nod to strangeness. Specificity of counter-clockwise trade is under-used, limiting full transformation. Still, combination feels idiosyncratic, not checklist.</comment>
