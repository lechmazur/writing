<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The recluse’s interior contradiction—astonishment at ruin yet tranquil perception—remains vivid and embodied, driving the micro-choice to open the box. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The final renunciation (closing the box, absorbing the words) is earned by the prior beats of reading and tears; the cost is the visible weight that now “radiates” from them. Voice remains coherent and specific, though the astonishment trait is more declared than dramatized in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box closes, ghosts disperse, and the recluse carries the unspoken words inward—an undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of ghost-gathering and letter-reading intensifies until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 5 and hold. No因果 turns are required under this lens; the single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stained glass box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its glow and grime charge the moment of opening/closing. Sensory selection stays tight: ash-heavy air, flickering light, the faint hum. Spatial choreography is clean; the box sits on a pedestal, is approached, opened, closed, and its inner light re-enters the final image. Environment mirrors interior decay without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens once: the box opens, letters release, ghosts press close, options narrow to “read or retreat.” The protagonist’s agency is the act of reading that forecloses retreat; the cost is the sorrow that now permanently inhabits them. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from hush to hum to dispersal constitutes meaningful intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the spectacle of remembrance: the living become archive for the dead. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of the glowing closed box reweights the premise—memory is portable prison and lamp. Subtext lives in gesture (trembling hand, mute reading) rather than declaration. Emotional aftereffect is melancholic awe rather than sentimental comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to the recluse’s perceptual filter: selective attention to subtle changes, red-rimmed eyes, finger tracing patterns. Syntax grows breathless under pressure—clause-stacking mirrors emotional layering. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are N/A. Voice texture is consistent, with controlled elevation that avoids register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence that mirrors the beat of ghost approach/dispersal. Figurative language is selective (“haunting echo,” “otherworldly glow”) and never clusters to stall momentum. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks detected. Opening and closing lines are sharp, the latter recharging the box’s glow as beacon—clean echo of earlier image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-apocalyptic beekeeping oasis haunted by visible ghosts—is fresh synthesis of eco-collapse + spiritual archive. Risk lies in the quiet lyric accrual rather than overt plot reversals, and it pays off in the charged final image. Specificity of the honeycomb fragments and beekeepers’ letters prevents generic “after-the-end” feel. The transformation test passes: swapping elements would break the resonance.</comment>
