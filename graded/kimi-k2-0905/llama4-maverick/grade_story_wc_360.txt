<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Echo’s obsession with “the mathematics of emotion” is compelling, but the borrowing-personalities trait is asserted, not dramatized: we watch Echo “slip into skins” in summary, never see a beat where a borrowed mask forces a wrong micro-choice or costs credibility. No interior contradiction within the workshop scene; obsession remains monolithic. Closure image is evocative (the whisper), yet the cost of vanishing stars is external, not tied to Echo’s body, wallet, or relationships—felt price is off-stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Single-scene causality holds: Halo fragment → press → disorienting print, each beat legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—stars gone, reality rewritten, “true work beginning.” Cost is cosmic, not personal; lacking a visible/private price keeps it from 8-band. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Workshop is sketched via smell of metal type and “soft glow of luminescent orbs”—tactile and biased to Echo’s lens. Micro-setting rules: the press itself constrains gesture and tension; fragment nestles in a specific slot, not generic. Final image of vanished stars reweights earlier sky-glimpses, satisfying 9+ gate. Missing tool-level accuracy on letterpress mechanics, but irrelevant to stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode emotion before stars extinguish—announced early. Escalation is atmospheric (stars blink out) rather than a narrowing of Echo’s options; nothing is forfeited or foreclosed inside the press ritual. No micro-turn where print fails or threatens Echo’s credibility; pressure is observational. Meets 7-band but lacks a paid price that alters tactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: language as empathic technology. Subtext in the disorienting print invites reader vertigo, mirroring theme. No final moral—stars vanish, Echo smiles, meaning re-priced. Ambiguity is purposeful, but earlier “mathematics” metaphor flirts with pseudo-profundity and is restated, not tested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rich rhythmic control: long breathless sentences mimic press motion, then staccato “stars began to vanish, one by one.” Diction stays within artisan lexicon—“musty scent of old metal type,” no corporate register. Perceptual signature strong: Echo notices “deliberate ambiguity” as a tactile shimmer. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; single-POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence layers sensory, conceptual, or kinetic data. Some metaphor overlap—“swirling vortex,” “kaleidoscope,” “living thing” in one paragraph—creates minor purple swell but does not cloud closure. No loops or synonym churn. Opening line anchors stake; final line crystallizes image. Minor tightening could delete one “energy” instance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: antique letterpress + cosmic Halo shard + empathic mathematics—specific, not patchwork. Risk of vanishing stars as literal countdown is bold, paid off by conceptual repricing. “Transposed empathy” remains an abstraction, but its mechanical link to ink/print feels novel. Not a retread of familiar cyber-mystic tropes.</comment>
