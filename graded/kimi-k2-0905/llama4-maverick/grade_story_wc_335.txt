<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s sorrow-laden gaze and backwards-walking tic are vivid, but the interiority stays atmospheric (“seemed to hold a world of sorrow”) rather than concrete. The mentoring motive is declared, never tested by a moment of interpersonal friction or failure, so the promised “quiet guidance” remains abstract. No visible cost or contradiction surfaces in their micro-choices; tension relaxes into lyric observation rather than character-driven stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the archivist’s “quiet triumph” reweights the shard-mirror and library hush, satisfying the CR test under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality, however, is loose—“the leaves… seemed to hold the key” substitutes seeming for agency, and the reversal of exile is asserted, not dramatized. TheOrientation Test is met by line 4, but the beat structure is repetitive (successive “As…” clauses) rather than because/therefore linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dust motes, creaking shelves, and the swinging playground seat outside create a layered auditory/visual web that mirrors the internal hush; the empty swing becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (archivist notices faint tea tang, old-book scent) and stays integral to mood. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object drift. Lacks a 9+ gate because no environmental detail literally constrains the final annotation choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“guide the exiled soul back”—is declared early but remains ethereal; nothing in the library physically resists or worsens if the annotation fails, so pressure feels atmospheric rather than tactical. Escalation is textural: repeated “as the hush deepened” intensifies mood, not risk. No visible price or option foreclosure is attached to the annotation act itself, so the tightening needed for 8+ bands is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of quiet restoration emerges through the accumulating images of dust, silence, and the mirror-shard rather than explicit sermon. Final image of the forgotten library feeling “a little less forgotten” offers a resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext would sharpen if the archivist’s own fear of irreversibility were quietly hinted, giving the rescue thematic mirror; currently the personal stake is one-note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory cadence that matches library atmosphere; syntax favors trailing participles and layered clauses that mimic slow, careful movement. Perceptual signature is stable—archivist’s attention gravitates to light, dust, glass, tea—without POV leakage. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent if occasionally over-rich (“heady mixture that seemed to transport”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is musical but leans on “seemed” hedges four times, softening authority. Metaphors are coherent (tea leaves as “tiny, twisted creatures”) yet crowd successive sentences, dampening urgency. No scaffold loops or synonym churn, but density drops during the three-sentence “As…” chain in the climax, slightly dulling the closure image. Otherwise grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusing soul-exile with tea-leaf geometry feels fresh; the shard-mirror library is an inventive micro-cosmos. Yet the narrative arc—scholar decodes mystical object, tension dissolves into hopeful stasis—echoes familiar “quiet occult restoration” templates. Risk is stylistic (lyric density) rather than structural; specificity of smell, creak, and glass redeems the concept from pure trope.</comment>
