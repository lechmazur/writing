<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority drifts into lyrical self-summary (“featherly determined,” “sense of kinship”) without embodied contradiction under pressure; the father’s absence until the closing beat keeps relationship crucible off-page, so change lands as greeting-card recognition rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is present—father’s beckoning reconfigures the child’s “lost” stance—but the necessary-distance rule is asserted, not dramatized: no on-page beat shows distance actually narrowing or foreclosing a live option; causality is thematic echo, not because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prism terrace supplies shifting light and spatial disorientation that constrain movement; however, sensory catalog repeats (“shattered light danced,” “colors bleeding”) without new environmental leverage in the final third, so the setting never charges the actual reunion beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—decode thresholds—stays abstract; no concrete test or forfeiture is staged; the logbook points the way but never risks loss or miscue, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens; reunion arrives as soft confirmation, not narrowed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “necessary distances” recurs but remains declarative; the closing smile restates rather than re-weights the premise; no image or gesture reframes what distance now costs, so resonance is gentle rather than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a consistent dream-toned diction; repetition of “drifting,” “fractured,” “prismatic” creates incantatory rhythm that suits child-wonder; occasional template cadence (“I felt… I felt…”) dulls differentiation but does not break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Metaphors stack in almost every sentence (“drifting prism terrace,” “watercolors on wet paper,” “featherly determined”) producing lyric density that fits mood yet edges overwritten; no mixed vehicles harm clarity, but the final beat is delivered through haze rather than precise image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Maze-architect father + weather-code logbook gives fresh vocational texture to familiar father-reunion arc; however, the core journey remains a symbolic walk toward parental affirmation, so ingenuity is incremental rather than transformative.</comment>
