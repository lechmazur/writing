<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Claustrophobia is named, never embodied; no tight-space panic or contradictory urge to squeeze deeper. “Stand by the unremembered” stays abstract—no micro-choice shows her weighing their lives against her own. Interiority drifts into summary: “She felt a deep connection” tells us the emotion rather than letting coral-scraped knuckles or failing torch battery speak. The phase-return choice is causally soft: she steps into a torrent and is “pulled through,” no visible cost or flaw-compounded error.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she surfaces clutching the codex, bearing the cables’ roar inside her—cost is legible. Causal chain wobbles: gold-fleck lock is announced, then the fleck is “in the margins,” so the door should never have opened for her; the beat is elided. Orientation clean by 120 words; spatial logic holds. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through tidal cadence and humming cables; one meaningful tightening suffices and is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Seafloor facility, anemones, coral, tidal flow—vivid, selective, filtered by Lyra’s caving eye for constricted spaces. “Crashing hush” sonic motif returns to charge the final image. Gold fleck and logbook act as micro-settings that gate progress. No object or body state reconfigures the final beat, so 9-band gate not cleared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: retrieve codex before tide turns—signaled early, tightens when pressure shift is heard. One visible cost: she must enter phase transition with no guarantee of return—price is felt in body-warping roar. Escalation is tidal and acoustic, not decisional; she never confronts a live trade-off (e.g., leave codex to survive). Consequently, tension plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance vs. erasure emerges through coral-shrouded lab and “unremembered” researchers, but remains implicit. Subtext resides in crashing hush—sound as memory. No late articulation of thesis, avoiding echo penalty. Ambiguity is present yet thin; counter-reading not sharply seeded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Lyra; no head-hop. Diction stays within caving perceptual lexicon: “tight, cramped corridors,” “flickering light.” Rhythm modulates—short clauses under pressure, longer reflective lines in logbook room. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture; it does, but cadence edges toward template repetition (“As she…”) in two openings.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Clean grammar, vivid nouns (anemones, codex), no scaffold loops. Mixed metaphor risk: “monolith… covered in anemones” (stone vs. living tissue) but image holds. One paraphrase loop: “secrets of the undersea cables that crisscrossed the ocean floor” restates in next sentence. Clarity never impedes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of claustrophobic spelunker with undersea phase-travel cables is fresh; not routine cave or sea tale. “Crashing hush” as technical + poetic sonic device is memorable inflection. Transformation test: story collapses without caving mindset + cable phase mechanics. Risk is moderate—lyric elliptical exit rather than set-piece—but coherence holds, so no bonus added.</comment>
