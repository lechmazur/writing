<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied—she “felt an inexplicable connection to the fragile, porcelain surface”—but her contradictory impulse (to seek lost time while sitting passively) is stated, not dramatized. Only one micro-choice (unfastening the book) carries visible cost; the rest is reverie. The crack-as-self metaphor is vivid, yet the character’s perplexity never actively obstructs or enables a beat; it remains label-quality. No relationship crucible or status shift on the page; head-count is one, so those bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of vanishing into “cloudbound memories” reweights the premise that lost time accrues between memories. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mist, crack, hand-tracings—held cleanly to the end. Orientation is taught early (“midnight glade above the clouds” by line 2) and waives any penalty. Cost is felt but conceptual rather than visceral; the book-unfastening is the only physical act, so the tightening is mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The glade above clouds is atmospherically specific—ozone, damp earth, moonlight on mist—and the dolls’ saucer functions as micro-setting that constrains her symbolic reading. Spatial anchoring is stable: cross-legged blanket, cards before her, book beside. Sensory selection stays urgent—scent of ozone, tactile crack, visual flicker of cards—mirroring internal fracture without overt symbolism. Environment does not alter tactics, so 9-band gate not met; cap 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where lost time accumulates”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no ticking clock or tangible loss sharpens it. Pressure accumulates texturally via recurring images (mist, crack, tracings) rather than narrowing options; no reversal or trade-off is forced. Agency is contemplative; the only cost is emotional acceptance, paid off-page. Escalation stays lyric; lacks visible price that alters later tactics, capping entry to 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: time’s fractures are lived through the cracked saucer and fading hand-prints, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image of “cloudbound memories” offers a non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext operates in silence—she never names her child yet maternal loss permeates. Ambiguity is purposeful; complexity is honored without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively lyric: “onyx-ink cartomancer,” “choking beauty,” rhythmic repetition of “cloudbound.” Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices symbols, scents, textures before action. No dialogue, so naturalism bullets waived. Psychic distance modulates from wide (“the cartomancer”) to intimate internalization without head-hop. Tense stable; no filter-verb clutter; syntax mirrors meditative stall then ethereal fade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“ethereal glow,” “choking beauty,” “trail of cloudbound memories”—yet avoids purple overload by staying short. One paraphrase loop: “lost time accumulates… moments that slipped away” in adjacent sentences (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; ozone/earth/crack imagery coheres. Read-aloud rhythm varies; final sentence lengthens for cadence release. Artifacts stay minor and clear of closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: cartomancy plus maternal grief above clouds is uncommon; crack-as-time-fracture feels inevitable in hindsight. Hand-tracing custom particularizes universal nostalgia. Risk is lyric stasis, but coherence justifies it. Core could transplant to new setting with different artifacts, so freshness is moderate, not singular.</comment>
