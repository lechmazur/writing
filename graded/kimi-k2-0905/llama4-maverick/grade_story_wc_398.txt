<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sentinel’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains observational; no micro-choice under pressure alters her course. The burned fragment never becomes a prop that forces a visible trade-off, so the arc stays static. She “realizes” and “feels,” yet the page does not show a decision or renunciation that costs her anything. The result is a luminous sensibility rather than a tested character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the sentinel’s new “task” is declared, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mismatches intensifies—but the final tightening is summary. No persistent constraint or price is locked to her future action. Causality holds, yet the ending beat is too abstract to reach high-band resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the vineyard’s topography and microclimates are sketched through the sentinel’s noticing, not catalogued. The amber pavilion and rustling leaves mirror internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial anchors are clear; weather and season affect mood, not tactical choice. The setting enriches atmosphere but never constrains a decision, keeping it just below the 9-line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stake—“to nurture intersubjective understanding”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete test or reversal narrows her options. Pressure is ambient, not escalating; the vineyard’s mismatches are observed, not interacted with. The single “tightening” is a realization without external cost. Under Accumulative lens, density increases, yet the lack of a visible price caps escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of destined mismatches emerges through imagistic parallels rather than statement, avoiding overt moralizing. The love-letter fragment and uneven grapes reweight each other, creating quiet resonance. Final paragraph’s “truth” is still articulated rather than dramatized, blunting the after-effect. Complexity is honored, but the absence of a costly choice keeps the insight cerebral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—scent of damp earth, golden light through leaves. Syntax modulates with longer cadences that mirror meditative pacing; no head-hopping or register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“intersubjective understanding”) feels slightly academic for the sentinel’s sensibility. Overall, a controlled, atmospheric voice that serves the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense, but repeated abstract nouns (“complexity,” “understanding,” “mismatches”) create synonym loops that dull momentum. No scaffolding or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent. A few filter phrases (“she felt,” “she realized”) could be trimmed for immediacy. Line-level craft is solid, yet the lyric surplus in the final third prevents a higher band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vineyard-as-human-heart is familiar, but the treatment through viticultural microclimates gives it fresh specificity. The burned love-letter edge is a sharp, particular object that reframes the theme. Risk is modest—quiet meditation rather than structural innovation—so no bonus applies. The synthesis feels inevitable yet not startling, landing in the upper-middle band.</comment>
