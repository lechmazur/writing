<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dweller’s gentle compulsion to “become visible” is consistent, but interiority stays generic; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The memory flash is vivid yet passive—no micro-choice alters present tactics. Closure is a soft glow rather than a renunciation with felt cost, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each cached object layers a quiet bid for recognition. The final “whispered promise” supplies Charged Poise, but the cost (remaining forever unseen) is asserted, not shown on the page. Orientation is clear by word 80; no causal break, yet the stakes never tighten—options don’t narrow, they simply accumulate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Library at dawn is atmospherically rich—dust, generator hum, sapphire hush—filtered through the dweller’s tactile routine. The tape fragment serves as micro-setting that triggers memory, but it never constrains a later choice; environment stays backdrop. Strong sensory hierarchy keeps the score high, capped at 8.8 for lack of final constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“be seen”—is signaled early, yet pressure is static: no beat forces the dweller to risk exposure or abandon the cache. The outage flicker is decorative; it neither complicates nor deepens tactics. Closure reiterates the same desire, so escalation is decorative, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of quiet guardianship emerges through recurring cache images, but subtext stays one-note. The tape reel’s return reweights nothing; memory theme remains ornamental. No moral is imposed, yet the insight never deepens beyond “kindness in shadows,” keeping resonance modest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains hushed, methodical cadence that matches the dweller. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent—grime, clink, scent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sapphire hush”) edges toward poetic overlay but stays legible under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is smooth, rhythmic, largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the dweller’s smile deepened… the dweller’s hands moved”) repeats. Figurative language is restrained and coherent. High information density in object cataloguing; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Invisible caretaker in urban infrastructure is familiar, yet the library crawl-space angle and ferromagnetic tape relic give fresh texture. Risk is modest—no structural experiment—but specificity of scent-memory elevates the piece above stock “hidden guardian” tales.</comment>
