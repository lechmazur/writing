<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s grief for the reefs is palpable, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“eternal flux,” “drifting moored”) that tells us the emotion rather than embodying it. The drum-tapping ritual is a vivid micro-choice, yet it never forces a real trade-off or risk; the station’s data could have been lost or her reef time forfeited, but nothing is staked. The final “she is part of the ocean’s story” epiphany is declared, not dramatized through a costly action or renunciation. Character is individuated and consistent, but the arc lacks a visible price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tapping + data sift builds to a conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maya accepts that some maps must stay missing—yet the cost is only asserted (“mystery still lingered”), not made legible on her body, choices, or future options. Orientation is clean within 120 words; causality is loose but coherent under the lyric mode. One meaningful tightening occurs when the torn page reframes all prior data, satisfying the single-scene default.</comment>

<comment>The station, drum-skin, and yellowed atlas are tactile, lived-in objects that constrain action: she can’t map without the page, can’t think without the drum. Sensory selection skews visual, but the salt-tang and beep-rhythm anchor the body in place. Spatial choreography is steady; no impossible moves. The reef is kept off-stage, which is economical, yet the micro-setting of desk, logbooks, and drumskin suffices to charge the final image of the missing coastline.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why do paths vanish?”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only as accumulating detail, not through a narrowing choice or forfeited option; the drum never jeopardizes her data, the missing page never forces her to discard a hypothesis. The final acceptance is a stance crystallization, but the price (she will keep listening yet never know) is stated, not felt. Sufficient for a lyric short, but the beat stops short of a visible cost that alters her next dive or survey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: human craving for fixed maps versus oceanic impermanence. Subtext resides in the torn page—an absence she must work with, not solve. Final image of rhythm fading into starlit silence reweights earlier data-crunching without moralizing. The insight is earned, but the lack of a tangible forfeiture keeps the resonance muted rather than piercing.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Maya; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is strong—she hears in beats, sees in coastline contours, thinks through logbook columns. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “tapping” and “rhythm” that teaches the pattern early. Register remains within her scientific-lyric idiom; no corporate drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinctiveness rests on interior diction, which is consistent if occasionally lofty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent (“fish swimming just beneath the surface” fits her world). Occasional elevated phrasing (“her spirit soar”) edges toward generic uplift, but it occupies a single line and does not obscure causality. Paragraphing breathes with emotional cadence; opening and closing lines are sharply anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Post-fossil-ban reef recovery and a sea-level station are fresh coordinates for the familiar “lost map” trope. The drum-tapping as method of listening to data is an inventive sensory hinge. Yet the core arc—lonely observer learns to accept uncertainty—remains recognizable; the piece does not risk a wild formal or moral swerve. Specificity of coral-health columns versus drum-rhythms lifts it above template, but it stops short of a transformative reconfiguration.</comment>
