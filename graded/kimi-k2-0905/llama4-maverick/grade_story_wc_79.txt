<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s “quietly driven” trait is asserted repeatedly but never instantiated in a concrete, costly micro-choice; she drifts through discovery without contradiction or visible trade-off. Interiority relies on stock labels (“sense of dread,” “weight of the unknown”) rather than embodied, idiosyncratic perception. The reed whistle and map function as props, yet neither forces a decision that reveals hierarchy of values; passivity dominates until the final step, which is undifferentiated from the story’s first impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Lyra steps beyond the city, watchers silent, cost felt in foreboding image. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural; the crack-pattern deciphering is the only causal linkage, and its payoff (map + note) arrives without prior pattern-teaching, so the tightening feels accidental rather than earned. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. Causality remains thin: the expedition’s fate is told via decoded note, not dramatized choice, so the decisive change is mostly atmospheric.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Turtle-metropolis is vividly sketched—sun-bleached shell streets, spiral scars, spatial hierarchy of age—and filters through Lyra’s cartographer gaze. Setting guides movement (she walks toward older, more worn shells) and mirrors internal unease without overt symbolism. The “reed whistle” and “pattern language” act as micro-settings that charge the final image; environment constrains access to hidden compartments. No world-rule inconsistency; idiom remains consistent and sensory selection is POV-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover why the expedition vanished—signals early and tightens once when the shell cracks open, revealing map/note. Agency is thin: the act of deciphering is passive, and the crack happens to her; she neither risks nor forfeits anything on-page. Cost is atmospheric, not concrete; escalation relies on imagery (watchers loom larger) rather than narrowing options. The final step beyond the city freezes options in dread, satisfying the situational lens, but the price remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of intrusion vs. silence emerges through the watchers’ mute gaze and Lyra’s defiant whistle, but the argument stays implicit. Recurring “sunwashed dread” reweights the turtle-city from wonder to menace, yet the note’s exposition weakens thematic density by stating the expedition’s doom rather than dramatizing it. No overt moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Thematic resonance is more atmospheric than philosophically provocative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres tightly to Lyra; perceptual signature is cartographer-pattern-centric, with rhythmic, list-like cadence that mirrors shell-mapping. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no head-hopping. Filter verbs appear (“she felt,” “she realized”) but are sparse and voice-motivated. Reed-whistle motif returns in final breath, crystallizing defiance. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on interior texture, which is consistent but leans on template phrases (“weight of the unknown” twice).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; openings avoid mechanical repetition. Information density is moderate—some sentences do double duty, others glide on atmospheric filler (“the city still held secrets”). Metaphors are coherent but familiar (“sun beat down,” “shiver run down her spine”). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Minor scaffold: “she walked” repeats three times in close succession; paraphrase loops absent. Closing image is crisp, propulsive, and artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Turtle-borne city plus pattern-language cartography offers a fresh synthesis; the lost-expedition hook is standard but re-framed through shell-cartography and mute watchers. Risk is moderate—silent antagonists, lyric dread—but execution leans on atmosphere over surprising turns. Specificity of spiral-shell streets and reed-whistle signal gives the world a memorable tilt. The piece avoids overt genre clichés yet does not push premise into unsettling new implications; freshness is more setting-deep than plot-deep.</comment>
