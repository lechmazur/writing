<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The guardian’s interiority is only gestured at (“expression unreadable” twice), so motivation remains an abstract phrase (“teach darkness the value of stars”) rather than a dramatized stake. No micro-choice shows why the mirror or the pattern matters to them; they merely watch. The figure is a prop-delivery device, not a second source of pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Endurance without visible cost or contradiction earns only partial credit for Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal linkage is weak: the figure arrives because the scene needs the box, not because guardian action summons or permits it. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the shutter-shadow and mirror-glow reweight the moment—but the cost is only atmospheric, not personal. Orientation is clear by word 60, yet the missing “why this night” anchor keeps the guardian’s presence feel arbitrary. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: pattern and weather thicken mood until the final image crystallizes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cobalt dock, wet planks, ozone, and shutter lattice are sharply sensed and filtered through a single gaze. Micro-setting (mirror surface, lattice shadow) directly charges the final image, meeting the 9- gate test. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no continuity errors. Weather affects light and reflection, but not bodily risk or access—hence not quite indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Stakes are atmospheric (“will the pattern reach the guardian?”) rather than personal; no option is foreclosed for either character. Agency is one-way: figure acts, guardian receives; no reciprocal pressure. Escalation is purely density-of-image; no cost or tactic shifts. Closure is mood-crystallization, not consequence, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the value of light within darkness, shown through mirror-gleam and star-motif rather than stated. Subtext is carried in gesture and lattice-shadow, not sermon. The mirror’s reprise reweights earlier imagery, giving conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers, but the insight is slightly abstract due to the guardian’s opaque interiority.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—every detail is wet-reflection or lattice-etched. Syntax is rhythmic, clause-varied, and mirrors the weaving motion. No head-hopping; POV stays tethered to guardian gaze. Voice modulates from rain-muffled hush to shimmer-glow without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative density is high but patterned (mirror = moon, lattice = constellation) so the lyric mode is earned. A few near-repetitions (“stillwater tension” twice, “unreadable expression” twice) create minor loops. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. Final image is sharp, but the preceding paragraph drifts into incremental rephrasing of calm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The shutter-ritual and mirror-as-moon feel fresh; they fuse craft and cosmos without slipping into trope. Conceptual risk—plotless mood arc—pays off in resonance but limits stakes. Specificity of cobalt dock and lattice mechanics prevents generic anywhere-setting. Still, the guardian-as-teacher premise remains abstract, curbing full originality.</comment>
