<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “methodically curious” label is shown—she pores over silent footage—but no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure appears; the interior is competent, not crucible-forced. The ending’s peaceful stasis feels bestowed by setting rather than paid for by a visible, costly renunciation. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship bullets are N/A. The characterization is solid but not taut enough for 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal lens: the henge comparison yields new knowledge (“subtle patterns”) that changes Elara’s stance, satisfying the closure requirement. Orientation is clean by word 60. However, escalation is flat—no tightening beat narrows options or raises price; revelation arrives as observation, not friction. Cost is conceptual (she now “carries the whispers”) but not dramatized on-page; hence ceiling 6.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault, mold scent, and stone wear are vivid, selective, and filtered through cartographer priorities. The henge and map-tear spot function as micro-setting that guides her attention and frames the closure image. No object or body-part constrains a final choice, so 9-band gate fails. High but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“uncover the henge’s secrets”—is declared early. Pressure is situational but static: rain and silence evoke mood yet never complicate tactics or force a trade-off. The “re-opening” is accomplished by passive watching; no credible loss or narrowing of options occurs. Escalation is atmospheric, not consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme—listening to silence, cartography of the unknown—emerges through recurrent images of whispers and torn maps. Subtext is mild: silence as empathy rather than absence. Final image of “map now whole” offers quiet CR, but insight is soft (“world full of secrets”) rather than re-weighted rule. No platitudes, yet no fresh moral friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“methodically curious,” attuned to stone wear and light shifts. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. Rhythm is steady, slightly repetitive (“rain continued to fall… rain continued to fall”) but matches meditative mode. Distinctive without being daring; competent control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, readable, with occasional elegant compression. Minor loop: “rain continued to fall” echoed; “she felt” filter stacks 3× in 200-word span. No metaphor clutter or register drift. Information density is moderate—some summary of footage work that could be dramatized. Final third is clear, so 9+ not disallowed, but not earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fusion of cartographer + archaeo-acoustic mystery is fresh angle on henge lore. However, the “silent video comparison” method is asserted, not explored; risk is announced, not taken. Whispers-as-silence motif is quiet rather than reconfiguring. Specific detail (map tear spot) lifts it above generic, but execution stays safe; no bold structural or tonal gamble.</comment>
