<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper’s urge “to harvest insights from failure” is stated but never dramatized through a concrete failure or micro-choice; interiority drifts into lyric self-summary (“crushing doubts”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The flute-playing beat is atmospheric, not a decision that costs her anything, so the change is felt as mood, not earned character turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the silent flute glowing reweights prior material and the cost is the canyon hush she now carries inside. Causality is accumulative/textural; the pattern of “sound → vision → stillness” tightens once and lands cleanly, but the driftwood markers appear only at the end, so the payoff is partly unearned. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no penalties.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sagebrush scent, thunder rumble, and glinting flute metal are selective and POV-filtered; the canyon’s hush becomes a tactile constraint that finally presses on her body. The driftwood markers’ late arrival weakens spatial choreography, but the environment still charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“harvest insight from failure”—stays abstract; pressure escalates atmospherically (music makes air vibrate) rather than through a narrowed choice or visible price. No live option is foreclosed; the tension is aesthetic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of learning through failure is announced repeatedly but emerges most cleanly in the final charged poise where silence replaces music; the refusal to keep playing is the unspoken admission that insight is endless, not achieved. Subtext is mostly atmospheric; no concrete prior failure is repriced, so insight feels conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence and perceptual signature—sound obsessed, canyon-bound, slightly archaic. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors (“avalanchingly quiet”) are bold but patterned and paid off. No dialogue to test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors breath of flute phrases; occasional stacked modifiers (“avalanchingly quiet”) risk purple but stay legible. One scaffold loop—“the silence… avalanchingly quiet” repeats concept not content—dulls without obscuring closure. Otherwise dense, clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fusing relic-curator solitude with shamanic world-crossing via a reed flute is fresh, but the “bridging worlds” trope remains metaphorical rather than given new rules. The driftwood compass arrives too late to feel invented rather than convenient. Risk is moderate; payoff is atmospheric, not conceptual.</comment>
