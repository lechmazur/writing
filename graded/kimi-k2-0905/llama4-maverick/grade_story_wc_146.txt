<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tuner is a watchful silhouette, never granted interior contradiction or embodied emotion; “infinitely patient” is asserted, not dramatized. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values, so the final “resumption of work” carries no felt cost. The piece is voice-driven, not character-driven; that can work, but here the absence of any visible flaw or struggle keeps the figure ornamental rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise—the town’s “wild hush” vibrates with new possibility—so the Accumulative/Textural lens holds. However, the cost is purely atmospheric; nothing on the page shows the tuner expending stamina, forfeiting time, or risking failure. Because no constraint or price is legible, the reconfiguration feels gifted rather than earned, capping the story below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: decay-scent, twilight gradient, cobblestone vibration underfoot. The ebony fork and archway recur as micro-settings that physically channel sound, so environment constrains method. While the town never becomes more than a mood-board, the tight focalization keeps description purposeful and propulsive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stake—“restore shared balance”—is announced early but remains abstract; no concrete obstacle or opposing force ever endangers it. Escalation is a slow volume-knob turn: the rhythm “grew stronger, more insistent.” That single intensification is too smooth to tighten options or raise visible price, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: sound as resurrection of communal memory. The final image of a “town reborn” reweights the initial silence without moralizing. Yet because the tuner’s internal arc is blank, the thematic cost is external only—felt by the town, not the person—limiting resonance to the atmospheric register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays stable, with a hushed, processional rhythm that mirrors the subject. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated (“velvet expanse,” “conceptual repricing”) yet remains within the tuner’s contemplative register. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; the voice is the story’s chief engine.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, propelling the slow procession; figurative language is restrained and coherent. Occasional loftiness (“fabric of reality was being reshaped”) flirts with abstraction but never loops or contradicts itself. A few near-repetitive stems (“the tuner continued their work… the tuner resumed their work”) dull momentum slightly, keeping the prose just shy of immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “revive a ghost town with footsteps and a tuning fork” conceit is fresh, and the story commits fully to its sonic logic. Risk is atmospheric, not plot-based, but the consistency of the metaphorical system gives the piece a singular identity. It’s more mood-essay than drama, so ingenuity caps at the high-mid band.</comment>
