<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elian’s obsession with the promise is declared repeatedly but never dramatized as a live dilemma; the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“volcanic tenderness”) rather than concrete, contradictory impulse. No micro-choice under pressure shows the arsonist’s specific risk calculus inside the archive. The climactic “touch” of the tapestry feels symbolic, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each artwork adds density until a pattern re-weights the promise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the trail crystallizes meaning and the tapestry smile re-anchors the vow—so RR is valid. Cost is conceptual (the archive now “speaks” through Elian’s art) but not viscerally felt; the final image is resonant yet lacks a concrete price extracted from Elian on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Parchment scent, fluorescent eeriness, and the tapestry’s “subtle smile” are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain perception and echo in the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; the archive’s corridors guide slow discovery without tourist excess. The environmental cues mirror internal stakes (dust = forgetting; smile = promise) and evolve as Elian’s trail alters the space, satisfying the 9+ gate for charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving the promise—signals early, but pressure escalates only texturally: each new artwork adds semantic weight rather than narrowing practical options. No credible loss (time, material, capture risk) is dramatized; the only “cost” is symbolic workload. The deepening is aesthetic, not tactical, so escalation feels gentle rather than urgent; still, the pattern break at the hidden alcove suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art as time-resistant memory. The tapestry smile and vandalized portrait refract love/loss without moralizing. Final scrawl re-prices the promise, inviting reflection on desecration as devotion. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the insight edges close to platitude (“enduring power of art”); a sharper ethical knot would lift score higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; diction (“labyrinthine corridors,” “volcanic tenderness”) is elevated yet tethered to Elian’s reverence. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during discovery, supporting cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on perceptual signature—aged parchment, enigmatic smile—which is memorable if slightly perfumed. No head-hopping or register drift; compression is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace; paragraph lengths vary to create visual swell. Some abstract intensifiers (“heavy with emotion,” “canopy of light”) flirt with overwriting but stay within voice. No synonym loops or template cadence; information density is high. Final line lands cleanly, recharging “stars” and “shadows” without scaffolding. Minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to whisper”) keep it from 8+ zone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Arsonist-as-curator inverts expectations; using fire-based charcoal to resurrect rather than destroy feels fresh. Trail-of-art clue device is rare in flash-length fiction and organically grows from archive setting. Tapestry smile reprise avoids gimmick by accruing meaning rather than announcing symbolism. Risk-taking is present but modest; premise would still function if Elian were merely a reclusive artist, so inversion isn’t absolute.</comment>
