<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Eira’s “jittery” trait is announced but never embodied in action or interiority; the pendant does the calming for her, so her flaw never complicates choice. The moment with the aurora-woman is beautifully atmospheric yet passive—no decision, risk, or refusal is asked of her, so no cost is legible. Interior contradiction and micro-choices are absent; the character is more lens than agent, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece lands a lyric Charged Poise closure: the pendant’s final hum reweights the earlier encounters as communal germination, a resonant reconfiguration under the Accumulative lens. Causality is loose—beats accrete mood rather than tighten options—yet the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last image, satisfying the accumulative contract. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity; cost is felt as wistful afterglow rather than concrete forfeiture, keeping the score just short of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ridgeway and aurora are rendered with selective, rhythmic detail—“threads of memory and myth”—that charges the final image; the pendant functions as micro-setting whose vibrating state alters social access. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Eira notices what serves her courier eye. Spatial choreography is airy but coherent; no credibility breaks. Environment does not constrain physical tactics yet reconfigures social possibility, meeting the 9+ gate for charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early—“retrieve relics, coax wonder”—but remain abstract; no concrete relic or deadline appears, so pressure stays atmospheric. The only tightening is the pendant’s stronger hum before the woman appears; this is a mood spike, not an option-narrowing beat. Escalation is lyrical accumulation, not causal rise; cost is oblique wonder rather than forfeiture, capping the band in the low-6 region.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: wonder as communal germination, not artifact possession. The pendant’s shift from personal soothe to social bridge reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—the locals’ creasing smiles—rather than statement. The final image lingers, inviting reflection on routine magic, though the insight is gentle rather than electrically fresh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice maintains steady lyric distance; perceptual signature is consistent—“eyes drinking in colour,” “jittery relic courier”—with synesthetic tilt. Syntax is varied, rhythm breath-matched to walking pace; no filter-verb bloat. Diction stays within plausible courier-poet lexicon; no head-hopping. Voice modulates slightly under aurora awe, then settles, earning high-band placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, with vivid noun-verb pairs—“unwound before her,” “ghostly presence.” Occasional elevated phrase—“germinate a sense of connection”—leans ornamental but recurs intentionally. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences; final line lands with echoic punch. Minor density in lyrical repeats prevents the 9-band but remains well above functional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The “relic courier on aurora road” is fresh furniture, yet the plot arc is a quiet walk, greet, walk—low risk. The vibrating pendant as social catalyst offers a specific inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight. Myth-memory fade is familiar cosmic fantasy turf, but the communal germination angle supplies a modest new twist. Execution is competent yet safe; no bold structural gamble elevates it further.</comment>
