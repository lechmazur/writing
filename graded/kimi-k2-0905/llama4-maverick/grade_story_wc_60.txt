<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria’s “luminous skeptic” and “realistically imaginative” labels sit atop repeated interior summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the only embodied choice—lifting the box lid—arrives without visible cost or micro-struggle. The vow to become “guardian” is declared, not tested, so the required Earned Stasis reads as unearned promise. Interiority drifts into atmospheric cliché (“her heart swelled”) instead of idiosyncratic perception under pressure. Voice remains consistent, but the arc is observation-heavy; no flaw complicates the final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breadcrumb-image layers density until the box-opening serves as Conceptual Repricing that reweights the city’s memory-rule. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the geese shard pattern is taught early and repaid when fountains restart. Causality is loose—memory-release mechanically revives fountains—but the lyrical contract accepts metaphoric linkage, so the closure image carries conceptual cost. No persistent price shapes Aria’s future, nudging the score down from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“City of forgotten fountains” moves from postcard phrase to active micro-setting: dust, dry basins, then flowing water constrain Aria’s pace and supply the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (rustle, creak, gurgle) over visual catalog, matching her listening method. Spatial choreography stays clean through alley–courtyard–door sequence; the black-stone pedestal localises climax. The setting’s state-change directly charges the Conceptual Repricing, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single stake—liberate memories—lacks external opposition; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is textural: shards → carvings → box intensify mood but never narrow Aria’s options or threaten loss. No visible price is paid; the city’s revival feels gift-like, not earned sacrifice. Hence the tightening is present only as cadence shift, not consequential trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Theme of remembrance-as-revival emerges through imagistic accumulation rather than statement; no moral is distilled. The fountain motif shifts from elegiac absence to resurgence, reweighting the premise without sermon. Ambiguity remains—whose memories?—inviting reader reflection. Subtext resides in silence and shimmer, satisfying the 9+ call for resonance without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature leans on auditory detail and sidereal slowness, fitting the patience concept. Syntax repeats “her footsteps quiet / her eyes scanning” template cadence, dulling rhythm. Diction stays within Aria’s plausible lexicon; no head-hop occurs. Voice is distinctive enough for high-band but not yet irreplaceably textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Prose is clean, with only minor scaffold: “with every step… with sidereal patience… with the stained glass box” triple opener late in text. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density is moderate—some atmospheric padding could be cut. Closure sentence avoids artifact, allowing 7+ score.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>7.8</question><comment>“Memory-trapped city revived through found art-object” risks trope, but the shift from grand fountains to intimate glass shards personalises scale. Geese icon acquires specific migratory urgency, avoiding generic bird symbol. Conceptual Repricing of memory-as-water feels locally fresh. Execution is competent rather than daring; transformation test passes, but risk-taking is modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</question><grade>Late micro-choice to open box alters city state, but trait “luminous skeptic” is label-only; no contradiction dramatized. Observing geese pause starts setup, yet skepticism never complicates belief in breadcrumbs. Trait recurs descriptively, not causally. Without cost tied to luminous skepticism, score caps below 6.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Box appears early as rumor, mid as glimmer of shards, late as pedestal object whose opening reweights city memory. Colors refract closure light, linking to fountain waters. Removing it collapses the Conceptual Repricing beat. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>“Sidereal patience” shapes Aria’s slow listening method; the phrase recurs and justifies her refusal to rush. It enables the breadcrumb strategy. Closing fountains’ gradual restart mirrors stellar tempo, linking patience to civic revival. Concept is causal, not ornamental.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</question><grade>“Realistically imaginative” is claimed twice but never enables a specific tactic or obstacle; imaginative leap to connect geese-flight carving is understated and swappable. No cost flows from the trait. Early signal present, development weak.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>Action “unstick the cobwebs of forgotten lore” is metaphorical; literalized through brushing dust off shards and pushing door. It reopens access to memory chamber, enabling climax. Without this dust-clearing, doorway stays sealed. Metaphoric but structurally functional across two beats.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Breadcrumb method is introduced early, taught via auditory clues, and guides entire alley-to-chamber progression. Mechanics matter: each shard is a tangible breadcrumb. Final shard cluster signals box location. Removing the sequence breaks navigation logic.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Setting shift from dry to flowing fountains directly enables the closing image and reweights the memory premise. Micro-setting of hidden chamber provides the only access route. City geography is tracked cleanly; fountain state is causal, not backdrop. All three gates met.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</question><grade>“Pause of migrating geese” seeds temporal cue and syncs with Aria’s sidereal patience; fountains restart in slow echo of migratory return. Time never tightens a deadline but frames cyclical revival. Mid development present; payoff in final image.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Motive “liberate trapped memories” drives every forward beat; absorption sequence dramatizes partial fulfillment. No conflicting want challenges it, so friction is low, but declared stakes materialize on page. Cost is civic, not personal, capping score at 7.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>“Defiant hush” sets quiet-footed tone, modulates to triumphant cry metaphor at fountains’ restart. Silence functions as shield against doubt, aligning with stealth search. Tone coherence links first to last paragraph, charging final image. Modulation is present but not pivotal to tactics.</question>
