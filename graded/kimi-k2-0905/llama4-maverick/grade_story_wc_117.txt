<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is present but leans on “ordinary magic” clichés; the curl stays ornamental, never traded or risked, so the closure lacks embodied cost. Eli’s wonder is observed, not filtered through micro-choices that could force Aria to renounce or pay anything. The result feels therapeutic rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single causal lens holds: eclipse → shared gaze → song → wonder seeded. Closure is a soft Charged Poise—the guitar lingers, curl safe—but no visible price is extracted from Aria, so the Resonant Reconfiguration feels under-costed. Causality is linear, no reversals, no tightened options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is atmospherically rich—sage scent, cicadas, cooling air—yet it never constrains movement or tactics; the guitar and curl do more micro-setting work. Spatial anchors are clear early; sensory layering supports mood without stall. Environment stays backdrop rather than pressure tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: awaken Eli’s lifelong wonder. Pressure is gentle atmospheric accumulation, not escalation—no trade-off, no option foreclosed. Eclipse functions as coincidental backdrop rather than tightening force; Aria never risks failure or loss. Stakes remain abstract, cost unrendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges through repeated phrases rather than dramatized cost; final sentence affirms it aloud, blunting subtext. The curl’s return in last paragraph attempts reweighting but lacks new insight. Resonance is pleasant yet thesis-bound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is warm, tactile, music-therapist mellow: “softly adaptive,” “hush of dreaming roots.” Syntax stays lullaby-cadenced; no head-hop. Occasional tour-guide lifts (“the world seemed to melt away”) flirt with stock phrasing, but overall texture remains consistent and ear-pleasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, low-scaffold; occasional adjective strings (“warm, golden light”) are earned by mood. No loops or mixed metaphors; information density modest—some sentences do only one job. Closure image clean; no artifacts touch final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Music-therapy-eclipse linkage feels fresh, yet “ordinary magic” as thesis is now familiar. Risk level is safe; no structural gamble. Specificity of scent and sound keeps it from generic, but transformation limited—template could swap healer/artist with minor edits.</comment>
