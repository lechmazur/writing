<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” tag is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in a costly micro-choice; the renegotiation beat is summarized, not dramatized, so we never see contradictory impulses collide under pressure. Interiority defaults to abstract labels (“thrill of excitement,” “new sense of purpose”) rather than specific, embodied perception. The time traveler remains a polite cipher—no red-rimmed eyes, no distinct idiom—so relationship-as-crucible never ignites. Closure gives Elara a generic epiphany rather than a renunciation or stance crystallization that costs her anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft thematic uplift (“she had found a new path”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the library door simply opens and the diary is pocketed without price. Causal chain is outline-level: “by researching gaps” is declared, never shown narrowing options or raising stakes. The Orientation Test is waived because the labyrinthine store is deliberately disorienting, but the lens stays blurry—mid-text shifts between causal quest and accumulative texture without teaching the pattern—so a −0.3 lens ambiguity penalty applies. Teleporting props (diary appears exactly where needed) and off-stage pursuit keep tension abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mountain-sized bookstore is a delicious conceit, but spatial choreography is hand-waved: shelves “twist in impossible geometries” yet never constrain movement or force a specific tactical choice. Sensory detail is vivid but generically gothic (“musty depths,” “scent of old parchment”) rather than filtered through Elara’s linguist bias; no cataloguer’s micro-notice of script, paper weight, or binding type. The “unheard symphony” motif is introduced late and never anchors to an object or body that could charge the final image. Environment stays backdrop; it never turns into an obstacle that exacts a visible cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the library—is declared early but never tightened; the shadowy pursuers exert no on-page pressure beyond being mentioned. No credible loss (time, safety, social credit) alters tactics; the diary is found exactly where convenient. The single “renegotiation” is summarized in one sentence, so no narrowing of options or felt price surfaces. Escalation is flat; coincidence (hidden door revealed by simply pushing a shelf) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Theme of “knowledge must be applied” is stated outright in the final paragraph, triggering a −0.6 Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is undercut by the same paragraph’s moralizing summary. The library’s “unlearned lessons” never acquire concrete symbolism that reweights meaning at closure; the concept stays abstract. Emotional aftereffect is therefore muted, leaning on platitude rather than image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays stable inside Elara, but diction drifts into editorial uplift (“the weight of unlearned lessons slowly lifting”) that feels authorial, not linguist-specific. No perceptual signature—no etymological aside, no script-based metaphor—marks her professional gaze. Time traveler’s dialogue is indistinct from narration; both speak in the same polished, slightly archaic cadence. Rhythm is smooth but generic; no syntactic tension mirrors the supposed labyrinthine pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Scaffold loops repeat (“labyrinthine bookstore,” “unheard symphony” echoed verbatim) and paraphrase clusters (“she realized that she had finally found… she realized that the journey had changed her”) dull momentum. Mixed metaphors (“the air seemed to vibrate with an unheard symphony”) blur physical logic. Filter verbs stack (“she felt,” “she knew”) during the climax, softening immediacy. Artifacts remain mid-level because they do not obscure the already-soft closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Library of unlearned lessons inside a mountain-sized bookstore is a fresh conceptual mash-up, and the botanical diary as MacGuffin adds quirky botano-temporal spice. Yet the shadowy pursuers are faceless genre furniture, and the time-travel frame defaults to standard “retrieve the artifact” beats without twisting the logic. Specificity emerges in glimpses (impossible geometries, extinct species diary) but stays under-exploited. Risk is present but hedged: the piece opts for uplifting closure rather than letting the labyrinth exact an irreversible price.</comment>
