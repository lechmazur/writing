<comment>The mapper’s only “choice” is to raise her hands at the viaduct—an unmotivated ritual that carries no visible cost or contradiction. Interiority stays generic (“surge of determination,” “sense of purpose”) and never degrades under pressure; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values. The promised flaw—impatience—is asserted, never dramatized; the final stance feels identical to the opening one, so no path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>No meaningful change or cost lands on the page: the viaduct hums, the moon sets, and the mapper walks back—identical to her arrival. The causal chain is purely associative (moon → viaduct glow → revolution declared) without any tightening of options or knowledge. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the texture never reweights the stake; the ending image repeats the opening atmosphere without reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>Basalt walls, frozen lake, and humming viaduct are vividly sensed and filtered through the mapper’s cold-attuned attention. Spatial anchors are clear early, but the environment never constrains a tactical choice; the viaduct could be any shiny bridge and the lake any frozen plain. Micro-setting fails the 9+ gate: no tool, body, or recurring object alters the final move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“patient revolution”—is declared repeatedly yet never tested; no visible price is paid, no option is narrowed. Pressure remains static: the viaduct hums louder, the moon sets, but the mapper’s tactics do not change. Escalation is purely atmospheric; coincidence (lunar climax coincides with viaduct glow) substitutes for agency-driven reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges only through repeated labels—“unyoke,” “patient revolution,” “sculpt patience”—rather than particularized action. The final paragraph moralizes the thesis instead of letting an image reweight it. Subtext is absent; the viaduct’s humming never accrues ironic or ambiguous resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>The third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual tilt—cold, lunar, metallic—but syntax is serviceable rather than rhythmic under pressure. No patterned elision or compression is taught; the prose stays conventionally transparent. Voice is coherent yet generic; it could swap into any contemplative futurist piece without loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is steady, but sentence openings default to “The mapper / She / As” stems that dull propulsion. Figurative language is sparse and clean, yet information density is low: repeated snow/ice/moon descriptors pad without new pressure. No scaffolding loops obstruct clarity, but no line-level sparkle either.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade>
<comment>Moon-gazing revolutionary oracle beside a singing bridge is familiar sci-fi lyricism; nothing in the mapper’s stance, the viaduct’s rule-set, or the revolution’s mechanism feels particular to this piece. The concept “patient revolution” is announced, not re-invented. Risk is absent; every choice plays to the expected trope cadence.</comment>
