<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Deep interiority anchors the painter’s insomnia and hope; the “methodically hopeful face” is shown, not told. Contradictory impulses—yearning to revive lost languages while fearing the city’s cruelty—co-exist in scene, powering the final creative act. Micro-choices (picking up the brush, dancing it across canvas) crystallize values and cost. Yet the motivation “to prove strangers remember kindness” is stated more than tested; no on-page stranger interaction complicates or jeopardizes her stance, so the flaw feels safe rather than compound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlit greenhouse → memory flood → canvas creation; each beat layers density rather than causal reversal. Closure lands in Charged Poise: dawn finds the canvas pulsing, city smog returning, painter smiling with “weight of her task” felt. The cost is conceptual—she must keep returning, the work never done—but the lack of an external obstacle or jeopardy keeps the tightening gentle. Orientation is clear by line 40; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse under waxing moon is kinesthetic: glass panes, smog that “swallows stars,” saffron quiet. Micro-setting qualifies—the moon-tipped brush and canvas literally constrain her next move. Sensory triage matches urgency: night air narrows to bristle-on-canvas sound at climax. Spatial choreography holds; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resurrect lost languages through paint; signaled early. Pressure deepens via accumulative layering—each memory adds weight—but no external force threatens failure, so options never visibly narrow. Cost is interior (endless nights, perpetual return) yet stays conceptual; no tangible forfeiture on page. Escalation is present but diffuse; meets default, falls short of 8.0 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: beauty as stubborn civil resistance against urban cruelty. Subtext resides in silence—absent stars, unheard tongues—rather than exposition. Final smile reframes earlier “saffron quiet” as communal promise, not solitude. Avoids overt moral; could reward more specific contradiction to push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains painterly perceptual signature: color, light, texture. Syntax elongates during reverie, contracts at brush-stroke climax. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within painter’s plausible lexicon; “methodically hopeful” is the single near-label, quickly embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence detected. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—moon as lantern, smog as star-thief—taught early and paid off at dawn. One paraphrase loop: “the city’s din and pollution seemed to recede” echoed twice; minor. No mixed metaphors; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fusion of insomnia, calligraphy brush, and lost-languages-through-paint feels fresh, not checklist. Moonlit greenhouse atop smog city supplies specific cultural frisson. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but execution coherent. Could push boundary further by letting urban hostility breach the greenhouse physically.</comment>
