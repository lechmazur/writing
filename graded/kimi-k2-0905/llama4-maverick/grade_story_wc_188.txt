<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is tactile—chanting while walking, registering flame motion through designer eyes—but she never faces a hard choice; the “gravity of hopelessness” is declared, not dramatized. The mosaic note triggers a smile, not a visible cost or relinquished option, so the arc is observation, not transformation. Competence is lovingly shown, yet no contradictory impulse forces a mistake or trade-off; the ending remains a generalized uplift rather than a charged renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: dusk → lantern-glow → starless hush layers mood until the final “canvas” reweights stakes. Orientation is swift; location and POV stay consistent. Closure is Charged Poise—her imagination “ablaze” with possibility—but the cost (time, materials, risk) is only implied, not tethered to an on-page constraint, so resonance is soft. No causal tightening forecloses an option; the uplift is atmospheric, not decisional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory filtration is excellent—orange fade, kerosene tang, chant rhythm, lantern gleam—each detail filtered through Lyra’s pyrotechnic gaze. The fortress garden is sketched with impressionist economy; spatial ground remains steady. The kerosene rag knot re-appears in memory at the end, but it does not physically constrain tactics or charge the final image, capping short of 9-band utility. Still, the environment directly feeds her creative lens, never dragging momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defy creative despair—is signaled early; pressure accumulates via sensory density rather than external opposition. No reversal or forfeited option occurs; the mosaic note offers confirmation, not complication. Escalation is atmospheric deepening (dusk→night), not option-narrowing; cost remains conceptual, not visible. Sufficient for short lyric mode but below the tightening required for 8+ bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: stillness as tinder for creative ignition. The motif pair—chant & silence—reverses value: chants start as filler, end as confident score; silence moves from threat to blanket. No moral is stated; meaning is left hovering in the final spark-trail image. Avoids thematic echo, but the insight is familiar; resonance is gentle rather than electrically reconfiguring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lyra’s perceptual signature—fire-color calculus, ambient vibration, chant cadence. Syntax flexes from languid garden sentences to tighter image-clusters as night falls, mirroring creative surge. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested; filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and rhythm-motivated. Distinction is consistent, if not startlingly idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence length varies, paragraphing breathes with dusk progression. Occasional Latinate loft (“serendipitous discovery”) nudges above POV’s likely diction, and a few soft loops (“glow” thrice in 30 lines) slightly dull texture. No metaphor collisions or scaffolding chains; information density is high. Line-level slips are minor but frequent enough to block 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing fireworks craft with ambient-sound design is fresh; the kerosene rag knot as aesthetic seed feels specific. Otherwise the “wandering artist revived by hidden message” arc is standard uplift template; no worldly rule or moral gamble is upended. Execution is graceful, but concept is recognizable. Risk level is modest; originality lies in sensory filtration, not narrative re-invention.</comment>
