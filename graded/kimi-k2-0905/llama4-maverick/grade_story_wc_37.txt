<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Memory-keeper’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. She “feels drawn,” “hums,” “continues” without stakes-based decision or visible flaw. Final resolve is restated, not earned by a costly on-page act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is a restatement of hope, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulative lens chosen: images repeat but never tighten options or reweight meaning. Orientation clear, yet no causal or pattern turn charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse and mica window supply lush sensory detail and refracted light that mirrors mood. However, no environmental feature ever constrains her choices or alters tactics; setting decorates rather than pressures. Final image still benefits from charged specificity of the pulsing window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle a dying realm”—stated early but never tested by obstacle or trade-off. No escalation: plants bloom automatically as she hums; no price, narrowing option, or reversal appears. Conflict remains decorative, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal memory versus entropy emerges through repeated “woven dawns” and song imagery, yet subtext stays surface-level. No ironic gap or re-pricing at close; final paragraph spells out hope explicitly. Resonance is pleasant but not reconfiguring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and musical cadence; diction stays within fairy-tale register. No head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm occasionally slips into template (“the memory keeper… the memory keeper…”) but remains readable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and vivid, but sentences often duplicate action (“she felt… she knew… she smiled”) creating mild paraphrase loops. Figurative language is steady; no mixed metaphors, yet density never modulates for pressure. Clean mechanics and proofreading.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mirror-world memory orchard is atmospherically fresh, but plot arc is generic restorative quest without twist or conceptual re-pricing. “Forgotten songs revive plants” is lovely yet under-exploited; no new rule or cost is revealed. Risk level moderate; execution pleasant but not singular.</comment>
