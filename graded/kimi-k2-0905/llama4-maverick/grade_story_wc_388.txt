<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s “sharply observant” trait and truth-drive are asserted repeatedly but never put to a decisive test; she follows paper scraps without error or cost, so the promised flaw-and-struggle arc never materializes. Interiority stays generic (“mind racing,” “heart pounding”) rather than concrete and contradictory. The final awe is declared, not dramatized through body or choice. No relationship or secondary pressure is on-page, so the crucible is purely environmental and therefore thinner.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is linear but intact: shredded letters → stillpoint location → arrival. Closure lands as Charged Poise (the pulsing glow reconfigures Aria’s world-view) with visible cost implied by the ominous watch-feeling. However, the orientation anchor is late (~150 words) and the liquidation’s engineered cover-up is told in summary rather than seeded early, breaking tight causality. The stillpoint rules are introduced only at the end, so the payoff feels conveniently revealed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is sketched with vivid, selective strokes: radioactive dust storms, twisted rows, sickly-yellow sunset. Micro-setting (Aria’s scanning gaze, paper under boots) keeps description woven through action. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment does not yet constrain tactics or tool use, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the atmosphere is cohesive and tonally supportive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—find the diamond/stillpoint—is signaled early and pursued steadily, but pressure stays flat: no ticking clock, antagonist, or resource drain. Escalation is purely accumulative (more paper pieces) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The “being watched” beat is introduced at the 90% mark but not activated, so cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Therefore the 8.8+ gate is unreachable despite the quest frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth vs. comfortable lies—emerges through Aria’s quest rather than authorial statement. The orchard-as-wasteland subtly mirrors the post-truth landscape. No tidy moral is imposed; the ending image leaves ambiguity. Yet the theme never deepens or contradicts itself; it merely iterates, preventing higher resonance.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Aria’s skeptical register. Rhythm is serviceable but cadence repeats (“As she…”) without purposeful variation. Perceptual signature is present but generic—inventory of sights rather than idiosyncratic filter—so voice is competent, not singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and mostly concise; no loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional scaffold stems (“As she walked…”) and adverbial openers dull momentum. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve adequately. No artifact touches the final beat, but density is only moderate; many sentences do one job.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—post-apocalyptic orchard, cursed diamond, thin-reality spot—are refreshed by the conspiracy-debunker protagonist and the paper-trail method. Specific wasteland-botany details (radioactive dust, thriving trees) add novelty. Still, the plot trajectory is predictable and the liquidation conspiracy is abstract, so ingenuity is solid, not startling.</comment>
