<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“velveteen gloom,” “tender touch”) but remains filtered through lyrical summary rather than contradictory impulse in scene; no moment of irreversible choice is dramatized with visible cost, so the arc stays observational. The gardener’s obsession is stated repeatedly, yet the single micro-action—unthreading tapestry—is too gentle to register as stakes-bearing. Motivation is coherent but never pressure-tested; we are told the quest “consumed every waking moment” instead of watching it erode a concrete alternative. Earned stasis is hinted at in the final return to the silo, yet the cost is poetic rather than embodied, keeping characterization just below the 6-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the gardener exits under starlight newly attuned to “the thrum of uncharted echoes,” reweighting the world with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is linear and coherent—sovereign case → tapestry decode → crystal hum → attunement—but escalation is gentle, not tightening; each beat adds texture rather than narrows option. The chess-clock expiry is a memorable image yet functions only as atmospheric time-passage, not a constraint that forces tactic change. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the deepening satisfies, but the absence of a palpable trade-off keeps it short of the 7.3+ zone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Cobalt silo, starlight through slat gaps, lavender sachets, antique dust—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through caretaker habitus. Spatial choreography is clean: gardener moves from cemetery → silo door → interior shelf → tapestry → night exit; no impossible props. Micro-settings (sovereign case, chess clock) double as tactile objects that charge the finale. The cemetery itself stays off-stage after line 1, but the silo succeeds as compressed cosmos, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate by constraining every action inside its echo-chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the shape of intentions”—is signaled early and deepened through pattern recognition rather than external opposition. Pressure is steady-textural: each untangled thread adds knowledge but never threatens loss or moral trade-off; stakes remain intellectual. The crystal’s hum is the sole moment of tangible escalation, yet it complicates nothing, merely confirms success. Because no live option is foreclosed, the tightening required for 8.0+ bands is absent; still, the accumulative charge is legible and coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: caretaking of the dead parallels caretaking of memory-threads and echo-intentions, culminating in the realization that the living world is equally threaded with unfinished purposes. No moral is stated; resonance is carried by the final image of the gardener walking among headstones now “alive with the thrum.” The tapestry language and crystal hum reframed as “language” supply subtle cohesion without symbolic over-tidiness. Ambiguity is preserved: we cannot decipher the echoes either, maintaining thematic complexity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric-third-person voice sustains a hushed, ecclesiastical cadence that mirrors meticulous caretaking; syntax lengthens during untangling, then shortens at exit, mirroring breath. Diction stays within gardener register—flowers, stones, threads, dust—never drifts into academic abstraction. Patterned repetition of “echoes,” “threads,” “tenderness” feels purposeful rather than algorithmic, teaching the reader a mantra. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature remains coherent and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, scaffold-free, high-density; no filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay internally consistent (stars as map, darkness as blanket) and do not crowd high-pressure beats. Minor overwrought phrases—“uncharted echoes,” “velveteen gloom”—tip toward preciousness but remain limited; they do not touch closure. Overall read-aloud rhythm is confident, with purposeful paragraph cuts that advance image or knowledge every two to three sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cemetery caretaking with antique-codebreaking offers fresh angle on “listening to the dead.” Crystal-as-echo-amplifier and tapestry-as-message are familiar tropes, yet their combination is grounded in gardener’s tactile vocation. Risk is taken in eschewing external conflict for textural accumulation; coherence justifies the choice. Not transformative enough for 8.5+ band, but specificity of lavender sachets, cobalt silo, and run-down chess clock prevents generic drift.</comment>
