<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Curator’s interiority stays generic—“brightened disquiet” is repeated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the philosophical breakthrough is declared, not earned through visible micro-choices. The decision to follow the Order is passive acceptance, not a costly stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (knowledge = nonlinear web) but cost is only asserted, not felt. Causal chain is loose: pistachio shell has no causal role, bathroom epiphany lacks trigger. Orientation is clear early; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural pattern of scent/image density.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Astral orchard is vividly sketched with stardust blossoms and incense-thick bathroom; sensory selection mirrors curator’s widening perception. Yet setting never constrains action—asteroid gravity, resources, or danger are absent, so environment is decorative, not tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stake—“pursue forbidden knowledge”—is declared but never tested; no tangible price or foreclosed option appears. Pressure plateaus: humming grows louder but curator simply walks forward without resistance or trade-off. Escalation is atmospheric, not consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear knowledge emerges via imagery rather than sermon, but remains abstract because the curator’s life situation never changes. Subtext is thin: Order’s motives, pistachio shell, and bathroom choice stay opaque, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains consistent lyric distance; diction (“astral orchard,” “nonlinear inheritance”) stays within curator’s scholarly lexicon. Rhythm is steady, but syntactic variety is limited—many “The curator…” openings flatten musicality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, no loops or mixed metaphors; however, figurative language is uniform across low- and high-pressure beats, dulling impact. Information density is moderate—some sentences do double duty, others glide on adjectives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Combining pistachio shell, astral orchard, and bathroom epiphany is fresh; the juxtaposition creates surreal intrigue. Yet the Order and nonlinear concept feel grafted from existing esoteric templates rather than transformed by unique world logic.</comment>
