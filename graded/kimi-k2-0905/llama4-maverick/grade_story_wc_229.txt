<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is lyrically rendered but static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, only asserted. The “purifying” power of the cork is declared, never tested in a moment that costs him anything. The climax is pure receptive ecstasy, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path; hence no earned change or stasis. Emotions are vividly named but not embodied in conflicting action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: imagery and scent layers intensify to a Charged Poise at dawn. Orientation is immediate; the garden-lighthouse continuum anchors by word 30. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—Elian’s worldview is altered—but the cost is only asserted (“indelible mark”) rather than dramatized; hence the cap. No meaningful tightening mid-text; the piece drifts on perfume rather than because/therefore linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory selection is disciplined: scent drives every beat, filtered through Elian’s night-garden devotion. The lighthouse and garden interleave as micro-setting, guiding his steps and metaphors; cobalt light at dawn recharges the opening image. Weather shift (post-heat-wave) is felt as cool skin and altered earth aroma, not weather-report exposition. Spatial choreography is clean: stairs, workbench, pocket, waves track without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is announced but never tested against external resistance; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure is atmospheric (sweetness, longing) rather than tactical; no visible price is paid or lost. The single “beckon” gesture is ceremonial, not a turn that narrows choices. Escalation is perfume density, not stake-driven causality; hence mid-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as an accumulative perfume: quiet persistence outlasts noise. The vial cork’s unseen residue becomes a metaphor for intangible influence, reweighted in the final image. No moral is stated; the tender scream is felt as sensory overload. While the insight is lightly earned, the piece avoids platitude and leaves plausible ambiguity about whether anything truly travelled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect lyricism stays tightly anchored in Elian’s perceptual filter: synaesthetic scent metaphors, maritime lexis, gardener’s diction. Rhythm swells and subsides like surf, mirroring the breathing of night-blooming flowers. No dialogue to distort voice; narration never over-reaches into omniscient exposition. Compression is purposeful; elision of mundane logistics keeps the trance intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is lush but loops: “gentle whisper,” “gentle, insistent voice,” “screaming tenderness” recycle stems within 200 words. Metaphors sometimes layer (light dancing vs. whisper) without clash, but density approaches purple in climax. No scaffolding or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or scent. Still, the ornamental cadence slows propulsion enough to cap high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The conceit—intent purified by a cork’s residue—feels fresh, yet the execution leans on familiar lighthouse-garden mystic tropes. Scent as carrier wave is a specific inflection that keeps it from cliché. The “whisper > shout” thesis is not new, but grounding it in night-blooming jasmine gives local specificity. Risk is moderate; transformation is present but not startling.</comment>
