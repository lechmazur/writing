<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The librarian’s “sanely eccentric” tag is repeated but never tested under pressure; she performs no consequential micro-choice that costs her anything. Her interiority drifts into generic awe (“sense of wonder and awe”) instead of contradictory impulses acted out in scene. The tattered scarf glows, yet she never reacts to it in a way that reveals fresh character data. Thus the arc feels like a static mood portrait rather than an earned renunciation or change.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric “Charged Poise”: stories begin to hum and she smiles, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulated texture (repetitive cadence of “as she…” clauses) teaches an incantatory pattern, but the lens is over-reliant on lyrical summary; no concrete beat shows causal linkage between mapping geometry and the awakening. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early and hold, but the midpoint remains suspended in reflective loops that flatten pressure. The ending satisfies the lyric CR test yet would be stronger with one visible micro-cost (e.g., scarf dims, page tears, she staggers).</question>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library is evoked with compact sensory triangulation—glow of lamps, scent of sandalwood, faint tang—filtered through the librarian’s selective attention to resonance rather than cataloguing. Hyperbolic geometry remains abstract (no diagram, compass, or tactile tool) so the environment never physically constrains her body or choice. Spatial choreography is minimal: she “moves with deliberate slowness,” patrons remain a blurred backdrop; bodies never collide or jostle shelves, keeping the stage safe but low-pressure. Closing image of scarf shimmer re-uses the object as micro-setting cue, earning partial charge-gate for 9+.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken dormant analog memories—is declared early but never tested by opposition; nothing fights back, no resource dwindles, no live option is foreclosed. Escalation is entirely lyric accumulation: whispers “grow louder,” scarf “shimmers,” hum “resonates,” yet these are intensifiers without causal reversals or tactical trade-offs. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the single cadence shift suffices, but the absence of visible price keeps the tension intellectual rather than visceral. High-band entry requires a concrete forfeiture (time running out, scarf unravelling, a patron interference) that never arrives.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: memory/story as living entity that must be tended, not consumed. Subtext resides in the librarian’s secrecy—she works “not to assist” patrons—and in the gradual personification of the library itself (shadows, whispers, breathing). No character articulates a thesis; the final smile lets the reader infer the worth of invisible labor. Ambiguity is meaningful: we sense stories are awake yet remain unseen, avoiding moralizing.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains steady psychic distance and perceptual signature: numbers, equations, resonance metaphors feel native to a science-poet librarian. Syntax favors participle openers and anaphoric “as she…” chains that create incantatory rhythm; occasional scaffold loops (“the librarian… the librarian…”) are mild. No dialogue means no voice convergence issues. Register stays within her plausible diction; even “hyperbolic geometry” feels like her natural shorthand, not authorial showing-off.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Paragraph rhythm breathes with white space, but sentence openings repeat “As she…/The librarian…” enough to create template cadence. Figurative layering (“branches of an ancient, gnarled tree”) is restrained, yet mixed metaphors sneak in—scarf glows, then “shimmers as if alive” without clarifying whether light or fabric animates. Information density is moderate: many sentences do only one job (description or summary) rather than double duty. No typos or grammar slips, but the over-reliance on gerundive openers flattens propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a librarian who tends “analog memories” via non-Euclidean geometry offers a memorable conceptual hook not seen in stock submissions. The science-poetry library itself is a specific, idiosyncratic arena. Risk is modest—lyric accumulation instead of causal plot—but the piece commits fully to its quiet spell rather than forcing a twist. Transformation test passes: swap setting or vocation and the emotional arc collapses, proving the idea is integrated, not bolted on.</comment>
