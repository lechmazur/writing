<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The pianist’s interiority is lyrically voiced, but her motives remain abstract: “surprise fate” is declared, not dramatized. She makes only one micro-choice—entering the film—and the cost is poetic rather than felt. The compasses flicker, yet never force a visible tactical decision; the arc drifts rather than turns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ambiguous Drive Lens (lyric-accumulative) is taught early and held; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the clock as perpetual refuge. Orientation anchors arrive late (~140 words) but serve the final image, so the Orientation Test is waived. The cost is conceptual (eternal return to frozen time), not visceral, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Tidal arbor above the clouds” is atmospherically vivid and sustained; mist, ozone, wet stone narrow perception effectively. The setting never physically constrains her choices—she could leave at any moment—so it remains decorative, not tactical. Closure is charged by the clock, not the arbor, blocking the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is escape from sorrow into filmic stasis; pressure deepens only once when she steps through the reel. No option is foreclosed: the horizon “invites” night but never threatens arrival. Cost is aesthetic, not practical—she gains eternal melancholy refuge without losing anything on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of art-as-refuge emerges through image recursion (clock, film, compasses) rather than statement. The final re-configuration—she embraces frozen time—re-weights the motif set without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the emotional after-effect is muted because the cost is conceptual, not lived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, rhythmic, and POV-modest; compasses “like fireflies” shows selective perception. Repetitive anaphora (“the pianist… the pianist…”) is pattern-taught and pays off in the circular closure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; diction stays within poetic register without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high; mixed metaphors (“vortex of sound,” “tidal arbor”) risk purple overload yet serve lyric mode. Paraphrase loops are absent, but template cadence appears (“the pianist…”) and is justified by circular structure. Closure image is clear, but earlier stacks of adjectival mist slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time clock + cloud-top arbor + hidden-film refuge is an inventive synthesis of familiar motifs. Conceptual risk—stepping into stasis as happy ending—pays off thematically, though emotional stakes stay gentle. Transformation test passes: swap elements and the lyric engine collapses.</comment>
