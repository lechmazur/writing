<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Artist’s “desire to lance the boil of her own emotional numbness” is declared, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. Detective’s epiphany about empathy is interior summary, not embodied under pressure. Relationship remains static—no status shift forced by quarry or mask ribbon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a soft CR: final image of “world…a little brighter” reweights premise, but cost is abstract rather than felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shifts via mist and ribbon reprise, yet no concrete consequence is risked or forfeited on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Quarry mist and dripping water create tactile micro-setting; ribbon fragment reprises as charged object in final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean—single location, bodies track believably. Sensory hierarchy favors visual haze; other senses under-used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—artist’s thawing empathy—is declared late (“sparked something within her”) without early signal. No tightening forecloses an option; pressure remains ambient (“mist swirled”) rather than causal. Detective’s cold-case angst supplies backstory, not present-scene cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-vision emerges through parallel art/investigation metaphors, avoiding overt moralizing. Mask ribbon reweights from curiosity to symbol of dual identity, echoing artist’s “face blind” method. Final paragraph’s “truth…about understanding ourselves” edges toward thesis-statement, blunting subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third lyrical-omniscient voice sustains furrowed-hush cadence; diction stays within “mist,” “swirled,” “hush” palette. Repetition of “mist swirled” creates intentional pattern that pays off in closure image. No dialogue, so voice carries full atmospheric load without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative layering is moderate—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “as the mist swirled around them” appears twice in adjacent beats; not at closure, so −0.3. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Face-blind artist + cold-case detective is fresh pairing; empathy-through-abstraction angle transcends stock “art heals” trope. Quarry-as-atelier and ribbon-as-identity-masque feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is modest—structure defaults to single lyrical scene without formal experimentation.</comment>
