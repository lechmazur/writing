<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sentimentalist’s “gentle, loving touch” goal is stated early and the final image of vanishing into the nebula keeps the renunciation legible, so the arc clears the low-bar closure. Yet we never see a concrete micro-choice that risks or costs anything on-page; interiority floats in cosmic paraphrase rather than contradictory impulse, so the emotional cost is assumed, not felt. The gear is never used, only held, so object-based pressure is absent. Motivation is coherent but not dramatized under pressure; stays mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final “troubling serenity” re-weights the premise that illumination can survive without fire. Causality is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. Orientation is taught in the first sentence (“nebula garden”) so no penalty. No meaningful tightening occurs—stakes remain the same diffuse wonder—so the arc inches rather than turns; keeps it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid, selective, and continuous: “stars bloomed like flowers,” “drift of cosmic dust,” “tendrils of gas and dust” all filter through a poetic perceptual bias. Sensory economy is good—no checklist of senses—and the garden’s scale and softness directly enable the “quiet sigh” metaphor that closes the piece. Spatial choreography is n/a for a lone walker; no credibility strain. Environment does not constrain tactics, so capped below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early but never tested; no obstacle, reversal, or visible price emerges. Pressure is static wonder, not escalating risk; the protagonist simply keeps walking and listening. Because the lens is Accumulative, escalation is judged by density/cadence shift; the final line offers a reprise, not a narrowing of options. No causal agency beyond continuing transit, so mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cosmos favors gentle transmission over destructive flame, re-weighted in the final image. No overt thesis statement; the repetition of “quiet sigh” and “troubling serenity” supplies resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved—reader can still question whether serenity is comforting or stifling. Lacks a sharp ironic edge or counter-reading, so stays shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric-essayistic, with controlled rhythmic cadence and cosmic diction that stays inside the sentimentalist’s plausible awe. No dialogue to test; free indirect style is clean. Perceptual signature is strong—“gentle drift,” “delicate beauty,” “weight of eternity” all color the same mind. Repetitive anaphora (“As they…”) is decorative rather than pressure-driven, preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“stars bloomed like flowers”) and therefore tolerable under lyric mode. A few soft paraphrase loops (“intricate patterns,” “infinite beauty”) recur without new pressure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; punctuation clean. Momentum is leisurely, appropriate to contemplative tone; no scaffold sentences. Closure line is crisp, saving it from artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Cosmic garden + sonar-pinging mystic is a fresh synthesis; avoids stock space-opera tropes. The “troubling serenity” twist reframes wonder as ambivalent, giving conceptual punch. Risk is moderate—slow lyric walk rather than scene drama—but coherence holds. Could swap sentimentalist with another gentle seeker without breaking frame, so not fully irreplaceable; caps below 8.0.</comment>
