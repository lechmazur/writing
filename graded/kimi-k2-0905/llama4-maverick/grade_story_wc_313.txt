<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The warden’s interiority is evocative—camera-clicks, scent of decay, the liqueur label as talisman—but stays observational; no fork-in-the-road moment forces a visible cost or contradiction, so the promised “expunge” action feels conceptual rather than embodied. The precisely-humane trait is announced, never pressure-tested. Still, perceptual detail is character-specific and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each photograph adds mournful density, ending in a Charged Poise (“silence seemed to vibrate with the promise of stories”). Orientation clear by line 4. Yet no decisive tightening or trade-off appears—the trail never finds the “forgotten memory,” so closure is atmospheric, not consequential. Cost is felt but not priced on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reservoir-mud town, creaking sign, child’s toy: selective, tactile, and filtered through warden’s documentary gaze. Sapphire label returns as micro-object that charges the final hush. Spatial logic clean; no geography drift. Meets 9+ gate: label constrains emotional focus and reappears in the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“heal the community via narrative”—stays abstract; no visible stake-holder appears, so pressure is spectral. Escalation is accretive mood, not narrowing options. No beat forces a renunciation or loss; thus no tangible price alters tactics. Emotional cost is suggested, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—storytelling as communal balm—emerges through recurring photo-trail and mirrored hush rather than exposition. Final image reweights the liqueur label from trash to beacon of memory. Ambiguity lingers, avoiding moral. No late thesis statement; slight deduction for “precisely humane” label used twice as prompt-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, patient cadence mirrors twilight hush; diction “morbid perfume,” “mirrored hush” is distinct and sustained. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature strong. Repetition of “precisely humane touch” feels template-like (−0.2). Still, rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally lean, image-rich lines; a few perfume/decay couplings verge on purple but stay pattern-consistent. One scaffold loop: “trail of photographs” + “trail of images” within 30 words (−0.2). No metaphor clash. Final sentence propulsion lands cleanly. Good read-aloud rhythm; minor tightening needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic reservoir town exposed is fresh; photo-trail as healing ritual gives novel civic elegy angle. Conceptual risk—quiet lyric instead of plot—mostly pays off, though memory never surfaces, muting payoff. Avoids tropes of survivor scavenging; stakes stay communal, not heroic. Synthesis feels inevitable if understated.</comment>
