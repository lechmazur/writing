<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is present but generic (“shiver run down her spine,” “hazy precision of her thoughts”); no contradictory impulses shown in scene. Only one micro-choice—starting the survey—yet it alters nothing and carries no visible cost. The investigator’s obsession is declared, never tested; she remains static from entry to exit. No flaw complicates her path; foresight goal is announced, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: she drives away feeling “determination” but no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Wind-pattern survey is set up yet yields no causal consequence; the patch never changes her tactics. Orientation clear by ~80 words, but lens slips between Accumulative (textural repetition) and Situational (static stance); neither lands with cost. No tightening or deepening beat—only iterative noticing—so escalation stays flat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is vividly sensed—rust smell, creaking steel, orange sunset—and filters through investigator’s professional gaze. Spatial choreography clean; wind corridors evolve with container geometry, constraining where she can stand. Micro-setting (patch in gloved hand) stays present but never alters her next move; thus fails 9+ gate. Sunlit exit image is pretty yet doesn’t reconfigure stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand to prevent next crash”—remains abstract; no live consequence if she fails. Pressure is ambient (silence, wind) rather than antagonistic; no trade-off forced, no option narrows. Investigator’s agency limited to looking and noting; survey produces no reversal or cost. Coincidence of finding the exact crash spot substitutes for earned turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—foresight through meticulous observation—emerges implicitly via iterative surveying, avoiding overt statement. Patch as symbol of human cost is hinted but never reweighted at exit; silence motif stays decorative. Final image of receding labyrinth promises persistence of memory yet offers no fresh irony or reconfiguration. Complexity acknowledged (interplay of factors) but moral cost remains off-page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature (“towering labyrinth,” “hazy precision”) is consistent if slightly generic. No head-hopping; tense stable. Rhythm varies with scene pacing—short sentences under wind observation, longer reflective coils. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within investigator’s professional register. Voice modulates subtly between methodical and obsessive, supporting tone.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional scaffold: “the silence of the port city seemed to press in around her” repeats earlier silence image without new charge. Figurative language is spare and coherent—“singular convergence of steel and shadow”—no mixed metaphors. High information density early; middle段 sags into iterative “she noticed / she realized” stems. Closure line crisp, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—accident investigator alone in evacuated port—offers fresh procedural twist on crash narrative. Wind-pattern micro-survey as detective method feels specific and authentic. Container maze as psychic space avoids cliché by tactile navigation rather than metaphoric threat. Yet investigator remains archetype; no irreversible choice or irreplicable detail makes this memory stick. Risk level moderate; execution competent but not bold.</comment>
