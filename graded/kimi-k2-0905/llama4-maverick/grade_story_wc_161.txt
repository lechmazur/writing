<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric—dust-mote meditation, paper-trail shame—but motives remain abstract ("preserve the echo of lost songs" as theme label, not actionable desire). No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the single micro-choice (send last pigeon) changes nothing. Earned cost is gestural: “peace settling over her” tells the renunciation without embodying forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dust/pigeon/book motifs layer toward a lyric RR. Closure = Charged Poise (dust swirl re-balanced) with conceptual cost (her past stays forged), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no prop or choice visibly lost. Orientation clean by word 60; however, the “learning to trust again” timeline is back-loaded summary, not on-page causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Attic as micro-setting is tactile—must, coo, skylight shaft—and constrains ritual (dust mapping). Sensory hierarchy stays tight: bibliophile pigeon-trainer notices paper, glue, bird weight. Final image reuses skylight dust to refract memory, satisfying 9+ gate. Mars chip is only glancing visual, never alters space or choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake = self-forgiveness vs exposure; pressure is ambient (threat never specified). No tightening beat: tension flatlines at “paper trails blurred,” never narrows options or tests secrecy. Agency is contemplative—dust watching—rather than risk-taking; closure re-weights interiorly but no lived cost is paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of reconciled fabrication emerges through dust→memory image, not thesis. Subtext resides in silence about what messages the birds carry, inviting reader extrapolation. Final paragraph flirts with moralizing (“finding a way to live with beauty and pain”) but stops short of overt maxim. Bittersweet tone stays particular to attic ritual, avoiding generic “accept yourself” platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close to Emilia’s synesthetic attention: dust “blooms withers,” pigeons “white as snow.” Rhythm varies—long breath for nostalgia, clipped clauses when banding birds. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature (booksmell = safety) is consistent. Register elevates only once—“conceptual repricing” risk—yet remains within her book-steeped lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is plush but disciplined: each sensory line advances atmosphere or memory pressure. Minor loop: “dust motes swirled / the dust motes danced / dust motes swirling” three close repeats dull cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided; metaphor density fits reflective beat. Opening and closing lines mirror, creating circular ear-ring without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fusing wartime-forgery guilt with homing-pigeon courier is fresh angle on “hidden past” trope. Dust-mote divination as mindfulness ritual is inventive micro-method. However, narrative arc stays interior lyric collage—risk-averse, no external jeopardy—so ingenuity feels stylistic rather than stakes-altering. Could swap meteorite for any keepsake without structural change.</comment>
