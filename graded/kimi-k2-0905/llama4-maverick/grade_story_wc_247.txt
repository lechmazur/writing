<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The advisor’s quietly charismatic magnetism is shown through the crowd’s unforced gathering, but interior contradiction is only implied, not dramatized in scene. The old man’s motivations are sketched via sign-language story, yet the advisor’s own stakes beyond “translate silence into music” stay abstract; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Because the final bonding moment is tender but cost-free, the emotional progression feels complete yet not fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the camera’s empty lens reframes the night’s symphony, reweighting memory vs. forgetting with undeniable conceptual cost—this qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; pattern of “silence→sign→music” is taught early and coheres at the final image. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is atmospherically vivid—“moonlight,” “lapping waves,” “gleaming lens”—but setting never constrains action or tools; it’s decorative rather than tactical. Micro-setting of the camera succeeds: its vacant film chamber becomes the conceptual pivot that charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting. Spatial choreography stays lucid throughout the silent duet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translation of silence into audible memory—is signaled early and deepens through the advisor’s conducting gestures; one meaningful tightening occurs when the crowd’s hush becomes the final instrument, foreclosing private communion. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: public sharing dilutes intimate silence. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; sufficient for lyric mode but lacks visible price on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-music emerges wordlessly through the sign→sound alchemy; no thematic echo sentences moralize. The camera’s empty chamber reconfigures the concept of capture without film, offering a resonant non-literal answer: presence can be performed, not preserved. Ambiguity lingers—joy and sorrow braided—avoiding tidy consolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains consistent poetic distance; perceptual signature is moonlit, auditory, gently omniscient. Rhythm modulates from lapping cadence to crescendo clauses that mimic swelling music, taught by repetition of “whispers,” “silence,” “music.” No dialogue to test naturalism; no head-hopping. Compression (“quietly charismatic”) is purposeful shorthand accepted at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm swells and contracts to mirror musical rise; scaffold is minimal—one paraphrase loop (“luminous harbor by moonlight” vs. “moonlit harbor”) but it serves incantatory effect. Mixed metaphors avoided; “tuning the atmosphere to a different frequency” is single sustained metaphor. Information density high; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—sign-language duet that turns silent stories into public symphony—is fresh synthesis of familiar motifs. Risk lies in lyric abstraction, but payoff justifies gamble: camera-as-empty-vessel repurposes nostalgia trope. Specificity of old man’s wordless biography prevents generic “lonely elders” template. Final image feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
