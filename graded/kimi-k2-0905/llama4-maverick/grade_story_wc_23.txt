<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The navigator’s grief is rendered through embodied ritual (turning the censer foot, moon-tuned perception) rather than label-speak, and her endurance at the plain earns a stoic resilience. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where moon-gifted clarity clashes with doubt—so the “raw solace” feels more declared than dramatized. Micro-choices (answering midnight calls, stepping onto the plain) are present but downstream motive stays abstract: why reverse-migrate now, why trust unknown callers? Competence is asserted without visible struggle or failure, blinding us to flaw and therefore growth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty plain reweights prior fragments and the censer foot becomes a talisman of acceptance, cost felt in the sunrise hush. Causal chain is lyric-elliptical but coherent: because moon → heightened perception → therefore follows calls → therefore reaches plain; ellipsis (who phones, how terrain is “mapped”) is allowed under Accumulative lens. Orientation is complete by word 60; no penalty. Transitions (station → night journey → dawn plain) are legible in two-shard default. A tighter causal bite—one failed map, one aborted route—would sharpen the tightening turn required for 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Starlit signal station” and patina censer foot act as micro-setting: one fixed vantage, one handheld relic that guides palm and memory. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—navigator notices glint on bronze, moonlit topographies—though smell/temperature are missed opportunities. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment alters choice only implicitly (open plain halts forward motion); a sharper constraint—rusted track, airless shaft—would push Q3 to 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“reverse migration through grief’s map”—is signaled early and narrows to the dawn plain where forward motion stops, a credible tightening. Agency is mostly receptive: follow calls, follow moon; a single active cartographic beat (discarding an outdated map, marking soil) would raise pressure. Stakes stay internal; no external jeopardy or resource lost, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Meets 600-word bar but lacks palpable price that alters next action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “navigation of loss is endless mending,” stitched from censer foot, moon rhythms, and call-and-response ritual—no thesis statements, good. Subtext in phone voices (disembodied, possibly self-projected) offers ambiguity, though device stays underexploited. The plain’s void re-configures earlier fragments, inviting reflection on salvage vs. surrender. Could ascend higher if one image cracked the consolation myth—e.g., censer foot cracks, spilling ash—complicating raw solace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature filters setting through celestial and tactile metal motifs. Prose modulates from long, moon-lit sentences to short dawn clauses, mirroring energy shift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Free-indirect texture is steady; diction stays within navigator’s salvage vernacular—“patchwork,” “salvaged parts”—never drifts into academic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Loop-free, high density; most sentences couple observation with interior flick (“canvas of shadows and light…open wound”). Minor overwriting haze in stacked abstract nouns—“raw solace,” “geography of loss”—that verge on slogan. Metaphors are coherent (patchwork self, moon as compass) but slightly familiar; fresher vehicle would sharpen final line. Punctuation, tense, pronouns clean; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic salvage trek is re-stitched via moon-calibrated perception and telephony oracle, a fresh hybrid. Censer foot as emotional compass particularizes grief ritual; not a check-box object. Conceptual risk—quiet ending in empty plain—commits fully, earns stoic stasis. Lacks one striking world detail (e.g., hydraulic ruins that still bleed pressure) that would push to 8.5+.</comment>
