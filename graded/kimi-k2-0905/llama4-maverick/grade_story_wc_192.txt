<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is lyrically consistent and the “tender” trait is embodied through gentle touch and deliberate isolation. The contradiction between caretaking and self-imposed exile is kept alive, but the moment of final change—“they could no longer remain isolated”—is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost, blunting the arc. The micro-choice to revive the flame is present, yet the emotional ledger feels abstract: we are told the heart feels peace, not shown its price. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature (“loaded emptiness”) stays coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the revitalized threshold and glowing ring reweight the keeper’s earlier isolation, making a before/after legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of shadow imagery and cadence shifts rather than causal chains—and the final image crystallizes options with felt cost: the keeper must now re-enter the world. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ashen charcoal sanctuary”) and never slips. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the ring’s state change is tracked throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s ashen charcoal palette is not postcard backdrop; its narrowing corridors and flickering flame literally constrain movement and supply the single tool the keeper can use to recharge the threshold. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the small flame-object governs the final beat. Sensory selection is POV-driven—“starlight” is noticed only when it glints off the ring, reflecting mood. Spatial choreography is clean: keeper descends, reaches heart-chamber, returns to entrance without impossible jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve sanctuary essence—signals early and tightens once: the fading threshold forces the keeper to act. Escalation is textural: each step deeper into shadow increases density of memory fragments and emptiness felt in the body. A visible price is paid: the keeper accepts permanent re-engagement with the world, foreclosing eternal isolation. Cost is legible but not viscerally scaled; we glimpse the trade-off rather than feel its ache.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the paradoxical mandate to “teach suffocating to breathe” through deliberate exile; the sanctuary’s rebirth literalizes the metaphor without final moralizing. Subtext resides in the ring’s shift from grey isolation to glowing invitation. The closing image reweights prior material: the once-skeletal doorknocker now hints at communion rather than death. Complexity is honored—solitude is both cure and wound—and no tidy maxim is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent poetic compression; patterned elision (“years since…”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Diction stays within keeper’s contemplative register—“loaded emptiness,” “dark tentacles”—without register drift. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Perceptual signature is distinct: shadows are felt as physical weight, starlight as accusatory. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for descent, fragmentary bursts at flame-revival, matching breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful; sentence openings vary and avoid template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, memory cue, and emotional charge. Occasional adjective stacks (“ashen charcoal sanctuary”) flirt with purple but serve the incantatory tone. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in repeated “the keeper…” openers mid-text, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>The fusion of caretaker vocation with self-exile in a shadow sanctuary feels freshly synthesized; trope of hermit-healer is twisted into active world-rejection that must be undone. Specific detail—“doorknocker ring like a skeletal hand”—creates memorable image not easily transplanted. Conceptual risk—teaching suffocation to breathe—commits fully and pays off in the final re-entry. Slight deduction for recognizable lyric-quest structure, but interior logic remains singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Early signal → middle beat → closure linkage all hit. The keeper’s choice to touch the flame revives the threshold and costs permanent re-engagement; removing this actor collapses the story.</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Ring is handled at start, mid-journey, and final glow; each appearance reweights meaning from death-knell to beacon. Its color change mirrors the keeper’s arc and is indispensable to the closing image.</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Fading threshold is the problem that triggers every action; its wane forces descent and its revival supplies the closure. Concept shapes tactics—keeper must “encroach” precisely because the glow is dying.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>“Burns bridges carefully” is stated once and embodied in the deliberate severance of outside contact; however, the trait is not revisited under pressure—no moment where a bridge could be rebuilt and is refused—so cost feels implicit rather than dramatized.</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Encroach is the inciting verb; it frames the keeper’s decision to re-enter the sanctuary and later the world. Removing it breaks both the inciting beat and the thematic symmetry.</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>Linking through scars is named and used mid-text to reawaken shadows, but mechanics remain abstract—no sensory detail of how scars transmit power—so integration is strong yet not irreplaceable.</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>Setting supplies the literal flame that must be tended and the spatial layout that forces descent; starlight overhead supplies the final image. Sanctuary is not backdrop but tool.</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</question><grade>“Years” of isolation is stated early and motivates the keeper’s rust and reluctance; however, no ticking clock or elapsed time alters tactics mid-scene, so timeframe shapes backstory more than present pressure.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Motivation is seeded in the first third and returns in the final line as the keeper now teaches breathing by example—stepping back into life. Desire is dramatized through the act of rekindling the flame.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Loaded emptiness is evoked in every shadow description and peaks in the paradoxical fullness-of-void at the heart; tone modulates from suffocating weight to luminous release, charging the final image.</question>
