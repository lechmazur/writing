<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character is competent but never contradictory; interiority drifts into label-speak (“felt a sense of pride and accomplishment”) that blurs embodied cost. The heritage rose thorn and the key are handled, yet neither triggers a visible micro-choice that tightens stakes. Calibrated treason stays thematic; no moment shows her hesitating, risking, or sacrificing for the forgery. The ending’s peace arrives as declared, not dramatized, so the renunciation lacks palpable price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing: the new text “unlinked” and the aurora’s glow reweights meaning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of parchment/rose/key imagery peaks in the final pearl-twilight glow, making cost felt conceptually. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. The stalactite drip supplies a coherent cadence shift, tightening once. Persistent constraint (the heirloom key) shapes every textual move, though its mechanics remain metaphoric rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites are vivid, selective, and return to charge the final image. The body is micro-setting: thorn-prick blood anchors heritage and risk within the marble frame. Spatial choreography stays clean; candles, desk, key tracked without drift. Environment narrows perception—only parchment scent, rose perfume, candle glow—mirroring the forger’s narrowing focus to the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—subvert an injustice-forging document—signals early. Pressure escalates only once: the“calibrated treason” deepens when words “seemed to take on a life of their own,” a textural intensification under Accumulative lens. No concrete loss (time, safety, tool) alters tactics; the risk stays abstract. Closure reweights meaning but does not narrow live options or show a price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the forgery act itself—textual inheritance vs ethical revision—without moralizing. The heritage rose thorn and key accrue symbolic weight that reconfigures at closure. Subtext operates in silence: no triumphalist claim, only aurora glow and dripping stone. The invitation to reflect on complicity and repair is organic, though the lack of dramatized cost keeps resonance just shy of high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric cadence is stable; diction stays within forger’s craft lexicon (parchment, scripts, ink). Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences during inscription, shorter at aurora peak. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature—parchment scent, candle flicker, pearl twilight—tied to her sensorium. Occasional template cadence (“As she…”) mildly flattens urgency but remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong sensory nouns/verbs (“aurora’s gentle light danced,” “stalactites dripped, slowly and silently”) keep momentum. No mixed metaphors; pearl twilight sustains consistent luminescent vehicle. Paraphrase loops appear (“soft, gentle light” ×2 near rose thorn), −0.2. Register stable; no scaffolding or filter-verb stacks. Final aurora image cleanly recharges motif, earning modest high-band entry despite minor repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: calligraphy forgery as ethical vandalism inside an aurora-lit marble cave. The key with no lock and heritage rose thorn are particular devices, not generic symbols. Risk is quiet—no chase, no villain—yet stakes feel large because document undergirds historical injustice. The concept could not swap names/places without collapsing its texture of ink, stone, and northern light.</comment>
