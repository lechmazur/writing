<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The dynasty ender is a passive receptor of visions; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, only awe. Interiority is generic (“flooded with visions,” “maelstrom of images”) rather than embodied. No micro-choice under pressure is shown—turning the crank is repeated identically each time, so no value hierarchy emerges. The final “understanding” is asserted, not earned by on-page renunciation or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Closure is asserted, not dramatized: “they knew they had uncovered a truth” is summary, not a visible Decisive Change or Charged Poise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence merely restates earlier images (golden shadows, crank handle) without reweighting stakes. No persistent constraint or price is legible on the page. Orientation is clear, but the ending beat breaks the accumulative contract by offering only thematic echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is vividly evoked through scent, lantern glow, and tactile paper dust; it functions more as mood board than as constraint. The gramophone crank handle is a micro-setting that finally reappears in the exit image, giving it closure charge, hence the slight boost. Spatial choreography is clean; we never lose track of seat, table, window. Environment never actively limits options, so达不到9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“uncover a hidden truth”—stays abstract; no concrete risk or forfeiture is attached. Escalation is recursive: each crank turn produces the same hum-louder-vision loop without tightening options. The standing waves are decorative, not a pressure mechanism that forecloses a path. Cost is absent; the protagonist exits peaceful, unchanged in circumstance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of intuition-as-epistemic-bridge is stated early and echoed often, but particulars never complicate it. The gramophone crank reappears as a symbol of access, yet its meaning is static—no Conceptual Repricing occurs. Subtext is replaced by overt muse-whispers. The final smile signals affirmation rather than ambivalence, flattening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a sepia, incense-rich register that matches the antiquarian setting. Rhythm is controlled, with sentence variation and no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within elevated but consistent bounds (“sepia,” “reverent,” “maelstrom”). No dialogue to test naturalism. Voice never modulates under pressure because pressure itself is static.</comment>

<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud clean, with high sensory density. Occasional micro-loop: “the dynasty ender felt… the dynasty ender felt…” creates faint template cadence, but it never obscures causality. Metaphors stay coherent (“bridge of intuition,” “standing waves”). No scaffolding or paraphrase debt in the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The gramophone crank as universal key is fresh, but the mystical archive trope is familiar. Interior visions via acoustic resonance offers a small twist, yet the execution drifts into stock “ancient muses whisper secrets.” No bold structural risk is taken; single-scene lyric accumulation is safe. Specificity of the reading room helps, but the concept never reframes the trope in an inevitable way.</comment>
