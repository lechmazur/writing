<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eli’s “creeping normality” gift is shown only as passive noticing; she never makes a high-stakes choice that costs her anything. The orris root is clutched but never used in a beat that changes her tactics. Interiority drifts into abstractions (“inexplicable connection,” “quiet wonder”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final insight feels bestowed, not earned by prior mistakes or micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The closure is a conceptual reweighting (house = living entity) but no visible cost is dramatized; she simply “felt” the shift. The causal chain is loose—“shard of hush” is never shown to do anything; its power is asserted rather than tested. Orientation is fine, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the text never tightens or risks a loss. The ending image is pretty but does not foreclose a path or charge future options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory selection is biased to Eli’s quiet attention: creamy hue of orris, soft lapping, expectant hush. The bay and house perimeter function as micro-settings that guide her ritual walk; spatial choreography is clean. Weather and season are used as mood mirror, not causal constraint, so the 9+ gate is missed. Still, detail is selective, weighted, and filtered through POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract: “understand why some houses feel alive” carries no concrete jeopardy or forfeiture. Pressure is static; the ritual walk proceeds exactly as planned, with no reversal or narrowing of options. The shard is never shown to fail, resist, or demand a price. Escalation is therefore decorative rather than causal or costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>The emergent theme—space can be awakened into living resonance through attentive ritual—is coherent and non-didactic. It grows from the orris-and-objects motif, but because the ritual faces no resistance the insight feels low-stakes. Subtext is thin; the perfumer’s hint is the only external voice challenging Eli. Final image is resonant yet safe, lacking a felt moral or social cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays close to Eli’s perceptions with consistent lexical modesty. Rhythm modulates between long breathy sentences and hushed fragments that support “hushed blaze” tone. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Occasional lofty diction (“inadvertently profound presence”) drifts above Eli’s observable lexicon, but the overall texture is controlled and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary. Some scaffold shows up (“She had always been drawn… She had long been driven…”) creating template cadence, but it never obscures causality. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. A few filter verbs weaken immediacy, yet information density is decent and no loops clutter the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The “sanctify a house with displaced objects” concept is fresh, and linking orris root to a “shard of hush” is a nice sensory invention. However, the idea is not pressure-tested; the ritual works perfectly, so the premise feels under-explored. Tropes of magical awakening are gently subverted by the quiet bay setting, but the execution stays safe. Specificity is present yet risk-averse; the story never lets the magic bite back or fail.</comment>
