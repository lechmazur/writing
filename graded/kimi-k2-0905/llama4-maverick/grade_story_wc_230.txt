<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The forager’s rationality and involuntary honesty are established early and complicate the orchard search; the embodied moment of kneeling to retrieve the glass eye (“half-buried in the damp soil”) gives a concrete micro-choice. Yet interiority drifts into summary (“their truthful nature compelled them to acknowledge the unease”) instead of letting the contradiction play out in scene, and the final resolve is asserted, not dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the forager steps into the storm clutching the relic-eye, a legible image of accepting fractured grace. Causality, however, is loose; the leap from “rumored cures” to actual ingestion/occlusion is compressed into a single paragraph, so the decisive change feels inferred rather than because/therefore driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is sketched with sensory economy—“battered and storm-torn,” roots like “tangled undergrowth”—and the glass eye’s aged patina gives a micro-setting anchor that charges the final image. Spatial track stays clean; weather is causally felt in slippery soil and howling wind that mirrors psyche without overt symbol slogans.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tempering involuntary honesty to reclaim psychological safety—is signaled early; pressure tightens when discredited cures are found. Yet the occlusion act itself is off-stage; we read “they began to experiment” rather than witnessing a moment where options narrow or cost is paid, so escalation is present but muffled.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy’s overreach vs. individual integrity emerges through relic history rather than authorial lecture; the glass eye’s final gaze reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext stays mostly in image, though the line “pursuit of empathy had been taken too far” inches toward thesis-statement territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens keeps consistent moderate distance; perceptual signature shows forager’s fungi-sniffing priorities and soil-level attention. Syntax is controlled, but cadence flattens in the long expository middle; no head-hopping, yet voice doesn’t modulate visibly under rising storm pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with only minor scaffold (“they realized that… they began to… they felt a sense of…”). Metaphors stay spare and coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple clusters. Information density is decent—one sentence often layers action, setting, and interior—but several adjacent sentences still open with “As they…” creating light template cadence that keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus orchard plus rational truffle forager is an unexpected synthesis; the glass eye as smuggled relic oracle freshens the post-catastrophe trope. Fractured grace concept gives a subtle tonal twist. Risk is moderate—mostly standard lyric interiority—yet the specific occupational lens and relic detail feel particular, not catalog-quirky.</comment>
