<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is vivid—embodied wine-hangover eyes, creaking joints—but his contradictory impulses (preserve vs. create) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single moment of choice. The “gleaned redemption” feels conferred by nostalgic sound-jar rather than earned through a visible forfeiture; the final smile lands as emotional summary, not costly renunciation. Still, the perceptual signature is strong and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn light → music-box → sound-jar → poem drafts build density toward the “lonesome splendor” Charged Poise. Closure is legible—the loft becomes sanctuary, isolation reframed as guardianship—but the cost is abstract (time lost, not a concrete option foreclosed). Orientation clean at ~80 words; no causal break, yet no persistent constraint that reshapes future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Feral loft, dunes, and glass jars supply tactile micro-setting; the music box and jars function as handled tools that steer attention and ultimately charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy respects poet’s bias—visual dust, auditory captured hum—though scent/temperature could sharpen crisis moment. Spatial choreography stable; no world-rule inconsistency. Environment mirrors inner state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve fleeting beauty vs. personal irrelevance—signaled early; escalation is accretive (each jar, each dawn ray intensifies wistful ache) rather than a narrowing fork. No visible price beyond generic “years bearing down”; poet never risks or forfeits a live option. Pressure remains atmospheric, not tactical; coincidence absent; meets minimal one-deepening test for lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of transitive memory emerges organically from sound-capturing conceit; final image of poet smiling at dunes reweights isolation as stewardship, avoiding moralizing. Subtext resides in tactile objects rather than commentary. Ambiguity lingers—redemption is “gleaned,” not guaranteed—yet insight still leans on abstract “translator between generations” phrase near end, a minor thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-close poetic voice sustains wistful cadence; diction (“penny poet,” “lonely serenade”) stays within vagrant observer lexicon. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, compresses at dawn’s first whistle, mirroring attention. No dialogue to test distinction; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are sparse and voice-motivated; rhythmic control heightens final tableau without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variation, and concrete nouns outweigh sporadic softeners (“weight of his years”). Mixed metaphor cluster limited to two lines near midpoint; no template cadence in closure. Information density high—each paragraph advances image or stake. Minor scaffold: “the poet’s thoughts turned…” refrain thrice; not severe enough to dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sound-capture jars offer fresh inflection on nostalgia theme; concept feels specific to this voice. Risk is lyric-accumulative structure rather than plot twist, executed competently. Dunes & vagrant poet trope familiar, but glass-jar mechanic and music-box duet particularize it. Transformation test passes—removing jars collapses central metaphor and closure image.</comment>
