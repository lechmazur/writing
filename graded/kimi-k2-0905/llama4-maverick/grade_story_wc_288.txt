<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Lyra’s interiority is textured—her fingers “coaxing secrets” from brass, the vibration in her chest—but emotions stay in lyrical register without body contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the solitary stance is coherent yet static, culminating in a soft renunciation rather than a crucible choice. The reincarnation memory is recalled, not dramatized, so motivational causality is attenuated; the earned stasis feels more mood than cost. Voice remains consistent and atmospheric, but the lack of tightening beat keeps her below 7.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sundial’s glint becomes a “promise,” reconfiguring isolation into forward duty with felt but conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light/shadow, hum, and memory layers until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchor-complete by line 3; no penalty. Escalation is modest—one cadence shift—yet sufficient under lyric design; lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Tidal library, brass sundial, and stone-circle hum are specific, sensory, and return in the final image, charging closure. Micro-setting (sundial’s atomically reflective face) literally mirrors Lyra’s shifting stance, constraining her attention and thus her choice. Spatial choreography is seamless; no geography drift. Atmospheric detail is selective, filtered through her keeper-bias; economy over breadth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete external obstacle tightens options. Pressure accumulates via mood and image, not causality; the only narrowing is her decision to “forge ahead,” cost conceptual rather than visceral. Sufficient for lyric mode, but lacks visible price or forfeiture that would push above 6.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragile continuity emerges through recurring “brittle awakenings” and mirrored light rather than exposition. Final glint reweights prior isolation into purposeful guardianship without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: independence is stance, not escape. Subtext operates in hush and glint, avoiding thesis sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice sustains rhythmic control; diction stays within plausible lexicon for a reflective archivist. No dialogue, so naturalism bullets waived. Perceptual signature—cloud-sea drift, atomic glint, chest-resonant hum—is distinct and consistent. Patterned repetition (“hum…hum…”) is taught early and pays off in closure, earning its cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers image, memory, and bodily resonance. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; metaphors stay coherent (cloud wisps, glass shatter). Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) is acceptable at distance; does not infect peak beat. Sentence rhythm modulates with long calm lines and shorter pulses under light change.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combination of tidal library, extinct-auk memory, and atomically reflective sundial feels fresh yet inevitable. Conceptual risk—quiet lyric closure without external antagonist—pays off under accumulative lens. No trope recycling; keeper-above-clouds is new inflection. Specificity of stone-circle hum as coexistence device prevents generic allegory.</comment>
