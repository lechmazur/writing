<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s inventor-storyteller duality is vivid, yet her interiority stays in lyrical summary (“a deep satisfaction”) rather than contradictory flashes under pressure; no micro-choice visibly costs her anything, so the ending’s communal triumph feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the communal song reconfigures connection and the vine’s glow makes cost legible; causal chain is soft—device succeeds on first try without setback, so tension is more accumulative/textural than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Verdant arbor is anchored early, returns as sacred space at end, and the crystal-plus-vine micro-setting physically enables the song—meeting the 9+ gate; selective dew/crystal imagery stays sensuous and woven through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes (restore communal rite) are declared early and tightened once when the device activates; no visible price or lost option materializes, so escalation is purely lyrical rather than tactical—sufficient for short form but not charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconnection emerges through communal song image rather than statement; the vine-crystal pairing quietly reframes technology-as-nature, offering plausible counter-readings without moralizing—though final paragraph flirts with echo (“restore the sacred practices”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains stable distance and perceptual signature; cadence echoes oral-fairy-tale rhythm, fitting the spinner of golden stories, with no head-hopping or filter-verb bloat; diction stays within fairy-tale register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical but leans on template cadence (“As the…”, “The…”) that creates drum-beat rhythm; several near-repeats (“sense of longing… sense of community”) dull density; figurative layering is coherent but peaks in passive phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-song tech-as-ritual is fresh, yet inventor-mystic and harvest-moon tropes remain recognizable; specificity of crystal-tuned vine gives a memorable inflection, but premise could transplant with minor edits—risk is moderate, not bold.</comment>
