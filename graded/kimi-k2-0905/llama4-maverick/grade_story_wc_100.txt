<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The undertaker’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is named but never dramatized in a costly choice; his interiority drifts toward abstract yearning (“give rest a permanent address”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The final serenity feels declared rather than earned by a visible renunciation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear—package → descent → lens → signal → sanctuary—but the decisive change (his “rest” achieved) is asserted off-page in the epilogue-style coda, so the cost is felt only faintly. The lens reassembly is the tightest beat; the years-later plateau softens the closure punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly sketched through sensory compression (“silence that swallowed all sound,” “tomes bound in moon-shimmer”) and directly constrains his actions—every shelf he restores is a step toward the beacon he tends. Spatial choreography stays clean; the glowing creatures in the final image nicely reweight the setting as living sanctuary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes begin as “revive a distress signal” and deepen into “create eternal refuge,” but the mid-story escalation plateaus once the lens clicks; no new obstacle or trade-off emerges. The tightening is singular rather than progressive, so pressure feels accumulative-textural rather than causal-crescendo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stillness-as-sanctuary emerges organically through the shift from mournful tone to beckoning invitation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The lighthouse-signal metaphor reconfigures from cry for rescue to call for rest, a resonant re-pricing that lingers without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent funeral cadence—measured clauses, somber diction, maritime undertones—mirroring the protagonist’s profession. No head-hopping or register drift; the compression in the descent paragraph (“dark, icy waters”) tightens rhythm without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with strong sensory specificity and only minor scaffold (“the undertaker… the undertaker…” openings twice). No metaphor muddle or synonym loops; one paraphrase loop (“the stillness he had long sought… the stillness he had been chasing”) mildly dulls momentum but does not touch the closure image.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Submerged-library-as-beacon is a fresh synthesis of gothic and solarpunk-quiet, elevated by the undertaker’s vocational inversion from burial to safekeeping. The concept commits fully; risk lies in the quiet ending, but it pays off by reweighting the signal’s meaning.</comment>
