<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The “creeping normality noticer” is interiorized through lyrical noticing, but her want remains abstract (“searching for a way to connect”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the single micro-choice—accepting bread/tea—does not tighten under rising pressure, so the arc is more mood-glide than earned renunciation. Cost is ambient, not personal or scaled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final walk-off smile reweights prior pattern, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural (image-return of bread/tea/garden) and the cost is only conceptual—“tenuous absolution” is named, not paid. Causality is loose: bread appears, gardener appears, repeated return visits accumulate texture; no because/therefore narrows options. Orientation anchor is met by word 40; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tea-house-as-micro-setting is vivid, selective, and body-proximal; vines and weathered wood constrain where the noticer can sit and what she touches. Bread functions as recurring object-setting, its vanished-source mystery charging the final conceptual absolution. Specificity is high, but environment never physically tests or blocks her, so setting supports atmosphere more than tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the ordinary”—is declared early but stays abstract; no tightening trade-off or visible price materializes. Pressure is situational and static: autumn deepens, birds leave, yet her options do not narrow; the one micro-turn (final smile) is mood-shift, not option-foreclosure. Escalation is textural (return visits accrue) rather than causal, sufficient for short form but thin on cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image-pattern (bread/tea/garden) rather than statement; final smile offers resonant reconfiguration of “tenuous absolution” without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—did the bread forgive her?—but subtext stays slight because no concrete prior transgression is seeded. Emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder, not complexity or irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person distant hovers close to noticer’s perception; diction (“wisps,” “crumbling stones,” “fading light”) is consistent, rhythmic, and filtered through her selective attention. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal cadence repeats soft sibilance without drumbeat. Compression (“creeping normality noticer”) is taught early and paid off in final image; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and loop-free; figurative language is sparse so no metaphors muddle. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only one job; occasional filler (“the scent of blooming flowers and the soft murmur of conversation”) could be cut without loss. Strong read-aloud rhythm and consistent tense; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of “guerrilla gardener” with “secret tea house absolution” is fresh, yet plot remains ambient mood-piece rather than transformative synthesis. Risk is quiet-lyric rather than bold; premise could swap names and still function. Specificity of vanished bakery bread adds local color, but core arc is familiar seeker-in-ruins template.</comment>
