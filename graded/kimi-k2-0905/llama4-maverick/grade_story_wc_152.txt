<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The embroiderer’s interior contradiction—witty mask vs. urgent sleuth—stays abstract; no embodied emotion or micro-choice under needle pressure shows the disguise costing them anything. “Pondering whispers” and “mind racing” are summary, not dramatized conflict; the promised flaw never alters a visible decision, so the final smile feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: stitched shimmer and candle pulse thicken atmosphere toward a Charged Poise closure. Yet causality is loose—no concrete beat shows how a stitch uncovers a secret; the coup remains off-stage threat rather than triggered or foreclosed action. Closure image (chart vibrating) carries conceptual cost, but because the embroiderer’s tactic is never specified, the reconfiguration is felt more as mood than decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, eternal candle, and velvet cloth are vividly filtered through the embroiderer’s tactile labor; the season’s crisp air narrows sensory hierarchy. Micro-setting—the needle, flame reflection on cloth—constrains posture and rhythm, charging the final glow. Spatial anchors arrive early and hold; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“listen for unheard stories before the coup”—is signaled early, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: shimmer intensifies, candle brightens, silence thickens. No on-page reversal narrows options; the embroiderer never faces a visible trade-off or failure. Cost is conceptual (imminent chaos), not felt through forfeiture or blocked path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden patterns beneath official maps emerges through embroidery and conspiracy whispers, avoiding overt thesis. Final image of vibrating chart reweights earlier shimmer, inviting reflection on knowledge as textile. Ambiguity lingers, but lack of concrete cost keeps resonance cerebral rather than gut-level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person intimate; perceptual signature favors textile metaphors and star-silk diction. Rhythm pulses with needle and flame, modulating under urgency. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom stays within embroiderer’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional soft fillers—“seemed to,” “as if”—dull immediacy in peak beats. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors, but density dips when shimmer is repeated without new sensory angle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing embroidery with espionage astronomy is fresh; cosmic map as living text subverts standard spy dossier. Conceptual risk—quiet accumulation rather than coup set-piece—pays off in a charged final image. Could swap observatory for any elite enclave, so specificity is moderate.</comment>
