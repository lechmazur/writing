<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eira’s underachievement is asserted, not dramatized; her “stagnant creativity” is repeated rather than shown through botched spell-craft or social humiliation. The interiority drifts into thematic commentary (“she feared she was succumbing…”), dampening embodied emotion. The keystone moment supplies a micro-choice (touch/release) but the cost is atmospheric, not personal—no visible flaw or trade-off is risked or foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: discovery → mist-walk → unstrap → luminance → renewal; each step follows, but pressure is light—no obstacle, deadline, or antagonistic force. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the “brilliant dimness” reweights her stance toward simplicity. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; the story never endangers her goal or reputation, so the tightening feels gentle rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Spire and garden are vividly sensory—ice-rimed carvings, star-like flowers, keystone glow—yet detail is front-loaded; spatial anchoring is clear by word 80. The setting constrains only via wonder; it never imposes cold, oxygen debt, or social surveillance. Micro-setting (keystone) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, but environment remains backdrop rather than tactical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rediscover creative spark”—is signaled early; escalation is purely internal, no external test or rival. One meaningful tightening: keystone release → luminance flood → felt reconnection. Cost is emotional uplift, not forfeiture; no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. Agency is present but low-risk; tension peaks at wonder, not jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—sacred simplicity vs. automated art—emerges through imagery rather than sermon. The keystone’s “brilliant dimness” offers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights creativity as humble wonder. Subtext is thin: no irony or counter-argument complicates the thesis. Final image is resonant but single-note; ambiguity is limited to tone, not moral stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays consistently close to Eira; perceptual signature skews toward luminous visual metaphor, fitting her artistic lens. Rhythm flexes—long breathless sentences for spire descents, clipped fragments at keystone release—without head-hopping. Diction drifts slightly elevated (“ethereal design that defied the laws of physics”), but remains within a mage-scholar lexicon. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal cadence is distinctive and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Loops: “lingering luminance” appears 4× with near-paraphrase; “brilliant dimness” twice. Metaphors occasionally stack (“winds howled like a chorus of the forgotten”; “flowers that shone like tiny stars”) without pattern payoff. Scaffolding: “she felt… she knew… she realized…” filters three successive beats. Otherwise syntax is clean, propulsion steady; no grammar errors or impossible simultaneity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of climate-gothic spire with anti-automation anxiety feels fresh; keystone as creative reset is an elegant literalization. Tropes—hidden garden, glowy macguffin—are familiar, but reframed through craft humility rather than power fantasy. Risk is modest: no structural experiment, no moral shake-up. Specificity of “mist walking” lore and “brilliant dimness”概念 keeps it from generic uplift arc.</comment>
