<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “expectantly resigned” is stated, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—she simply proceeds with her plan. The rosette triggers nostalgia, yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals fresh conflict or cost. Closure is a static affirmation rather than an earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-scene lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues through sensory echo rather than causal turn. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image of rustling leaves re-weights the earlier “traveled stillness” with quiet cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The pattern holds, but the cost is atmospheric, not tactical—lacks a persistent constraint that reshapes next moves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn leaves are vividly filtered through Emilia’s musical ear; light and dust act as acoustic filters. The zither rosette functions as micro-setting, constraining her metaphorical equation of carving = braiding voices. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Sensory selection stays biased to sound and sight, supporting the textural lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts through choral harmony—is declared early but never materially tested. No tightening or trade-off appears; the “subtraction of noise” remains a metaphorical method without on-page mechanics or risk. Pressure is static nostalgia, not escalating scarcity. Closure reconfigures mood, not options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via iterated images of weaving/carving harmony, but the final paragraph verbalizes—“devotion,” “power of music”—rather than letting the image speak. Subtext is thin; silence and leaf-rustle carry some resonance, yet the concept of “unlearning hatred” is asserted, not dramatized. The ending avoids overt moral, but the conceptual reweight is gentle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains stable distance; diction stays within a music-teacher’s lexicon (“rosette,” “kaleidoscope,” “resonant”). Rhythm is deliberate and legato, mirroring zither flow. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative voice is consistent, but metaphor density edges toward purple in high-emotion beats without pressure release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm is varied; however, stacked abstract nouns (“yearning,” “longing,” “harmony,” “stillness”) create synonym churn that blurs specificity. Several sentences open with participial or prepositional clauses, softening propulsion. No hard artifacts in closure beat, but figurative layering feels ornamental rather than tactical. Read-aloud ear is pleasant but slightly hypnotic—risk of monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Premise—choir teacher uses antique zither to teach social harmony—is familiar; freshness lies in acoustic “subtraction” metaphor and autumn-light texturing. Specificity of carved rosette as micro-metaphor for braiding voices gives a modest inflection. Risk is low; piece leans on lyric mood rather than surprising turn. Synthesis is gentle, not revelatory.</comment>
