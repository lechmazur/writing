<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Survivor’s trauma is sketched in labels (“frazzled nerves”) rather than embodied contradiction; her creative drive is declared, not tested under pressure. Eli’s silently-expressive trait is shown once in the nod, then dropped; no visible trade-off or cost attached to either character. The partnership forms without status friction or micro-choice that forecloses a path; interiority stays safe and therapeutic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: sunrise light-shift + heat-map color bloom tighten the stake of “translating silence” into felt vibration. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dimming lights and leaning plants re-weight their symphony as a living part of the conservatory. Cost is conceptual—the music must now be carried alone—but not visibly paid on the page, keeping it just sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is more than postcard: frost on panes vs. tropical air creates the tension that mirrors inner/outer silence. Automated sunrise spectrum and quivering leaves are tactile, biased through the survivor’s sensory priority. The tuning fork case is micro-setting that constrains their final adjusments—irreplaceable tool within arm’s reach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via heat-map color feedback that forces real-time frequency correction. One meaningful tightening: the final joint adjustment before lights dim, narrowing options to this shared symphony. Cost is present but soft—no tangible resource lost—so entry to 8-band wavers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unshaken marvels emerges through living plants listening to unheard music, not exposition. Final image of frost outside vs. music inside re-prices silence as fertile ground rather than void. Avoids explicit thesis; ambiguity lingers about how long the marvel survives once she leaves, holding it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person single POV stays stable; perceptual signature shows in frost-vs-warmth binaries, plant-quiver attention. Compression (“winterglass,” “heat-map”) is taught early and remains legible. Free indirect edges (“she felt a pang of gratitude”) slightly flatten diction under peak moment, keeping it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric rhythm supports accumulative mode without algorithmic pattern; sentences vary in length and breath. No loops or synonym churn; “vibrations emanating from it like ripples on a pond” is lone stock image but does not touch closure. High information density—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data—and no scaffold bloat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise of post-catastrophe silence translated via tuning-fork vibration + emotion heat-map is fresh synthesis; conservatory as resonant listening chamber gives it organic frame. Risk is moderate—quiet, low-plot lyric—but coherence justifies the choice. Could swap survivor’s backstory with another trauma without altering core, capping it below 9.</comment>
