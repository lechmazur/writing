<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elys’s interiority is concrete—empathic resonance with books, the armchair ritual, the invitation rubbed soft—and the contradiction “staying while leaving” is lived in scene. Yet the mistake that drove them here is kept abstract; we never see the wound, only the label “painful,” so the renunciation at the end lacks a felt before/after. The paradox motif circles back via the dropped note, earning a quiet stasis, but the cost is generic “peace” rather than a specific path foreclosed. Voice stays consistent; still, the arc rides atmosphere more than pressured choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tactile detail (dust, lantern glow, worn gold title) layers density until the midnight quarter-hour tightens cadence. Orientation is clean by line 4; causality is loose but permissible under this lens—escalation is tonal compression, not option reduction. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the invitation tucked back into the pocket reconfigures failure into possibility with conceptual cost visible. The missing causal trigger for the original mistake keeps this from 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Library as “secret society…hidden in plain sight” is vivid, selective, and immediately constrains access; lanterns and musty scent recur to mirror internal shift. The crumpled invitation functions as micro-setting/object that literally changes meaning when handled again at closure. Spatial choreography is stable—chair, shelves, slip of paper—no white-room syndrome. For 9-band it needed to obstruct or enable one concrete tactic; instead it serves mood, not choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unearth wisdom in past mistake—signaled early; pressure escalates via narrowing clock (quarter-hour to midnight) and density of paradox texts. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action; the invitation re-pricing counts as visible cost under Accumulative lens. No live option is foreclosed on page—Elys could still attend the ball—so tension remains atmospheric, not tactical. Sufficient for mid-high band but not the sharp trade-off 8.8+ demands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: paradoxes as lived contradiction, truth in questioning not answering. No final moralizing; the note slip reweights prior motifs without sermon. Insight is earned through concrete handling of invitation and book, not abstract assertion. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader left to decide if retreat is wisdom or extended avoidance—preventing tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elys’s perceptual filter: selective attention to paper texture, lantern hue, empathic “whispers of forgotten knowledge.” Syntax mirrors recluse rhythm—long, winding sentences that breathe with library silence. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; register consistent, slightly antiquated, justified by bibliophile lens. Filter verbs (“Elys felt”) are minimal and functional, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates: calm descriptive lull builds to shorter clauses at midnight beat. Information density high—each sentence advances setting, character, or theme. Minor scaffold: “As the clock struck…As midnight drew near…As the first light…” creates template cadence but does not obscure closure. No mixed metaphors or overwriting; near-publishable with micro-edit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Secret-society library” trope is refreshed by treating it as atmospheric extension of recluse psyche; paradox-as-method rather than gimmick. Central synthesis—invitation = past error becomes future growth—feels inevitable yet not obvious in opening. Risk is quiet; no structural stunt, but voice commits to stillness as stance. Could swap city/generic library without breaking arc, limiting originality ceiling.</comment>
