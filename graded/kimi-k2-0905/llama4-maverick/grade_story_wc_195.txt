<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The knight’s passivity—mostly witnessing and murmuring—keeps interior contradiction theoretical; the single active choice (unsnap) is too late to test traits under rising pressure. Emotion stays atmospheric (“shivering bliss”) rather than embodied contradiction. The allegiance is professed but never complicates tactics or costs him anything on-page, so the “withdrawn” label never collides with a visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the merger with “shape of possibility” re-weights reality and carries implied cost. Causality is lyric-associative rather than tight because/therefore; the unsnap triggers the cascade but the link between wooden snap and cosmic shift is asserted, not motivated. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; the lens holds as Accumulative/Textural throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse-night hybrid is sensuously specific (“leaves rustling with otherworldly energy,” “scent of blooming flowers and faint tang of mystical experimentation”) and filters through the knight’s alchemical familiarity. Space is stable; glass walls ripple but geography never blurs. The environment acts—trees lean, branches tangle—supplying the final image; micro-setting (wooden snap) charges the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes (“capture the shape of possibility”) stay abstract; no concrete forfeiture is risked or paid. Pressure escalates only atmospherically—light shifts, trees move—without narrowing the knight’s options or forcing a trade-off. The single micro-choice (unsnap) is initiatory, not climactic; consequence is cosmic but costless to him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the alchemical transformation of isolation into conduit-ship, but the concept is stated (“shape of possibility”) more than dramatized through costly action. Subtext is carried by imagery (trees as marionette-strings) rather than by conflicting values. The final image reframes the greenhouse as a living stage, yet the insight feels abstract because the knight’s inner stakes were never sharpened.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyric-fantastical, with perceptual signature tied to alchemical lexicon (“mystical experimentation,” “otherworldly energy”). Compression and repetition (“shape of possibility” x4) drift toward template cadence but stay legible. No dialogue to test; free-indirect texture holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but loops (“reality shifted” / “as reality continued to shift”) and stacked mystical modifiers dilute immediacy. Strong auditory and olfactory specificity keeps momentum alive. Artifacts appear mid-scene, not in closure beat, so 9+ remains possible elsewhere but caps this category beneath 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The alchemical orchard-night and puppeteer-entity fusion is fresh, avoiding standard fantasy templates. Tropes (withdrawn knight, mystical token) are re-cast through botanical alchemy and marionette metaphor. The unsnap→reality-shift mechanic is conceptually bold but under-grounded in character cost, keeping the ingenuity conceptual rather than fully embodied.</comment>
