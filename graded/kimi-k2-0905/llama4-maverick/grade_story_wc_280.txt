<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Echo’s longing for an encore is declared repeatedly but never enacted as a concrete choice; she passively touches the coin and “begins to weave” off-stage. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her nostalgia, so the arc feels performed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece lands a soft Charged Poise: the garden stills and the coin glows, implying timeline repair. Yet causality is lyric-metaphorical (“echoes grew louder…timeline began to repair”) rather than a traceable because/therefore chain; cost is atmospheric, not stipulated on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orchard-maze imagery is lush, synesthetic and consistently filtered through Echo’s perception; the coin’s glint and shifting trees supply micro-setting pressure. Spatial clarity wavers only once when “paths and trees” rearrange without anchoring Echo’s body relative to the coin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stake—repair the fractured timeline—is declared late and abstract; escalation is accretive imagery (“echoes swirled…garden vibrating”) rather than a narrowing of options. No tangible price or foreclosed path is legible, so pressure feels decorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nostalgia-as-redemption emerges through recurring sensory echoes and the final quiet glow, avoiding explicit moral. Theme remains diffuse because the timeline fracture is never dramatized as a lived loss; resonance is aesthetic rather than experiential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at consistent psychic distance; diction is musical and patterned without monotony. A faint choral cadence (“as the…”) surfaces thrice but reads as incantatory, not template churn, so voice stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is supple and dense, but repeated abstract pairings (“whispers of forgotten melodies,” “fabric of reality”) create near-paraphrase loops that dull the final third. One mixed metaphor—“distilled into a potent elixir” beside “timeline repair”—muddies causality at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Syndrome-ghost + tarot-coin + synesthesia + hedge-maze compresses several familiar fantastical tropes, yet the synesthetic after-hours orchard feels specific and painterly. Risk is moderate; the concept does not mutate the tropes but blends them into a memorable tableau.</comment>
