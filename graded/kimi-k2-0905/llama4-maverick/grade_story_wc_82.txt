<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kaito’s grief is palpable in the lantern-crafting and crane-folding, but interiority slips into abstractions (“luminous torment,” “yearning to transcend”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice visibly raises the stakes after the first crane; the final release feels pre-ordained, not hard-won. The absence of another on-page character keeps status pressure off, so the arc is purely internal—acceptable, but the emotional cost is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the released crane reconfigures grief into something airborne, cost felt in the ache that precedes it. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of polish-fold-release tightens through repetition rather than external turns—valid for lens. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the basilica is introduced as a possible external catalyst but never alters tactics; its promise remains off-stage, so the tightening is purely internal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Floating tea garden, silk threads, glass basilica—each is sensuously sketched and filtered through Kaito’s artisan eye. Micro-setting (the lantern filigree at the edge) literally supports the final gesture, giving the environment a tactile role. Weather and spatial choreography stay consistent; no white-room syndrome. While world-rules (dream recording, shadow detachment) are mentioned, they remain ornamental rather than choice-constraining, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmute grief into crafted light—is signaled early and never drifts. Pressure escalates by texture: each polished lantern and folded crane adds weight until the final release. No external opposition or reversal appears; escalation is one-directional accumulation, acceptable under Accumulative lens but limits ceiling. Cost is present (time, bodily ache, emotional exposure) yet static—no new tactical loss after midpoint—so the tightening feels gentle rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of alchemizing sorrow into luminosity emerges through iterated images—polish, fold, release—without sermonizing. The origami crane’s final flight offers a wordless repricing of grief’s value, satisfying the non-literal answer test. Ambiguity is preserved: transcendence is hinted, not guaranteed. No thematic echo in the closing paragraph; subtext stays implicit, though the basilica’s unused promise lingers as untapped thematic potential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Kaito’s artisan perception; no head-hop. Syntax is lyrical yet controlled—long breathless clauses mimic lantern-thread tangle, then contract for the crane release. Diction stays within a craftsman’s lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing (“unutterable,” “hallowed halls”) edges toward poetic overwrite but remains consistent with the fairy-tale register; under peak pressure the rhythm still breathes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphor chains serve the luminous torment tone; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“something tangible, something that could be shaped and molded”—redundant, costs −0.2. Otherwise density is high; each sentence layers craft, body, emotion. Final paragraph avoids figurative muddle; image of unfolding lotus lands clean. A trim of two adjectives per paragraph would sharpen propulsion to 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Floating island grief-craft is familiar terrain, but the specific fusion of lantern-glass polishing with origami cranes feels fresh; the two crafts rhyme light and fragility in a way generic “art” would not. Dream-recording basilica hovers as untapped potential—interesting but under-deployed. Emotional specificity of folding each crease as memorial keeps the concept from feeling schematic. Not radically original, yet the synthesis and sensory execution elevate it toward the high band.</comment>
