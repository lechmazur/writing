<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and “resiliently positive” tag are declared repeatedly, but no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure dramatizes that trait; her decision to enter the grotto is reported, not wrestled with, so the arc reads as observation, not crucible. The empty hourglass and vanishing-ferry clues never force her to act, endure, or renounce anything on-page, so no visible cost is paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece is an atmospheric vignette, not a causal plot: no “because/therefore” escalates; the discovery of grotto symbols is a reveal, not a reversal that narrows options. Closure is a mood-state (“she stepped into the unknown”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost; the lens remains Accumulative/Textural, but no density shift or pattern break re-weights stakes, so the ending feels open, not earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Spectral grotto under starlight” is vividly sketched through Elara’s biased, nautical attention—dripping water, mineral glint, ferry-deck echoes—anchoring who/where/when by line 10. Details filter her professional eye and quietly mirror her wonder, but the grotto never constrains a later choice; it’s postcard, not pivot, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—personal curiosity about the vanishing ferry—is signaled early, yet pressure never intensifies; the grotto markings merely confirm what she already suspects. No reversal, resource loss, or time-ticking threat forces adaptation, so escalation stays flat; the sideways-clock rule is named but exerts no tactical squeeze, leaving the conflict ornamental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Transient vs. permanent tension emerges through starlight, hourglass sands, and “sideways clocks,” but the theme is stated in narrative abstract (“merge parallel timelines”) rather than dramatized via events. Final image of stepping into “permanent transient-ness” gestures at Charged Poise, yet without prior cost, the reconfiguration feels asserted, not earned, keeping resonance mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays consistently inside Elara’s maritime perception—radio crackle, deck tidying, ferry smell—creating a distinct, salt-tinged diction. Rhythm and syntax flex credibly under wonder, avoiding filter-verb clutter; dialogue with Marcus is brief but flavored by occupational banter, sustaining voice integrity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is sensuous and varied, but overwriting drags: stacked star/grotto metaphors in consecutive sentences and repeated “spectral/gossamer” qualifiers dilute immediacy. Several near-paraphrase loops (“shift and flow like the sands… world shifting, flowing…”) stall momentum in the final paragraph, preventing high-band polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mystical ferry-vanishings and sideways-time clocks remix familiar tropes; the deckhand POV freshens perspective, yet the plot beat—finding graffiti that confirms mystery—is conventional. Specific nautical detail lends authenticity, but the core concept doesn’t twist expectation; ingenuity is solid, not startling.</comment>
