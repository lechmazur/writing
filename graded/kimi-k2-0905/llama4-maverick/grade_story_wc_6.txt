<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is mostly generic “therapy-speak” (“prove that scars can sing,” “emotional ones that still linger”) and never embodied in a specific contradiction during action; the graft is the only micro-choice tied to motive, but it carries no visible cost or risk, so the arc stays flat. Motivation is declared rather than dramatized; the radio call, the coin, and the sand are handled as talismans without forcing a trade-off. No genuine flaw complicates her tactics; competence is unchallenged, so the ending feels pre-ordained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory motifs (lagoon, sand, coin, rain) layer until the final “kelp-drift peace” reweights the stake. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the grafted branch crystallizes Aria’s stance and the cost is the acceptance of her own scars, felt in the final rain image. However, the tightening is modest—no option is foreclosed and no price is extracted on the page—so the reconfiguration is more mood-shift than decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon, volcanic black sand, and coin-on-red-thread are vivid and specific; the lagoon’s mirror-like surface quietly guides the final image. Sensory selection reflects Aria’s bias—she notices texture, color, and healing lore—but the environment never constrains her grafting action or supplies a resource she must relinquish. Spatial choreography is clean; weather migration brings the rain that charges the closing mood, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tending a scarred world while carrying her own—is signaled early, but pressure is static; the burned tree is the only external pressure and it poses no active obstacle. The graft is a single gentle act; no complication, risk, or irreversible cost escalates. Escalation is therefore a texture-shift (rain, scent) rather than a narrowing of options; the lens holds but the beat is too soft to reach high-band cost clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of “scars as song” emerges through recurrent images—charred bark, coin, black sand—rather than overt statement, but the final line drifts toward abstract moral (“hope…for the scars to sing”). Subtext is thin; the coin and sand never accrue contradictory meaning under pressure, so the reweighting is sentimental rather than conceptually charged. Still, the particulars stay particular, avoiding tidy moral binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Aria with consistent perceptual signature—she catalogs textures, colors, and healing myths. Syntax relaxes into lyrical cadence that matches lagoon calm; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction across cast is N/A; internal voice is coherent but relies on repeated “she felt” filters that dull immediacy under peak emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is smooth, with purposeful paragraph breaks and varied sentence length. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors, but “kelp-drift peace” and “scars can sing” edge toward soft poeticism. Information density is moderate—some sentences do double duty, others summarize internal state. No loops or scaffold, but occasional filler filters (“she felt,” “she knew”) sap urgency in closure vicinity, preventing 9-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The arsonist’s-daughter firefighter is a fresh angle, yet the plot is a gentle vignette rather than a transformed trope; swap any healer protagonist and the arc remains. Specific volcanic black sand and obsidian lagoon supply local color, but no rule or implication subverts expectation. Risk-taking is stylistic (lyric calm) rather than structural or moral; the synthesis feels familiar, not inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
