<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Amaranth’s interiority is mostly atmospheric (“otherworldly inspiration”) rather than concrete or contradictory; no micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values, so motivation reads abstract. The “ethics of storytelling” drive is declared repeatedly but never dramatized through a single on-page dilemma or cost. Because no plausible mistake or trade-off is staged, the closure lacks earned renunciation; she simply leaves satisfied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the piece thickens mood via iterative dome/stick references until a quiet Charged Poise closes on “meteor hush” as CR. Orientation is immediate; causality is loose but acceptable under lyric design. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the dome’s silence now frames her future subversions—so the unit is valid. However, no causal trigger escalates options; density alone does the work, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Radar dome’s “ghostly sentinel” shell and “meteor hush” white-noise are specific, sensory, and re-weighted in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is minimal yet sufficient for one character. Selective attention—she notices flicker, creak, trinket jingle—mirrors her calligrapher’s eye. Setting directly enables her creative turn, so the dome is not backdrop but tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Single stake—subvert narrative ethics—is declared, never tested; no tightening or price appears. Pressure is ambient (“eerie calm”) rather than option-narrowing; she never risks failure, loss, or contradiction. Because no beat forces a decision, escalation is static. Closure reweights meaning, not stakes, so Conflict score stays mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—storytelling as ethical subversion—emerges through iterated imagery rather than event, a valid lyric mode. Final “meteor hush” reprises the dome’s silence as conceptual repricing, inviting reader reflection without moralizing. Yet the absence of dramatized ethical friction keeps resonance abstract. Subtext is present but thin; specificity of character dilemma would deepen afterglow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: calligrapher notices “half-lit epiphanies,” “scratching of her pen,” trinket jingle. Rhythm varies cleanly between long atmospheric sentences and short tactile beats. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Register stays within her urbane, artistic lexicon; “subversive puppet shows” is nicely specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; occasional “meteor hush”/“ghostly sentinel” poetic pairings verge on template cadence but stay sparse. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-weight motifs efficiently. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences. Information density is high—every sentence advances mood or motif—meeting 9- band technical bar, yet minor cadence echo prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Concept of decommissioned surveillance dome as creative incubator is fresh and specific; links radar silence to ethical story-subversion are non-obvious. However, the puppet-show ethics remain abstract, reducing transformative punch. Without dramatized audience reaction or failure, premise feels cerebral rather than lived. Risk is present but hedged; deeper摩擦 would push originality higher.</comment>
