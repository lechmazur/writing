<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is poetic but generic; no contradictory impulses play out in real time. The “luminous ache” is asserted, not embodied. His choices—repair, reinforce, gaze—are sequential tasks, not stakes-driven decisions. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the still hand reweights escape velocity into transcendence of self. Causality is loose—tremors appear without trigger, and the hand’s stop is externally decreed rather than earned by Eli’s action. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation cap −0.6 for soft causality and off-stage resolution of the quake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Peak observatory details—“air thin,” “cameras,” “leaf sound”—are vivid but under-deployed; none constrain Eli’s tactical choices or charge the final image. Micro-setting (clock hand) is present yet its physical properties never limit repair options. Environment stays backdrop; no sensory narrowing under tremor stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (harness the ephemeral) is declared early but never tested by a reversible beat; tremors raise abstract stakes yet Eli’s response is only to reinforce walls—no trade-off or narrowing options. No visible price is exacted from him. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; coincidence drives the quake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—time’s continuity amid chaos—emerges via the spinning/still hand, but the insight is delivered in summary rather than dramatized cost. Leaf-as-beauty motif reappears but does not reweight meaning at closure. No subtextual tension complicates Eli’s stance; the epiphany feels pre-approved rather than struggled for.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled rhythm and astronomical lexicon. No dialogue to test distinction. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “changelessly constant”) edges toward thesis-speak but stays within Eli’s reflective register. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature present but not sharply idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, but repeated abstract noun phrases (“luminous ache,” “harness the ephemeral,” “changelessly constant”) create template cadence across paragraphs. No mixed metaphor, yet stacked abstractions dull the final image. One paraphrase loop: “still connected… still alive… still… wonder” within four lines. Density adequate; trimming 10% would sharpen momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing camera repair with cosmic escape velocity is fresh; the non-stop clock hand is a strong speculative object. Execution drifts toward familiar lyric meditation rather than exploiting the repairer’s tactile craft. Leaf-as-catalyst feels imported rather than discovered. Risk is moderate; payoff stays conceptual, not visceral.</comment>
