<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The statue’s interiority is abstract—“incisively kind,” “sense of wonder”—without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; it listens, understands, and shares, but never risks or loses anything. The parrotfish functions as a gentle informant, not a crucible, so the statue’s shift from certainty to nuance is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost. No persistent flaw or blind spot complicates its telepathic mastery, so the arc feels smooth but frictionless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s decay is reframed as resilient adaptation, and the statue accepts its eternal vigil with quiet satisfaction—an earned stasis whose cost is the perpetual burden of animation. Causality is interior and accumulative; the ampoule’s arrival feels serendipitous, but the statue’s interpretive act drives the decisive change. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural throughout.</comment>

<comment>Underwater garden is vividly rendered—coral ballerinas, foxglove-stained glass, filtered light—yet description seldom constrains choice or alters tactics; it’s atmosphere more than pressure. The empty ampoule at the statue’s feet becomes a micro-setting object that charges the final image, nudging the score into the 7-band. Spatial choreography remains stable in a single, slow-motion scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is cognitive: replace nostalgic certainty with nuanced acceptance of decay. Pressure escalates once—ampoule jolt → cascade of revelations—but the tightening is internal and cost-free; no option is foreclosed, no tangible price paid. The garden thrives narratively, yet the statue’s agency changes only its interpretation, not its circumstances, keeping escalation gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—beauty in impermanence through adaptive perspective—emerges organically from the statue’s reframing of structural decay. Subtext is quiet: the empty ampoule silently reweights earlier nostalgia into resilient acceptance. No moralizing statement intrudes; the final image of thriving decay lingers with gentle irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres to the statue’s calm, contemplative diction; no head-hopping. Syntax is languid and rhythmic, mirroring underwater suspension; occasional poetic uplift (“coral and anemones swayed like ballerinas”) stays within the statue’s aesthetic perception. Voice remains distinct and consistent, though emotional modulation is narrow—wonder, satisfaction—without stress-compressed fracture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, but figurative language clusters in successive sentences (“cascade of revelations,” “thread together the fragments”) create light pattern density without new pressure. A few paraphrase loops—“the garden, once forgotten, was now a vibrant, thriving ecosystem” restates prior beats. Overall clarity and rhythm remain intact; no artifact touches the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Living statue telepathically reviving an abandoned underwater garden is fresh; the foxglove-stained ampoule as revelation catalyst adds botanical-gothic specificity. The concept’s risk is its gentleness—decay reframed as life—but the piece commits fully to quiet lyricism rather than ironic undercut. Specificity of marine decay and telepathic historiography keeps it from generic eco-fantasy.</comment>
