<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The surveyor’s motive—"archeologist of abandoned dreams"—is declared repeatedly but never tested by an opposing force or concrete loss; interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction ("hushed blaze") rather than embodied contradiction, so the final smile feels unearned. No micro-choice visibly forecloses a path or exacts on-page cost, keeping the arc static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—the inkwell left behind reweights absence—yet the lens stays Accumulative/Textural, so the causality gate is satisfied. However, the repeated reflective loops ("interlaced absence," "whispers of the past") stall forward pressure, and the note-planting method is named only in summary, blurring the decisive change’s trigger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion is vividly tactile—silt, orange glow, still water—and the inkwell micro-setting constrains the final gesture of leaving it, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography holds; only the drawbridge shadow feels like a late emblem rather than an active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes of "rescuing stories from silence" remain abstract; no tightening beat raises concrete risk or forfeiture. Pressure plateaus after the inkwell retrieval; the surveyor’s tactics never adapt, so escalation stays flat under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges through recurring water-and-ink imagery rather than statement, achieving quiet resonance. Final image of the empty yet "full" inkwell reconfigures meaning without moralizing, though earlier passages flirt with thesis-like phrasing that slightly dulls subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—stoic, cataloguing, faintly archaic. Rhythm modulates with long breathy sentences that mirror underwater suspension; no head-hopping or register drift. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: selective sensory detail, no synonym loops, strong verbs ("wrest," "swallowed"). Occasional stacked modifiers ("stoically sensitive to the whispers") flirt with purple, yet the read-aloud cadence holds. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conceit of an underwater archeologist planting messages in repaired foundations feels fresh, merging climate-gothic with epistolary ghostliness. Tropes of drowned pasts and antique ink are reanimated through tactile specificity; the risk stays coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
