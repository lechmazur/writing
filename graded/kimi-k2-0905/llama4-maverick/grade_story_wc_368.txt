<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kaito’s curiosity about “story-magnet” people is stated, not dramatized; the wing’s handling is delicate but never forces a hard choice or visible cost. Interiority drifts into abstract wonder (“his understanding expanding”) instead of contradictory impulse under pressure. The earned moment is a soft realization without a renunciation or tactic change—acceptable at this length, but the lack of micro-choice keeps him just shy of 7.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrored light deepens the stake of “seeing” rather than causal because/therefore chains. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image of drifting darkness re-weights the earlier iridescent caution with undeniable cost. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity. Slight cap because the escalation is one-note (only light play) and the cost is conceptual rather than felt in body or resource.</comment>

<comment>The floating tea-house is sketched with spare, sensory strokes; its lantern glow and wooden floor constrain Kaito’s cross-legged stillness and the exact angle of light he needs. Valley-mist and drifting rock remain postcard glimpses, but the wing-as-micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate: its iridescent surface literally refracts the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; only the broader world rules (how rocks float, how lanterns stay lit) are withheld, acceptable at this length.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the secret of magnetizing stories”—is signaled early but never tested or tightened; no alternative path is foreclosed. Pressure is atmospheric (fading sun, gathering onlookers) rather than tactical; Kaito’s agency stops at “decided to illuminate.” The cost is purely conceptual (he now “knows” connection), so escalation stays modest. Meets short-form requirement of one meaningful deepening, but lacks visible price or option narrowing.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: refraction as metaphor for narrative allure is shown through the wing’s light-play, never stated. The final image of drifting darkness re-prices the earlier “iridescent caution,” letting wonder and warning coexist. No sermonizing, no allegorical stand-ins. The concept stays light-touch; ambiguity is purposeful but not electrically complex, keeping it just above mid-7 band.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays pinned to Kaito’s perceptual filter; diction (“quietly explosive aroma,” “valley-mist wonder”) is lyrical yet consistent. Rhythm modulates between long contemplative sentences and shorter perceptual jabs, mirroring the shift from contemplation to revelation. No dialogue to test, no POV slippage. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated; syntactic variety sustains a hush-fit tone. Slight over-reliance on “seemed to” constructions prevents 8.5.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, read-aloud melodic, with high information density: each sentence layers image or emotional nuance. No loops, no mixed metaphors; “quietly explosive” is the single compressed oxymoron and it pays off. Opening and closing lines are sharply image-anchored. Occasional adjective triads (“soft, ethereal glow”) flirt with purple but stay within voice. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dye-master craft with butterfly-wing optics is fresh; the “floating tea-house” tweaks familiar wuxia/cloud-temple tropes into a quieter, contemplative register. The insight that storytellers refract social light like iridescent scales is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is modest—no structural experiment—so no bonus. Avoids derivative premise penalties; still, the core metaphor feels like an elegant variation rather than a radical re-imagining.</comment>
