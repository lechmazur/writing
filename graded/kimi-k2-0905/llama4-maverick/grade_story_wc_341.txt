<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but abstract; Lyra’s contradictory impulses stay summarized (“she felt a deep connection”) rather than enacted in a single moment of embodied choice. No micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path—the telescope is raised once, but no tactic or risk is altered. Earned stasis is gestured at but not dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure reaches Charged Poise: the final image of “dusty starlight” reweights the stake of memorializing storms, and the cost is the solitude of that calling. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of cloud-emotion mapping tightens through repetition until the final crystallization. Orientation is clear by word 50; no causality breaks, yet the tightening is mild—one cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Gondola, telescope, and sky function as micro-setting; the brass telescope re-appears as the charged final image, constraining Lyra’s stance. Selective sensory detail (“quietly explosive power”) mirrors internal weather without cataloguing. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility errors. Environment subtly guides her choice to keep watching, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—remains abstract; no external test or visible price is levied for failure. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: clouds calm, but Lyra neither loses nor risks anything on-page. One soft tightening: telescope gaze crystallizes her resolve, yet options do not narrow and cost stays conceptual. Meets short-form minimum, but lacks palpable trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory inscribed in sky—emerges through recurrent cloud-emotion cataloguing and telescope heirloom rather than thesis statement. Final “dusty starlight” reprises earlier motif, reweighting spooled wholeness without moralizing. Subtext is quiet but coherent; ambiguity lingers about whether proof is possible. Insight stays slightly abstract because stake is never materially tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is meteorological (“clouds’ emotions turbulent”), idiosyncratic but consistent. Register balances technical (“aviation meteorologist”) with lyric without drift. Rhythm modulates toward shorter cadence at climax. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Clean control, but not yet singular enough for 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet efficient; high density in lines like “empty spaces remembered, holding the essence.” Occasional ornamental pairing (“kaleidoscope of shapes and textures”) slightly pads, but metaphor logic holds. No scaffold loops or tense slips. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs anchor motion. Final paragraph sustains clarity and lifts resonance, staying within 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Cloud-emotion taxonomy feels fresh, operationalized through inherited telescope and storm memorial, not mere quirk. Synthesis of meteorology with grief-memory avoids cliché. Risk is quiet—lyric meditation inside gondola—yet coherence and specificity make it memorable. If premise were ported to another frame, the emotional engine would collapse, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
