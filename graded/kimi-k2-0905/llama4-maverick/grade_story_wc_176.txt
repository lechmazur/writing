<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Akira’s “technically gentle” trait is shown in dexterous rope-work, but interiority stays generic (“sense of peace,” “labor of love”) without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; the forgiveness backstory is told once and never tested again, so the arc feels flat rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rope’s hum reweights memory and carries felt cost (“sound of forgotten names” now audible). Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each braid tightened adds density until the final resonance—but the punch-card’s rule-set is introduced late, so the decisive mechanism feels lightly motivated rather than foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum, candle glow, and auroral hiss are filtered through Akira’s tactile attention; the reconfigured rope itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final pluck. Selective sensory detail mirrors internal thaw, but spatial anchors (ceiling, distance, exits) remain vague, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve fading names—is clear early; pressure tightens as each braid narrows future options. Yet no credible loss (time, material, personal risk) is dramatized; escalation is aesthetic rather than tactical, so cost stays conceptual and the tightening feels gentle, not urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-sound emerges through the rope-instrument image without overt statement; the aurora’s hiss and the rope’s hum form a resonant pair that reweights loss into continuity. Final image avoids moralizing, but the conceptual leap relies on lyric repetition rather than a concrete ethical trade-off, capping resonance short of the 9-tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—sound-first, touch-second—mirroring Akira’s caster precision. Syntax stays controlled, with rhythmic variation that breathes during braiding and tightens at the pluck; no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and loop-free; figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“snowmelt ardor” appears once and pays off). Occasional soft fillers (“seemed to,” “as if”) slightly dull the final hum’s edge, preventing a 9+ line-level score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Fusing lost-wax craft, auroral acoustics, and punched-card data into a memory-instrument is fresh and specific; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but the piece commits fully to its accumulative lens, avoiding gimmick or template.</comment>
