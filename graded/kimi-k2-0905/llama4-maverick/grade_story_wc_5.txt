<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s patience-as-ritual is embodied early and pays off in the blood-drop seal, giving us a credible micro-choice hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“world…holding its breath” mirrors her own held breath), but the heartbeat-map desire is stated more than dramatized until the final glow; no contradictory impulse is shown mid-process. Earned stasis is present—the life-force cost is felt—yet she never risks failure, so tension stays interior and plateaued.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the plate’s pulsing map is a Charged Poise that reweights the crater from dead orchard to living cartograph. Causal chain—pattern-making → starlight infusion → blood seal → heartbeat translation—holds without gaps; no orientation debt. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the hum synchronizes with her pulse, forcing the final seal. Cost is legible in “channel her own life force,” satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subarctic crater pins temperature, twilight, and scent to every surface; orchard detritus is handled, not catalogued. The plate as micro-setting constrains the final action—it must be lifted to fading light to complete enchantment—meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean (no impossible moves), though larger geography beyond the crater lip is unmarked and irrelevant. Environment mirrors interior stillness without overt symbolic nudging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into maps—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tested once at the seal beat. Pressure is accumulative: decay-perfume silence → starlight glow → heartbeat hum → life-force cost, each layer adding weight rather than narrowing options. No external antagonist or reversal, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural, so one intensification suffices. Cost is visible (vitality drain), fulfilling the 8-band guardrail.</comment>

<comment>Theme—art wrests living meaning from desolation—emerges through the orchard-to-map transformation rather than statement. Starlight/heartbeat motif accrues two weights: cosmic distance vs. intimate pulse, reconfigured when the map begins to breathe. Final image of “moving stillness” offers non-literal answer without moral. No Echo penalty; no abstraction replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Aria; perceptual signature favors tactile crunch, damp earth, and hush. Syntax slows to match deliberate gesture, then compresses at the harmonic hum—“world…exhaling”—without register drift. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “safekept starlight,” which feels idiosyncratic yet internally consistent. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, meeting 9- gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional, participial, and subject-start patterns without drumbeat. No loops or synonym churn; “stillness” is repeated but reweighted intentionally. Figurative density spikes in the final third (“vessels for the deepest desires,” “cartographer of the soul”) yet stays coherent under the lyric lens. Strong verbs anchor motion; only minor scaffold in “seemed to glow / seemed to come alive” doublet.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Flash-paper alchemist is fresh, but “heartbeats into maps” is the standout synthesis; starlight-as-ink feels inevitable in hindsight. Orchard-crater is specific, not generic frozen-wilderness. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric escalation rather than twist—but coherence never wavers. Could swap “flash-paper” for “glass-bone” alchemist with minor edits, capping score below 7.</comment>
