<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Eira’s gentleness and persistence are repeated labels, never dramatized by a moment where her restraint costs her or alters tactics. The travelers remain an anonymous chorus; no interior contradiction or individual choice surfaces. “Unused courage” is asserted, not embodied in any character’s micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: the journey’s mood thickens by repetition of mist, star stamp, shoreline lullaby. Closure is a Charged Poise—dawn reveals the new shore and the stamped palm glows, reweighting the premise with felt cost. However, no persistent constraint or price shapes tactics; the trek is frictionless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway and shoreline lullaby are evocatively textured, filtering perception through Eira’s staff and stamping ritual. Micro-setting works: the staff’s etched symbols and star stamp act as tactile anchors. Environment steers mood, but never narrows choice or supplies hazard that alters path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes—“find unused courage”—stay abstract; no concrete test or loss confronts the travelers. Escalation is atmospheric (mist thickens, dawn approaches) rather than causal. The vigil moment deepens mood but does not foreclose an option or exact a price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of awakening dormant courage emerges through imagery rather than thesis. The shoreline lullaby and star stamp form a quiet pattern that reweights at dawn. No moral is stated; the resonance stays modest because courage itself is never dramatized in a costly choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent poetic distance; diction stays within fairy-tale register. Repetition of “veiled ridgeway” and “shoreline lullaby” teaches the pattern early. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; perceptual signature is limited but coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet lean, no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“serpent through the twilight”) are coherent. Occasional stacked modifiers (“mist that swirled with an otherworldly energy”) flirt with over-density, but clarity survives. Final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Ferry guide leading souls through liminal mist is familiar; star stamp as passport feels fresh. Risk is low—no structural or conceptual gamble. Specificity of shoreline lullaby and ticket punch lifts the piece above generic quest, yet premise remains recognizable mythic template.</comment>
