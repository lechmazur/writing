<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The fire-escape gardener’s interiority is lyric but thin: “wistfully pragmatic” is stated, never embodied through contradictory impulse or visible trade-off. Actions (pruning, pocketing the tooth) stay on one emotional register; no spike of stress tests hierarchy of values. Reflection on the lockmaster stays ornamental; it neither tilts a present micro-choice nor forecloses a path with cost. The character ends where he began: a serene caretaker—no earned stasis with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: moonlit harbor, oar-rhythm, and tooth accrete toward a Charged Poise closure—urban tranquility wrapped round by felt vigilance. Transitions are smooth (one scene, one POV); time/space anchors arrive by line 3, satisfying Orientation. Closure image (“fire escape gardener stood as a guardian…”) reconfigures stakes—city’s beauty now contingent on hidden caretaking—conceptual cost legible. No causal reversal, but pattern break (dawn after hush) is sufficient under Accumulative drive; cost is oblique yet undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, steel fire-escape lattice, and salt-air oar-sound interweave with tactile action—gardener’s knees against iron, tooth’s ridges in palm. Micro-setting (rosebush, bit-gauge tooth) doubles as constraint: pruning triggers reflection, tooth cues memory; both return in final guardian image. Sensory selection mirrors POV bias—professional gardener notices petal-drop before city noise. No environmental detail stalls momentum; each stroke of light or water advances the accumulating hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve city’s hidden beauty—signals early but remains static; no escalating obstacle or trade-off appears. Pressure is situational: moonlit hush and oar-rhythm deepen mood rather than narrow options. Gardener’s sole “choice” is to keep tending, identical to his opening action; no visible price alters tactics. Escalation is lyrical, not consequential—enough for short-form accumulative design yet below the threshold for high-band cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: caretaking as covert resistance to urban erasure. Recurrent light/dark imagery reframes pruning not as loss but as reflection-transfer. Final guardian stance answers the implicit question—who tends the overlooked?—without moralizing. Subtext carries in gesture (pocketing tooth, hands moving like ritual) rather than assertion; resonance lingers in reader’s bodily memory of oar-cadence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains hushed cadence; syntax elongates then contracts to mimic oar-strokes. Perceptual signature is gardener-specific: botanical taxonomy, lock-master lore, harbor acoustics filter through cultivator patience. No dialogue, avoiding register risk; internal diction stays within plausible self-taught range. Patterned repetition (“rhythm of oars,” “quivering hush”) is taught early and paid off in final cadence, legitimizing stylistic compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long floral clauses and short pulse beats, matching breath of night work. Figurative layer is dense but coherent—metaphors (city holding breath, spell of protected vulnerability) stay inside horticultural/lock-picking lexicon. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or conceptual grain. Minor scaffold: “as if” hedges appear three times; none dilute closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Urban night-gardener trope is familiar; freshness lies in pairing with ex-locksmith tool and acoustic oar motif, yielding quiet civic-poetics. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet not widely rehearsed. Risk is stylistic (lyric accumulation vs. plot) rather than conceptual; limited to short-form, the gamble succeeds. Could edge higher with a sharper cost or irreversible guardian burden.</comment>
