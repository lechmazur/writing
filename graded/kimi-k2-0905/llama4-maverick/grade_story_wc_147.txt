<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael’s lonely resolve is palpable, but interiority drifts into lyric perfume-speak (“touching memories”) that abstracts rather than embodies. The contradiction between clinging to life and overriding instinct is named, not dramatized—no moment shows her body fighting itself. Final “smile in darkness” gestures toward Earned Stasis yet feels declared; the cost of overriding instinct is only summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent-drenched repetitions tighten mood until the energy is bottled. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the temple falls utterly silent, Kael left with scented absence—cost is the world’s voice replaced by perfume. Orientation crystal-clear by 50 words; one looped phrase (“as time runs short”) is minor artifact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Underwater temple is sketched in salt-drip and crumbling stone; micro-setting of neck-vial becomes the true terrain that guides steps. Sensory triage narrows to scent and faint blue glow—perfect crisis filter. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Vial-light charging the final image passes 9-gate test yet setting never over-describes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the ephemeral or lose civilizational memory”—is signaled early and personal. Pressure tightens only once, at the crystal heart; prior beats are lyric reiterations rather than new costs. Protagonist agency is present yet single-gear; no secondary trade-off or visible price paid until final silence. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens but remains one-tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-scent emerges organically through action, never sermonized. Subtext hints that archiving may equal embalming, but ambiguity stays under-explored. Final image reweights vial from gift to sarcophagus—effective CR. No platitudes, yet insight feels one-note compared to nuanced sensory build-up.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hop. Diction trends toward atmospheric litany (“lonesome splendor,” “gentle susurrus”)—lovely yet slightly uniform across beats; peak stress lines identical cadence to calmer lines. Perceptual signature vivid in scent-filtered noticing. Dialogue absent; prose rhythm clean, occasionally hypnotic, could vary more under mortal pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>High density early—“crumbling stone, faint glow, salt and decay” triply load one line. Later, template cadence surfaces: repeated “as time runs short,” “temple’s whispers grew louder.” Mixed metaphor harmless but one strained stack (“crystal perfume vial suspended from her neck… touches memories… unsnarled threads”) slightly clogs climax. Strong ear overall; minor tightening needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Merging scent with archival rescue breathes new life into both “memory perfume” and “dying temple” tropes. Specificity of blue-glow vial guiding diver’s hand feels fresh. Yet plot arc remains familiar lone-archivist myth; emotional beat of smiling into darkness leans on stock sublime. Worthy risk in lyric escalation but not fully non-obvious.</comment>
