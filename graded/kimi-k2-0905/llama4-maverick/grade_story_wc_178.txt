<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyric but generic; “empirically ironic” is asserted, never dramatized in a micro-choice. The astronomer’s covenant is announced, not tested under pressure; no felt cost or contradiction drives the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence repetitions (“the astronomer felt…”) deepen mood rather than advance cause. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tile lifted to starlight—whose conceptual cost (life’s work complete) is legible but abstract; no concrete price is shown on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Palace is evoked in lush, echoing phrases; spatial anchors arrive late (~130 w) but serve the twilight payoff. The tile functions as micro-setting, constraining attention and choice; its shimmer is repeatedly filtered through POV priority.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—cosmic covenant—declared early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed. Escalation is textural accumulation of dusk and starlight rather than a tightening that costs the astronomer anything tangible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of transcendence through encoded devotion emerges imagistically, not stated. Final image reweights earlier star-maps, but ambiguity lingers—covenant’s price is cosmic, not personal—keeping reflection slightly generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at consistent dreamy distance; diction stays夜空-bound, syntactic parallelism mirrors celestial orbits. No dialogue to fracture voice; perceptual signature is “dusty relics whispering,” a filtered astronomer-eye.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence—yet pattern is taught early and sustains trance rhythm. Some loops (“the astronomer felt…”) and synonym churn (“celestial rhythms…cosmic harmony”) mildly dull propulsion near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Magic-square-as-cosmic-key is fresh angle on familiar scholar-mystic arc. Risk is stylistic—sustained lyric cadence—but execution stays coherent; specificity of Babylonian reimagining prevents generic fantasy drift.</comment>
