<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The seed sorter’s quiet curiosity and ritual of building twig monuments give her a consistent, particular interiority; her wonder feels embodied, not generic. Yet the transformation is declared (“she knew that she would emerge transformed”) rather than dramatized through a final, costly micro-choice, so the arc slips into summary at the exact moment it should crystalize.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern of decoding leaves and glowing specks early and holds it to closure. The final image—arbor glowing with residual moonstone light—delivers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights the whole experience. Cost is present but diffuse (time, self-loss); a crisper sentence of forfeiture would have pushed this into high band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Ashen skyborne arbor” is anchored by word 10; every later detail (moon-barked trees, leaf-code, drifting clouds) is filtered through the sorter’s selective attention. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting/object that literally illuminates the final pattern, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography remains stable in a single, floating locale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode the message hidden within the falling leaves”—is signaled early and tightens once when the speck brightens to reveal the hidden leaf pattern. The escalation is a single, gentle intensification rather than a narrowing of options; no visible price is exacted on the page, so the pressure stays lyric rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory, transformation, and the human need to ritualize the forgotten. The monuments-to-forgotten-things motif returns in the final image without authorial comment, letting the reader feel the reweighting. Quiet endings are allowed, but a sharper ironic sting or loss would have lifted resonance into the 8+ band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, mist-textured, and consistent: “mossy delight,” “hush where past meets prophecy” create a perceptual signature aligned with the sorter’s moonlit attentiveness. Syntax swells and contracts with the leaf-fall cadence; no head-hopping or register drift. Occasional soft-focus堆砌 could be trimmed, but line-level control holds under lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the leaf cadence; sentences vary without algorithmic pattern. A few soft repeats (“glow,” “misty,” “ethereal”) and near-paraphrase clusters (“gentle glow,” “soft, ethereal radiance”) dull density, but they never obscure causality or stall closure. Clean punctuation and tactile verbs (“prod,” “shimmered”) outweigh the minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Floating seed-arbor as nexus of past-prophecy is a fresh, non-obvious frame; twig monuments to forgotten things supply a lovely, specific ritual not seen in stock fantasy. The lyric escalation risks gentleness-over-familiarity, yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk level is moderate—more charged loss or irony would have pushed originality into the 8.5+ tier.</comment>
