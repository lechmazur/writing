<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Asa is sketched in evocative strokes—dreamless freight guard, wave-function meditator—but interior contradiction is only asserted, never dramatized. The archive’s pull is felt as ambient magic, not as a hard choice that forks her wants; the moment she re-animates the chess clock is beautiful yet cost-free, so no path is foreclosed. The “merging” at the end reads as rapture rather than earned renunciation, blunting the required visible cost. Still, her perceptual lens is distinct and steadily maintained, keeping the score north of mid-line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure is present—Asa’s form re-solidifies at dawn, the archive secured, the dune gentled: a Charged Poise that reweights the world from ash to glow. Causality, however, is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore; the clock restart causes the dune to bloom, but that bloom is metaphor, not tactical consequence. Orientation is legible inside 120 words, so no orientation penalty, yet the archive’s “occasionally everywhere” trait is never rule-taught, letting coincidence masquerade as logic. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final cadence shift lands, but the cost is atmospheric, not palpable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glowing dune is atmospherically rich—sand that shimmers underfoot, flora that blooms in radioactive color—and every descriptor is filtered through Asa’s freight-guard gaze, never touristic. The chess clock’s frozen hands, half-buried then resurrected, functions as micro-setting that directly charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: ridge-crest kneel, grains brushed away, ticking synced to heartbeat. Environment never constrains a tactical choice, only mirrors mood, so it hovers just below the 8+ gate that demands choice-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivate hidden sparks—is announced early but remains abstract; no concrete resource is risked or forfeited. Pressure is atmospheric rather than narrowing: the dune glows brighter, the archive hums, but Asa’s options do not shrink. The one micro-turn—restart the clock—unlocks harmony, not complication, so escalation runs backward into wonder rather than forward into cost. Without a visible price paid on the page, the conflict stays lyric, not stakes-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge asleep in ash, revived by ritual attention. The frozen clock reborn as pulse embodies the idea without sermon. The “fractured lullaby” tonally reframes apocalypse as lullaby—an unsettling comfort that resists moral binaries. No character articulates the thesis, so the resonance is earned, though the abstraction keeps it from piercing deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is textured, synesthetic, rhythmically controlled: “the dune itself was responding… sand beneath her feet began to shimmer.” Diction stays inside Asa’s perceptual lexicon—no academic register drift. The second-person hovering “you” never appears; no head-hopping; psychic distance compresses credibly under hallucinogenic bloom. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) are rare enough to keep immediacy intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies: long breathy clauses yield to staccato image-kicks (“frozen at midnight, its still hands”). Metaphors are internally coherent—no mixed vehicles. Occasional near-loop (“glowing dune… dune’s glow”) is isolated; no paraphrase churn. Information density is high; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. A few adjectival floaters (“ethereal glow,” “otherworldly energy”) flirt with purple but stay within lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The freight-guard tasked with a Schrödinger archive on a post-forest dune is fresh, and the chess-clock heart is a beguiling central machine. Yet the “wave-function” method is asserted, not mechanized, so the SF gesture feels ornamented rather than rethought. The “occasionally everywhere” trait is never exploited for plot or paradox, flattening novelty. Risk is taken with lyric over causal, but the payoff is atmospheric, not revelatory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Her dreamlessness is stated, never tested by a nightmare or choice; the freight-guard occupation seeds the milieu but grants no special tools or constraints. She decides to restart the clock, yet that act could be done by any wanderer, so the role is ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The clock is seen, buried, brushed free, restarted, and finally becomes the beacon that syncs her heartbeat—five functional touches that reweight it from symbol to lifeline. Without the restart, bloom and merger stall, so it is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The archive is the cargo and the energy source, but its “divergent” nature is never specified or limit-tested; it behaves like generic magic. It generates atmosphere, not tactical trade-offs, so integration is mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The “occasionally everywhere” trait is introduced early and exploited when the archive’s pulse guides her to unlit corners, enabling the final cultivation. Yet the rule is never constrained or costly, keeping it from top band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>“Charm” is used once as a verb for mental focus; it is synonymous with “activate” and carries no unique mechanic. Swappable with “summon” or “probe,” so integration is modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>“Wave functions” are name-checked but never explained or limited; they serve as sci-fi décor rather than method. The story never shows how her modulation alters outcomes, so the concept is decorative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>The glowing blooming dune is the only landscape given; its shimmer directs her feet and its light provides the cultivated sparks. Remove it and the entire visual arc collapses, so linkage is strong, though it never physically obstructs.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>“After the last forest burns” sets the eco-apocalyptic clock, but time is static—no countdown, no seasonal deadline. Dawn arrives as serene coda, not pressured pivot, so timeframe is thematic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Her motivation to “cultivate sparks” propels every step toward unlit corners and justifies the merge, but the desire is never contested or priced. It functions as steady compass, not conflicted want, capping it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The “fractured lullaby” tone is established in the ticking-bloom cadence and sustained through sonic images—ticking woven into lullaby. It modulates from unsettling to serene at the end, directly charging the final image.</comment>
