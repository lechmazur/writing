<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but generic; “crestfallen” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulses in scene—only abstract self-interrogation. The final “redesign” is declared, not dramatized; cost is metaphorical smoke. Voice remains atmospheric, not individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical CR: the broken box reweighted as gateway. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of untangling reconfigures perception. No orientation debt; lighthouse library anchor arrives by word 40. However, no causal tightening mid-text; pressure is static mood, not narrowing choice. Cost is conceptual only—acceptable under CR, but thin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Library-lighthouse fusion is vivid, selective, sustained. Dust, leather, beam are filtered through artist’s eye and return in the closure image. Micro-setting (box fibers) functions as setting extension and constrains the manual redesign act. Would need one tactile choice altered by spatial layout to breach 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can art matter?”—is declared, never tested in scene. No external or internal pressure that narrows options; escalation is cadence repetition, not rising cost. No visible price paid; the untangling proceeds unimpeded. Under Accumulative lens, a single pattern intensification is sufficient, but it must reweight stakes—here it only re-describes them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation→reintegration emerges through box/lighthouse imagery, not sermon. Final image reframes darkness as generative—an earned Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers without confusion. Rhetorical questions flirt with Echo penalty, yet remain interrogative rather than assertive, sparing the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is stable; diction stays within artist’s perceptual range. Rhythm modulates with long/short sentence alternation, supporting meditative arc. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs (“seemed to”) are purposeful under Textural lens, not lapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but purple clustering in every sentence of final paragraph dulls impact. Metaphors (“luminescent ache,” “river of threads”) recur without mutation, creating loop. No scaffolding or synonym churn, yet density approaches overwriting. Closure image still lands clear, capping deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fusing tarot, lighthouse, and library yields fresh symbolic space. However, the descent-into-darkness artist arc is familiar; only the composite setting distinguishes it. Risk is aesthetic, not structural. Would need one irreversible micro-choice unique to this collage to reach 8+.</comment>
