<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rachel’s interiority is vivid (“music seemed to seep from the very walls”), but her motivation to crack the code is stated rather than dramatized with contradiction or cost; the pivotal decision to tilt the program is the only micro-choice that actually changes her tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the water-revealed message reweights Rachel’s alienation into communion with the house, delivering an Accumulative/Textural Charged Poise. Causality holds in the water-program beat; earlier beats slip into atmospheric loops without tightening options, preventing higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Flooded pit, flickering lanterns, and water-warped paper are lived-in and selective; they guide her discovery method and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the soaked program) constrains her only investigative tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the ghost’s secret—remains abstract until late; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Only the final tilting of the program narrows options and forces concrete cost, a single meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of porous boundaries between art and artist emerges through water-bleeding images, not statement. The program’s final reconfiguration offers resonant non-verbal answer, but earlier imagery is repetitious, muting full resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at consistent psychic distance; diction stays within musician’s ear (“unstruck chords”). Occasional template cadence (“As the…”) and filter clusters dull immediacy, yet voice remains distinct and coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity, but repeated scaffolding (“As…”) and near-paraphrase loops (“music of La Bohème swelled… / music… etched in heart”) gum rhythm. Figurative layering stays purposeful—water as score—without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ghost-code revealed via water-damaged score is fresh; flooded opera house as liminal instrument is memorable. Risk lies in lyric drift, but it pays off in closure, avoiding gimmick. Detail feels particular to this voice rather than borrowed gothic set.</comment>
