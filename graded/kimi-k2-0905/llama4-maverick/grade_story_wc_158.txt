<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The “shyly unstoppable” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a visible contradiction; the centuries-long span is summarized rather than embodied, so interiority feels generic. No second character appears, so status/relationship tests are N/A. The final lullaby is a micro-choice, but its cost is only asserted (“weight…lift”), not dramatized, keeping the arc in mid-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers image-repetition (postcard, fungi, shell) until the final lullaby reweights the stake. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; closure is a Charged Poise—the lullaby crystallizes peace with felt cost. Minor slips: “centuries of longing” is told, not shown, and postcard causality is retrospective; these nudge it below 8.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shell-fungi-postcard triad is specific, re-used, and charges the final image; the postcard’s colors against fungal glow visually tightens the ending. Spatial choreography is minimal (she never moves), but the micro-setting (notebook, postcard, fungi) constrains the act of singing. Sensory balance is lyric-skewed, yet purposeful; no world-rule inconsistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute pain into beauty—is declared early; pressure deepens only through accumulated imagery rather than narrowed options. No credible loss or reversible risk appears; the “armistice” is backstory, not live tension. Escalation is poetic density, not stakes; cost is lyrical assertion, not visible price, capping it below 7.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: art as survival inside grief’s husk. Subtext lives in the postcard’s color return and the shell-to-womb turn. Final image avoids moralizing, achieving quiet resonance, but the century-span is told, not tested, so complexity is moderate, not profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-consistent, with perceptual signature (fungal glow, reef-shadow) tied to poet’s sensorium. Syntax varies; no head-hop. Register stays within poetic lexicon; “reef-shadow joy” risks abstraction but is pattern-taught early and repaid in closure. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong auditory and color texture; sentences carry dual duty. Minor loop: “beauty”/“bloom”/“blossom” echo without new inflection; “centuries of longing” appears twice. No mixed metaphor or clarity break; rhythm breathes with lullaby cadence. Within high-band but not flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Mollusk-shell studio and galaxy postcard as peace relic feel fresh; combo is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is lyric compression, but it pays off.minus for slight over-reliance on “beauty” as abstract payload; still, specific bioluminescent detail keeps it memorable.</comment>
