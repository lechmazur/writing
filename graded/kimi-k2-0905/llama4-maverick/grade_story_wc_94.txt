<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; emotions are named (“furiously tranquil”) rather than embodied in gesture or breath. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized—she reads the letter she herself hid, so the moment is circular, not consequential. The “cartography of scars” remains metaphorical; we never see one scar alter her grip on the timer or the envelope. Endurance is declared, not tested, so the renunciation feels cost-free.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: the storm’s beauty is re-seen through “newfound understanding,” but the understanding itself is asserted, not shown in a decision or forfeiture. Causality is accumulative/textural; the timer’s ticking and the envelope’s reveal create cadence, not plot. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation is deliberate and pays off lyrically. Still, the final image carries only atmospheric, not actionable, cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is evoked with strobing sensory specificity—lightning flashes, wind howling like “a chorus of the damned.” The darkroom timer’s tactile familiarity anchors the micro-setting, constraining her vigil rhythm. Spatial choreography is ghosted but coherent; bodies never collide with the envelope or timer. Environment is mirrored in emotional register, charging the final image of dissipating storm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and static: will she understand her scars? Pressure never tightens—options do not narrow, time does not shorten, and the storm offers no real obstacle. The envelope reveal is a foregone conclusion because she hid it herself; no external force complicates retrieval. Escalation is atmospheric, not consequential; the storm’s fury is backdrop, not antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurring images of mapping, masking, and developing—scars as negatives, storm as developer bath. The final reconfiguration is quiet: darkness shifts from “oppressive” to navigable. No moral is stated, but the insight is generic—“hidden patterns” remain abstract. Particulars (timer, timetable) carry more texture than the thematic payload, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent—long phrasal cadences mimic storm surge. Perceptual signature is poetically elevated throughout, justifying diction like “rarefy” and “cartography.” No dialogue to distort register; internal monologue stays within poet’s lexicon. Filter-verb stacks (“she felt”) appear but serve lyric distance rather than dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Syntactic variety is strong, but overwritten metaphor density in peak beats (“chorus of the damned,” “turbulence within”) tips toward purple. Minor paraphrase loops: “hidden patterns / unseen lines” restate without deepening. Opening and final lines are ear-tested and propulsive. No scaffold or template cadence, but figurative overload slightly blurs closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The conceit of a darkroom timer as vigil heartbeat is fresh; bus-timetable dead-drop feels lived-in, not gimmick. Storm as developing bath for personal negatives offers a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds. Could swap poet for any wounded artist without structural change, so freshness is partial.</comment>
