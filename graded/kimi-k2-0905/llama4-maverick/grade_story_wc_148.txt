<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The son’s curiosity is credibly seeded, but interiority leans on inherited “weight of legacy” shorthand rather than a private, body-level itch. No forked desire shows in-scene; he drifts through awe without contradictory impulse. Final touch of the lock is thinly motivated—no visible cost or renunciation forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure drifts into lyric open-endedness rather than legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the lock-touch promises revelation but pays no cost on the page. Orientation is clear; causal chain is weak—“because father told tales” never tightens to “therefore I risk prison.” Lattice pattern taught early holds; lighthouse space is tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Salty decay, copperlit lattice, and scuffed door give tactile specificity; micro-setting (door skin, hinge rasp) steers attention. Lighthouse-prison concatenation stays more postcard than constraint; it never limits exit or amplifies peril in-scene. Final lattice glow is atmospheric but does not charge the closing image; hence 9+ gate not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“chasing hush to own the story”—is declared early, yet escalation is tonal (density of whispers) not causal. No option narrows; no price is extracted. Situational pressure ok, but without beat-level trade-off the promised “before bodies” clock feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of inheritable fiction versus lived peril emerges implicitly through father-son motif and lattice that “sustains impossibilities.” Final image flirts with reweighting but stops short of concrete cost, leaving ambiguity pleasant yet unsubstantial. No moralizing, but also no piercing after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers invitingly between detachment and sensuous registering of textures. Rhythm lilts, diction favors salt-soaked consonants; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal, perceptual signature consistent. Slight poetic overwrite in “copperlight repose”/“specter” clusters drifts toward ornament, not Voice-as-character under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is melodic, yet paraphrase loops echo (“boy felt… boy felt… boy knew…”), thinning density. Some metaphor strata mix (specter + lattice + thread) without taught pattern, risking incoherence. Momentum breathes more than propels; scaffolding like “he began to notice” could be trimmed. Clean grammar and spatial tracking keep clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Werewolf-less “cry-wolf” heir entering confessional-lattice prison is fresh angle; father’s liar legacy repurposed as vocation to “thread labyrinth” intrigues. Texture relies on gothic sea-prison tropes minus idiosyncratic rule twist; danger feels familiar. Conceptual risk taken with lyric drift, but payoff deferred off-page, muting inevitability.</comment>
