<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s desire to “unify fragmented truths” is declared early but never tested by an opposing force; she drifts through the temple without a visible cost or contradiction. The dictionary is handled, yet its use stays ornamental—no beat turns on a discovered definition. Interiority leans on lyric labels (“cosmic harmony,” “stillness at the heart of turmoil”) rather than embodied tension. Earned stasis is gestured at but not dramatized; the closing “new path forward” is asserted, not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure reaches for Charged Poise: Aria re-enters the echoing hall having “unified” self and cosmos. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of hush and image builds to a final cadence shift. Cost, however, is only poetic (“the cosmos sang a new song”); no concrete constraint or forfeiture is locked to the beat. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the middle third repeats atmospheric variations without tightening options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The temple library is sketched with selective, sensory strokes—“aged parchment,” “shelves like sentinels”—that feed the hush-tone. Spatial anchors stay stable; the dictionary’s tactile presence functions as micro-setting. Environment never actively obstructs or resource Aria; it mirrors mood rather than shaping tactics. Thus the 9+ gate (constraint charging the final image) is missed, but the atmosphere remains coherent and evocative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are announced—“unify the fragmented truths”—yet never narrow to a single irreversible choice. Pressure plateaus; each paragraph re-describes the same stillness instead of escalating risk or deepening knowledge. The “universe’s hiccup” is atmospheric, not a clock that forecloses options. No visible price is extracted from Aria, so the tightening required for 8.0+ never arrives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Theme of cosmic unity emerges through recurring images of silence and spiral motion, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext relies on lyric accumulation rather than dramatic irony or gesture. The final “resounding hush” reweights earlier hush-motifs, but because no concrete sacrifice is legible, the conceptual cost feels abstract. Ambiguity is present yet not haunting; the insight borders on consolation rather than reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—attention to scent, shelf-shadows, page-texture. Syntax is rhythmic, with purposeful cadence shifts that mirror Aria’s inward/outward motion. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is uncontested. Register stays elevated but remains tethered to the temple’s timeless ambience; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid but leans on abstract nouns (“discord,” “illusions,” “harmony”) that dilute sensory immediacy. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same stillness (“silence around her grew, a resounding hush that enveloped the world”)—minor loop, −0.2. Figurative language stays coherent; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor the tone, yet mid-section density drops when imagery repeats without new information.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Combining “end-of-history witness” with “softcover dictionary” is fresh, but the concepts stay symbolic; they do not collide in an unexpected plot turn. Spiral arbitration is named, not dramatized in a rule-based twist. Risk is aesthetic (lyric meditation) rather than structural; the piece avoids gimmickry yet also avoids surprise. Specificity resides in atmosphere, not in event invention—hence memorable voice but modest ingenuity.</comment>
