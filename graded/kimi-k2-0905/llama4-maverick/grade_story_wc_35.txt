<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s gift and healing motive are vivid, but the “sandpaper rough memories” drive stays abstract—no concrete moment where her palette rejects or distorts a dish under memory-load. The interiority loops in place (“turmoil in her mind” repeated) rather than crystallizing a contradictory impulse. Her final stance is a quiet Earned Stasis, yet the cost (what she forfeits or can never taste again) is never specified on-page, blunting the arc’s edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Accumulative/Textural Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion tide subsides and Elara’s stance crystallizes with peace. Orientation is clean; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. Causality is lyric-pattern rather than because/therefore; the tidal pool → pavilion drift is coherent under the dream lens. Cost is felt but diffuse—“the memories would always be there”—without a pinpoint image or forfeiture, so the price reads conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sandstone, ozone, wet earth, blooming night flowers—selective sensory triangulation keeps the desert breathing. The coral pavilion’s cold glow and the tidal pool star-reflections serve as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: feet sink → pool kneel → pavilion touch. Environment never constrains a tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere is integral to the lyric escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>Stakes are singular: smooth stored remorse before it drowns her. Pressure escalates once, when coral touch floods her with pavilion sorrow; options narrow to endure or be overwhelmed. Agency is endurance, not action; the tightening is emotional density rather than external obstacle. Cost is implied, not tactile—no forfeited dish, no ruined palate—so the escalation stays internal and mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the palate-gift metaphor: healing others by ingesting their pain. Subtext is strongest in the tidal-pool mirror—“even in the desert, the ocean’s presence was still felt”—linking memory to tidal return. No late moralizing; the final line’s “resolute” fortress reprises resilience without sermon. The concept is coherent but not deeply surprising; the image set is tight, yet the thematic reweighting is gentle rather than revelatory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent, slightly elevated register suited to fable. Perceptual signature is culinary-tactile: “flavors of the past danced on her palate,” “hands moving with a precision that belied the turmoil.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for dunes, staccato when coral memories hit—showing control under pressure; speculative elision (“at the close of an unspoken dream”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with sentence-length variance and purposeful paragraph breaks. Figurative language is dense—every sentence carries image—yet pattern is taught and coherent, escaping purple-prose penalty. One paraphrase loop: “memories swirling within her” echoes “memories that had been stored within the pavilion” within four lines (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffolding does not dull the final image, keeping the score in solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The memory-tasting chef is fresh; pairing it with a coral remorse-repository under dunes is an unexpected synthesis. Concept follows implications—touch contagion, tidal pattern reading—without retreating to safer ground. Desert fortress + icebound pavilion is a bold environmental collision that feels inevitable in hindsight. Execution risk is moderate; the lyric voice sells the fantastical logic, though the emotional calculus remains familiar (healer absorbs pain).</comment>
