<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tutor’s gently probing patience is consistent, but the student’s interiority stays generic (“eyes sparkled,” “shiver run down spine”), never showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro-choices are mostly tea-sipping and seal-handling without visible trade-offs; the final gift feels tender yet pre-ordained rather than earned through costly action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear—borrowed sugar → weekly lessons → meteor climax → seal transfer—and orientation anchors within 120 words. Closure lands as soft Conceptual Repricing: the seal now glows with shared “agreed-upon lies,” a legible before/after for the student. Cost is present (tutor relinquishes heirloom, student accepts worldview shift) but muted; no persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly filtered through the tutor’s biased attention—city hum, flower scent, starlight as pedagogical spotlight. Antique seal functions as micro-setting, handled in multiple beats and charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; no object drift. Meets 9+ gate: the seal constrains the parting gesture and reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single stake—student’s desire to decode “language of old buildings”—is declared early but never faces an on-page test or narrowing. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Escalation is lyrical accumulation under meteor glow rather than causal tightening; acceptable under Accumulative lens yet remains low-impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “agreed-upon lies” emerges through the seal’s transfer rather than exposition, inviting reflection on history as shared fiction. Subtext stays in gesture (handing over the seal under falling stars) without final-paragraph sermon. Ambiguity is modest but present; resonance would sharpen if the student faced a concrete consequence for believing the lie.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close to tutor maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholarly, antiquarian, attentive to texture of carved jade and city hum. Rhythm breathes with lesson cadence; no head-hopping. Diction skews literary yet stays within tutor’s plausible lexicon; occasional elevated phrasing (“mysterious familiarity”) reads intentional rather than register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, varied, and read-aloud smooth; sentences pull double duty (e.g., “meteor shower above them cast a magical glow, as if the stars themselves were illuminating the secrets”). No loops, mixed metaphor, or scaffold. One paraphrase hiccup—“secrets they hold” repeats twice in adjacent lines—drops score a hair.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: dead-language tutor teaching “language of buildings” via antique seal under meteor shower. Specificity of rooftop garden and cultural lie concept elevates trope. Yet core arc—wise elder passes talisman to eager pupil—remains recognizable; risk is modest. Synthesis feels inevitable but not startling.</comment>
