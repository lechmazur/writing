<comment>Kael’s longing to belong is vivid and embodied, but the arc is narrated rather than dramatized; the decisive moment of acceptance is summarized in a communal hug rather than shown through a micro-choice that costs something on the page. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“luminescent ache”) instead of sensory contradiction under pressure. The flaw never complicates the outcome—once the tag is found, belonging is unconditionally granted—so the turn feels smoothed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is present—Kael’s ache transmutes into peace as the community embraces the arbor—but the cost is declarative (“for the first time, Kael felt truly connected”) rather than visibly paid. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the search accumulates evidence of kinship until the emotional valence flips. Because the final beat is summarized, the reweighting is felt only at narrator-distance, not through an image or action that crystallizes the trade-off. The piece meets the 8.8 gate for clarity but not for on-page cost.</comment>

<comment>Crystalline orchard and shimmering crater are anchored early; the obsidian arbor later constrains choice when Kael decides to embed the street-tag symbol into its lattice, so the object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—glow, scent, hum—and filtered through Kael’s sculptor-eye. Spatial choreography stays clean as the pair move between trees. The setting subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and tightens when the tag is discovered, but the tightening is emotional rather than tactical: no live option is foreclosed, and the community’s acceptance is unconditional. Escalation is textural: each glimmering tree adds evidence that Kael is already enmeshed. A visible price (time, risk, social capital) never materializes; the ache simply evaporates. Thus the required cost-legibility for 8.8+ is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of kinship emerges through the arbor-as-web image and the tag-as-proof motif; no character articulates a thesis. The final image—moonlit orchard hosting the arbor—offers a quiet reconfiguration rather than a moral. Ambiguity is present: the community’s ready embrace could read as utopian or gently ironic, but the text leans earnest. The arbor’s recurrence does constrain Kael’s final act, so the motif earns its resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Kael’s sculptor perception; diction—“glimmering,” “webs,” “graft”—is consistent and particular. Rhythm breathes with longer cadences in calmer moments, then shortens during the find. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is avoided. The only POV slip is one clause implying Lyra’s interior (“Lyra suddenly stopped and pointed…”), but it is fleeting and does not break the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with high information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor overwriting in the mid-section (“luminescent ache… webs of kinship… glimmering obsidian”) risks purple, but the pattern is taught early and pays off at closure, so the artifact is allowable. The final line lands with image, not explanation, preserving momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—sculptor carves kinship into obsidian arbor—feels fresh, yet the plot arc (lonely artist finds community through art) is familiar. Specificity of marsh-reed technique and crystalline orchard prevents generic overlay. The street-artist tag twist is a small but effective inflection that fuses outsider art with communal myth. Overall, a thoughtful synthesis rather than a bold subversion, keeping the score mid-high.</comment>
