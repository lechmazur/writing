<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>Oracle is a label, not a person. No contradictory impulses, no micro-choice under pressure, no embodied emotion—just abstract self-mythologizing. The stranger is a silent prop; status flatlines. Closure line restates premise without cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens declared but pattern never taught; same cadence recycles “open secrets / new key” without deepening. No decisive change or felt cost—final smile is pure sentiment. Lighthouse and microdot remain ornamental; neither constrains final choice nor reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.4</grade>
<comment>Visual cliché stack: “beam slicing darkness,” “air thick with otherworldly energy.” Lighthouse geography absent—no stairs, lens room, island footprint. Microdot never handled; wooden box never opened. Setting fails 9+ gate: no object or place constrains choice or charges last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade>
<comment>No stake is ever tested; “life transposed into a new key” stays metaphorical. No visible price, no narrowing of options—Oracle drifts from tavern to lighthouse to desk without obstacle. Stranger’s arrival is pure coincidence; conversation loops on theme instead of forcing decision.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>2.7</grade>
<comment>Theme declared, not dramatized: “open secrets” repeated like a prompt rubric. No subtext in gesture or silence; final paragraph sermonizes. Insight never earned from event—Oracle already knows everything, so reader learns nothing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient floats above POV; no perceptual signature beyond purple filter. “Accidentally prophetic nature stirred” is diagnostic label-speak. Rhythm clogs on stacked appositives: “a puzzle wrapped in a mystery, as they wove a narrative that drew the stranger in.”</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>3.5</grade>
<comment>Paraphrase loops every paragraph—“mysterious lighthouse… secrets and whispers… mysterious stranger… mysterious lighthouse.” Metaphors contradict: beam both “slices” and “drips.” Template cadence: every sentence opens abstract noun + passive verb + prepositional phrase.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>3.0</grade>
<comment>Fortune-writer + microdot + lighthouse is clever mash-up, but none are transformed beyond named roles. Conceptual payload exactly equals prompt list—no risk, no inversion. Swap any noir prop in and story proceeds unchanged.</comment>
