<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward self-diagnosis (“she was in the midst of the unlearning”). The mandala work supplies embodied micro-choices, yet the final smile feels tidy; cost is asserted, not dramatized. Social perceptiveness stays observational—never complicates action—so the trait remains decorative. Still, the contradiction between control and surrender is credibly sustained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pattern density (mandala, mist, whisper cadence) tightens until the lilac light bath re-weights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of “ready to explore”—with conceptual cost (certainties shed). No orientation debt; transitions are implicit mist seepage. One scaffold loop (“world that was slowly coming into focus”) repeats but does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Whispering grotto is more atmosphere than concrete constraint, yet the tile flake micro-setting charges the ending via warmth talisman. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (whispers, susurrus) over visual, matching POV bias toward listening. Spatial choreography is clean: flake drifts, mist curls, artist remains cross-legged. Setting evolves causally—mist recedes only after mandala completes—so environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find meaning in mess. Pressure escalates texturally—each sand grain adds density—but no lived option is foreclosed; the artist could walk away at any moment. Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) rather than tactical; no credible loss of time, stamina, tool. Agency is attention-only, sufficient for Accumulative lens but below 8.8 threshold that demands visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—meaning emerges through attentive surrender—stays implicit, carried by mandala/mist parallelism. Lilac unease and “listen deeply” tile reprice the premise without moralizing. Wisdom is earned via tactile particulars, not platitudes. Ambiguity lingers: is the hush comfort or warning? Resonant but not piercingly fresh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains rhythmic control: echoing w- and s-sounds replicate hush. Perceptual signature is painterly—color, swirl, grain—never generic. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse and rhythm-motivated. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; interior diction stays within artist’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts track mandala phases. One paraphrase loop (“world… coming into focus”) repeated; no mixed metaphors. Density high without purple overload; sand, mist, whisper vehicles stay coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Minor scaffold but nothing obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Tibetan mandala + whispering gallery is fresh yet feels organic. Lilac unease avoids color cliché by tying to tonal effect. Risk-taking is quiet—no plot twist—but conceptual gamble (entire story = internal unlearning) pays off. Not transformative enough for 8.5+ band, but specificity lifts it above template.</comment>
