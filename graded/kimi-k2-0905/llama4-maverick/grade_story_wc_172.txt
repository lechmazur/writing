<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The “amoral philanthropist” is sketched only through externalized label and one sentimental token; interiority is abstract (“felt a pang of sentimentality”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices—walking, clutching, releasing water—are present but linear, never forcing a trade-off that shows amorality colliding with sentiment. No credible cost or visible flaw complicates her success, so the arc feels smoothed rather than earned. The egg functions as a prop but her psyche remains undisturbed, keeping characterization functional yet replaceable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored floodwaters and echoed birds reweight the salt flat from wasteland to living ecosystem with conceptual cost—she vanishes into the storm, leaving her morality untested. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each crack → river path → released water, tight under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; map/egg anchors taught by line 6. One meaningful deepening: the lull before thunder becomes the ticking clock that triggers release. Cost is legible in the final image of her disappearance, though price feels conceptual rather than personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Salt-flat micro-setting directly shapes tactics: cracks = map, cracked earth = audible crunch that times her steps. Sensory selection is urgent—dry earth scent, thunder timbre—filtered through her project-manager gaze. Weather transitions from lull to deluge, guiding the decisive release; environment evolves causally with action. Final image of water lapping newly made shore recharges the opening barren vista, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore life vs. powerful drought interests—is declared early; pressure heightens once as thunder’s lull tightens the release window. Agency is the single gesture of opening sluice/berm using the crack-map; no visible opposition or resource loss, so cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is poetic density—storm swell, egg fragility, cracked lines—rather than option-narrowing. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode, but lacks a tangible price that forecloses future moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ecological resurrection versus capitalist drought, refracted through a lone operator who hoards sentiment inside amorality. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via the extinct egg, cracked map, and returning bird echo. Final image of vanished benefactor leaves morally ambiguous aftertaste, inviting reflection on whether restoration absolves extraction. Avoids tidy moral, achieving resonance through concrete particulars rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance, perceptual signature filtered through her engineer-like attention to cracks, thunder intervals, and object weights. Syntax grows breathless only in the release beat, mirroring water rush; diction stays precise, avoiding purple drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interiority—occasionally abstract but never ventriloquising external minds. Filter verbs minimal; rhythm controlled, taught pattern of fracture/echo paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with storm timing. Occasional elevated phrasing (“fractured grace,” “palimpsest of drought”) flirts with register drift but stays within lyric allowance. No scaffold loops; information dense—each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors coherent; only minor near-repetition of “cracked” could trim 0.1, but closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Combines climate-revenge fantasy with sentimental artifact is fresh for flash length; trope of mysterious benefactor is not subverted but re-contextualized through ecological engineering. Specificity of crack-map as literal guide gives concrete twist to familiar drought-restoration plot. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over causal thriller—yet coherence holds. Could edge higher if amorality had bitten her visibly; as is, transformation feels scenic rather than psychological.</comment>
