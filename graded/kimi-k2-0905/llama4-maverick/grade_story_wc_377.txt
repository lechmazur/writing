<comment>Aria is sketched only by vocational label and serene acceptance; no interior contradiction or embodied cost accompanies her decision to embed the fragment. The “muted vigor” of the bluff folk remains an abstraction—no individual choices or stakes appear on the page—so the collective reaction feels decorative rather than dramatic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sculpture becomes the bluff’s new transmitter, crystallizing the post-verbal era with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds: each seasonal paragraph thickens texture until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift and the mosaic pattern is taught early, but the price is more declarative than viscerally felt.</comment>

<comment>The bluff above clouds, the kinetic sculpture, and the iceberg fragment form a single charged micro-setting that constrains the final image; their spatial and sensory relations remain coherent. Selective, POV-filtered detail (glistening crystal, rainbow refraction) is woven through action rather than catalogued, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the bluff’s shift from silence to heart-language—is signaled early; escalation arrives via density increase, not causal turns. The final image reweights the stake, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping pressure just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively through the accumulating imagery of resonance, color, and muteness; no explicit thesis is stated. The closing image of the sculpture as eternal beacon reconfigures prior material, offering a non-literal answer to the question of how truth survives language’s end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric-omniscient voice sustains a consistent cadence and perceptual signature—selective attention to light, vibration, and seasonal hush. Patterned repetition (“As the seasons passed… As the winds howled…”) is taught early and pays off in the final incantatory paragraph, keeping prose legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is spare and purposeful, avoiding purple swell. High information density—each sentence advances image, time, or concept—gives the piece forward motion despite its meditative surface.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing a seasonally mute cliff community with a post-verbal resonant sculpture feels fresh, yet the beat structure follows a predictable seasonal montage pattern. The iceberg fragment’s rainbow optics and the “symphonies of truth” concept are evocative, but their development remains within familiar mystic-ecological territory rather than forging a startling new angle.</comment>
