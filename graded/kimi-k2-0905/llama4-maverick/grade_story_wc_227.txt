<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kaelin’s desperation and half-breath stamina are vividly embodied; the mentor-charm memory loops, however, recycle the same beat three times without new contradiction, blunting interior depth. The final collapse is earned by prior oxygen drain, but her “uncertain alchemist” label is never tested by an actual mistake or doubt—she succeeds too smoothly. Micro-choices are present yet narrow; no visible flaw complicates the pattern-matching, so the crucible feels competent rather than genuinely perilous.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed pattern reweights the statue into a map, the acid sea still foaming beneath, cost felt in her near-drowning. Causal linkage holds—each parchment match narrows oxygen further—yet the midpoint mentor flashback is a 70-word unmotivated ellipse that halts pressure. Orientation is clear by line 10; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, density tightening toward the final image without contradiction. Persistent constraint (lung-time) shapes every tactic; the charm’s glow is a harmless echo, not a causal prop.</comment>

<comment>The acid-sea workshop is sensuously tactile—creaking struts, foaming green below, grime on parchment—yet never constrains a specific tactical choice; the same task could occur on dry land. Micro-setting succeeds: the statue’s pockmarks and the rabbit-foot charm are handled, turned, weighed, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no continuity drift. Weather and scale remain atmospheric backdrop rather than active obstacle, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode statue or suffocate—is signaled early; oxygen debt provides a live countdown. Tightening is single-track: each match burns air, but no reversal or trade-off complicates the path; success is linear. Cost is visceral (near blackout) yet predictable; the absence of an error or pattern mis-match flattens escalation. Under Accumulative lens, density increase is sufficient, but option-foreclosure never surprises.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of salvage-beauty emerges organically from the kintsugi motif and acid-sea rot; no explicit moral is stated. The final image—girl gasping beneath still-churning toxic waves—reweights the premise: meaning is mined from wreckage, but the world stays lethal. Ambiguity lingers—will the map save anyone?—yet the piece avoids tidy triumph. Mentor memories quilted in repetition risk thematic echo, slightly dulling resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, oxygen-starved, synesthetic: “words spilling from her lips like a prayer.” Rhythm compresses toward the blackout, clauses shortening, no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within an alchemist’s lexicon—parchments, pockmarks, gears-and-cogs—without thesaurus drift. The repeated “quilted together” phrase is the only noticeable template cadence, a minor artifact. Perceptual signature is strong: attention narrows to texture, temperature, ticking lungs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is excellent; no two openings repeat. Figurative language is selective—acid sea, quilted memories—never stacked in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop exists: “the workshop creaked and groaned / the workshop creaked and groaned around her” two paragraphs apart (−0.2). Information density high; each line advances breath, pattern, or memory. Grammar clean; no simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—kintsugi alchemy on a toxic floating forge—is fresh, not a stock trope. The statue-as-map twist is seeded early via pockmark matching, hence earned. Risk is moderate: single-scene, single stakes, but oxygen clock and acid sea heighten vulnerability. Specific detail (gem-studded rabbit foot, yellowed parchments) prevents generic transplant. Could swap “acid sea” for “desert” with only cosmetic edits, limiting top-band entry.</comment>
