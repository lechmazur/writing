<comment>Kael’s “wannabe philosopher” tag is shown more than told—he pores over tattered texts, digs until his hands blister, and keeps the cog like a relic—but the interiority leans on stock abstractions (“competing narratives,” “hubris and consequence”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. No second character appears, so status crucible is off the table; the sole pressure is self-imposed obsession. The arc is Earned Stasis—he renounces the surface world with a “wry smile” in the sewer—yet the cost is asserted (“he would never be content”) rather than dramatized. Contradictory impulses are declared, not enacted in scene, keeping the portrait vivid but not fully lived-in.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the final image of Kael smiling in darkness crystallizes his renunciation (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost—he forfeits rebuilding for obsessive excavation. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: layers of ruin, cog, and text density reweight his stance rather than plot turns. Orientation is anchored by word 45 (“Kael huddled in the dimly lit sewer”), satisfying the single-scene window. The lens holds, but the cost is felt more abstractly than viscerally, capping the score below 8.</comment>

<comment>Setting is the sewer’s rot, the sunken city’s “watery grave,” and the micro-setting of the cog—all filtering through Kael’s alienated gaze. Sensory selection favors smell and tactile decay; visual detail is selective (“detritus,” “waterlogged tomb of steel and stone”). The cog functions as micro-setting, handled in two beats and recharged in the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent; no impossible moves. City scale is evoked by implication rather than catalog, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is cognitive: reconcile competing narratives of collapse. Pressure intensifies only rhetorically—“he began to agonize,” “jumble of competing narratives”—without on-page narrowing of options or tangible loss. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the tightening is purely rhetorical escalation. Closure qualifies as stance crystallization, but the lack of visible price keeps escalation muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: knowledge-preservation as perverse salvation after civilizational failure. Subtext resides in the cog’s reprise—once a timekeeper, now a relic of timeless ruin—reweighting “ancient methods” as both futile and vital. No overt moralizing; final smile invites ambiguity. The concept stays particular to Kael’s obsession rather than drifting into generic aphorism, though the echo of “competing narratives” edges close to Thematic Echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a dense, clotted syntax that mirrors claustrophobic sewer air and Kael’s spiraling intellect. Perceptual signature is strong: metaphors of sediment, maelstrom, and “abrasive calm” recur with purpose. Distance stays tight in third-person limited; no head-hops. Dialogue is absent, fitting the solitary frame. Occasional elevated diction (“transience of human endeavor”) slightly overshoots Kael’s likely lexicon but reads as his internal philosophizing rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled: long sentences堆叠to mimic obsessive recursion, then snap to short fragments (“He would preserve…”) at closure. Loop check reveals two near-paraphrase clusters—“competing narratives” thrice, “rationally rebellious” twice—costing −0.3. Metaphors stay coherent (rot, sediment, time). No scaffold sentences; information density is high. Final line lands cleanly without clutter, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The post-plaque sewer-scholar premise is fresh, avoiding zombie tropes for epistemic scavenging. Cog-as-talisman repurposes a mundane gear into temporal emblem without feeling gimmicked. Risk is quiet—no plot twists, only cognitive entrenchment—but the commitment to interior excavation feels authentic. Transformation test passes: Kael’s arc depends on his specific refusal of rebuilding, not interchangeable angst.</comment>
