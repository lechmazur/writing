<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s “odd historian” label is shown more than told—her fingers “itch to probe,” she spends “years collecting,” and her method is “painstaking.” Interiority is concrete (“bronze quiet” inside her) and embodied. Yet the only micro-choice on-page is to lift and store the tapestry fragment; the diaries are read, not used to alter tactics. No contradictory impulse or visible cost forecloses a path; the closure is a quiet smile, not an earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of atmospheric density increases until the final “bronze quiet” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tapestry safely stored, the silo’s whispers acknowledged—felt cost is the lingering scent of dust that will draw her back. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3. No causal break, but the escalation is ambient rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The silo library is rendered through tactile specificity: “weathered walls bearing scars,” “narrow windows,” “scent of old books and dust.” Micro-setting (tapestry fragment) constrains her attention and re-appears in the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors her historian’s bias: visual threads shimmer, olfactory dust transports. The setting evolves causally: longer shadows mark elapsed time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the silo’s secrets—signals early and tightens once: illegible final diary entry halts reconstruction. No visible price paid (time spent is abstract; no tool breaks). Escalation is accretive: each artifact adds atmospheric density rather than foreclosing options. Agency is observational; the only narrowing is the diary’s charred gap, which feels logistical, not costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: history as haunting palimpsest, stories as living dust. Subtext resides in the dragons’ displaced gaze—hint that interpretation itself is skewed. No explicit moral; resonance is the sensual after-image of “bronze quiet” inside her. Avoids lecture, but the tapestry’s hinted “key” never perturbs choices, so thematic charge is ambient rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect third stays close to Emilia’s perceptual filter: “bronze quiet” is idiom particular to her historian’s temperament. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under tactile discovery (“fingers itched”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Psychic distance modulates: wide for silo history, tight for tapestry shimmer. Register stable—no academic jargon intrudes. Final image’s “whispers” belong to the walls, not authorial overlay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for archival awe, shorter pulses for discovery. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“fabric…alive”). One paraphrase loop: “stories that walls had heard” repeated with slight variation; no clarity harm. No scaffold, no synonym churn. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the dust/whisper motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: post-dream world where history is sensual residue, not data. Tapestry dragons’ displaced axis offers oblique mystery rather than fantasy MacGuffin. Risk is lyric accumulation rather than plot twist; pattern is taught early and paid off in final “bronze quiet.” Not radically novel, but specificity of scent and hush feels particular to this silo, not generic archive.</comment>
