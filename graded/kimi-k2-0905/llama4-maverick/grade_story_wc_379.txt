<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Emilia’s interiority is thin; the “discerning curator” label never alters her micro-choices in-scene. She watches and asks, but no contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her actions; the decision to display the locket feels like a default rather than a pressured renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft CR—the note “To those who listen” reweights the locket’s meaning—but the absence of any felt cost to Emilia keeps it shy of Resonant Reconfiguration. The mailbox mystery resolves off-stage via the writer’s confession; the because-chain between Emilia’s investigation and the emotional payoff is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The courtyard’s “gentle hum” and birds function as postcard backdrop; no spatial constraint or tool alters Emilia’s tactics. The locket acts as micro-setting, but its handling is static—opened once, then shelved—so it never charges the final image under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—“prove listening heals” is declared, never tested by a beat where failure costs her anything. Pressure plateaus after the mailbox spill; Emilia’s reading binge is summarized, so the dominant stake neither tightens nor forces a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly—listening as communal balm—but the final sentence trumpets it overtly, trimming resonance. The locket’s reprise in the display case offers a modest image-based echo, yet the absence of any character stakes keeps the aftereffect polite rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person lens stays stable, but diction slips into editorial uplift (“the story it held within”) that outruns Emilia’s perceptual range. No rhythmic signature distinguishes her noticing from the narrator’s, so voice texture feels default rather than character-sculpted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Repeated abstract couplings—“the courtyard’s tranquility was disrupted… maintained”—create paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Stock phrasing (“inexplicable connection,” “sense of calm wash over her”) clusters in the closing beats, obscuring the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mystery-via-antique-objet and anonymous-letter tropes are familiar; the writer-recluse reveal adds mild novelty but arrives via summary rather than a turn earned by Emilia’s ingenuity. The “sandstorm calm” metaphor is fresh yet under-deployed, never repurposed to charge the ending.</comment>
