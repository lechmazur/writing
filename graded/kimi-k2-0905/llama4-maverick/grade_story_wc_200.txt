<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Collector’s calm competence is sketched through action, but the “modestly fearless” label is repeated instead of tested; no contradictory impulse or visible cost accompanies the hand-off, so the ending feels benevolent rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain holds: spot → approach → listen → release; closure lands with Charged Poise as the harp fades and the tooth is left behind, a felt relic of the exchange. Orientation is swift, lens stays causal, cost is legible in the lingering “luminous ache.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mist, waterfall, harp reverb, and the tooth’s glint are filtered through the collector’s practiced eye; Echo Gorge acts as acoustic amplifier that shapes both tactic (follow the sound) and closure (fading echo). Micro-setting (tooth-in-hand) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes are intimate—one soul’s release—but escalation is flat; no live alternative path is foreclosed, no price exacted from the collector. Pressure exists but never tightens; the beat is ritual, not reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of finding light inside loss emerges through the tooth’s humble souvenir and the counter-hum lullaby, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image of “luminous ache” reweights prior whispers into quiet radiance, though ambiguity is mild.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to collector perception; syntax lengthens and softens during the lullaby, mirroring calming breath. No head-hop, no filter clutter; diction remains restrained and other-worldly, a consistent spectral register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional adjective stacks (“luminous ache,” “modestly fearless”) flirt with overwriting but recur as motifs. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; final paragraph breathes without deflating momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Soul-collector trope is refreshed by acoustic geography and the crocodile-tooth keepsake, a quirky, specific anchor. Risk is modest—formulaic benevolent guide—but sensory palette and humble relic lift it above generic after-life fare.</comment>
