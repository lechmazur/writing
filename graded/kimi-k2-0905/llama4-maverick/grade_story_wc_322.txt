<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The “fever dream architect” is more concept than person; interiority is poetic but abstract (“mind was consumed by the concept of rational enchantment”) rather than dramatized via concrete contradiction or embodied emotion. She makes no true micro-choice under pressure—only passive observation and weaving—so the promised arc of discovery lands as narration, not earned change. Cost is asserted (“unsettling calm”) but not paid on the page. Voice remains consistent, but the character never risks or forfeits anything tangible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is present as a Charged Poise: the final image of the thread trailing like an “umbilical cord” reweights the premise, making the gallery a living pattern she can re-enter. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. Causality, however, is weak—gallery reacts because “she wove,” not because a prior choice forced a narrowing. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and color swell, but no persistent constraint shapes tactics. Cost is felt but conceptual rather than tactical, keeping the ending lyric, not decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Gallery anchors every beat; mirrored walls and pulsing thread supply instant sensory filter and micro-setting. Selective detail—“old glass,” “soft hum,” “kaleidoscope turning”—keeps exposition lean and mood forward. The thread as handled prop constrains her final stance, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is lightly tracked; no impossible moves, but no tight body-to-body pressure either.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of connection” between rational and enchanting—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete resource is risked or forfeited. Escalation is tonal (color riot) rather than tactical; options do not narrow. Agency is contemplative; she endures wonder rather than testing commitment. Cost is atmospheric, not visibilized, so pressure plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: rational mind seeking pattern inside illusion, finding unity without dissolving it. Final image of thread-as-lifeline reprises opening motif, reweighting “rational enchantment” as lived tether rather than paradox. No moral is stated; resonance is imagistic. The concept stays specific to this voice; avoids pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third lyric-omniscient stays close to her perceptual filter: “sinew thread…seemed to pulse with a life of its own.” Syntax is rhythmic, fevered, yet controlled; no head-hop. Diction—“sinew,” “kaleidoscope,” “umbilical cord”—is precise and thematically tight. No dialogue to test; internal voice sustains distinct texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative runs are patterned early (“ever-shifting landscape”) so density feels earned, not purple. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or cadence. Minor simultaneity slips (“as she walked, the exhibits began to erupt”) but timeline stays legible. Final line lands clean, recharging “pattern” and “thread” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Premise—architect mapping wonder onto optical illusions via living thread—is fresh synthesis, not stock trope. Accumulation design rather than causal twist risks familiarity, but the lyric reprise saves it from gimmick. Specificity of “sinew thread” as biological/artifact hybrid keeps image memorable. Risk is moderate; concept commits fully, no retreat to safety.</comment>
