<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority drifts into workshop-speak (“seeking to rebuild a connection,” “sense of responsibility to honor their memory”) instead of embodied contradiction; no moment shows her wanting to quit yet staying. The sundial is finger-traced three times with identical emotional summary, flattening hierarchy of values. Faith-restoration motive is declared repeatedly but never collides with a counter-desire on the page; thus the final “cautious enchantment” feels bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The piece runs on lyrical accumulation; tension plateaus after the first burial metaphor instead of narrowing options. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the revealed tomb re-weights her belonging—but the cost is moral/philosophical rather than felt, so the resonance is mild. Because the lens holds and the final image recalls the opening, I waive severe penalty, yet the lack of a live trade-off caps the score below 7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is vividly seeded early and lingers as micro-setting: roots snag her boots, bones trip the trowel, canopy dapple alters digging pace. These tactile constraints shape the meditation beats, satisfying the 9+ gate. However, spatial anchoring never clarifies depth or entry exit points; we lose track of where sundial sits relative to the main chamber, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ancestral reconnection—is clear, but pressure is static: each paragraph restates the same emotional gain without new obstacle or forfeiture. The “tomb” offers wonder, not resistance; no credible loss of time, tool, or social credit complicates tactics. Escalation is therefore atmospheric, not functional, capping score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of re-rooting emerges organically from burial imagery; no moral sermon intrudes. The sundial’s recurrence could re-price time/heritage but returns only as pictorial echo, muting resonance. Still, particulars resist tidy closure, inviting plausible counter-readings, hence low-6 band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, reverent cadence that matches “cautious enchantment.” Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she began to feel”) dilate psychic distance during peak discoveries; trimming one per beat would sharpen immediacy. Otherwise, diction remains within Maya’s contemplative register and creates a consistent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openers vary, paragraphs breathe. Two adjacent “as she worked” sentences create a light paraphrase loop (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or purple clusters; however, repeated “sense of… growing within her” template dulls final third, preventing 7+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard is a fresh synthesis of necropolis and grove, generating visceral images. Interrupted journeys motif stays thematic, never weaponized as plot engine, so originality is local not structural. Risk is moderate; concept commits fully, avoiding safety-middle, meriting upper-6 score.</comment>
