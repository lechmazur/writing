<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The herder’s motivation is legible—ancestral duty and cosmic curiosity—but remains abstract; no interior contradiction or bodily cost appears. We never feel the curse as a lived burden (no mis-sensing, no physical price). The moment of completion is reported, not dramatized, so the promised shift in stance lacks embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a vision-delivery that “lifts” the curse: a Conceptual Repricing with faint cosmic cost, satisfying the lens (Accumulative/Textural). Causality is loose—rocks arranged → vision granted—but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting facts. The beat is single-scene, single-POV, within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Salt-ozone-air, aurora palette, and rock-tactile micro-details are selective and filtered through the herder’s gaze. The tidal bluff constrains placement and sight-lines; stardust glint is a charged object. No spatial drift; no static catalogue. Environment is not just backdrop—it supplies the material substrate for the ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode cosmic pattern before reality frays—is declared early, but pressure stays atmospheric, never tightening into a visible trade-off or lost option. The “friction disappears” horizon never becomes a live clock. Agency is present—arranging rocks—but no escalation or narrowing of choices occurs; the climax is revelation, not decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as inheritance and cosmic responsibility—emerges through ritual action rather than statement. The stardust/rock motif reweights at closure, re-pricing the herder’s curse. No moralizing paragraph. Ambiguity lingers: will cosmos now unravel faster? The after-effect is quiet wonder, not profundity, keeping it under 7.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distancing fits the mythic register; diction stays consistent, no head-hop. Rhythm is controlled, with aurora/sea/rock repetitions forming an accumulative cadence. No dialogue to test. Perceptual signature—precise sensory triangulation—remains herder-bound throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. Occasional elevated register (“sacred patterns that governed the universe”) edges toward template cadence but stops short of clutter. No mixed metaphors. Final image is clear. High-band gate remains open; one near-repeat phrase keeps it from 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eel-herder cosmologist is fresh; merging tidal husbandry with star-dust numerology feels non-obvious. Ritual-via-painted-rocks is a novel tech that is both concrete and symbolic. The borrowed-dawn/aurora overlay gives a memorable visual signature. Risk is moderate—lyric myth rather than plot—but specificity keeps it from feeling template.</comment>
