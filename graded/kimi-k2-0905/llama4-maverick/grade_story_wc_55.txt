<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is soft-focused and lyric; the bear is granted near-human motive-telepathy (“seemingly sensing Elian’s introspection”) without dramatized cue. Reflection block ~30% meets BRR exception but flattens present pressure; no contradictory impulse plays out in scene—dream simply re-ignites. Cost is asserted (“not too late”) rather than embodied; renunciation or trade-off absent. Micro-choice hierarchy visible only in silent stillness, but excruciating gentleness never tested against a visible risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via ticking density and petrichor echo; closure is Charged Poise—“harmonize the mechanical with the natural” reweights premise with conceptual cost. Anchor triad delivered by line 4; orientation clear. Lacked causal trigger for bear approach; coincidence allowed under lens but keeps escalation mild. Final image satisfies RR test yet no persistent constraint shapes future tactics; cost is felt but not enacted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clock-tower interior, wet courtyard, and dawn sky rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail; scent and light guide attention. Forecourt crystals return in final image and charge closure; micro-setting (pond ripple) acts as mirror shift. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. 9+ gate missed because no environmental detail actually constrains Elian’s physical choice—he always had free exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconcile precision life with wild dream—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: bear-eye contact re-opens abandoned path. Pressure stays atmospheric; no concrete trade-off forced on page. Escalation is mood-accumulative, not tactic-narrowing; cost remains prospective.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mechanical time vs. natural rhythm. Final crystalline sunrise image re-prices earlier petrichor nostalgia without verbal moral. No thematic echo sentence; complexity accepted. Slight drift toward abstraction in “harmonize the mechanical with the natural” line, but image rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close tightly matched to Elian’s introverted register; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Rhythm mimics soft ticking and glacial hush; sentence length modulates with attention. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop. No dialogue to test. Occasional elevated phrase (“excruciatingly gentle”) risks register drift but reads as intentional motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; scaffolding largely excised. Some metaphor layering (“crystal whispering forecourt,” “glacial hush”) borders on decorative density but supports accumulative lens. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. Final line earns cadence cut. Typo-free; punctuation clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—clock scribe meets bear at dawn—offers fresh angle on time-vs-nature trope. Bear not anthropomorphized beyond one intuition beat; still risks familiar eco-epiphany pattern. Specificity of clock mechanism and rain-crystal forecourt lifts material. No bold structural risk; defaults kept. Transformation present but moderate.</comment>
