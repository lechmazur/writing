<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courtesan’s interior contradiction—poised body vs. suffocating conformity—remains vivid throughout; the bodily poetic trait is not just label but enacted as she sheds “threads.” Her micro-choice to untangle the final thread is credible and scales to length. Emotional embodiment is strong (“weight of a thousand unspoken words”), avoiding therapy-speak. Earned stasis lands: she forecloses the conformist path with felt cost in the prism flash. Minor slip: “radiating a confidence that was both captivating and unnerving” edges into label-speak, blunting the beat slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught by the echo pattern and held to closure. Orientation clean: silver courtyard / snowfall / night anchored in first 50 words. The decisive tightening occurs when the last thread is untangled, releasing harvested echoes; prism glow reweights the rule-set (Conceptual Repricing) with undeniable cost—she is “no longer bound.” Persistent constraint: the prism dims, signaling spent power. One causal micro-gap: how untangling threads physically triggers prism glow is elided, but the lyrical logic is taught early enough to waive as pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (body and prism) constrains every choice; snow and mirror-facets narrow perception to glints and crunch underfoot. Selective sensory triage—cold light, crystalline sound—mirrors internal thaw. Spatial choreography is clean: she stands, raises eyes, steps away; no floating props. Final image recharges setting: courtyard remains, prism now “dimly lit,” making environment cost legible. Weather cliché risk (“delicate flakes danced”) is offset by immediate POV filter and later tactical use of snow-crunch as departure cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom vs. conformity—signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates via density increase: each untangled thread releases real echoes that compress inside the prism. One meaningful tightening at the final thread; options narrow to irreversible change. Cost is visible: prism lights, then dims—power is spent, serenity becomes “alarming.” No coin-flip resolution; her agency drives the unlock. Could push higher if an earlier beat showed a concrete social consequence (lost client? scandal?) rather than abstract “expectation.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: thread / echo / prism motif reweights the meaning of voice vs. lullaby without stating a moral. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—dim prism is silent yet speaks of spent defiance. Avoids overt thesis; “lullaby of conformity” appears once and is dramatized, not sermonized. Complexity honored: loss and promise coexist in “bittersweet harvest.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade><comment>Perceptual signature sustained: narrator notices light fracture, bodily poetics, snow-crunch in character-specific hierarchy. Lyric elision (“a span between sigh and smile”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Syntax modulates: longer coils for entanglement, short fragments for unlock beat. Filter verbs serve voice (“she felt an inexplicable pull”) rather than dull immediacy. Rhythm mirrors arc: dense metaphor early, airier cadence as threads fall.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate; no template cadence runs. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work (“harvest of echoes was a bittersweet thing”). Mixed-metaphor risk in “prism sanctuary” is justified by taught pattern. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “as if” similes could compress, but they occupy low-pressure beat. No artifacts in final third; closure image stays lucid. One typo-grade slip: “bodily poetic form” repeated twice—synonym churn light, −0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><grade><comment>Fusion of chaste courtesan + snow-bound prism + thread/echo mechanics yields fresh angle on familiar self-liberation trope. Specificity anchors risk: 19th-century Asian courtesan vocabulary merged with crystalline optics. Transformation test passes—swap geisha or debutante and the metaphor web collapses. Bold lyric compression at this length is gambit, but coherence holds. Slight deduction for echoing “silver + snow + starlight” palette common in winter-symbol poems; offset by bodily poetics twist.</comment>
