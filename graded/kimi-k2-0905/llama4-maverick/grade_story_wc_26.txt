<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dusk noticer’s interiority is lyrically particular (“luminous regret”) and her tactile attention to the river stone embodies emotion, but she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything; the decision to “share her findings” is declared, not dramatized. Reflection outweighs action (~40%), so the arc feels observed rather than forged under pressure. The flaw is not fatal, yet the absence of a charged, on-page renunciation or risk keeps the characterization just shy of high-band resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers footage, stone, and shadow imagery until the final image reweights the premise (library glow = conceptual repricing of hope). Orientation is swift; causality is looser—her decision to act is summarized, not beat-driven. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost (“the shape of hope was still present”), satisfying the CR test, so the arc coheres even though the turning point is off-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The blooming library is evoked with selective synesthesia (parchment scent, floating shelves, cloud sea) and the river stone micro-setting constrains her grip, anchoring attention. Spatial choreography stays stable; environment mirrors interior states without overt symbol overload. One lapse: “cloud-soft floor” is briefly unclear in materiality, but it never distorts choice. The final image of the glowing library recharges the stake, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-charged closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is declared early; pressure deepens via footage-revealed disconnection and the shadow’s creep. No visible price is exacted from her; the cost remains conceptual (world losing its way) rather than personal loss or foreclosed option. Escalation is textural: density of shadow imagery tightens the mood, but agency stays contemplative. Enough for mid-band, but lacks a beat where hope’s endangerment narrows her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from juxtaposing shared dreams vs. unbound shadow; no final paragraph sermon. The river stone’s luminous regret motif recurs and reweights at closure, tying private grief to collective stakes. Ambiguity is purposeful: shadow as both external force and internal fear. The absence of a dramatized sacrifice keeps the resonance just below the 8.5+ tier where theme must bite the protagonist’s flesh as well as the world’s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: dusk-colored, soft-deliberate, parchment-scented. Syntax lengthens and breathes with contemplative cadence; no head-hopping. Diction stays within plausible noticer lexicon (“tome,” “luminescent orbs”) without academic drift. Occasional template cadence (“the dusk noticer…”) is mild and pattern-taught, not disruptive enough to cap high-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled, sentences varied; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“shadow… spreading tendrils”). Information density high—each line advances atmosphere or insight. Minor scaffold: “softly deliberate” is reused without fresh angle, and “luminous regret” approaches label-speak, but neither artifact touches the closing image. Closure clarity intact, so stays above 7.0 cap for artifact-free final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Shared-dream collective unconscious plus archival footage grief-poem is not a trope cocktail seen daily; the synthesis feels specific, not grafted. The “shadow unbound” as fear-feeder is familiar, yet its anchoring in silent-film micro-expressions refreshes. Risk is taken with lyrical accumulative structure over causal plot; payoff is the glowing library CR. Not radically unprecedented, but the conceptual braid and sensuous specificity lift it into memorable territory.</comment>
