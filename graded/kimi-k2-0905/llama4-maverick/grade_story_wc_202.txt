<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“eternal instant,” “suspended in timeless space”) that tells us she feels awe rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. The remembered vocation “to honor overlooked histories” arrives as summary ten lines before the end, so the final resolve feels imported, not earned through on-page micro-choices. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; her flaw (passive receptivity) is named but never complicates tactics under pressure. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the lens fragment is handled in multiple beats, giving her a concrete tactile drive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lens glows, boundaries blur, and Lena accepts her translator vocation with conceptual cost—she will forever “unfasten anchors.” Causality, however, is loose: the fragment jolts memory, but the leap from souvenir to mission occurs off-stage during reflection. Orientation is clear within 50 words; the single-scene default is met. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the final cadence reweights earlier images, satisfying the RR test, yet the middle beats accumulate atmosphere more than narrowing options, so escalation stays soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rooftop market is evoked with sandalwood, myrrh, whispered secrets—selective sensory triangulation that mirrors Lena’s hushed awe. Spatial choreography remains tidy: vendor stall → painting rack → descent. The lens fragment behaves as micro-setting, constraining her grip and focalizing attention; it also charges the final image when it glows. What keeps this from 8.5 is that the environment never pushes back—no crowding, bargaining, or physical obstacle tests her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—“unfasten the anchors…release the secrets”—but on-page pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. The single meaningful tightening is spotting the tiny figure in the painting; it shifts her attention rather than closing an option. No credible loss (money, social credit, bodily risk) is dramatized, so cost stays conceptual. The lens fragment complicates but never endangers, keeping escalation within the mild band suitable for lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory as civic duty—emerges through the repeated pairing of overlooked paintings and overlooked people. Subtext is strongest in the vendor’s knowing smile and the blurred cliff figure, implying prior translators. The final image of rooftops as “canvas waiting to be filled” offers a resonant non-literal answer, though the insight “honor forgotten tales” is spelled out in the penultimate paragraph, slightly thinning the mystery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice sustains a hush-filigree rhythm, syntactic parallelism (“to unfasten…to release…to weave”) that teaches its incantatory pattern and pays off in the final anaphora. Perceptual signature is sharp: Lena notices “furtive glances” and “crystal facets glinting like a shard of moonlight.” No dialogue, so no register clash; POV distance stays consistently close third. The only wobble is occasional abstraction (“elusively tangible objects”) that dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences flow with deliberate cadence; clauses lengthen then contract to mimic breath-held wonder. Information density is high—each sentence layers scent, sight, or metaphor. Figurative language is coherent and kept from purple excess by concrete nouns (“sand-wood and myrrh,” “shard of moonlight”). A few scaffold phrases (“it was on one such visit that…”) and one synonym loop (“hidden…overlooked…forgotten”) nudge this off 8-plus territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The between-worlds translator who steals a fragment of lighthouse soul to unfasten “anchors of intuition” is a fresh synthesis of metaphysical heist and memory activism. Rooftop alchemist bazaar and living painting micro-figures are particular to this piece. Risk is moderate: lyric repetition and conceptual stakes replace external jeopardy, but coherence holds. The concept does not retreat into safety; it commits fully to its lyric logic.</comment>
