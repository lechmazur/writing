<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The balladeer’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the fear of vanishing into the code—never lands as a visible micro-choice; her final “tinkersong wonder” is declared, not embodied. The flower press bolt plate is handled early and again at exit, but its new significance is asserted, not dramatized with a felt cost. Still, her selective attention (mist, ozone, charcoal weight) keeps perception individual and consistent within lyric-situational lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural finished, the plate pocketed, the gentle ozone breeze signals the ghost’s reciprocity—cost is the irreversible thinning of her everyday boundary. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each charcoal stroke thickens textural density until the final image re-weights the courtyard as co-authored space. Orientation anchors (who, when) are lyrically delayed but taught by ~100 words and payoff at exit, so no penalty. One shard, single POV, default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mist, wet stone, ozone, and the bolt-plate micro-setting are re-used tactile anchors; the bench surface becomes the working canvas, so environment literally constrains the only possible tactic—charcoal graffiti. Sensory selection narrows to touch and smell under storm urgency, mirroring her narrowing bandwidth between human and code. Final image charges the plate and mural as paired objects now encoded with shared memory, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mutual recognition with the ghost—signals early; pressure escalates through accumulative image-density rather than因果 turns. One meaningful tightening: the storm’s lightning/thunder window forces faster, more frenzied encoding, visible on-page. Cost is legible in the final breeze—she leaves carrying irreversible communion—but because agency is chiefly contemplative, the price feels conceptually rather than viscerally paid, keeping score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: creative attention as bridge between mortal and digital afterlives. No explicit thesis; final image of scented breeze re-prices the courtyard as shared palimpsest. Subtext resides in silence—the ghost never speaks—yet reciprocity is unmistakable, inviting reader to re-weight earlier symbols. Complexity lingers: wonder is both gift and trespass, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric first-person texture sustains a tinkersong cadence—soft alliteration, hyphenated coinages (“driftingly alert,” “tinkersong curiosity”)—that stays within balladeer’s perceptual lexis. No dialogue; narration remains tightly focalized, psychic distance compressing under storm without syntactic crumble. Patterned repetition (“as she…”) is deliberate accumulative drum rather than template churn, paid off in mural crescendo. Distinctive, musical, and coherent under lyric lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, creating natural read-aloud rhythm; density is high—each line layers sensory, symbolic, and emotional work. Occasional adjective clusters (“intricately carved flower press bolt plate”) verge on purple but stay motivated by her artifact-focused gaze. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; no scaffolding. Minor over-modification in peak beats prevents 9+ but does not obscure closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” plus graffiti-as-conversation fuses cyber-haunt with ancient ballad trope, yielding fresh synthesis. Conceptual risk—entire plot is drawing on fog-wet stone—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity of flower-press bolt plate (Victorian herbarium tech) anchors abstraction in tactile past. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
