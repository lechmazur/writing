<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Carpenter’s “quietly persistent” trait is asserted repeatedly but only once shown (following the song). Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“whispering gleam in their eyes”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after meeting the singer alters later carving; persistence stays ornamental. Earned stasis is hinted but cost is off-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: dawn + finished horse + memory of singer reconfigure meaning, but the cost is only implied (“memory would remain”). Causal chain is loose—wrong turn feels author-engineered, not driven by carpenter’s prior choice. Orientation clean by 120 words; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Halo fragment returns as gentle glow but never tests or limits action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Abandoned train and misting hush are atmospherically rich; sensory detail filters through carpenter’s selective attention. Micro-setting (lantern-lit workbench, pool reflection) constrains attention and mirrors internal calm. No environment-derived obstacle or tool failure shapes tactics, so 9+ gate fails. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—stays abstract; no concrete trade-off or price emerges. Escalation is purely atmospheric (mist thickens, song nears) rather than option-narrowing. Wrong turn to oasis is coincidence, not agency-driven tension. No visible cost after singer encounter; carpenter simply returns and finishes horse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty-through-silence emerges through recurring images (misting hush, wind bells, halo glow) rather than assertion. Final image of finished horse reweights earlier silence motif, but epiphany is gently stated (“they had discovered a hidden truth”). Resists moralizing, yet insight feels prefabricated rather than wrested from conflict. Ambiguity is present but thin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—close attention to wood grain, star reflections, chime cadence. Syntax flexes with emotional swell (“misting hush that seemed to carry…”) without losing clarity. No dialogue to test voice distinction; carpenter’s interior idiom is stable. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within plausible artisan lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and mostly concise, but figurative layering becomes dense in every sentence (“rusty wheels told tales,” “halo fragment’s gentle glow illuminating the face”). Template cadence appears (“the carpenter… the carpenter…” anaphora) without pattern payoff. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors, yet overwriting blurs peak mist/oasis beats. Final line lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—lonely artisan in ghost-train meets phantom singer—evokes familiar lyric ghost-story template. Specificity of carousel carving and halo fragment freshens the trope, but core arc (follow song → find beauty → return wiser) remains foreseeable. Risk level modest; no structural or conceptual twist beyond atmospheric oasis. Memory-of-singer twist is gentle but not transformative.</comment>
