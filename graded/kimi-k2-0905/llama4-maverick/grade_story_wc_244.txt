<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Raven’s loneliness is stated but never embodied in gesture or contradiction; the “desperately jocular” mask is announced, not dramatized. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure—Raven drifts rather than decides. The moon-rock plan is motive, yet we never feel the ache that powers it. Closure is soft: loneliness dissolves off-page in collective warmth, so the cost is implied, not internalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Causal chain: rumor → gathering → communion is legible, but each step is summarized, not tested. No reversal or obstacle narrows options; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Closure is a gentle fade (“the world was just a little bit brighter”)—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost, yet the price is social, not personal. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, but the tightening beat is missing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Ivy-choked station is sketched in economical, sensory strokes that mirror decay→growth. Spatial choreography stays clean despite crowd expansion. Micro-setting absent—no tool or body part constrains choice—so 9-band gate fails. Still, the environment actively hosts the action rather than decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“cure loneliness”—is declared early, but on-page pressure is collective, not individual: Raven’s own ache never faces a test or trade-off. No meaningful tightening; the rumor chain spreads unimpeded. Stakes spread thin across the crowd, diluting visceral risk. Closure reweights community, but protagonist’s personal cost is off-stage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges through event: shared food, shelter, stories—never sermonized. Final image re-weights moon rock from talisman to obsolete relic, a quiet Conceptual Repricing. Complexity is modest; ambiguity is present but not sharp. Sentimentality loiters at edges (“world a little bit kinder”) yet is mostly earned by communal particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, lightly ironic cadence—“politely anarchic” without slipping into stand-up. Diction stays within logistician-cosmopolitan lexicon; metaphors (ivy as skeletal fingers) are sparing and apt. No dialogue to test character divergence; narrative texture is consistent. Rhythm breathes with scene expansion, avoiding drumbeat syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. A few elevated phrases (“conceptual cost of cosmic kindness”) flirt with register drift but pass. Information density is moderate—some thematic shorthand could be cut. Closure image is clear, unmuddied by figurative overgrowth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>“Rumor-chain relief logistics” is fresh; moon-rock-as-catalyst is familiar but redeployed as social virus. Ivy station provides organic decay→renewal metaphor. Risk is mild—no structural or perspectival gamble. Specificity of crowd logistics keeps it from sliding into template allegory.</comment>
