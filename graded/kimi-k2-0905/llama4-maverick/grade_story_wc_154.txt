<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is evocative—translator-as-decoder mirrored in reading the cast—but contradictions stay summary-level (“lotus-hearted ache” repeated without fresh embodiment). The moment she decrypts the cast is decisive and stakes her own trauma, earning the late softening, yet we never see her mistranslate or misstep on-page, so competence feels protected rather than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral pulses in darkness, re-weighting shared pain into shared peace; cost is felt in the anesthetic fog that dissolves her agency. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—dense motif repetitions tighten rather than causally chain—held cleanly to the end. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mist, coral, and cast function as micro-setting that constrains perception and supplies decryption tools. The coral is tactile—turned, clutched, pulsing—charging the final image; atrium geography stays coherent via the operating table and smudged cast within arm’s reach. Selective sensory triage (visual, tactile) mirrors Kael’s professional bias as translator-decoder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unknot my own anguish by decoding another’s”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when decrypted cast messages mirror her fears, forcing acknowledgement. Escalation is textural (pattern density) rather than causal reversal; cost is the emotional vertigo under anesthesia, but no visible forfeiture or blocked option materialises on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared fragility emerges through coral-as-metaphor and mirrored child-adult anxieties; no overt thesis stated. Final image of glowing coral quietly reprices earlier turmoil without moralising. Subtext lives in smudged syntax—illegible handwriting standing for war’s untranslated wounds—inviting reader decryption, though emotional after-effect tilts serene rather than complexly ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers close to Kael’s sensorium; perceptual signature filters world through synesthetic translation metaphors (“patterns a testament”, “syntax of fears”). No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Rhythm clusters in anaphoric “as the…” clauses that mimic lapping waves—pattern taught early and paid off in final dissolve—compressing time under narcotic haze without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but keeps propulsion via short beat-chains; no scaffolding loops. Metaphors occasionally layer (“lotus-hearted ache” + “gentle lapping of waves”) yet stay coherent within poetic register. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“unknot,” “graft”) advance action. Final third avoids overwritten closure beat—image carries weight, letting syntax breathe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of war-zone translator with brain-coral cryptography feels fresh; coral-as-memory-chip reframes PTSD through ecological lens. Child-cast decryption reverses usual adult-to-child knowledge flow. Risk resides in lyric repetition risking sentimental haze, yet specificity of smudged crayon syntax grounds it. Not radically avant-garde, but synthesis is non-obvious for 700-word frame.</comment>
