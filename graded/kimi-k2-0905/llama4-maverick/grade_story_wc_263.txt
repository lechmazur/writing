<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically consistent but floats in generalized awe; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The “trapped creativity” stake is asserted, never tested through an on-page choice that costs her anything concrete. Micro-choices (adjusting the astrolabe, tracing stars) are ritualistic, not tactical; they don’t narrow or foreclose options. Earned change is declared rather than embodied—she simply “knew” she’d succeeded at dawn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated aurora/astrolabe imagery intensifies toward a Charged Poise at dawn. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—creativity is “freed” via cosmic communion—but the cost is purely atmospheric, not dramatized; no path is visibly foreclosed. Causality is loose: the stars don’t push back, and the calendar tracking never tightens options. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and astrolabe supply tactile, luminous specificity; sensory hierarchy skews visual but stays POV-filtered. Micro-setting works: the astrolabe’s “intricate carvings” act as tactile anchor and symbolic key. Environment never actively constrains her physically—no cold, wind, or fatigue—so stakes remain metaphorical. Final image of stardust trail is vivid but doesn’t alter her next move; setting decorates rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing creativity—is declared early but never pressured by external obstacle or internal trade-off. Escalation is tonal (aurora brightens) rather than causal; no option is narrowed, no price exacted. The “unwritten calendar” promises ticking urgency yet remains abstract; meteor timing doesn’t force a critical moment. Resolution is atmospheric release, not earned reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic inspiration emerges through imagistic accretion rather than statement, avoiding overt moralizing. Recurrent stardust/astrolabe motif reappears at closure but doesn’t reweight meaning—its final glow merely restates the opening promise. Subtext stays one-note: universe speaks, artist listens; no counter-readings or ambiguity complicate the transaction. Insight feels pre-given, not wrested from struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—selective attention to celestial motion, archaic diction (“moonstruck,” “velvet expanse”) that suits the dreamer’s reverence. Rhythm modulates: longer hypnotic clauses under aurora swell, shorter fragments at dawn exhalation. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing (“shadowed rapture”) risks purple but stays within POV lexicon of cosmic awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with aurora pulses. Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—but pattern is taught early and sustains lyric mode without mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “across the unwritten calendar” is repeated conceptually not actionally. No loops or synonym churn in final third; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cosmic creativity quest is familiar, yet anchoring it in an astrolabe rather than telescope offers fresh tactile angle. Aurora-lit archway as ritual workspace feels specific to this narrator. Risk is stylistic—sustained lyric metaphor—but execution stays coherent. lacks a transformative turn that makes the cosmic feedback surprising; payoff is mood, not revelation.</comment>
