<comment>Emilia’s interiority is evocative but remains abstract: “diligent orchestra copyist” is never exercised in scene—no ink, no proofing, no conductor score, no muscle memory of transcription. Motivation (“teach dust to tell stories”) recurs as mantra yet is not dramatised through contradictory micro-choices; the only visible decision is transcribing, which merely confirms competence. Static posture at the desk throughout prevents status shifts or embodied cost; the cloak grab is reactive, not a value-laden choice that forecloses a path. No earned contradiction or visible price attaches to the obsession, so the closure is felt as mood rather than character change.</comment>

<comment>Closure is present as a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust swirls into “tangible storyform” and the radio glow lingers as Charged Poise, reweighting the premise. Causality beneath this, however, is associative: broadcast → transcribe → dust obeys; no intermediate beat tests or complicates Emilia’s agency, so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is secure within 120 words; single-scene default met. The lack of a tightening reversal means escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; cost is conceptual rather than lived, limiting upper band.</comment>

<comment>The ember alcove is sketched with selective sensory economy—glow, mist, dust motes—each filtering through POV priorities. Micro-setting (radio dial, desk surface) functions as tool and lens, constraining attention and later charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. For 9+ the dial or desk would need to alter a final tactic; they shimmer but do not force a choice, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—capture the broadcast to animate dust—is signalled early and held. Pressure is accumulative: static thickens, lyrics clarify, dust reacts; yet no live option is foreclosed and Emilia never adapts tactics. The crescendo intensifies atmosphere but does not test commitment or force trade-off, so escalation is present yet static. Cost is aesthetic (silence after song) rather than tactical, keeping score mid-band.</comment>

<comment>Theme—art as transmutation of absence into narrative—emerges through recurring dust/radio imagery rather than statement. Final image reweights dust from debris to medium, supplying quiet conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers: is the story-telling real or wishful? Complexity is modest because the beat is single-note; no counter-readings challenge Emilia’s conviction. Subtext stays imagistic, avoiding moral tag, but lacks friction to push higher.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Emilia’s perceptual filter: “soft glow,” “thistled calm,” “dust motes dancing” reflect her hush-attention. Rhythm is lull-cadenced, mirroring transcription trance; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally over- perfumes (“ember alcove,” “story famine”) but remains internally consistent. Voice is distinctive if mannered; under stress diction compresses appropriately, meeting the 9+ quick test for control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluent and rhythmic, but overindulges in metaphor strings: every sentence in the first third carries a figurative vehicle, dulling impact. Mixed metaphor risk—“radio dial’s secretly luminous face seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy”—is borderline. Paraphrase loops appear (“mist-shrouded atmosphere,” “mist outside the alcove swirled”). No artifact touches closure, so high-band cap remains 8.8; density surplus holds score here.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Pirate shortwave + dust-as-medium is a fresh synthesis of steampunk and magical realism, avoiding cliché. Concept is specific to voice and setting; removal would collapse the piece. Risk is moderate—lyric stasis over plot—but coherence justifies the gamble. Could edge higher with sharper causal twist; presently the novelty is atmospheric rather than structural.</comment>
