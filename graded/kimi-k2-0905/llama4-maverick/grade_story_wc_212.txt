<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The “furiously tranquil” duality is asserted repeatedly (7×) but never embodied in distinct micro-choices; interiority drifts into abstract sermon (“she felt an overwhelming sense of purpose”) instead of sensory contradiction. No credible struggle or visible cost attaches to her acceptance of stewardship—she glides from vision to resolution without tightening trade-offs, so the arc feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure reaches for Charged Poise: the cap lingers in hand while the vortex hums, re-weighting time as “borrowed.”  However causality is loose—how blowing an acorn cap rewires entropy is neither taught nor constrained, so the final image charms but doesn’t foreclose a path with felt price. Mosaic design (one continuous lyrical flow) is coherent, yet the speculative rule-set remains ornamental rather than operative at climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Starlit glass atrium and thawing frost provide a tactile, shifting micro-setting that mirrors internal thaw; selective sensory detail (glistening panes, soft hum) is filtered through seed-saver priorities. The space stays legible and constrains her ritual—she must wait for melt to perform—earning its keep in the final hush without stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve cyclical balance”—is declared early but stays abstract; no concrete resource, relationship, or rule is jeopardized. Escalation is atmospheric (visions intensify) rather than causal, so pressure feels decorative; the “tightening” is a lyric crescendo, not an option-narrowing turn, leaving cost legibility weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational caretaking under entropy emerges through seed / egg / cap imagery without explicit sermon. The vortex re-prices time as “borrowed,” inviting reader reflection, yet the concept is stated (“discover the texture of borrowed time”) rather than dramatized through sacrifice—so resonance is moderate, not piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to sensorium, maintaining calm-register diction (“wild serenity”) that modulates into hushed awe at climax. Syntax is patterned and rhythmic, mirroring vortex swirl; no head-hop or register drift. Voice is cohesive if not idiosyncratic—could swap seed-saver for another guardian without rewriting sentences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence lengths; however figurative strings stack in every sentence of the climax beat (“thousand tiny mirrors,” “fabric of time and space,” “kaleidoscope of images”) without pattern pay-off, dulling impact. Several near-paraphrase loops (“world as it had been… world as it would be”) and repeated “she felt” filter stems sap immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mythic seed-keeper who steers cosmic vortex via acorn cap is fresh synthesis of climate-grief and folkloric inheritance. Execution leans on lyric cadence rather than invented cosmology, so concept feels evocative but not rigorously transformed; still, the quiet ecological stance avoids cliché and lands a memorable tonal signature.</comment>
