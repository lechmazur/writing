<comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her guilt is embodied in the rake-handle inscription moment—but the “ethically diligent” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown under pressure, so the arc feels smoothed rather than tested. The micro-choice to walk on is credible yet low-cost; the story never risks her competence or makes her choose between two live duties. Closure leans on lyrical reprise rather than a visible forfeiture, so the change feels symbolic, not crucible-forged.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ridge, pendulum, and rake handle layer images until the final cadence reweights “incremental absolution.” Orientation is clear by line 3, transitions are smooth, and the closure is a Charged Poise—the golden light reconfigures the stake without a new causal turn. Cost is felt (“weight slowly lifting”) but not visibly paid; the lens holds yet the tightening is mild.</comment>

<comment>The tidal obsidian ridge is rendered with salt-swell specificity; the broken rake handle becomes a micro-setting that literally guides her next step and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; weather and rock constrain gait and mood. The 9+ gate is missed only because the ridge never actively threatens or resource-strips her; it mirrors rather than alters tactics.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: pendulum pause → inscription → golden light, each layer deepening the same stake rather than narrowing options. No visible price is exacted; the conflict is internal and static, so escalation is present but gentle. Coincidence (finding the rake) complicates, does not resolve, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through the shifting rake-handle text and light-image rather than explicit moralizing; the final golden horizon offers a non-literal answer to “can guilt be shed in steps?” Complexity is respected—no tidy absolution, only onward motion. The echo of “incremental” in the inscription and sunset is organic, not harvested. Still, the lack of a dramatized counter-argument keeps the resonance slightly monovalent.</comment>

<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices brass gleam, salt weight, cracked wood in character-specific hierarchy. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then shortens into motion, mirroring pendulum release. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet internal diction remains consistent and tactile. Lyric elevation (“searing reverie”) is earned by pattern, not decorative.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the pendulum, sentences lengthen/contract purposefully. One scaffold detected: “the weight… slowly lifting” is restated in adjacent phrasing, a −0.2 loop. Metaphors are coherent (pendulum as heartbeat) and do not clog high-pressure beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image, not exposition.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing clockwork precision with coastal gothic is fresh, yet the emotional arc—guilt → artifact → walk toward light—tracks familiar therapeutic allegory. The rake-handle inscription as miniature scripture is a lovely specific inflection, but the premise itself is not aggressively non-obvious. Risk is moderate; transformation feels regional rather than paradigm-shift.</comment>
