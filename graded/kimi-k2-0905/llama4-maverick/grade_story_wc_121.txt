<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—"periodically eternal existence" gives a concrete ache—but contradiction is only asserted, never dramatized in a moment where two wants rip her in opposite directions. The tablet is handled repeatedly, yet every choice is a calm, solitary computational step rather than a micro-choice that visibly forfeits something. The closing stance is strong, but the cost is atmospheric ("darkness coalescing") rather than a specific, earlier-laid price. Voice remains consistent and otherworldly; still, the absence of embodied tension under pressure keeps her just shy of lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration in which the labyrinth’s conquest redrafts reality; the city’s "soft, lunar light" is the felt cost. Causal linkage is lyric-elliptical rather than strict because/therefore, but pattern is taught early ("procedural generation") and paid off in the final image. Orientation is strong at 120-word mark. One causality quibble: the tablet never meets an explicit limit that is then overcome—it guides, it never resists—so the victory feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned by a final, narrowing trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct, rain-mist, and draining luminescence are not backdrop but barometer: each shift in glow tracks the internal power transfer, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is seamless—she stands, gazes, closes eyes, emerges; puddles, clay tablet, and darkness cohere without drift. Selective sensory triage mirrors her priorities: ozone and earth first, tactile tablet next, city-wide vista last. The city never becomes a place we could map, but at this length the viaduct itself functions as the "micro-setting" that constrains her path, fulfilling the requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastery over fractured timelines—signaled in paragraph one and tightened once when the glow "intensifies" then "fades," marking the power siphon. Agency is present in every beat (she generates, confronts, integrates), yet the tablet never pushes back; escalation is a smooth ramp rather than a wrenching trade-off. Cost is atmospheric ("darkness coalescing") rather than a concrete forfeiture we can weigh; the price is felt but not specified. Still, the lens holds and the single deepening re-weights options, satisfying the short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—self as editable labyrinth—emerges through iterative imagery rather than thesis: echoes, paths, glow-drain, lunar replacement. No character sermonizes; the only "answer" is the final cityscape, reborn under her gaze, a wordless conceptual reprice. Ambiguity is purposeful: is she savior or tyrant? The refusal to moralize lets the image resonate. One abstract noun cluster ("possibilities that lay ahead") nicks the subtext, keeping it from the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient hovers at dreamy distance; diction ("periodically eternal," "darkening brightness") invents its own register and sticks to it. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed clauses when time narrows between drop and ripple, then lengthens again at emergence—showing rhythmic control. No head-hop; knowledge stays bounded to what the lens can poeticize. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on narrative texture, which remains singular and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—light/dark, drop/ripple, path/labyrinth—each pair recurs with payoff, avoiding the "stacked metaphor" penalty. Scaffolding minimal: one paraphrase loop ("stood...stood...stood") in finale, but it serves incantatory closure rather than slack. Information density high; clauses carry double duty (action + metaphor) without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combining "procedural generation" with mystic labyrinth is fresh; the idea that self is debugged like code feels non-obvious. Yet the emotional arc—lonely seeker absorbs fragments to become god—mirrors familiar ascent templates; specificity of city and tablet helps, but plot skeleton remains recognizable. Risk in structure (lyric, iterative) heightens mood without obscuring clarity, earning the +0.3 bonus. Final score reflects genuine hybrid insight even if chassis is borrowed.</comment>
