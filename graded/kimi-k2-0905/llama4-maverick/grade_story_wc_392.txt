<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya’s calm is stated repeatedly but never tested; no contradiction or visible cost attaches to it. The “break free” motive is declared late and never dramatized—no micro-choice shows her refusing an old pattern. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she felt liberation”) rather than embodied tension. The lantern connection is asserted, not enacted; we never see her hand shake or grip tighten under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern’s brighter shine plus rain-soaked emergence reweight the stake with felt cost. Causal linkage is thin—empirical observation is named, not shown, so the turn rests on atmospheric rise rather than because/therefore. Orientation is clear by 60 words; no penalty. Single-scene default met; no mosaic drift. Lens ambiguity by midpoint costs −0.3; accumulative reading holds at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tunnel micro-setting is vivid and selective: damp-earth reek, flicker on rust, dripping echo. Lantern functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its glow literally guides the exit beat. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Weather pivot (drought→rain) externalizes inner thaw without overt symbolism. Professional detail scant but not plot-relevant; meets scope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—solve case/free self—signaled early but pressure stays atmospheric; no concrete narrowing of options. One soft deepening: “Free at last” inscription links case to self, but it is noticed, not triggered by agency. Cost is existential, not enacted; no tactic altered. Escalation is textural density rise via drip/echo repetition; sufficient for short-form under accumulative lens, but barely felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of historical/freedom loops emerges through lantern, inscription, rain, but never complicates—no counter-pull shows what freedom loses. Subtext stays suggestive; no character voices to carry irony. Final image reframes tunnel from grave to birth-canal, giving mild CR. Avoids explicit moral, yet “break free” thesis is restated in closing paragraph, trimming top-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya; perceptual signature relies on sensory triage—smell, echo, light. Rhythm breathes with descent/ascent motion; sentence length varies. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within investigator’s plausible lexicon. Lantern light as “catalyst for memories” is the one overt abstraction; otherwise prose stays concrete.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong auditory and olfactory specificity, but “dripping water continued to reverberate” loops four times near verbatim—template cadence −0.4. Mixed metaphor cluster in para 3: “threads of entangled memories…weight of the past” compresses without fresh image. Elsewhere clean, concise, propellant. No closure-beat artifacts, so 9-bar remains open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Investigator + underground railroad lantern yields fresh cultural mash-up; prevents generic tunnel trek. Yet central move—memory surfacing via relic—is familiar ghost-device; no twist complicates it. Rain-as-renewal is foreseeable once drought mentioned. Specificity of “Free at last” carving keeps it from sliding to 5-zone. Conceptual integrity intact; risk level moderate.</comment>
