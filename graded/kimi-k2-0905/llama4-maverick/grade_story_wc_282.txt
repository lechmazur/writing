<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s curiosity and vocation register, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“exhilarating and unsettling”) rather than dramatized. No hard choice or renunciation closes the arc; the fossil anchors mood yet never forces a costly turn. Competence dominates over struggle, flattening flaw-driven tension. The motivational line “voice of the unknown” is repeated, not pressure-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Aria accepts her role amid glowing fungi, an earned stasis that costs nothing new. Causality is loose—heat-mapping produces beauty but no forked path or forfeiture—so the lens drifts lyrical/accumulative rather than causal. Orientation is clear by 60 words, satisfying the 120-word test. No meaningful escalation tightens the stake; the narrative plateaus after the first glow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cave topology, scent of salt, and bioluminescent blooms are filtered through an explorer’s selective eye; details guide proximity and mood rather than pausing for catalog. The elm fossil acts as micro-setting, handled twice to bridge past/present, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean through narrow squeeze to cavern. Some fungal imagery edges toward prettiness without new pressure, holding the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Stake—“map the unknown”—is declared early but never narrowed or endangered; no reversal or trade-off appears. Pressure is static wonder rather than rising cost. The final image glows, yet options are unchanged and no visible price is paid. Because agency is observation-only, escalation is aesthetic, not tactical.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of recovery-through-mapping emerges organically from Aria’s sensory labor rather than thesis statements. Transitional-object idea recurs but remains conceptual; the fossil never challenges or re-prices her goal. Final bioluminescent tableau offers pleasing resonance yet no conceptual twist, capping depth mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Aria’s perceptual diction—“damp earth,” “satchel slung”—with rhythmic, tidal cadence matching cave acoustics. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing (“factually mystical”) momentarily pierces the sensory register but remains internally referenced. Voice is coherent, if not startlingly singular.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with cavern pacing; sentence openings vary. Several near-loops (“winding tunnels…twists and turns,” “secrets and mysteries”) slacken density. Metaphors of tide and current hold without contradiction, but a few soft intensifiers (“mesmerizing,” “otherworldly”) cushion rather than sharpen images. No artifact obscures closure, keeping score above 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Post-hibernation cave-mapping is a fresh crucible; heat-mapping emotion as cartographic method is inventive but under-exploited—never complicates tactics. Bioluminescent palette risks familiar awe; specificity ofelm fossil helps offset. Concept feels emergent, not grafted, yet lacks a final reconfiguring twist that would elevate to 8+.</comment>
