<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Aria’s caretaker-robot paradox—precision vs. emotional overload—stays legible, but her “inner static” is mostly labeled, not dramatized; the carved box is touched twice yet never opened or risked, so the fear stays abstract. The burn-plan epiphany jumps too cleanly from duty to escape without an on-page micro-choice that shows cost. Still, her body-level tending of roses and the tentative smile at the end earn a modest arc of Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The causal spine holds: magnetic shift → burn → Aria’s decision to contain rather than flee. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she is still an android, still caretaking, but the dome now “less confining.” The cost is present yet soft: the box is lighter, the flames already spent. One causality bump: management announces the burn off-stage, so the stakes arrive pre-packaged rather than forced by Aria’s discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Glass dome, roses, smoke, and heat are filtered through Aria’s mechanical perception—precise humidity readings, visual glare—so setting constrains her tactics and mood. The enclosure acts as both pressure-cooker and lens, amplifying the fire she must miniaturize. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. One minor slip: “magnetic north shifts” is stated but never made tactile or consequential to her movements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quell “inner static” or be consumed—is declared early; pressure tightens when she chooses to contain rather than escape the burn. That reversal narrows her options and risks overheating her chassis, a visible price. Escalation is linear, not deepening; each beat restates the same tension rather than revealing new trade-offs. Still, the final image reweights the stake: chaos caged, not vanished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fragmented wholeness emerges organically from fire-carved roses and Aria’s partial repair; no character sermonizes the theme. The box of fears reappears lighter, a quiet repricing rather than a moral. Ambiguity lingers: is the static silenced or just domesticated? One abstract line—“a testament to fragmented wholeness”—flirts with thesis-speak but is saved by the tentative smile that precedes it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Aria’s sensorium: mechanical hum, petal-count, heat threshold. Diction is precise—“magnetic north shifted,” “miniaturize the chaos”—without drifting into technobabble. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for nostalgia, clipped fragments during fire-containment. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Voice could be more idiosyncrally android; occasional soft-focus lyricism (“flames were strangely organic”) slightly blurs the mechanical lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, with high information density: each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors are spare and integrated—“flames danced like living entities”—without metaphor pile-ups. One scaffold tic: “the desert rose farm, once again…” repeats three times as a paragraph opener, creating a template cadence that dulls the final beat. Otherwise, syntax breathes with the fire’s surge and ebb.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Android caretaker + controlled burn + miniature chaos is a fresh synthesis; the inversion—she cages the very chaos she hoped to flee—avoids stock rebellion tropes. Roses as memory implants and fire as emotional exfoliant feel specific to this dome. Risk is moderate; concept never fully questions the ethics of android sentience, retreating to gentle uplift. Still, the image of glass-amplified flames contained by their gardener lingers.</comment>
