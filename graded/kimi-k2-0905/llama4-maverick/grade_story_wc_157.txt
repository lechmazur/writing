<comment>Lyra’s “charming rogue scholar” label is never contradicted by on-page action: we watch her garden, not steal, barter, or charm. Interiority stays generic (“spark of defiance” repeated) and emotion is declared, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; choices are smooth gardening tasks, so motivation feels flat. The ending offers no cost or renunciation tied to her character—just a satisfied smile—so the arc feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>A single continuous scene is cleanly anchored inside the greenhouse by word 50. Causality is present: because thoughts are taxable, therefore coded gardens. Yet escalation is static—gardening steps listed without tightening or deeper cost. Closure is a Charged Poise image (mature seed dispersing) but the “conceptual cost” is asserted, not dramatized on Lyra’s body or options, so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds weakly.</comment>

<comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting: trellises and soil texture guide Lyra’s every move and the camera stays tight on seed, soil, pollinator motion. Sensory triage is biased—smell of bloom, insect hum—matching entomologist frame. Spatial choreography is crisp; no impossible positions. Setting never evolves or constrains final choice, so it charges atmosphere but not closure, capping Q3 under its 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—evade thought-tax—is declared early but never tested in scene: no inspector appears, no near-discovery, no ticking clock. Middle offers only a list of planting steps; no tightening or trade-off. Cost is postponed to an abstract future where seeds “carry the message forward,” so pressure stays ambient. Without on-page endangerment or price, escalation remains decorative rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of linguistic resistance emerges implicitly through gardening code without sermon. Motif of seed-as-language returns at end, reweighting earlier planting as political act. Final paragraph drifts toward overt thesis (“beacon of resistance”), blunting resonance. Complexity is present but undercut by tidy summary sentences; still, the greenhouse particulars keep the idea from floating entirely.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close stays locked on Lyra; no head-hop. Narrative diction is consistent, lightly elevated but within scholar lexicon. Rhythm is repetitive—“the gourd rattle seed… the gourd rattle seed”—a templated cadence that dulls musicality. POV perceptual signature is present (noticing insect wingbeats) yet lines blur into catalogue listing, preventing higher band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences advance cleanly, but scaffold loops appear: “the community gardeners, oblivious… the community gardeners continued” and “message patterns… message patterns stood.” Metaphors are safe—“converging chaos” repeated without fresh image. Several near-paraphrase pairs slow momentum. Copy is otherwise clean; issue is rhythmic monotony, not grammatical failure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Tax-on-thoughts + horticultural cipher is a fresh synthesis; rogue scholar trope remains label-only, trimming novelty. Execution risk is modest—linear gardening vignette, no structural experiment. Specificity of entomologist greenhouse pollinator detail keeps premise from feeling abstract. Fits genre of quiet resistance tale but does not push into unfamiliar emotional territory; competent rather than revelatory.</comment>
