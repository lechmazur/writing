<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Amira’s shock-to-purpose arc is legible, but interiority defaults to abstract labels (“unfiltered awakening,” “bleak exhilaration”) instead of embodied contradiction. The crystal’s calming effect is asserted, not dramatized through bodily change or micro-choice. No internal conflict is shown in-scene; she pivots from grief to investigative drive between paragraphs without visible friction or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to “hunt” unused potential is crystallized, cost acknowledged (“heart still bearing the scars”). Causal chain is thin—flyer-to-observatory transition is pure convenience—but the lens (Causal) holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rubble-and-smoke opening is vivid and selective; the geode’s facets reflecting “dying light” anchors the beat. Observatory hum/glow supplies tactile contrast, but spatial choreography inside the station remains white-room. Crystal acts as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover why her wedding was destroyed—signaled early. Middle “tightening” is intellectual (data pattern) rather than an action that forecloses an option; no visible price is paid or resource lost. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of weaponized stagnation emerges through data rather than character experience; insight is stated (“unused potential… a catalyst”). Final image of tempered spirit offers modest resonance, but the conceptual reweighting is delivered in narrative paraphrase, not charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is generic-survivor rather than idiosyncratic. Prose rhythm is serviceable, but repeated “intangibly tangible” becomes template cadence without pattern payoff. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Information density is adequate; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. However, stacked abstract noun phrases (“sense of purpose,” “bleak exhilaration”) flatten peak beats. Metaphors are safe (“beacon,” “tempered like crystal”) and do not muddle causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Drone-strike wedding + geode talisman + orbital perturbation lab is an unexpected synthesis; the combo feels fresh rather than checklist. Risk is moderate: the concept leans allegorical but stays grounded in Amira’s grief. Could be swapped to generic rebellion plot, so not fully irreplicable.</comment>
