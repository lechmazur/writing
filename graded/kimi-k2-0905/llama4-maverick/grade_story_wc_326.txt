<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Akira’s interior contradiction—obsession with mortality yet hunger for transcendence—remains vivid, but her heartbeat-counting never alters a visible choice; the porcelain shard glows but never constrains action. The “fetch wisdom from failure” motive is asserted, not dramatized through escalating stakes. Closure is quiet acceptance rather than earned renunciation, so the cost feels ambient, not personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is lyric-accumulative: ink patterns and ghost fragments layer texture until the final image reweights solitude. Orientation is swift; causality is associative, not causal—ghost emergence feels like snow-assisted epiphany rather than a because/therefore sequence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: shard released into dawn hush, solitude crystallized, cost felt in the hush itself. Lens holds, but the lack of a tightening turn keeps it below 7.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Opal observatory under fresh snow is micro-set as both sanctuary and lens; snow depth subtly increases alongside ghost definition, mirroring interior focus. Porcelain shard becomes portable micro-setting whose glow charges final image. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent; weather choice is fresh rather than seasonal cliché. Detail economy is high: every flake and ink swirl is filtered through grief-attuned perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stake is single: wrest meaning from digital ghost before snow stops. Pressure is atmospheric, not option-narrowing; no concrete trade-off or tool loss occurs. Escalation is textural—ghost gains definition—rather than tactical. Cost is emotional hush, visible but not priced on-page, keeping it in mid-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as transience-as-consolation: ink, snow, shard, and ghost all dissolve yet leave quiet imprint. No overt thesis; final image of falling shard reweights earlier porcelain motif. Ambiguity is purposeful—ghost remains unnamed code or memory. Resonance is delicate rather than profound, fitting the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is fused with snow-light and ink-diffusion metaphors. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for drift, fragments at dawn. No dialogue to distort. Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within grief-philosophic register without drift. Voice is memorable yet borders on poetic uniformity—lacks grit under fingernails.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative density peaks in ink-study paragraph yet serves pattern. One paraphrase loop: “snow seemed…seemed to echo” triggers minor ding. No mixed metaphors; temporal sequence is clear. Final line lands with image-earned hush. Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, almost too even—lulls rather than pierces.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of digital ghost with ink-divination feels fresh; death-certificate error backstory stays off-page, reducing specificity. Snow-bound observatory as liminal lab is elegant, not radical. Wisdom-from-failure angle is understated, avoiding self-help trap. Overall, a graceful remix rather than a risk-taking re-invention.</comment>
