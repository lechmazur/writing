<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts into diagnostic self-labeling (“darkness within her,” “holes in her soul”) that blurs embodied contradiction; the burned card momentarily externalizes flaw, yet no micro-choice after the pickup visibly alters tactics or reveals hierarchy of values under pressure—spell-weaving is asserted, not dramatized. Closure achieves Earned Stasis, but cost is gestural (“weight of her soul lifting”) rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: spell complete, destiny rewoven, orchard transformed; cost is conceptual but legible in the final glow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (roots, bones, card, corridor-light) intensifies stake until final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. Slight causal softening: how inlaying meaning rewrites fate rules is never constrained, so the price feels unbounded rather than rule-bound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is vividly textured—roots “snaked between ancient bones,” air “morbid perfume”—and every descriptor is filtered through the idealist’s macabre hope. Micro-setting of the burned tarot card constrains the midpoint choice and recurs as talisman in closure, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; light from corridors tracks consistently. Economy slips once with “blooming flowers” scent overlay, a sentimental addition that dulls the gothic sting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—barter destiny to mend soul—signals early and tightens through pattern accumulation: each inlayed object raises spectral attention until orchard leans in. Agency is present (she weaves, she trammels), but external pressure remains atmospheric rather than an opposing force that narrows live options; no visible price alters tactics mid-stream. Closure crystallizes stance without foreclosing a future path—“brighter future” is left open—so cost is tonal, not tactical. Sufficient for 600-word accumulative arc, but lacks a concrete trade-off beat that would punch 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-determination versus fatalism emerges through the burned Eight of Swords reframed from imprisonment to agency; no explicit thesis statement. Final image of orchard whispering approval reweights earlier bones-and-roots imagery into hopeful germination without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: did she swap destinies or merely re-story her own? Minor deduction for “patch holes in her soul” therapy-speak that momentarily abstracts the concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent gothic cadence; diction (“trammel,” “inlay,” “dusky resolve”) feels purposeful, not thesaurus churn. Perceptual signature skews toward synesthetic decay—scent as perfume, sight as half-glow—anchored in idealist’s sensibility. No dialogue to test; free indirect moments stay clean. One register drift: “bartered destinies” trades folkloric diction for commercial idiom, a micro-jolt under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates well—long aromatic clauses contract to short ritual imperatives during spell. Figurative layer is dense (every other sentence) but pattern-taught early and paid off in final glow, so density penalty waived. Only scaffold: two adjacent “as she” participial openers create template cadence; minor loop fixed by cut. No mixed metaphors; props track.</comment>

<comment>Mystical fate-swap in ossuary orchard is familiar gothic turf, yet execution freshens via tactile botany—roots threading bones like yarn through eyelets—and repurposed tarot as DIY spell tool. Risk is moderate: accumulative lyric structure rather than confrontation, but coherence holds. Could push higher with a sharper, non-generic constraint rule for the barter. Transformation test: swapping tarot for rune or bones for rusted chains would blunt emotional valence, indicating specific synthesis.</comment>
