<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority drifts into abstract “desire to prove coincidences have meaning” without embodied contradiction; no micro-choice shows this drive colliding with risk. Custodian’s handling of prism and orrery is passive wonder, not pressured decision; cost is asserted (“shiver”) rather than dramatized. Retrocognitive blessing is label-only; it never complicates or limits action, so the climax feels gifted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands a Conceptual Repricing—light flares, knowledge rekindled—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of humming, star charts, thistle scent tighten into final glow. Causality is loose; shard simply “flares” when touched, no trade-off or constraint. Orientation clear by 50 words; no meaningful tightening mid-arc, only repetition of “custodian walks and feels awe.” Cost is aesthetic, not tactical, so resonance stays mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass pavilion’s vibrations and star-etched walls create a micro-setting that filters every beat; broken prism and frozen orrery are tactile anchors. Thistle scent threaded through action, not backdrop, and charges the final golden bloom. Spatial track clean; no white-room. Setting never forces a hard choice, so it supports but does not constrain—keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“uncover hidden pattern”—is declared early but never tested; no reversal or resource lost. Shard and orrery yield answers without resistance; escalation is purely atmospheric brightening. Protagonist’s agency is receptive touching, not active problem-solving; coincidence is celebrated, not interrogated. No visible price alters later options, so pressure plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-through-pattern emerges via star charts and humming glass, avoiding explicit thesis. Final golden light offers quiet repricing rather than moral. Yet thistle-blown hope is asserted more than dramatized; ambiguity feels ornamental because no real cost shadows the insight. Still, particulars (prism, orrery) carry the idea without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical distance stays consistent; diction (“shard of hush,” “thistle-blown optimism”) creates a fragile, glass-toned texture that matches pavilion. Rhythm repeats “as they” participial openers, but pattern is taught early and pays off in final glow. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Perceptual signature thin—custodian sees but does not filter through idiosyncratic bias—keeps score mid-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Strong imagistic density: “shard of hush,” “velvet expanse,” “thistle-blown hope.” However, three adjacent sentences open “As they…” creating template cadence; one paraphrase loop re-states “resonated with vibrations / still resonating.” Metaphors stay coherent, no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffolding dulls propulsion but does not obscure closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse star-pavilion that sings when walked through is fresh; retrocognitive silence shard repurposes fantasy trope into textural object. Conceptual repricing of knowledge via frozen orrery avoids typical fire-rebirth cliché. Yet core arc—loner touches relic, world glows—remains familiar; absence of cost or opposition keeps the twist gentle, not transformative.</comment>
