<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic (“shaken to her core,” “yearn for the stars”); no contradictory impulse is dramatized.  The tooth triggers only awe, never doubt that could test her skepticism.  Mentor memory is a summary label; no micro-choice shows bone-setting craft altering her stance.  Closure is an declared epiphany, not an earned renunciation or visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—images and memories layer rather than cause turns—yet pattern is taught late and closure is still declarative.  No concrete cue anchors the “substitute body” backstory, so the causal trigger that justifies her new purpose is missing on-page.  Final image is a glow on the tooth, but no felt price or irreversible change is dramatized; therefore RR/CR is weak.  Orientation clear; no penalty, but escalation stays flat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Garden and maze are sketched with impressionist color; sensory selection is biased toward Emilia’s wonder, not botanical inventory.  Bench and tooth function as micro-setting, but neither constrains her body or alters tactics—she simply picks up and leaves—so 9+ gate fails.  Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves.  Weather absent, but stakes are internal; appropriate economy for length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</comment><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning after the body incident—is declared, never tested; no live option is foreclosed.  Pressure is atmospheric (tranquil garden) rather than escalating; the tooth discovery is a gentle nudge, not a reversal.  No visible price is paid or resource lost.  Under Accumulative lens, density increases via memory fragments, but none tighten choice or raise cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting flaws into beauty emerges through the “constellations” motif, reiterated in closing paragraph; not stated in-scene, so avoids preachiness.  Yet insight is asserted rather than discovered through dramatized struggle.  Ambiguity is present—reader may doubt the tooth’s power—but ambiguity is accidental, not crafted irony.  Emotional after-effect is soft nostalgia without complicating counter-notes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient floats above Emilia; no perceptual signature unique to her profession or skepticism.  Syntax is fluid, but cadence is uniform; no rhythmic intensification at insight moment.  Diction stays safely literary, never risking idiosyncratic diction that would signal a lived-in mind.  Free indirect style absent; interiority is paraphrased, not voiced.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is pleasant, yet sentences open repeatedly with “As she… / She had…” creating template cadence (−0.4).  Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors, but no high-density payoff either.  Paragraph cuts are logical; no scaffolding paragraphs found.  Line clarity high; pronoun reference clean, tense stable.  Lacks the snap and compression expected at elite tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Changeling tooth + bone-setting constellation is an unusual pairing, but both remain abstract; no fresh mechanic or bodily scene actualizes the concept.  Secret garden trope is familiar, and here it merely beautifies rather than complicates.  Risk-taking is tonal (quiet lyric) rather than structural or ethical.  Specificity resides in tooth etchings, yet they are never decoded or used—potential left latent.</comment>
