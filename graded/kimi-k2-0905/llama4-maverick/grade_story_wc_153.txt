<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays observational; she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The “moment before deciding” is contemplated, not enacted, so the promised change is only asserted. Healing skin and shard remain symbolic—never once does moonlight’s pain or the relic’s edge alter her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the window clears to show a composite reflection, conceptually repricing identity. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned lyric recurrence—and the final image merely restates earlier motifs without tightening options or revealing new cost. No beat narrows possibility; the apparition appears because singing “reaches a fever pitch,” not through Aria’s agency, so the ending feels arrived at rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mangrove maze, fungi glow, damp rot, suspended windowpane—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Aria’s ritual attentiveness. Spatial choreography is clean; the shard and moonlight are re-anchored each beat. The setting never physically constrains choice (no tide, root-trip, or light-limit alters tactics), so it stays atmospheric rather than instrumental—just shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“uncover the truth behind the unsent letters”—stay abstract; no concrete consequence awaits failure. Pressure escalates only in volume: spirits sing louder, mist thickens, messages appear, apparition coalesces; none narrows Aria’s options or forces a trade-off. No reversal or deepening occurs; the beat structure is iterative description, not rising cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges through recurring images of sealed letters and fogged glass; the final cleared window reweights identity without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit, but the insight—shared sorrow dissolves into composite self—feels asserted rather than discovered through painful choice. Complexity is present yet static; ambiguity is graceful but not costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Aria’s perceptual filter: damp earth, “primordial aroma,” moonlight as balm. Syntax is varied, rhythmic, and avoids filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“evoke the essence,” “conceptual repricing”) feels like narrator intrusion rather than Aria’s idiom, keeping it just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined: no loops, clean grammar, strong verbs. Figurative layering is dense but patterned early (“singing spirits,” “moonlight healing”) so it reads as taught texture, not purple overload. A few abstract nouns (“profound significance,” “weight of unspoken apologies”) slightly dilute immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mangrove gothic with epistolary ghost-ritual feels fresh; the shard-as-channel and condensation-as-screen are neat reversals of usual occult props. Yet the emotional arc—medium confronts regret, feels better—maps neatly onto familiar therapeutic ghost-story templates. Specificity of voice and biome keep it memorable, but structural risk is low.</comment>
