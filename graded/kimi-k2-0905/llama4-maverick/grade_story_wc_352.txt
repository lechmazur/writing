<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s curiosity is clear, but her interiority stays generic: “spark of curiosity and determination” is label-speak, not embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; she simply follows the map the doodle provides. The ending’s “weight of discovery” is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels abstract rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the seeds of vigilance shift from metaphor to cultivatable force—yet the cost is only named (“responsibility that came with knowledge”), not felt. Causality holds under the Accumulative lens: each beat adds density until the alcove reweights the premise. However, the manuscript doodle teleports in as a fully-formed map rather than being earned through deduction, blunting the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto’s damp stone, moss scent, and inverted-gravity tug are vivid and selective, filtering through the archivist’s scholarly attention. Threshold effects manifest as “glimpses of hidden patterns,” a useful vagueness that keeps world-rules permeable without breaking. The chamber’s otherworldly tomes finally constrain choice—she must leave when the hour ends—so setting actively shapes the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—find the forgotten repository—but the only tightening is the ticking gravity-inversion clock; her options never visibly narrow. The serpent-seed map removes investigative friction, so pressure plateaus rather than escalates. Cost is postponed to an abstract future “responsibility,” so the beat-to-beat tension stays moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: vigilance as a living seed that must be cultivated, not hoarded. The final image of the archivist smiling over the doodle reweights the symbol without moralizing. Yet the insight remains cerebral; the emotional aftereffect is muted because the personal price is off-stage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the archivist’s scholarly perceptual filter—“prism-minded,” parchment crackle, pattern glimpses—creating a consistent texture. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that breathes during threshold visions. No head-hopping or register drift; voice modulation under pressure is subtle but present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with high information density: “yellowed parchment crackled with age” does double duty for texture and stakes. One scaffold loop appears—“the mist swirled around her” twice in similar cadence—but it doesn’t obscure causality. Metaphors stay coherent; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion library run is fresh, yet the serpent-and-seed symbol feels like standard esoteric shorthand rather than a transformed trope. The threshold-effect rule set is hinted but not explored enough to feel inevitable. Specific scholarly details—prism-mindedness, margin doodle—supply individuality, but the core quest template remains recognizable.</comment>
