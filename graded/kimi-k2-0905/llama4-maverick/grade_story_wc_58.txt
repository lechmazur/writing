<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and consistent—melancholy, morbid, archivist-observer—but the only micro-choice (touching the loose thread) is static; no consequence or higher-stakes fork is forced. The “obituary for the living” premise stays observational rather than tactical, so motivation never tightens. End state is wistful stasis, not renunciation with visible cost. No second character, so relationship/status tests N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the snapped thread puff of dust reweights memory and connection, felt cost legible. Accumulative/textural lens holds—pattern of absence, shadow, thread, lunar glow— Cadence shift at “lunar glow” reframes silence from oppressive to luminous. Orientation clear by line 4; no causality break. However, no prior beat threatens or forecloses an option; escalation is purely atmospheric accumulation, satisfying the lens yet thin on tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Garden is concrete: damp-earth smell, decaying leaves, bench, moonlit shadow geometry. Palace carpet micro-setting works as charged object; its thread physically snaps to spark closure image. Sensory hierarchy suits mourner-observer—visual, olfactory, tactile—but environment never actively blocks or enables a choice; it mirrors mood only. Meets 9+ gate for object charging final image, yet lacks environmental constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is comprehension of “geography of healing,” an abstract want without external pressure or antagonist. No tightening beat narrows options; silence and emptiness accumulate texture but never test commitment. Protagonist’s agency is confined to writing and fondling thread—no fork, no forfeiture. Cost is purely contemplative; fits Accumulative lens yet stays flat on visceral stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence→presence via written memory emerges implicitly through motif chain: empty streets → carpet thread → lunar hush. No explicit thesis, but final dust puff reweights earlier absences into quiet companionship. Subtext operates in image, not declaration. Lacks deeper moral friction; theme is atmospheric rather than dialectic, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains antique, elegiac diction—“morbid perfume,” “lonesome splendor”—consistent with obituary-scribe persona. Syntax lengthens under melancholy, contracts at thread snap, mirroring emotional crest. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on rhythmic, textured narration. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature strong. Elision pattern (absences named but not itemized) taught early and paid off in lunar silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyric cadence occasionally drifts into template stacks—“the silence that echoed… like a mournful sigh,” “beauty that was both haunting and redemptive”—slight metaphor padding but retains clarity. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or interiority. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly. Read-aloud rhythm varies; minor over-modification in adjective pairs but not closure-damaging.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>“Obituaries for the living” is fresh angle on elegy; palace-carpet weft as synecdoche for human connection feels novel yet inevitable. Autumn ghost-town meets shadow-garden palette avoids genre cliché by focalizing through archivist mourner. Risk is lyric stillness over plot, but coherence under Accumulative lens keeps it from gimmick. Could transpose into any melancholic locale, so uniqueness rests on voice-thread fusion, not world.</comment>
