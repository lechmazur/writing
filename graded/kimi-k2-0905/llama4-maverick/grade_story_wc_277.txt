<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Adelaide’s desire to “discover hidden truths” is declared repeatedly but never embodied in a specific, contradictory choice under pressure; she only ponders and descends. The pen nib triggers calm rather than a visible micro-choice that alters tactics; no interior contradiction is dramatized in scene. “Proof by contradiction” stays abstract, so the moment of potential renunciation or cost is summarized, not shown. The result is a motivated stance but no earned change or visible price on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Adelaide smiles into the mist clutching the nib, implying the path ahead has been reweighted. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible. Causal chain, however, is thin: no concrete test of the journalist’s claim occurs; the pen nib’s “power” is asserted, never validated or falsified, so the contradiction exercise is outline-only. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity; transitions smooth; escalation mild but present under situational lens.</comment>

<comment>The observatory-above-clouds locale is economically sketched through drifting mist and cool air; altitude stays consistent and cues Adelaide’s仰头 scan. The pen nib functions as micro-setting: its rosewood warmth is tactile and re-appears in the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. However, environment never actively constrains her choices (exit is always open), so the 9-band gate is missed.</comment>

<comment>Stakes are declared early (empire-toppling scandal) but remain abstract; no concrete risk materializes on the page. Pressure accumulates only as atmospheric swirl and internal rumination; no tightening beat forces a trade-off or narrows options. Escalation is therefore textural/accumulative rather than causal, and the price (determination to act) is emotional but not yet visible or felt. Sufficient for low-plus band but not the sharp cost spike required above 7.</comment>
