<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amira’s grief is vivid and embodied, but the “quiet talent” label is repeated without dramatized contradiction; no micro-choice shows her skill causing risk or cost. The interior monologue stays in generic therapy-speak (“anchor optimism in realism”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. Closure is Earned Stasis yet feels serene rather than costly because no alternative path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl of stillness reweights the stake and the photograph flattens, a visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift from wind-tormented to hush suffices. Orientation anchors (who, when) clear by line 3; lighthouse keeper line is late but functional. Causality is lyric, not because/therefore, allowed under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sea-cliff arboretum is sensuously particular; wind-warped trees mirror her psyche without overt symbol. The photograph and “pearl of stillness” act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial coherence holds as she walks the single path to the cliff edge. Environment constrains perception—salt air narrowed to breath, final orange glow—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she re-enter life after massacre—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: wind dies, internal stillness arrives; this is a single deepening rather than escalation of options. No visible price is paid (no forfeited action or object); cost is conceptual, legible but mild. Agency is receptive (standing, breathing) rather than decisive, sufficient for Accumulative lens but not high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing through desolate nature emerges via recurring wind/tree imagery; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of smooth photograph reweights earlier trauma without moralizing. Ambiguity is present—stillness may be transient—but lacks lingering friction. Subtext stays surface-level; gestures and silence carry some weight yet stop short of irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice maintains consistent perceptual filter: salt air, creak-to-hush acoustic arc. Rhythm modulates with wind intensity; clause length mirrors breathing. No dialogue to test. Free-indirect moments (“trees seemed to be reaching out”) blur toward pathetic fallacy but stay within lyric license. Diction remains within plausible grieving-woman lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong auditory and tactile specificity; sentences advance atmosphere or interiority. Several near-metaphors in one paragraph (“blue-gray silk,” “branding iron”) slightly overcluster yet do not obscure. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts clean. Final line avoids explanatory tag, trusting image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Wedding-drone survivor in windswept arboretum is fresh angle; stillness-as-pearl concept is lovely but not transformative. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric meditation after violent inciting event. Premise could swap names/places yet retains emotional core, keeping score sub-7. Specific coastal botanic detail supplies freshness.</comment>
