<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aria’s death-longing is palpable in her tactile reverence for the emerald and her hush-craving interiority; the “threshold of stillness” functions as an embodied, contradictory motive that crystallizes in the final infusion. Micro-choices—polishing, attuning, coaxing—track an ascending arc from grief to surrender, earning the closing Earned Stasis. Missing only a sharper contradiction under peak pressure to hit the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via the aurora–emerald refraction pattern and held to a resonant CR: the chip’s glow reweights oblivion into transcendent preservation. One seam—why this heirloom matters—is elided, but the final image pays undeniable conceptual cost. Closure is legible and charged; minor causality gap keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto’s crystal lattice and auroral palette are filtered through Aria’s mortician eye for refracted light, constraining her pattern-finding method and charging the final emerald glow. Selective sensory hierarchy (sight, haptic polish, white-noise memory) keeps description lean; spatial choreography stays clean in a single-scene window. Environment directly shapes the stakes—without the aerial aurora the infusion fails—meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture beauty before oblivion—tightens once: the infusion choice narrows her future to “radiant hush” rather than annihilation. Pressure accumulates through density of light/color saturation rather than external blocking; cost is felt when the threshold recedes, leaving her in earned stasis. Sufficient for length, but a second visible forfeiture would push higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transience vs. preservation, beauty as defiance of death. The aurora–emerald motif reframes oblivion into continuity without moralizing. Final image offers resonant CR—glow as fragment of divine—inviting contemplation beyond plot. Complexity acknowledged; ambiguity stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent mortician-poet idiom: precise yet luminous, rhythm modulating with the aurora’s cadence. Filter verbs serve voice (“she searched for hidden patterns”) rather than dull immediacy. No dialogue to judge; perceptual signature remains distinct under pressure. One clause of elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) slips through—minor, non-repeating.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, largely loop-free; figurative language is patterned and paid off. One scaffold pair—“the world around her began to slow… world contracting to a single, shining point”—repeats conceptually; trimming one would sharpen momentum. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo, syntax varied, metaphors internally consistent. Closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Beautician-mortician + sky-grotto aurora lab is a fresh synthesis; pattern-finding in static as method of enchantment feels novel yet inevitable. Risk is present—death-wish protagonist in lyric mode—but not gimmicky. Conceptual payoff re-energizes familiar “beauty against death” template. Could push 9+ with a sharper ontological twist.</comment>
