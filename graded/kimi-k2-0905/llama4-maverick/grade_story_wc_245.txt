<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>A single, nameless blind mapmaker carries the entire interior burden; we get embodied emotion (“skin tingled,” “heart swelled”) and a clear hierarchy of values—stillpoint > safety. Yet the only micro-choice shown is the act of following notes; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the final “understanding” feels announced rather than earned. The tattoos absorb languages, but this trait never constrains or costs on the page; it decorates rather than complicates choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory refrain (“musical notes,” “quiet blaze”) intensifies toward a Charged Poise at the stillpoint. The closure image reweights the premise—mapmaker’s stance toward sorrow is reconfigured—but the cost is only sub-textually felt (“trepidation and wonder”) rather than visible. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. One soft reset: the ring glow is first heirloom, then oracle; the rule shift is un-signaled.</comment>

<comment>Ultrasonic forest is more than backdrop—soundscape directs footsteps and narrows perception to immediacies. Platinum ring re-appears in three tactile beats and charges the final image with blue light; it functions as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean: trees lean, air thickens, distances track. Weather and time-of-night evolve with emotional pitch; no static cataloging. The 9+ gate is met: recurring object constrains final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—emotional navigation of grief—is signaled early and tightens through sensory intensification rather than external opposition. No reversal or trade-off narrows options; escalation is purely textural (louder notes, thicker air). The stillpoint revelation reweights internal knowledge but does not foreclose a path or demand sacrifice, so cost is conceptual, not felt. Agency is limited to attentive walking; protagonist remains largely receptive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief mapped as spatial music—emerges through recurrent motifs (notes, blaze, compass) rather than exposition. Final image crystallizes the equation: external harmony = internal reordering, without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: stillpoint offers insight, not cure. The tattoo language trick never returns to complicate theme, leaving one strand slack.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric maintains stable distance and a synesthetic perceptual signature (“trees sang,” “skin absorbed language”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses at stillpoint approach, longer lyrical coils during constellation pause. No head-hopping; diction stays within mapmaker’s sensorium. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are sparse and voice-motivated. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator meta-talk, not character-think, but it occurs outside narrative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary; no template churn. Information density high—each sentence layers scent, sound, or light. One mixed metaphor cluster: “quiet blaze of discovery and introspection” fuses fire + silence + abstract noun; it recurs four times, dulling impact by closure. Minor simultaneity slip: “raised their face to the sky” while “footsteps slowed” in the same beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences survive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of dowsing, synesthetic cartography, and emotional way-finding is fresh; trope of mystical compass is re-coded as sonic divining rod. Specificity—ultrasonic forest, language-absorbing tattoos—anchors abstraction in lived body. Risk taken with lyric repetition pays off in resonant closure image. Concept would collapse if elements swapped, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
