<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ezra’s “ghost-seeing” plays only a decorative role; she never makes a consequential choice under that pressure. The mainspring barrel beats feel like theme props rather than personal stakes; her interiority shows no contradictory impulse on the page. We are told she is “skillfully observant” but watch her notice dust trails three beats after they have already been described by the narrator. The closure is a soft drift rather than an earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The closure attempts a Charged Poise (she’ll keep hunting stories) but the price is never dramatized—she leaves the office exactly as she entered, toolbox intact, job unaffected. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern reweights meaning at the end; the ghosts simply “fade into the distance,” letting atmosphere substitute for change. The dust-to-logbook reveal is a single coincidence that complicates nothing; it never forces Ezra to act or surrender a live option.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fluorescent “buzz dies” and the skeletal-light image are sharply anchored early; spatial choreography of counter, shelf, and hidden compartment is coherent. Sensory economy favors dust motes and etched metal, but the rest of the circus exterior is only alluded to; ticket stubs and posters stay catalog props without re-use. The mainspring barrel succeeds as micro-setting: handled twice, carried out, humming—meeting the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes are floated but never tightened: “stories to uncover” is an abstract wish, not a concrete liability that can rise or fall. No reversible choice or resource loss occurs; Ezra never risks safety, time, or money. The single micro-turn—finding the logbook—adds knowledge without narrowing options; pressure plateaus. Closure does not crystallize cost under Accumulative lens, because nothing materially changes in her world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>“Cracks hide stories” is declared repeatedly but stays thematic wallpaper; it never becomes an actionable rule or moral dilemma. The mainspring barrel recurs yet its meaning remains decorative rather than repricing any concept on the page. The final smile feels sentimentally safe; ambiguity stays ornamental, not morally complex. No subtextual irony or charged image invites reflection beyond “abandoned places are poignant.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; the diction trades between technical (“horologist’s mainspring barrel,” “logbook entries”) and lyric (“whispers carried away on the wind”) without register drift. Filter verbs are sparse; sensory verbs (“humming,” “drinking in”) keep immediacy. Repetition of “weightless burden” and “cracks” flirts with template cadence but lands intentionally as mantra. The perceptual signature—toolbox clatter, fluorescent hum—gives Ezra a distinct rhythm that survives the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openers shift to keep momentum through the dust-pattern paragraph. Mixed metaphors are avoided, although “overhead fluorescent buzz dies” leans auditory on a visual object. Some scaffold exists in final-paragraph wind/ghost/crowd clustering; it is brief and does not touch closure, so cap harm is minor. High information density in early beats keeps the prose lean; later exposition about financial collapse is summary but justified by logbook device.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elevator tech + ghost seer is a fresh vocational overlay; mainspring barrel as story-key avoids obvious trope. Cracks-as-history motif is familiar, but pairing it with dust-pattern analysis gives the device specificity. The abandoned circus frame is stock, yet the quiet non-horror treatment keeps sentiment unsensational. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no gimmickry, but risk level stays moderate rather than bold.</comment>
