<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The recollectionist’s interior contradiction—joy in the hunt while “cheerful gloom” deepens—lands as performed label-speak rather than embodied tension. Her micro-choice to transliterate feeling into hum is vivid, yet the hum never alters tactics or costs her anything; it’s decorative. Memory-as-stake stays abstract; no visible flaw complicates the search, so the arc feels safe. The crater glass glows but never constrains her next step—an opportunity for tactile cost missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the symbols re-weight the disappearing-path rule with undeniable conceptual cost—“flux is the only constant.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural: seeds → deeper → symbols → re-weighting; each beat layers density rather than forcing a turn. Orientation is nailed inside 50 words; no world-rule break. Yet the re-appearance of the path is narrated, not dramatized on the page, softening the Decisive Change punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The geode’s facets glinting “like a thousand tiny mirrors” is selective, pressure-filtered visual detail that steers her gaze and slows her steps—textbook environment-as-pressure. Body-as-setting is absent, but the crater glass in palm functions as micro-setting: its inner glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no impossible bird-seed scatter. Sensory economy is strong; only visual is over-indexed—other senses could have sharpened the “otherworldly energy.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—is signaled early and deepened by symbol-decoding, a meaningful Accumulative tightening. Yet the cost is purely conceptual; no live option is foreclosed, no tool lost, no path denied to her. Agency is observational: she “deciphers” rather than risks; tension accumulates but never crystallizes into a trade-off. The cheerful gloom tone modulates, but the emotional price stays off-page, capping escalation below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: impermanence as the geode’s own pulse. The final image—crater glass glowing with “inner light”—re-weights prior motifs without moralizing, fulfilling the non-literal answer test. Subtext is thin; the bird-seed mechanic is too overt a cue to “connection,” leaving little implication for the reader to mine. Still, the symbol-set of vanishing paths reframes memory as wave-wash, resisting tidy moral—complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and patterned: long breathy sentences mirror cave resonance; diction stays within recollectionist’s poetic lexicon. Perceptual signature is sharp—“sea-foam recollectionist” notices light, translucency, echo—never generic. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression in “cheerful gloom” is purposeful oxymoron; rhythm modulates with sentence length under pressure. Filter verbs minimal; syntax stays clean. The slight cadence repetition in “as she walked” stems is tolerable under lyric license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Figurative density is high but patterned early—allowed under Accumulative/Textural lens. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “cheerful gloom” is deliberate oxymoron, not contradiction. One paraphrase loop—“the recollectionist felt… the recollectionist’s footsteps”—triggers −0.2. No synonym churn, no template cadence at closure. Information density is strong; each sentence layers image or knowledge without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Premise—“memory hunter inside sentient geode”—is fresh synthesis of fantasy + lyric essay modes. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over causal turns, but coherence holds. Specificity is high; “crater glass” is not a stock artifact. Transformation test fails: core arc could survive with crystal replaced by mirror, recollectionist by cartographer—freshness is texture-deep, not premise-deep. Still, the emotional equation “cheerful gloom = impermanence” feels particular to this voice.</comment>
