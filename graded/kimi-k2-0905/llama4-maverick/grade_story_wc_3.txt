<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s kindly methodical nature is named repeatedly but never costs her anything; the seed glows, she ponders, the mist swirls—no micro-choice shows the trait constricting or enabling action. Interiority drifts into abstract paraphrase (“she began to ponder…”) rather than embodied contradiction. Because the closure is a soft epiphany rather than a renunciation with visible price, the required “earned change with cost” test fails.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “physics of transition” is declared grasped, but the conceptual cost is only asserted (“she felt a deep sense of connection”). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mist/seed/light—but the final reweighting is told, not imaged, so the cost lacks legible charge. Orientation is clear by word 50; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor and mist are sensuously sketched and return as charged image in the last line; seed-as-micro-setting is tracked by its glow-state. Early spatial anchor delivered; only cap is that the environment never actively constrains her body or tactics—she never trips, drops, or orients by it—so 9-band gate not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reestablish the connection between worlds”—is declared early, but escalation is purely atmospheric: mist thins, seed brightens; no concrete option is foreclosed. Agency is contemplative; pressure accumulates texturally but never forces a trade-off or visible price. One micro-turn: seed brightens; no tightening of consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges via arbor/seed/spirit web imagery; no overt moralizing. Final image of arbor “bathed in warm light” reprises the pattern with mild reweighting. Subtext stays shallow because Elara’s internal stakes are never complicated or contradicted—no irony, no counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; diction is consistent, faintly academic to match translator POV. Distinct perceptual signature limited—mostly visual mist and glow; no idiosyncratic metaphor or rhythmic compression. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) cluster near climax, dulling immediacy but remain within voice tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is steady; sentence openings vary. Paraphrase loops recur (“wisps… dissipated into the misty veil,” “mist swirling around her ankles,” “last wisps of mist disappeared”)—three echoes of identical mist image without reweighting, −0.4. No mixed metaphors or heavy scaffold; prose is clean but low-density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fusing cuneiform scholarship with spectral arbor is fresh, yet execution drifts toward generic mystical investigator template. Seed-as-key and “physics of transition” gesture at hard-fantasy angle but remain abstract, unparticularized. Risk is present but doesn’t heighten stakes because cost is undeveloped.</comment>
