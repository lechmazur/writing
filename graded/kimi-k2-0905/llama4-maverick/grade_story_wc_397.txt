<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourist backstory supplies a sharp contradiction—someone who sought death now laboring to clear wreckage—but interiority leans on stock phrases (“sense of detachment,” “haunting me”) and abstract self-diagnosis. Micro-choices are sparse; the pivot from passive observer to shovel-wielding volunteer is declared rather than dramatized with felt cost. The heirloom parasol is gripped but never exerts causal pressure; its lace patterns remain decorative. Earned stasis is hinted at yet the on-page price (cold-blistered hands, social awkwardness with volunteers) is muted, keeping the change more announced than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator stands on the ice, parasol in hand, accepting fragility while hearing “approaching endings.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned cold imagery and solace motif reweight the stake from suicide to attentive living. Causality is loose (why relief work heals is asserted, not shown), but the final image does reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is evoked with vivid, selective sensory hits—creaking dock, stinging air, ice-light reflections that “danced.” Environment acts as tactile crucible: cold narrows perception, forces shared labor, and mirrors internal thaw. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geographic drift. While the parasol is nominally setting, it never constrains action; hence 9+ gate not met, but atmosphere is still immersive and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator re-enter life or stay dissociated—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each day of labor adds sensory vividness and communal warmth, tightening the choice to stay present. No sharp reversal occurs, but the “sound of approaching endings” deepens knowledge, making endurance feel finite and precious. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; option to withdraw lingers but feels foreclosed by the final parasol-clutching image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile renewal emerges through ice imagery and shared labor rather than thesis statements. Subtext rests in silence between volunteers and wind-borne mourning: survival is collective, momentary. Final paragraph risks overt assertion (“cherish every moment”) but retreats into image of creaking ice, letting concrete aftereffect dominate. Ambiguity lingers—peace is “fragile”—avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>First-person voice keeps consistent lyric distance; diction (“windborne solace,” “fold in patience”) poetic but patterned early, so reads as taught. Perceptual signature favors sound and light over bodily detail, fitting dissociated stance. Rhythm lengthens in calmer passages, fragments under cold stress, mirroring thaw. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior voice stays coherent, if occasionally elevated beyond vernacular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, with strong read-aloud cadence and varied paragraph shape. Occasional template cadence (“As I…, I felt…”) recurs every few sentences, dulling momentum; not severe enough to touch closure. Metaphors (“fold in patience”) remain coherent. Information density is high; minimal scaffold. Final third stays clean, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Euthanasia tourist finds post-suicide grace in disaster relief” is fresh; ice-marina locale particularizes the frame. Parasol-as-link between past femininity and present labor offers idiosyncratic prop. Ice acoustics metaphor for mortality avoids cliché. Conceptual combo feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk is emotional rather than structural. Could swap locales with minor edits, so not quite indispensable, but memorable.</comment>
