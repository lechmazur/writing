<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The worker’s interiority is lyrically asserted (“steady hum in the background of their mind”) rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in scene. Actions (climb, hold, close eyes) are ritualized rather than pressured; the final smile feels unearned because no flaw or mistake has complicated the task. The “quantified sorrow” premise is announced, but the worker’s own sorrow is never tested or traded off; thus the renunciation lacks visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Closure is present—the sextant is whole and the worker’s sorrow “dissipate[s]”—but the decisive change is causally opaque: moonlight healing is asserted rather than earned. The pin-drop moment is decorative; it does not tighten options or reweight stakes. Because the lens is lyric-accumulative, a Resonant Reconfiguration could suffice, yet the ending image reprises the same soft lunar glow already used three times, so no new charge lands. Conceptual cost is missing: nothing is foreclosed, and the tower-trees-moon web remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stormlit tower is vividly sketched through sensory selection (damp stone, ozone, wind-driven rain) and filters attention via the worker’s professional gaze. Spatial choreography is loose—how far is the observatory door from the bench?—but not broken. The moon’s silver glow is over-repeated, dulling its final charge. Micro-setting (the sextant’s twisted curves) functions as active object, yet the environment never constrains a choice; the storm merely decorates the ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled early; the task is introduced as vague obligation (“not to repair… but to deconstruct sorrow”). Pressure does not escalate: the storm intensifies externally, but options for the worker do not narrow, deepen, or cost anything. The pin-drop beat is decorative coincidence, not causal trigger. Because no trade-off or price is dramatized, the closure feels like ritual success rather than earned reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “mundane miracles” is stated repeatedly in final paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete stakes. The trees-as-witnesses motif is introduced too late to reweight prior material. Subtext is replaced by lyrical assertion (“sorrow was not just a feeling, but a quantifiable force”). The ending moralizes—“even the most broken things could be made whole”—without having dramatized any irreparable loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature (maintenance worker’s tool-attuned gaze). Diction stays plain, occasionally elevated to poetic register (“lunar light,” “machinery of the universe”) that fits the mythic frame. Rhythm is varied; sentence openings avoid monotony. No dialogue to test naturalism. Filter verbs (“feeling the weight”) are present but not clustered under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade>
<comment>Overwriting clusters in the final third: “silver glow,” “gentle healing power,” “magic of the mundane miracles” repeat the same luminescent abstraction four times, dulling the closure image. Paraphrase loops appear (“the worker smiled, feeling… the worker smiled, feeling…”). Near-simultaneous participles (“As they walked… the sound… echoing”) create timeline fuzz. Metaphors are coherent but generic (“storm of the universe”). Information density is low; many sentences do only one job.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>The “quantified sorrow” concept is fresh, yet its narrative function remains declarative; it neither complicates tactics nor charges the ending. Moonlight healing and labyrinth tending are evocative but fused in broad, archetypal strokes rather than specific world logic. Risk is modest—lyric accumulation而非causal innovation. Transformation test fails: rename “worker” to “wizard” and tower to “citadel,” arc still works unchanged.</comment>
