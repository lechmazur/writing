<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The star watcher’s interiority is lyrically sustained but largely static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the final “stillness” feels pre-decided rather than earned. Micro-choices (polishing strokes) recur but never tilt present risk or foreclose an alternative path. The absence of any second character keeps pressure purely spectral; status and relationship crucibles are inapplicable. Still, the sustained perceptual signature keeps the portrait above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the polished glass becomes a “beacon” that reframes the quest from fire-less sharing to embodied radiance; cost is felt in the final “pearl of tranquility” image. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each polishing stroke deepens pattern rather than forcing external turns—and the lens holds. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. The missing middle escalation (no visible failure or trade-off) keeps it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Grotto, mist, damp stone, and salt tang are filtered through the watcher’s gem-polishing attention; the bench’s proximity to the wheel and the glass’s changing facets supply micro-setting that directly shapes action. Spatial choreography is invisible (no body moves more than arms), but the object-as-setting test is met: the sea glass’s evolving surface charges the final beacon image. Sensory economy is strong—only two smells, two sounds, one touch—each reused to signal cadence shifts. No environment-forcing tactical change, so 9+ gate missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“share stillness without fire”—is signaled early but never tested by external resistance or resource loss; pressure is internal and steady-state. The single meaningful intensification is the glass’s final gleam, a visual deepening rather than an option-narrowing turn. No credible loss or forfeiture is dramatized; cost is purely conceptual. Under Accumulative lens this suffices for one tightening, yet the absence of felt price caps it below 7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated glass–light–stillness imagery rather than statement; the final “zephyr bloom” reweights stillness as active radiance, achieving quiet Conceptual Repricing. No character articulates a thesis, avoiding thematic-echo penalty. Ambiguity is preserved: is shared stillness solace or solipsism? Particulars (salt mist, gem dust, zephyr) resist generic abstraction. Lack of external stakes keeps resonance mid-high rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains close to sensorial ground, never drifting into abstract psychobabble. Syntax lengthens and shortens with polishing rhythm, teaching a repeatable cadence that pays off in the final hush. Diction stays within star-watcher lexicon (“luminescence,” “facets,” “zephyr”) without thesaurus drift. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk; perceptual signature is distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only “soft luminescence” repeats twice and is forgiven as motif reinforcement. Metaphors (pearl, bloom, zephyr) cohere around light-botanical axis without mixed logic. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or action. Rhythm breathes naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. A single paraphrase loop (“the star watcher’s presence seemed to embody…”) keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses coastal grotto hermitage with gem-polished light-sharing—fresh enough, yet the plot arc is a straight rise to success with no setback or inventive twist. Sea-glass-beacon recasting is satisfying but not conceptually surprising. Emotional specificity (salt-mist solitude) lifts it above generic zen vignette. Risk is moderate; bolder structural or ethical complication could have pushed higher.</comment>
