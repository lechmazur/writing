<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is lyric but generic—“molting personalities” is asserted, never shown in scene; no embodied contradiction under pressure. The only micro-choice is entering the library, yet it carries no visible trade-off or cost. Friendship with the prisoner is summarized, not dramatized, so motivation stays abstract. Closure relies on declarative hope rather than earned renunciation or stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlight and rust imagery recur, culminating in dawn-lit library rebirth; the pattern is legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the city’s future, but the cost is only asserted (“the city was not yet saved”). Orientation clear by 120 words; no因果 breaks, yet escalation is gentle—no tightening beat forecloses an option. The final uplift feels predetermined, not paid for.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory selection favors metallic decay (rust, hinges, tin) and lunar silver; details are filtered through the poet’s salvage aesthetic. Library steps, moon angle, and interior debris track spatially. Micro-setting (coffee tin) doubles as talisman and secret box, but its false bottom is never used tactically—missed constraint opportunity. Atmosphere supports theme of beauty-from-ruin without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—library rebirth as resistance beacon—is signaled early. Pressure is situational: decayed space vs. creative will; no external antagonist. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poet steps inside and the hinge creaks, symbolically accepting stewardship. Cost is conceptual (endless work) rather than tangible; absence of a concrete forfeiture keeps escalation muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration-through-art emerges organically from rust-to-phoenix imagery; no overt thesis statement. Subtext resides in the tin’s hidden layers and the unspoken prisoner’s absence—beauty forged from what society discards. Final dawn image offers quiet Conceptual Repricing: knowledge that rebuilding is Sisyphean yet chosen. avoids moralizing, but abstraction limits aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence; diction (“molting personalities,” “luminous fracture”) is poetic but self-consciously prompt-aligned. Perceptual signature is selective decay-metallic, moon-observant. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Internal register stays within poet’s plausible lexicon; occasional template stems (“the poet’s thoughts turned…”) dull texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary. Figurative layering is dense but patterned (moon/rust/light) and supports texture—does not obscure causality. Two paraphrase loops (“the poet’s thoughts turned…”) and one filter-verb cluster cost −0.4. No scaffolding or mixed metaphors in closure beat; ending image is clean. High density, but poetic repetition approaches artifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Combines vagrant-poet, false-bottom tin, and personality-molting into one persona feels inventive, yet “penny poet” and “forge beauty from anarchy” echo familiar bohemian tropes. Library-as-resistance-hub freshens the setup. No close plagiarized lines. Risk is moderate—lyric montage rather than plot daring—so no bonus. Synthesis is smooth but not startlingly non-obvious.</comment>
