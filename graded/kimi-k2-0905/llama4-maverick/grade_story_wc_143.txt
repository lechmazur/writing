<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “purposefully curious” label is repeated but never tested against a contradicting impulse; she never hesitates or refrains. No interior contradiction under pressure, so the trait feels decorative. The emotional beat at the sight of the flora is summarized (“eyes stung with unshed tears”) rather than embodied. Earned stasis is present but the cost is generic, not tied to a specific character flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the grain returned to the summit reweights time and transience. Causal chain is thin—Patel’s timed message is off-stage catalyst, not a because/therefore turn. Orientation clean by word 60. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the chemical timer is mentioned but never limits her choices on the page. Closure cost is felt yet abstract, not linked to a prior concrete stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Moonlit summit is vividly anchored through camera placement, crater shadows, and low-gravity motion. Light shifts drive shot timing, integrating setting into tactic. Micro-setting object—the grain—charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Occasional tourist-catalog phrasing (“vast, barren expanse”) but sensory selection mostly filtered through inspector’s lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—document flora before it vanishes—is declared early but never tightens; no visible resource is risked or lost. Escalation is purely atmospheric (dawn light improves) rather than option-narrowing. Agency is observational: she takes photos on a schedule that never slips. No price is paid on the page; outlasting the night is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Transience vs preservation emerges through image chain: translucent petals, dissolving message, sand grain returned. Avoids explicit moralizing, but theme is still spelled out in final paragraphs (“poignant reminder…”) rather than left to reverberate. Grain reprise offers modest reweighting. Emotional aftereffect is gentle; lacks unsettling ambiguity that would push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice sustains a hush cadence that mirrors vacuum stillness. Perceptual signature is consistent—technical camera terms, lunar light jargon. No dialogue to test distinction. Occasional register drift into poetic abstraction (“reverberate through every molecule”) but fits the accumulative/textural lens. Rhythm breathes with light changes; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variation, and selective detail. Density high: many sentences do double duty. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent. Minor scaffold: “the stillness…a dawning hush” is reprised almost verbatim; also “beauty that could be found…” appears twice. Loops do not touch closure, so cap remains modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lunar botanist photographing the last bloom is fresh; hourglass grain as time relic is lovely. Yet the narrative arc—arrive, shoot, leave—remains a travelogue with no reversal. Conceptual risk is low; no rule twist or ethical fracture. Execution is competent but not transformative; premise could swap names and planet with minimal change.</comment>
