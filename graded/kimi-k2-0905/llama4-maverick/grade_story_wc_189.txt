<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The chronicler’s interiority is lyrically articulated, but her motives stay abstract—“desire to discover the texture of time” never bites into a concrete want or fear. Because she only watches, no micro-choice under pressure tests contradiction or cost; the closing stance is unchanged, so no earned renunciation. The jade cicada never alters her action, and the frozen couple’s tension is observed, not interacted with, leaving the relationship crucible unused.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: dawn light crystallizes the observer’s charged poise, paying off the cicada motif with felt cost—she leaves the timeless grotto carrying transformation in hand. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starlight, dripping water, and insect hum accrue until the cadence shift at daybreak reweights the stake. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causal break. Deduction for late-onset agency: the decisive change is purely tonal, not action-forced, so the cost is atmospheric, not personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting prevails: damp stone, salt reek, and star-speckled roof are filtered through the chronicler’s sensory bias. The grotto’s spatial logic stays coherent; bodies never float, props never teleport. Starlight-as-lantern and dripping-water metronome both constrain perception and supply the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Lost top decimal because the couple’s staging is sketched only relative to “across,” leaving distance and exit path under-defined.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is epistemic—will she grasp the texture of time inside this pause—but it remains cerebral, never tightened by an external test or forfeiture. Pressure is ambient: the couple’s unresolved conversation is scenery, not a threat that narrows her options. No visible price is exacted; her vigil ends at sunrise unchanged except in mood. Escalation is therefore atmospheric, not tactical.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: transition as lived suspension is rendered through sensory particulars, not thesis. Cicada, starlight, and dripping water quietly braid into a single motif of cyclical change; final image of dawn re-prices the night’s stillness without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on observant passivity itself as valid stance—complex ambiguity intact. Lost top tier because the insight remains general, not sharpened by a specific personal loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to the chronicler’s perceptual signature—salt-heavy air, cricket hum, “tangential” thought loops—rendered in rhythmic, tidal syntax. No head-hop; diction stays within her contemplative register. Filter verbs (“she pondered,” “she considered”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue absent, correctly ignored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence length undulates like breathing, mirroring tidal imagery. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; modifiers are sparse, nouns concrete. A single mixed metaphor—“luminescence of starlight filtering” (starlight doesn’t filter, gaps do) yields micro-ding. Otherwise clean, vivid, read-aloud ready.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Premise turns familiar trope—wise observer in cave—into textured accumulative vignette, not plot. Freshness lies in privileging pause over event; stillness becomes dramatic. Specificity of tidal-pool chronicler as vocation and cicada-as-lens supplies idiosyncratic detail, but risk is modest—no structural or POV gamble. Slight deduction for echo of “starlit ancient place” stock image not fully inverted.</comment>
