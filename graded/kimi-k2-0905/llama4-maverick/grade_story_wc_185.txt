<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete—her tactile engagement with the echo chamber stone and the way crack‐patterns guide her listening show a believable occupational mind. Contradictory impulses are present (dread of din vs compulsion to map) but remain summarized rather than enacted in a single pressured beat. The final stance—she will “continue to tend the bloom”—is a credible renunciation of rest, yet the cost feels announced (“she felt a sense of satisfaction”) rather than embodied. Voice stays consistent and specific; no stock therapy-speak, but emotional peaks could use more bodily specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Earned Stasis: the caves settle into “hammered repose” and she accepts perpetual guardianship; the hush lands with conceptual cost—her life’s labor is now endless caretaking. Causality is accumulative/textural: each examination of ice cracks incrementally attunes the cave until the bloom emerges; the lens holds. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3 and remain stable. One soft spot: the energy beings’ sudden attunement is asserted rather than shown, a micro-break in texture, but it does not rupture the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is evoked through selective sensory detail—ice crack symmetries, luminous rock, vibrational timbres—always filtered by the mapkeeper’s professional gaze. The harmonic caves function as both environment and instrument: their resonance shapes her tactics and is re-shaped by her, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible shifts. One missed opportunity: temperature is never felt although ice is omnipresent, a small gap under immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation rather than external opposition. Pressure escalates as crack patterns shift, forcing her to refine attention; the bloom’s arrival forecloses the option to leave the caves untended. Cost is conceptual but legible: lifelong vigilance exchanged for momentary hush. Agency is interior and observational, fitting the accumulative lens; a more visceral price (hearing loss, frost-nip) would have pushed this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: balance is not a state but a perpetual tuning. The bloom of hush reweights the premise—silence is not escape but responsibility—yet the insight is lightly paraphrased in the final paragraph (“she would continue to tend”), a minor echo-violation. Subtext operates in the stone’s pulse and the rocks’ “hammered repose,” avoiding overt moralizing. Complexity is present; no tidy binary between noise and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly fused to the mapkeeper’s perceptual grammar—cracks are “read” as sheet music, vibrations “taste” of metal. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during scan-work, clipped fragments when hush blooms, mirroring her narrowing attention. No head-hopping; diction stays within her technic idiom. One tiny register drift: “delicate balance of the harmonic caves” sounds like exposition rather than her vernacular, but it is isolated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences do two jobs (“She held the stone, feeling its soothing vibrations, and began to examine…”). Figurative language is controlled—only two metaphors in final third, both paying off earlier motifs. No loops or scaffold; spatial/temporal sequences are clear. A single mixed micro-image: “rocks… being shaped by the vibrations into a state of tranquil equilibrium” implies external sculptor rather than internal resonance, but it does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses geologic listening with alien acoustics—fresh without gimmickry. The ripple-mark mapkeeper feels like a vocation invented for this cave alone. Risk is taken in quiet, observational climax rather than confrontation, and it pays off. Could edge higher if the energy beings’ perspective offered a brief, unknowable fragment to sharpen the asymmetry.</comment>
