<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Luna’s affectionate skepticism animates the opening beats—the geode is “carefully examined,” the telepathy recall is “fascinated and intimidated”—but the interiority soon drifts into poetic labels (“willowglass hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. The geode-in-hand anchors micro-choices until the static shock recalibrates perception, yet the later “danced between the light sources” feels performed rather than pressured. A visible cost is present—the pill supply is gone—but the final smile is serene rather than charged by the earlier risk. Still, the single-POV voice stays particular and the motivation is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—each sensory layer (scent, tingle, glow) thickens the creative trance—and lands a Charged Poise closure: the dawn-lit painting is a crystallized final image that reweights the stake, with the geode still clutched as undeniable residual cost. Causality is internal but coherent: recall → geode proxy → static jolt → recalibrated sight → new paintings. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3. Minor loop risk: “delicate, glittering shard” and “delicate, glittering beauty” echo, but the closure image is not dulled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The studio is sketched with purposeful economy: linseed oil and turpentine anchor olfactory memory, static shock provides tactile immediacy, and the geode sliver functions as micro-setting that literally refracts the light beams she paints with. Spatial choreography is clean—body traces patterns between light sources—and the environment evolves as the glow intensifies. No extraneous brand lists or tourist catalog. The light-painting tech remains plausible without over-exposition. Strong gate pass: the geode-as-tool directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to collective unconscious after pill recall—is signaled early and tightens once: the geode must substitute or she loses her channel. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each sensory layer (scent → tingle → glow) ups the ante until the static shock delivers the single meaningful deepening that recalibrates perception. Cost is conceptual—the recall forecloses the chemical path—but the on-page price is mostly opportunity loss rather than felt forfeiture, keeping it below the 8.0 band. No reversal or trade-off beyond the shock moment; pressure plateaus after that.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of art-as-technology for inner mapping emerges organically via the geode-light interface; no final moral is stated. The telepathy recall serves as conceptual repricing of risk, but the story resists simplifying the ethical question. Subtext lives in sensory implication rather than overt assertion. The “willowglass hope” label verges on thematic echo but is saved by its fragility being enacted in the delicate final image. Sufficient ambiguity lingers without drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Voice carries artist-scientist perceptual signature—“fractally precise structure,” “somatic markers”—without register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer meditative sentences build trance, then shorter clause bursts (“The studio around her melted away”) mimic shock recalibration. No dialogue to judge. Internal diction stays within Luna’s plausible lexicon. Patterned repetition (“delicate, glittering”) is mild and does not contaminate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with natural sentence-length variation; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory or emotional data without scaffold. No paraphrase loops or simultaneity errors. Metaphors are coherent (“sea of mental images”) and do not stack in closing beats. Minor template echo of “delicate, glittering” but it never obscures causality or the closure image. Proofing is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of muscovite optics with telepathy-recall aftermath feels fresh; the geode as DIY cognitive prosthesis is a novel angle. Tropes of “artist taps unconscious” are transformed through material science specificity and somatic-marker mechanics. Risk is present—lyric accumulative structure could have sagged—but coherence holds. No close echoes of famous scenes. Conceptual integrity intact: follows the premise that mineral refraction can replace chemical telepathy without late rule cheat.</comment>
