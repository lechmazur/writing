<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael’s observing-only method keeps him passive; the stranger is a cipher, so the relationship crucible is absent. Interiority is atmospheric (“witnessed isolation”) rather than contradictory or embodied. The final clutching of the boutonnière is a micro-choice, but it is the first; prior beats are surveillance, not decisions. Enough for a low-mid 6 band, not the 8+ needed for elite immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the lighthouse-as-memory-bank motif accretes via repeated gaze and mist, but the pattern is taught late (~40% in) and the closure is a soft Charged Poise—Kael holds the flower, no new option closed. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The missing decisive change or felt cost keeps this below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mist, salt, dock planks, and lighthouse glass are viscerally filtered through Kael’s mariner senses. The boutonnière acts as micro-setting, its brittle petals grounding the final image. Spatial tracking is clean; the stranger never drifts out of sight-line. Setting does not constrain tactics, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will Kael decode the gesture?”—is announced early but never tightens; no reversal or cost materializes. Pressure is atmospheric (mist, solitude) not causal; the stranger leaves on his own schedule. No visible price is paid by Kael, so the 8-band entry gate remains locked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Borrowed-memory concept seeds theme, but it stays speculative meta-commentary rather than dramatized dilemma. The Edelweiss reprise supplies quiet irony—memory object becomes keepsake—but Kael’s worldview is unchanged. Subtext is present yet thin; no moral repricing or stance shift lands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays anchored to Kael’s salty perceptual lens; no POV slippage. Syntax is controlled, with sentence-length undulation that breathes with tide and fog. Diction occasionally drifts toward literate-elevated (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) beyond a dock-keeper’s lexicon, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is supple; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is restrained, but two mixed metaphors (“repository of memories,” “echoing chamber”) momentarily blur the lighthouse’s logic. Information density is high; only micro-hedges (“perhaps,” “for a moment”) dilute propulsion. Clean copy, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Moody lighthouse-memory trope is familiar; freshness comes from nautical-twilight timing and the Edelweiss-as-key choice. Risk level is moderate—lyric accretion over plot—but the concept remains abstract. Specific sensory detail keeps it from template mediocrity, yet no transformative turn shocks the material into rarity.</comment>
