<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aria’s “perpetually learning” trait stays ornamental; only one embodied micro-choice (cleaning the slide) is dramatized. Interiority loops: “she felt a sense of…wonder” repeats four times with no contradictory impulse or cost. No relational crucible; archway and slide supply pressure, yet Aria’s stance at exit mirrors her entry—no visible renunciation or loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a soft CR: the sculpture “stood as a testament” reweights prior material, but the conceptual cost is asserted, not dramatized. Causal chain: GPS failure → find slide → make sculpture; the slide never constrains later tactics, so the final image feels coincidental. Orientation clean by word 80; no lens contradiction, yet escalation flatlines after slide discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Storm-archway and salt-etched stone are vividly tactile and filter through Aria’s sculptor eye. Slide-as-micro-setting qualifies: its glint amid wrack draws her hand, later its glow colors the sculpture’s form. Spatial choreography clean; weather stays causally linked to mood but never blocks or endangers action—pressure remains decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“unlock the secrets”) is declared, yet slide never resists or demands sacrifice; tension is cerebral. Single micro-turn: slide discovery narrows focus, but no subsequent trade-off or visible price. Escalation quoted, not felt: “creative energies surging” is summary, not on-page obstacle. Closure lacks persistent constraint; sculpture costs nothing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of “timewoven alliances” emerges via slide–sea–sculpture triad, but delivered in contiguous abstract nouns rather than image. Final paragraph’s “hidden patterns” sermonizes what the scene already showed. Subtext absent; no gesture or silence reconfigures meaning. Still, particulars stay coherent and resist tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third lyrical–free-indirect hovers close to Aria’s sensory filter; diction (“turbine-hum reverie”) is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Syntax loosens into accumulative cadence that mirrors tidal wash—pattern taught early and paid off in final line. No dialogue, hence no voice collision. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing) intrudes but remains within Aria’s artist lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Loop screen flags: “she felt a sense of…” ×4; “the slide seemed…” ×3; −0.6. Mixed metaphor cluster: “turmoil of the sea and the stillness…combining to reimagine the world anew” −0.3. Info density moderate; several sentences perform only atmospheric duty. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Freshened combo: failed GPS → storm-archway → magic lantern slide driftwood sculpture yields non-obvious synthesis. Slide-as-catalyst avoids cliché; sculptor POV lends tactile specificity. Risk is moderate; accumulative lyric structure rather than twist. Could swap “forest glade” slide for any image with minor edits—irreplaceability moderate.</comment>
