<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seer’s interiority is textured—“tactile sense that guided her,” “inexplicable jolt of recognition”—but emotions stay performative (“she knew,” “she felt”) rather than embodied under pressure. Motivation (shape a new reality) is declared not dramatized; the final renunciation lacks on-page cost. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; decisions happen in summary. Still, the mercury-glass identity and buried-talent premise create a memorable, specific consciousness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bookstore becomes a “threshold to new possibilities” and the stone stays changed, both legible. Cost is implied (“she vanished”) but not felt on the page; no persistent price shapes tactics. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of glyphs, shadows, thunder—held to the end. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no causal break but escalation is soft, not sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is vividly realized—“shelves upon shelves…casting long shadows”—and the stone’s shimmer re-appears to charge the final image, meeting 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through seer-perception. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Tone sustains mystical antiquity without drifting into tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock forgotten truth via stone—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening: visions reveal post-memory pain, narrowing options to “seed a new reality.” Agency sits with the seer, but cost is conceptual, not visceral. Escalation is textural (glow, thunder, shadow coalescence) rather than a forced trade-off.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as wound, home as crafted reality—emerges through imagery, never sermonized. The stone’s shift from relic to catalyst reweights meaning. Subtext lingers in “hidden thunder,” inviting reflection. Ambiguity is purposeful, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent archaic-mystic register: “labyrinthine,” “heady aroma,” “whispered promises.” Syntax elongates to mirror contemplative drift, then tightens at the touch beat. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature—seer’s tactile divination—remains distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace; clauses mirror mounting awe without algorithmic pattern. Information density high—each sentence layers scent, light, myth. Two soft loops: “labyrinthine bookstore” echoed close together; “hidden thunder” thrice, but pattern feels ritual, not artifact. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fusion of bibliophilia, divination, and reality-seeding feels fresh; not a shelved trope. The mercury-glass seer and language-stone are specific inventions, not generic archetypes. Conceptual risk—lyric, low-plot metaphysics—pays off in resonant final image. Could edge higher if cost were physically tasted rather than philosophically implied.</comment>
