<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s past as a body-finder is evoked only through nostril-memory; no present-scene contradiction or micro-choice is driven by that history. Lyra’s scavenger expertise is asserted, not embodied in split-second tool use or status negotiation. The pair’s bond deepens, but the emotional cost is borne by landscape description (“eyes shining with gratitude”) rather than an irreversible renunciation or visible flaw collision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: wax-leaf sensation → riddle cue → phonograph decode → spring found, each step because/therefore. Cost is soft: fatigue is summarized, the spring arrives as gift rather than earned forfeiture, and the closure image (“wax orb glowed”) reprises motif without crystallizing a new constraint. Orientation clear by line 8; no lens ambiguity; meets 600-word single-scene default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Scrapyard Krael is sketched with sensory triangulation: rust hulks, creosote air, gravel crunch underfoot. The tanker-truck shade and phonograph grooves are tactile micro-settings that guide the riddle solve. Environment never blocks or weaponizes choice, so constraint test for 9+ unmet, but specificity remains vivid and POV-filtered throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the spring to revive the wasteland”—is declared late but coherent. One meaningful tightening: riddle forces phonograph re-examination, narrowing search path. Cost is implied (long walk, thirst) rather than dramatized; spring discovery feels fortunate, not purchased by irreversible loss. Agency stays with Lyra/Kael, so escalation holds under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through concrete pattern: preserved leaf ↔ hidden spring, both tiny life inside dead shell. Final orange sunset echoes leaf hue, reweighting prior image without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit; no character utters “hope” or “renewal.” The emotional aftereffect is gentle relief rather than complex ambiguity, keeping score just below 7.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Kael’s nose-and-jaw perceptions; diction (“nostrils,” “jaws,” “twitching”) stays canine-apt. Rhythm swells in lyrical cadence (“wild hush,” “kaleidoscope of rust”) yet remains readable. No dialogue to test naturalism; sensory filter repeats “twitched/sniffed” but not enough to blunt immediacy. Voice distinct enough to avoid committee average.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean but leans on abstract pairings (“inexplicable tug,” “sense of connection”) where concrete gesture could stand. Several echo stems: “As they…/As the…” opens three sentences in forty words. No mixed metaphor or scaffold loops in closure beat; momentum stays steady. Read-aloud rhythm pleasant, yet information density rarely doubles duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic scavenger quest for lost oasis is familiar, but leaf-in-wax as living map and phonograph groove as cipher add fresh tactile mechanics. Transformative angle modest: the spring’s existence is confirmed, not subverted. Specific sensory detail keeps template from feeling generic; nevertheless, plot arc could transplant intact to another ruined future without loss of logic.</comment>
