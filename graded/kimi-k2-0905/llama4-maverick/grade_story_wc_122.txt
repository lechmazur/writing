<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s deafness and emotional numbness are stated, not embodied; her only micro-choice is stroking a drum while humming. No contradictory impulse or visible cost appears, so the “earned” hush feels asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric assertion (“she knew she would never let it go”) without on-page cost or decisive change; the lens is Accumulative/Textural but the final cadence merely restates earlier imagery, offering no new reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cavern’s damp-earth scent and worn tool handles are tactile and specific; the drum skin’s vibration under Aria’s fingers supplies micro-setting that mirrors her interior state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stakes—defeat numbness—stay abstract; no tightening beat narrows options or forces trade-off. The seasons’ “rustle” is decorative coincidence rather than rising pressure, so escalation remains flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-healing emerges through sensory pattern, yet the final paragraph spells it out (“beauty of a world without sound”), blunting subtext and capping resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Aria’s tactile perception; rhythmic repetition (“as the seasons turned”) is purposeful, creating incantatory texture that suits the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lovely individual phrases, but scaffold loops (“the cavern was…”) and stacked abstract nouns (“sense of wonder,” “filament of hush”) dilute momentum; a tighter cut would sharpen the cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reversed phonograph grooves as silent soul-language is fresh; the deaf musician seeking hush rather than sound flips expectation, though the beat never complicates or endangers the premise.</comment>
