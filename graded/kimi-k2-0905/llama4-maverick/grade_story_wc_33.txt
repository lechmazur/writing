<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but abstract—“desire to find where broken promises heal” is thematic label-speak, not embodied contradiction. One micro-choice (crossing the border) exists, yet the cost is under-felt; the bottle’s transfer carries more charge than his stake. Still, the rebel-mailman persona is consistent and the job ethic under drone peril is believable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is slim but intact: curiosity → covert crossing → hand-off; closure lands as “small step toward healing,” a Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier talk of promises. The “linking absences” gimmick is asserted rather than shown and never tested under pressure, so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal. Cost is soft—no concrete forfeiture on page—holding it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Cobalt arcade” and “smuggling drone border” are evocative place tags; neon against twilight gives immediate visual texture. Micro-setting works: bottle-as-storm object becomes the tactile pivot. Spatial track stays clean—no impossible drone moves or teleporting props. The world never constrains a later tactic, so it falls short of 9+ gating requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes—deliver contraband bottle across drone line—are signaled early and tightened once: he waits for sensor drift, then sprints. That single beat carries visible risk; afterwards pressure plateaus rather than deepening. Escalation is minimal; no secondary trade-off or loss appears, so the story qualifies for “one meaningful tightening” but not the felt-price band above 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Redemption-through-delivery theme emerges implicitly via the bottle-storm metaphor; it avoids explicit moral. Final image re-casts arcade neon as “brighter,” a quiet reconfiguration. Ambiguity is present yet shallow because the mailman’s interior is mostly emblematic. Still, no thesis statement or echo cliché drags it down.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic repetition that suits twilight mood. Filtering is light, diction poetic but not purple; no head-hop issues. Distinct perceptual signature is moderate—generic noir cadence rather than idiosyncratic mind. Clean dialogue-free execution keeps mechanics invisible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variance good. Occasional template stems—“the mailman…,” “the thunderstorm…”—recur without pattern payoff, minor loop debit. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density decent; some lines perform only atmospheric duty. No artifact touches closure, so holds low-7 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Storm-in-bottle plus drone-border is a fresh mash-up; vending-storm trope is old but recontextualized within courier noir. Conceptual risk is modest, not structurally daring. Specificity of “linking absences” method remains vague, blunting ingenuity. Still, the blend feels singular enough to stand out in a slush pile.</comment>
