<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Aurora’s pacifism is stated but never pressure-tested; she drifts rather than chooses, so her “steadfast” trait stays abstract. The micro-choice to sew is gentle but not morally freighted, so interior contradiction never ignites. Closure feels serene rather than costly because the locked dimension opens without her having to betray any value. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with a visible price.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens: each stitched photograph adds density until the final image reframes the ship’s emptiness. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors hold. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kwan Yin’s Tear floats, the dimension cracks open, cost is the flood of ancestral grief she must now carry. Causality is lyrical, not sequential, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The recycled ship is evoked through tactile detail—worn metal, dried tears, needle glint—rather than exposition. Micro-setting (the necklace, the photograph edge) constrains the sewing action and charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight: every visual or haptic note either impedes or enables the stitch. No postcard drift; place is felt through fingertip and memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlock a dimension—remains abstract; pressure is poetic but not tactical. Escalation is a slow accretion of memory, not a narrowing of options. No visible price is exacted from Aurora; the opening feels gift-like, not loss-like. Under Accumulative lens the deepening is sufficient, but cost is too diffuse to reach high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of compassion as trans-temporal repair emerges through the sewing motif rather than statement. Subtext is carried in the shimmer of tears, the floating necklace—silence does the arguing. Final image reweights the ship from tomb to cradle without moralizing. Resonance is quiet but intact; ambiguity lingers about what Aurora will meet beyond the door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual bias—Aurora notices weight, light, fabric, not tech specs. Rhythm swells and subsides with the stitching cadence; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within pacifist gentleness: “soft,” “glimmer,” “shimmer,” never militaristic. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged on narrative texture alone and passes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, loop-free; sentence length modulates to mimic breath of sewing. No scaffold, no metaphor muddle. Occasional elevated phrases—“uncharted possibilities,” “indomitable will”—flare slightly above grounded lexis but do not stall momentum. Final line lands with image, not explanation, satisfying read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Splicing Buddhist iconography with dying-generation-ship is fresh; tear that lightens with happiness is a specific physics-of-emotion tweak. Shadow-work-as-photography-repair reconfigures clichéd “memory palace” into tactile craft. Conceptual integrity holds: the story commits to gentle pacifist sci-fi and never lapses into war tropes. Risk is moderate; transformation sufficient but not groundbreaking.</comment>
