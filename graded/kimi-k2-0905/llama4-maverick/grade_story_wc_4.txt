<comment>Luna’s “perceptively calm” trait is named repeatedly but never tested; she never mis-reads a clue, hesitates, or pays a price for her calm. No contradictory impulse or micro-choice reveals interior tension, so the portrait stays flat. The “collective healing” motive is asserted, not dramatized—no moment shows her refusing an easier path or risking failure. Earned stasis is absent; the ending serenity feels pre-ordained, not purchased.</comment>

<comment>The piece is Accumulative/Textural: static lyric tableaux build mood until a Charged Poise closes on the glowing empty map case. Location and POV are clear within 120 words; no orientation debt. However, the only escalation is the sun setting and vines continuing to climb—external, not protagonist-driven. Closure lands as a resonant image but no causal constraint or cost is legible; Luna loses nothing, forfeits nothing, and faces no fork.</comment>

<comment>Lavender/rust dichotomy is vividly filtered through Luna’s photographer’s eye: scent, color, rust flakes on lens, bees humming. The factory ruins function as micro-setting: broken windows frame shots, vines snake into foreground, guiding composition choices. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The setting charges the final image—the empty map case glows against the purple rows—meeting the 9+ gate, but the absence of any tactical constraint (she never needs a vantage, risks a fall, or loses access) keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“transmute pain into a masterpiece”—is declared early but never tested; no obstacle or time pressure materializes. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off occurs; the only “escalation” is sunset. Cost is zero: film is unlimited, light is perfect, mood stays serene. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern intensifies mood but does not reweight options or foreclose paths; closure feels incidental rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing-through-art emerges through recurrent lavender/rust juxtaposition rather than explicit statement. The closing image of the glowing empty case offers a quiet conceptual reprice: the tool is spent, implying labor completed. Whimsy is present but earnestness dominates, softening edge. No late moralizing; theme stays implicit. However, because no pain is named or dramatized, the transmutation remains abstract, limiting resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Luna’s photographer perception: light values, scent, aperture decisions. Sentence rhythm mimics slow looking—long, breathy clauses that dilate attention. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within her lexicon. Voice modulates once: shorter clauses at sunset (“She paused. The light danced.”), showing pressured awe. Clean throughout; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but restrained; no metaphor chains or purple overload. Information density is high—each sentence layers scent, color, sound, or emotional valence. Repetition is intentional (“As she walked…”) to create incantatory cadence; no synonym loops. Closing line is crisp, satisfying ear-test. Minor scaffold: “the dove gray map case” is repeated four times with identical epithet; trims −0.2. Still, clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Post-industrial lavender field is fresh as visual premise, and linking摄影 to healing offers gentle twist. Yet the narrative arc—serene artist enters pretty ruin, takes photos, leaves serene—is predictable; no risk taken structurally or morally. Whimsy tone could have subverted the healing trope but instead reaffirms it. Specificity of photographer’s sensorial attention keeps it from feeling generic, but transformation test fails: swap any calm artist, outcome identical.</comment>
