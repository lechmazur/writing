<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria’s quietly rebellious streak surfaces only in the drumming; the treatment’s promised memory-untangling stays off-page, so her interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized. The “auroral sorrow” is repeated emotion-labeling without bodily cost. Still, the final renunciation of the fading light lands as a credible Earned Stasis, legible because her earlier drumming tried to freeze time.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the dimmed lagoon re-weights the shared dream with undeniable conceptual loss. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each drumming beat intensifies the glow until the inevitable fade—so the lens holds. The Orientation Test is passed by word 40. No tangible prop or price alters tactics, so the resonance is aesthetic rather than consequential.</comment>

<comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop; its metallic petals vibrate under Aria’s taps, guiding her tempo and literally amplifying the lagoon’s response. Sensory selection stays narrow—sound and light dominate—mirroring her narrowed attention under treatment. Spatial choreography is clean: she “steps down from the perch” and the garden’s whisper trails her exit, tying the micro-setting to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“breathe life into a shared dream”—is declared early but never tested by failure or sacrifice; escalation is purely atmospheric (glow brightens, then dims). The only tightening is the lagoon’s inevitable fade; Aria’s agency remains observational drumming rather than a trade-off that forecloses an option. Cost is conceptual, not tactile, keeping pressure lyrical rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The emergent theme—collective memory is beautiful because transient—arrives via the lagoon’s fade, not exposition. Subtext lives in the hush/exhale cosmological metaphor, paid off when Aria smiles at the exhale. No final moral is stated; the sorrow stays auroral, not didactic. Complexity is present but thin: no counter-reading challenges the bittersweet acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-close lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: every noticed detail is either vibrational or luminous. Syntax clusters sibilants and soft consonants to mimic wave resonance; no filter verbs dilute immediacy. compression (“the hush of the universe inhaling”) is taught early and paid off in the mirrored exhale, earning its elliptical privilege.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm swells and subsides with sentence-length variation; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—one metaphor per beat—so lagoon = mirror/memory never muddles physics. Occasional elevated diction (“auroral,” “entangled”) is motivated by the speculative frame and echoed consistently; no mixed registers intrude at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “sound wave garden” plus “auric lagoon” combo refreshes memory-loss tropes through synesthetic physics. Conceptual risk—lyric Accumulative rather than causal plot—pays off in a final Charged Poise that feels inevitable. Specificity keeps it from devolving into New-Age shorthand; garden mechanics stay tactile (drumming → vibration → light). Not quite groundbreaking, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
