<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority stays concrete—map-shop dust, crumb-trail focus—but the “empirically intuitive” label is announced, not dramatized. Father-promise grief is filter-verbed (“lingering promise she made”) instead of embodied contradiction; no moment shows her intuition failing or costing her. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—she follows ants, she steps through doorway—but the emotional cost stays abstract (“weight lifting”) rather than a felt renunciation. Voice remains coherent; loneliness is shown through selective noticing, yet the flaw-intuition link never complicates the final choice, keeping the arc at solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: creek-rising cadence, ant-procession pattern, map-in-stone texture tighten the stake toward a Charged Poise ending—final chamber reveal reweights “promise” with felt cost. Causality is loose: ants-as-guides, chip-as-key, and disappearing path are magical equivalences rather than because/therefore links, acceptable under chosen lens. Closure lands cleanly—she crosses threshold, reads father note, chamber opens—options reconfigure, heritage cost is legible. Orientation anchors by word 60; no ambiguity at end; one soft ellipsis (how path vanishes) waived under lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory triage mirrors antique-dealer gaze: varnish scent omitted, instead “dusty relics,” “fading light,” ant-file motion, dripping water—economy over catalog. Creek/cavern form micro-setting dyad—rising water sets ticking backdrop, floral cavern supplies map puzzle; both constrain exit timing and spatial choices. Spatial choreography clean: shop→foliage veil→stone map→hidden chamber, distances track without drift. Final image reuses creek reflection as peace mirror—earned environmental echo, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfill father’s promise—signals early; pressure escalates through pattern accumulation (ants, map, doorway) rather than causal reversals, coherent with Accumulative lens. One visible tightening: receding flowers → exposed chamber forces final stance crystallization. Creek clock is decorative—“now swollen, now receding” marks beats but never truncates action or alters tactics; cost is conceptual (heritage found) not visceral. Agency present but mild—she obeys ant guides, complies with map puzzle; no trade-off or resource lost, keeping score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as inheritance vs. solitude—maps, ants, father note form a quiet chain of connection rather than stated thesis. Subtext operates in silence: absence of father given weight by object-return (note), not exposition. Final image reframes dusty shop relics as living lineage—Conceptual Repricing with understated social cost (she will keep serving maps, now self-linked). Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers over whether promise is “complete” or cyclical, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric single-POV stays tight to Emilia’s perceptual filter—ant-track focus, varnish-light gleams, map-in-stone noticing. Syntax flexes with pressure: short additive phrases during ant march; longer clause chains in cavern awe—rhythm mirrors attention span. Diction anchored to her empiric eye—“type foundry matrix chip,” “ant-file” —avoids ornate intrusion. One micro head-hop risk: “creek continued to rise” interpreted as external fact, but cadence allows environmental narrator; waver lands inside acceptable band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence runs. Occasional scaffold: “As the creek…, as she…” opener pair, but distance brief, not looped. Figurative control solid—“glimmer in fading light,” “sweet scent of blooming flowers”—vehicles clean, no mixed metaphors. Information density moderate: some sentences single-task (“She smiled, knowing…”) yet momentum sustained; hedges minimal. Line clarity high; no typos, tense stable. Artifact-light enough to stay above 6.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Father-note-through-ant-quest is fresh hinge; ant trail as map key inverts usual explorer trope. Antique-map dealer + type-matrix chip is specific vocational pairing that deepens world. Risk taken with magical realism (vanishing path, flower retreat) but pattern taught early, paid at chamber reveal—coherence intact. Emotional core centers ordinary grief, not spectacle; specificity over gimmick keeps originality solid mid-high band.</comment>
