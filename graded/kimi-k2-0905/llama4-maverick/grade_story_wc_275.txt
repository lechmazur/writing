<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria’s pacifism is embodied in every beat—tending roses, refusing the sword, sheltering refugees—so her traits drive action, not summary. The “senselessly perceptive” tag stays latent, never complicates a choice or costs her anything; interiority drifts toward serene abstraction rather than contradiction under pressure. Father’s sword earns a quiet renunciation, but the causal chain is thin: we hear no moment when wielding almost happened, so the cost feels pre-emptively resolved. Still, her stance crystallizes in the final image, giving a modest but genuine Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floral vignette layers tranquility until the final rose reweights the wrecked world outside. Closure is a Charged Poise—Aria asleep inside the dome, sword on wall, roses breathing—whose cost is the perpetual vigilance we infer she’ll face tomorrow; the text only implies, not dramatizes, that price. Orientation is clear by word 60, but the single through-line is static; no tightening reverses her course, merely re-affirmation. Causality is loose: the engraved stone is discovered, then decorative; the inculcation method asserted, never tested under threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glass-dome farm, airship wreck, and pink rose in scrap ballast are tactile, sensory, and return in the final image—satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Light, scent, and heat differentiate beats; the dome’s filtered sun mirrors Aria’s filtered life. Only lapse: “tower’s collapse” remains a hazy off-stage landmark; its rubble never intrudes the dome, so external desolation is asserted, not felt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve oasis of peace—arrives early and stays coherent. Pressure is situational: more visitors, more chaos outside, but no concrete tightening narrows Aria’s options or forces a trade-off; she simply keeps gardening. Agency is caretaking endurance rather than a decisive fork; the sword never tempts, the dome never breached. Cost is conceptual (inferred future burden) not on-page, capping escalation at moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing continuity against collapse emerges through recurring living images—roses from scrap, engraved quiet—never moralizing pronouncements. Final sleep-cradled rose is a charged callback that reweights the sword’s violence as obsolete. Subtext is quiet but legible: cultivation as resistance. The piece avoids sermon, but because the stake never sharpens to a painful choice, resonance stays gentle rather than piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person omni stays distant, almost horticultural, matching the tranquil blaze tone; perceptual signature is selective serenity—petal fold, humidity bead—rather than personal diction. Rhythm lilts with long sentences that breathe like the dome, then contracts for “engraved quiet,” teaching the pattern. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“she could feel”) occasionally blunt immediacy but serve the meditative distance; under peak stress the syntax holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical, mostly free of loops; however, “the gentle…, the gentle…, the gentle…” cadence drifts toward template near paragraph 3, not quite taught as motif. Mixed metaphors avoided; rose/light imagery stays coherent. Information density high—each sentence layers scent, color, or symbolism. A few near-duplicate abstractions (“sense of continuity, sense of purpose”) could compress without loss.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Pacifist bounty-hunter’s daughter cultivating weaponized beauty is fresh; serene dome amid wasteland feels inevitable, not gimmick. Roses-from-wreck and engraved stone repurpose detritus into life without overt eco-sermon. Risk is quiet—no battle, no invasion—and the story commits to that gamble, earning a modest originality bonus. Could swap “tower” for any generic apocalypse, so specificity earns B+ not A+.</comment>
