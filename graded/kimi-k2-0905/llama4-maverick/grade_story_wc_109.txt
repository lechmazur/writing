<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Oracle’s interiority is lyrically specific—“mildly obsessed with the art of listening to the silence”—but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the retelling/summarizing action is a single steady state rather than a pressured choice, so the final smile feels bestowed by the text, not earned by causal struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the world “rearranged into a new and mysterious pattern” with conceptual cost (darkness distilled, silence now weighted). Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical pass thickens the ambered hush until the final image reconfigures meaning; orientation is clear by sentence two; no causal reversals are needed for this texture track.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ridge-fort, storm, candle stubs, flaking booklet—each tactile detail is filtered through the oracle’s perceptual bias and returns in the final image where “shadows rearranged” literalize the redrawn map; environment directly supplies the resource (darkness, silence) that enables the closure act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to draw a map of the endless night”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via accretion of sensory density rather than option narrowing; no visible price or foreclosed path is dramatized on the page, so the tightening is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of re-creating cosmos through attentive silence emerges from iterated images rather than statement; final “ambered hush” reweights prior material without moralizing; ambiguity is purposeful, but theme remains monolithic—no counter-readings complicate the mystic triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a marbled, hushed cadence; diction stays within oracle’s contemplative register; syntactic repetition (“the oracle… the oracle…”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in the heartbeat footsteps of the closing line; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative layering is dense yet coherent under the accumulative lens; occasional adjective stacks (“storm-tossed ridge fort creaked and groaned”) are purposeful rather than purple; zero paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; final line lands with rhythmic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Cosmic cartography via silence is fresh; flaking gold booklet as cipher rather than MacGuffin avoids standard mystic-prop trajectory; risk lies in the lyric stillness itself—no antagonist, no reversal—yet specificity of “pebble-shore oracle” and “ambered hush” prevents generic mysticism; not transformative, but memorably angled.</comment>
