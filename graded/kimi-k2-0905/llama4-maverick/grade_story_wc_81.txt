<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s calm indexer persona is consistent, but interiority stays abstract (“felt a deep connection,” “sense of excitement”) without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The stamp is handled, yet its emotional charge is asserted rather than dramatized through tactile tension. No visible flaw complicates her decryption; competence feels friction-free, so the final resolve lands as temperament, not earned alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of stillness → decoding → stamping tightens once with the “bold annotation” beat; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the library as her private archive. Causality is light—decryption success feels pre-ordained—but the final image of blue ink on drowned paper carries conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no disorientation taught, so no penalty. Meets 600-word scope; single scene, single POV, one meaningful deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sunken-library micro-setting is vivid and selective: “dusty tomes and the faint scent of aged paper,” waterlogged bindings creak. The stamp’s physicality—ornate handle, precision tip—constrains the climactic annotation; environment mirrors internal shift from passive reading to active marking. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drift. Meets 9+ gate: tool charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake = decode truth before blackout ends; pressure stays conceptual—no ticking clock or resource loss on page. One meaningful tightening: shift from substitution-cipher assumption to interwoven-narrative hypothesis narrows options. Cost is intellectual, not visceral; no credible loss alters tactics. Escalation is gentle pattern break under Accumulative lens; meets minimal bar for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: forgotten texts as mirrors for submerged selves; final blue stamp converts passive archive into personal palimpsest. No overt thesis; image of ink blooming on drowned page reweights “honest origins” as ongoing, mutable. Ambiguity lingers—truth is mark, not extraction—avoiding moral. Subtext operates through object handling rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is calm, catalogic (“delicately turned the pages,” “soft creak of the binding”). Syntax stays controlled, slightly formal, matching indexer POV; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; diction within plausible lexicon. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long sentences in stillness, shorter fragments at stamp beat. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. Information density high—each sentence advances stillness, decoding, or stamp motif. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“dappled resolve”) is mild; doesn’t touch closure. Clean grammar, precise punctuation. Final line anchors image and recharges ink motif. Minor over-modifying (“tranquilly perceptive”) but within tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Sunken librarian decoding meta-manuscript is fresh surface; execution relies on ambiance over surprise. Stamp-as-key transforms from prop to signature, giving specific inflection. Conceptual risk—quiet accumulative closure—pays off, but premise itself is recognizable archive-gothic. Detail-level particularity (blue ink on soaked vellum) rescues from generic.</comment>
