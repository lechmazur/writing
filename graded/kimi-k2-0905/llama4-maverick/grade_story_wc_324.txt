<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s curiosity is asserted (“persistently curious gaze”) but never complicates her choices; the sister’s grief is sketched only in tears, not contradictory impulses. The decisive beat—offering comfort—restates her job description rather than revealing a new cost or flaw. Interiority stays generic (“felt an instant connection”), never anchoring in idiosyncratic thought. No micro-choice under pressure is haunted by a visible mistake or trade-off, so the renunciation lacks sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Aria stays on-duty, the woman leaves healed, the hearing-aid hum continues—cost is the endless task itself, faint but legible. Causality is soft: the sister’s appearance is coincidence, not Aria’s tactic; the clearing mist is atmospheric confirmation, not consequence. Orientation clears by word 60; no lens drift. One non-closure flaw: the “decades-old hearing aid” is introduced as already-working magic without prior cause or constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Mist, twilight, and marble atrium are filtered through Aria’s practiced eye; the hearing aid’s static hum replaces visual detail with a tactile, proprioceptive anchor that guides movement. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: only the pulse and the woman’s tears are admitted. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions. The final image (mist closing like a veil) recharges the opening mood, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting that constrains the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“reconnect lost hearts”—is declared early; pressure tightens once when the sister appears, narrowing Aria’s role from seeker to soother. Agency is gentle: Aria offers her hand, speaks reassurance; the outward cost is invisible, the inward cost (perpetual duty) only implied. No credible resource loss or tactic shift occurs. Coincidence delivers the sister rather than Aria’s tracking skill, so escalation feels atmospheric, not earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as public-service labor—ghosts are bureaucratic data to be filed into peace. Subtext resides in the hearing-aid hum, a literal static that stands for unfinished grief-work. Final image of the continuing hum avoids moralizing, offering quiet CR: the dead keep calling, the tracer keeps clocking in. No late thesis statements; the sister’s smile is the only explicit comfort, keeping sentimentality at bay.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aria; no head-hop. Syntax is calm, evenly cadenced, matching the “reeling hush.” Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature is acute auditory focus. Dialogue is sparse but plausible (“I’ve been searching for my sister”)—tear-choked brevity fits stress. No register drift; diction stays within Aria’s quiet competence. Voice does not modulate sharply under pressure; the evenness flatlines urgency slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Clean copy: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips. Rhythm alternates sentence length, avoiding drumbeat. Occasional soft filler—“the mist around them began to clear, as if the atrium itself was responding to her words”—uses weak “began to” and explanatory “as if.” Metaphors are few, safe, unstrained. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances stance or image. Final line ends on sonic echo (“reeling hush”) rather than fresh image, slightly undercutting propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” conceit freshens ghost-story tropes by merging epidemiology with grief-counseling; the decades-old hearing aid as ectoplasmic Geiger counter is specific, memorable. Incident structure—single encounter, no twist—leans on mood more than surprise. Risk is modest; premise stays in lyric register rather than testing bureaucratic implications. Still, synthesis feels organic, not gimmick, and the quiet ending trusts the reader to feel the endless queue of the dead.</comment>
