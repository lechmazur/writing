<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyric-generic (“broken-hearted archivist” stated, not shown); no embodied contradiction under pressure; final epiphany (“true calling”) is announced, not dramatized with cost. Micro-choices remain archival (cataloging, sifting) but never fork her stance; the soldier’s story does not collide with her own, so no relational crucible or visible flaw is tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust-pattern reading → memory tapestry → sanctuary of remembrance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost: the room’s glow re-weights her exile into vocation. Orientation anchors early; no causal break. However, no single tightening reverses her options—escalation is atmospheric, not tactical—so cost is felt but not sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Foster-care file room is micro-setting-as-pressure: cardboard ridges, must, drifting dust become the only tools for her “unfurling.” Button-as-tool re-weights at closure. Sensory selection is narrow but POV-colored; spatial choreography clean. No environment detail contradicts; no occupational error. Meets 9+ gate: button charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake “magnify small kindnesses” is declared early; pressure is textural—dust layers deepen, stories accumulate—rather than causal. One meaningful deepening: she moves from random box to deliberate sanctuary. No visible price or option foreclosure on-page; escalation is atmospheric. Fits Accumulative lens but lacks tangible cost that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—rescuing forgotten micro-mercies—emerges iteratively through dust, button, imagined soldier’s family. No overt moral; final image of glowing room answers the question of what emancipation is for. Some abstract nouns (“resilience of the human spirit”) flirt with platitude, but subtext in dust and button mostly spares lecture. Complexity mild; ambiguity limited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third close-proximity lyric voice stable; perceptual signature is archivist-attentive (faded labels, cardboard odor). Sentence rhythm varied; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” terrain) but stays within literate-observer lexicon. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs minimal; internal metaphors coherent. Texture supports accumulative mood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm generally smooth; some looping stems (“As Emilia…”) and abstract near-repeats (“stories… stories…”). Density decent—dust, button, file boxes reused. No mixed metaphors; no scaffold obscuring closure. Paraphrase loops minor but present; final paragraph stacks uplift abstractions without fresh image. Clean copy; tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—archivist salvaging kindnesses from foster files—is fresh angle on foster-care aftermath. Dust-pattern reading as method is novel micro-gesture. Soldier-button twist supplies specificity. Execution leans familiar lyrical uplift; emotional arc predictable. No bold structural risk. Sufficient transformation of “orphan files” trope; not derivative, yet not startling.</comment>
