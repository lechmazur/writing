<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elian’s synesthetic gift and vocation are vivid, but interiority drifts into abstractions (“certify wonder as essential”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the song crescendos because the prompt says so, not because prior beats foreclose alternatives. The ending smile signals satisfaction without visible cost or renunciation, keeping the arc aspirational rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cavern’s hush is “unfettered,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost—the singer leaves emptied yet luminous. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. A single tightening beat suffices at this length, though escalation is gentle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ice cavern, crystals, fungi, and aurora bleed are rendered through Elian’s synesthetic filter, turning setting into instrument. The amber sheet’s tactile wear and the sculptor’s poised chisel function as micro-settings that constrain timing. Spatial choreography remains coherent; bodies and distances track. Environment actively modulates the music-silence tension, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberating the “sculpted hush”—is signaled early; pressure mounts via sensory density, not option reduction. The chisel strike provides the single required tightening, releasing both sound and silence in one fused moment. Cost is conceptual (the hush now lives outside the marble) rather than a tangible loss to Elian, keeping the price oblique but legible under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as existential necessity—emerges through the synesthetic fusion of color, silence, and song rather than overt statement. The final image of Elian vanishing into a landscape now “seen through the lens of wonder” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext resides in the paradox that silence must be sculpted by sound. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting reflection on art’s transubstantiation of matter into spirit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elian’s synesthetic perception; diction (“prism-song,” “kaleidoscope of colors”) is consistent and patterned. Rhythm modulates with the musical crescendo, sentence length swelling then subsiding. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are minimal; perception feels immediate. Register remains poetic yet anchored to bodily sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: figurative language clusters only during the aurora surge, taught by context. One paraphrase loop (“soft glow… ethereal light”) costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines frame the arc with mirrored luminescence. Read-aloud rhythm breathes appropriately; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Synesthesia-as-instrument and silence-as-sculptable matter synthesize into a fresh angle on the artist-seer trope. The ice cavern becomes resonant instrument rather than postcard backdrop. While “artist awakens inert beauty” is familiar, the multisensory mechanics and the notion of hush as captive marble give the concept new torque. Risk is moderate but coherent; no late rule inventions.</comment>
