<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ava’s “culture-shock absorber” premise is vivid, but interiority stays at role level; no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her choices. The chip moment is the sole embodied beat; elsewhere emotion is narrated rather than shown through body or decision. The climactic stance is credible, yet the cost feels communal, not personal—her own stake never tightens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal arc is clean: graffiti campaign → growing unity → deadline resistance. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chip becomes emblem of collective refusal, cost legible in “ready to face whatever the future held.” One minor scaffold: the phrase “the perpetual carnival…had become a beacon of hope” restates prior uplift without new pressure.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The raft-carnival is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“smell of exotic foods,” “ever-floating”—and the chip micro-object constrains allegiance on the page. Spatial anchoring stays coherent; no clutter of tourist detail. Environment steers tactic: graffiti spreads along food-stall walls residents trust. The closing image re-weights the setting itself as living entity, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve city soul vs. privatization—is declared early and escalates via each new graffiti tag; options narrow to “united front.” Cost is visible: authority could erase the art, residents risk eviction. The chip’s tactile presence sharpens the felt price. Missing a single micro-loss (tool, arrest, time) keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme of collective resistance through shared symbols emerges inductively from chip→graffiti→unified stance; no overt thesis line. Final image of carnival-as-beacon reconfigures earlier carefree motif into defiance, offering non-literal answer. Subtext could dig deeper into privatization’s moral calculus, but complexity is plausible. No late moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tethered to Ava; perceptual signature is community-minded (“delicate balance of cultures”) but diction drifts into civic-report register (“preservation of the city’s essence”). Rhythm is steady, yet lacks syntactic stress under deadline pressure. No dialogue to test voice further.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; sentences vary in length and avoid loops. Minor scaffold: repeated “the perpetual carnival…”—three hits feel decorative. No mixed metaphor; information density good. One filter-verb cluster in “she knew would ultimately prevail” slightly dulls immediacy.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raft-carnival + culture-shock absorber + graffiti-resistance fusion feels fresh; not a template plot. Specificity of the chip as both symbol and literal fragment grounds the concept. Could push flaw or risk further for higher originality, but synthesis is memorable and fully committed.</comment>
