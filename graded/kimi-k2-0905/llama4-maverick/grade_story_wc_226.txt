<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The artist’s interior contradiction—defiance vs. need for forgiveness—stays abstract; no embodied micro-choice under pressure shows the cost of “innocently mischievous” on the page. “Price of forgiveness” is voiced, not dramatized through a renunciation or forfeiture we can touch. Voice cadence is consistent, but trait labels repeat instead of revealing new value hierarchy. Closure peace is asserted, not paid for by visible action, so the arc feels foregone rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the same lyric wave—poetry → refracted mist → spire revelation—loops with rising sensory density; the final spire epiphany acts as Conceptual Repricing, giving the mist-veil a felt cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3, well under the 120-word ceiling. Single continuous scene, one POV, one dominant stake; no violation of scope defaults. The central causality is atmospheric accumulation, not because/therefore; acceptable under chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bone towers, pale spire, and refracting mist are specific, sensory, and return to reshape the final image; they pass the 9+ gate by charging closure. Canyon echo rules remain consistent, learned through sound and light play rather than exposition. Selective detail favors sound and sight, mirroring the poet’s medium. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible positions or prop drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stake—“Can she uncover the truth of forgiveness before the ritual?”—is declared early. Pressure escalates only texturally: each poem refracts the mist denser, but no live option is foreclosed; her tactics never change, no tool is lost, no cost is visibly paid. The “tightening” is a repeated sensory crescendo rather than a narrowed path. Closure offers cognitive shift, not a trade-off, so the escalation feels like accumulation without bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recursive imagery—refraction, echo, veil—rather than overt thesis, satisfying the 9+ test. Final image of spire symbols reweights earlier abstractions with undeniable conceptual cost. Complexity is honored: forgiveness remains ambiguous, avoiding tidy moral. Minor dock for reiterated “price of forgiveness” phrasing that edges toward prompt-echo (−0.3).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature is sound- and light-obsessed, consistent with an artist-poet. Syntax lengthens and compresses in step with mist motion, showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping or register drift. Filter verbs (“seemed to be”) are occasional but voice-motivated, kept below penalty threshold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary; no template cadence chains. Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence—yet pattern is taught early (“towers of bone pierced the sky”) and paid off at closure, so −0.3 for density, not −0.7. Minor paraphrase loops (“truth she sought…truth she had uncovered”) create micro-scaffold; another −0.3. Typos and tense clean. Final line lands cleanly despite metaphor load.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Canyon-of-echoes + refractive-poetry yields a fresh conceptual mash-up; transformation shows in bespoke sensory grammar rather than plot. Risks lyric repetition but commits fully; no retreat to safer linear plot. Specific detail prevents generic “anywhere” feel. Slight deduction for proximity to familiar trope of artist-hermit seeking cosmic truth (−0.4).</comment>
