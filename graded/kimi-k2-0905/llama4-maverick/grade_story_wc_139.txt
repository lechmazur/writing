<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete—"ink pot seemed to liquefy the rigid thinking"—but the decision to breach protocol is announced, not dramatized in-scene. Father–daughter status shift is only reported, so the cost of her readiness is inferred, not embodied. Contradictory impulses appear in reflection, yet final assent lacks a visible micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ink pot → reframe → breach plan. Closure is a Charged Poise—"she would be ready"—with conceptual cost (criminal risk) legible, but the decisive moment is projected, not enacted, softening the because/therefore snap. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prep-room micro-setting is tactile—"cold steel tables," "faint scent of death"—and constrains the moral climate; the ink pot functions as micro-setting object that literally guides Lena’s reframing. Spatial choreography is clean; father exits/enters without drift. Detail is selective, never touristic; funeral formaldehyde sharpens the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—client’s asylum—signaled early; pressure tightens when director demands protocol breach. One meaningful deepening: Lena reframes director as mark, narrowing moral options. Cost is conceptual (criminal exposure) but still abstract until final breath; a visible price (e.g., father’s tremor) would sharpen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of fair-trade calculus emerges through Lena’s ink-pot meditation rather than statement; "mathematics of a fair trade" is voiced once, late, but earlier images (formaldehyde versus flowers) already encode moral equation. Final image reweights grift ethic without moralizing—risk = ink = justice. Ambiguity lingers, earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Lena; perceptual signature is precise—"soft glow," "morbid beauty." No head-hopping; father’s smile is filtered through her gaze. Syntax modulates with tension—long reflective sentences contract to "We’re making progress." Free-indirect "she felt a surge of determination" is justified by prior embodied cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work—"sterile smell of formaldehyde and the faint scent of flowers." No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent ("ink pot…liquefy rigid thinking"). Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths mirror tension crests. Clean grammar; pronoun track never wavers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: funeral-as-con-site is familiar, but ink pot as philosophical prism reframes grift ethics in a mortuary key. Specificity of prep-room etiquette and vintage ink curvature keeps it from template. Risk is present—protocol breach in death space—yet story commits fully. Not transformative, but angle feels particular to this voice.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Setup early ("taught her that the key…"), development in reframing director, payoff in readiness to breach—cost is implied criminal risk. Choice alters tactics, but father still drives the external action.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Handled in opening polish, mid-scene reframing, and final readiness; its unique weight and aesthetic charge the closing image. Removing it breaks the cognitive lens and final symbol.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Present as stakes, but asylum mechanics stay off-stage; director’s reluctance is heard, never seen. Shifts one tactical frame yet could be swapped to "escape plan" without structural damage.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphor enacted once—"liquefy rigid thinking"—and enables reframing; no later tradeoff or cost tied directly to the trait, limiting upper band.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Breach is the hinge beat; however, it is promised, not dramatized. Strong causal linkage, but payoff deferred to post-story future.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>"Wait actively" is explicitly named and shapes Lena’s observant stasis; mechanics matter to timing, though no clock is felt ticking.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prep room supplies moral chill and practical access to records/corpses; setting pressures the illegal breach decision. Atmospheric but could be another institutional back-room at lower score.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Desire voiced late; conceptually frames theme and reframing beat, but no concrete equation or trade is dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Deathly vitality threads throughout—sterile steel vs. lurking life-in-risk; modulates with tension and charges final "deathly vitality" line. Coherent and adaptive.</comment>
