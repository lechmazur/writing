<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the carver’s “turmoil within” is named, not embodied. No micro-choice is dramatized between chiseling and the spectral arrival; grief-study becomes retrospective lecture. The mentor’s nod is the only external pressure, so the final insight feels bestowed, not earned. Ribbon and poem function as talismans rather than decision-forcing objects.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: butterfly arrival thickens mood rather than pivots plot. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lunar glow re-weights grief into beauty—yet cost is conceptual, not lived. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no causality break, but no tightening beat either. The poem fragment is recycled memory, not new knowledge that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse is evoked through scent, mist, and lunar geometry; headstones and tropical flora intermingle to charge the finale. Spatial anchor holds: chisel, ribbon, and spectral figure remain legible in dusk light. Butterfly density accrues as textural escalation, not backdrop. Micro-setting (ribbon in pocket) constrains the gesture of recitation, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape—is declared early but never tested; no reversal or forfeiture occurs. Spectral mentor is calm consultant, not antagonist; butterflies migrate on schedule, complicating nothing. The single “tightening” is interior re-labeling, absent a visible trade-off. Closure’s cost is aesthetic, not tactical, so pressure stays atmospheric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective grief emerges through migration trope—beauty persisting beyond death—avoiding overt thesis. Ribbon and poem function as family ritual, not sermon. Final image crystallizes paradox without moral tag, satisfying CR. Ambiguity is present yet thin; counter-readings are possible but not textured into scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Voice is steady, lyrical, faintly archaic (“dissolved into… misty veil”) consistent with meditative carver. No dialogue, so no register clash. Perceptual signature relies on garden metaphors; syntax stays uniform, limiting peak modulation. Purposeful repetition (“the carver… the carver…”) teaches cadence, paid off in hush of final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, loop-free; clauses breathe with scene temperature. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral mentorship,” “conceptual repricing”) fits ceremonial tone. No mixed metaphors, though “thundering calm” borders oxymoron it intentionally tensions tone. Information density drops mid-story during reflective blocks; sentences list rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Monarch-migration plus graveyard is fresh synthesis; spectral mentor remixes familiar trope yet remains gentle guide, not twist. Ritual ribbon and poem trade-off feel specific to this family, not archetype. Conceptual closure rather than plot surprise limits memorability. Risk is lyric accumulation, not structural gamble; execution competent but not daring.</comment>
