<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaito’s interiority is textured—his affinity for the quill, the scent-triggered calm, the held-breath suspension—yet the “urge to shed the weight of his past” is stated rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is played out in scene; the transformation into stories is asserted during the writing flow, not tested under pressure. The beat of physical instability (tremor) is noticed but does not force a visible tactic shift or reveal a flaw. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise; the cost is felt, but the character work leading to it is more lyrical accumulation than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the platform drift, scent, quill-scratch, and sunset build density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful shift—the whispers cueing the writing surge—tightens the cadence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spent quill across parchment crystallizes the stillness-to-storm arc with visible artifact-cost; the inferred lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The floating tea-platform is never allowed to constrain tactics—tremors are noticed but don’t alter footing or tea ritual—so the micro-setting ceiling caps at 8.8. Sensory selection is POV-driven (sandalwood, creak, saturated hush) and matches the meditative stake. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no impossible positions. Weather (storms parting for sunset) mirrors internal clearing and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming personal scars into written stories—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only once, when rune-whispers catalyze the writing surge; this is an external nudge rather than a narrowing of internal options. No visible price is extracted (no ink shortage, no platform lurch that endangers parchment). The closure reweights meaning but the protagonist’s agency is reactive, not a trade-off under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of stillness and turbulence: scars become stories when the poised breath ends. No explicit moralizing; the sunset image reprises the storm/tear motif without statement. Subtext lives in the quill’s spent tip—writing as consumable magic. The idea is coherent yet thin; the rune-whispers act as convenient confirmers rather than complicating the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tightly latched to Kaito’s perceptions; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is consistent—scent as trigger, breath as clock, hush as texture. Rhythm modulates: long languid clauses during stillness, shorter units during tremor/whisper intrusion. Diction remains within scholar-mystic register; no corporate drift. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety avoids template cadence. Figurative language is restrained—only two metaphors in 800 words—so no density penalty. One paraphrase loop: “the platform continued to drift, a tiny, serene world” twice in closing paragraph costs −0.2. Punctuation and tense clean; no simultaneity errors. Opening and final lines serve as frame anchors, not scaffolds.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Floating tea-ceremony rock is a fresh fantastical frame; rune-whisper catalysis feels familiar but is localized by scholar-protagonist. Transformation of scars-into-stories is universal, yet the quill-as-conduit and breath-held temporal pocket give it specific inflection. Risk is quiet rather than bold; no structural experimentation. Premise is memorable but not radically non-obvious.</comment>
