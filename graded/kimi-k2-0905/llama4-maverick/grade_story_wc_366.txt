<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Skipper’s reticence is shown through gesture and silence, but his interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“luminescent ache”) that tells rather than embodies contradiction. The sea-glass pocketing and stone-stacking are concrete micro-choices, yet no real trade-off or visible cost is exacted; the resolve to “protect” the lighthouse repeats the opening stance. No second character appears, so status/relationship crucible is N/A. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with tangible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the glowing glass reweights the earlier found object and crystallizes the skipper’s commitment under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is light—stone-stacking calms but does not tighten options—and the anonymous-letter threat is introduced then abandoned, so escalation is more mood accretion than because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is present but diffuse (emotional “ache”), not a concrete constraint that shapes later tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lantern room, spiral staircase, and rocky shore are sketched with selective sensory detail; the sea glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent. Environment does not actively constrain choices—no tide rising, no mechanical failure forcing action—so setting serves atmosphere more than tactical pressure, capping entry to 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the lighthouse’s safety—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external antagonist or ticking clock raises cost. Stone-stacking provides a meditative beat yet does not narrow options or create irreversible consequence. The anonymous letters are hinted as menace but never activate pressure. Escalation is tonal deepening only; closure offers resonance without a visible price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief into artifactual light emerges through the sea-glass and cairn images rather than statement. Subtext is strongest in the unspoken comparison between smoothed glass and the skipper’s own weathering. Final paragraph flirts with overt thesis (“bottle the feeling of safety”) but stops short of moralizing. Ambiguity lingers, yet the anonymous-letter motif is undeveloped, leaving one thematic thread dangling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is maritime, taciturn, slightly elegiac. Syntax lengthens under emotion, mirroring the spiral descent. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal light,” “conceptual repricing”) edges above a reticent sailor’s lexicon but remains consistent with lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; sentence variety supports the meditative pace. Minor loop: “luminescent ache” is repeated with near-identical phrasing three times; “stacking stones” cadence re-uses same participle opening. Metaphors stay coherent. No scaffolding or synonym churn in climax; clarity intact. Density is high; every sentence advances mood or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stone-messaging language and sea-glass talisman give fresh coastal texture, but core situation—lonely keeper surrogate communes with haunted tower—recalls familiar lighthouse tropes. The anonymous-letter device promises uncanny twist yet goes unused, muting originality. Specificity of denim jacket and dawn-blue glass helps, yet plot arc feels safe. No structural risk-taking; accumulative lyric mode is competently executed but not transformative.</comment>
