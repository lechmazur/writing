<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The librarian’s interiority is poetic but abstract—moods shift with moon phases yet no embodied contradiction forces an on-page choice. The bamboo creel functions as symbol, not pressure; no micro-choice stakes the librarian’s identity. The “preserve wonder” motive is asserted, not dramatized; closure is stasis, not renunciation with cost. No second character enters, so status/relationship crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical loops of tide/moon imagery build texture rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift and clear; space, time, POV stable. Closure is Charged Poise: final tableau crystallizes “wonder in routine” but no new constraint or price is legible—librarian simply continues. Thus cost is only atmospheric, not actionable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tidal atrium rendered with sensory economy: salt-lap, wicker-scent, moonlight on water. Environment mirrors internal flux without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography simple—librarian alone—so no tracking issues. The creel and moonlight return in final image, supplying micro-setting constraint for 9-band, but they don’t alter tactics, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Stakes are existential—“preserve wonder”—yet never tested by opposition or tangible loss. Pressure is ambient (moon phase, tide) not antagonistic; no option is foreclosed. No beat of reversible consequence; escalation is purely cadence repetition. Thus no visible price shapes tactics or ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of migrating identity emerges through moon-phase imagery and mechanical-organic blend, never sermonized. Final image of creel holding shimmering artifacts offers quiet Conceptual Repricing: wonder distilled into humble carrier. Complexity accepted—no moral binary—yet insight remains generalized; particulars (creel contents) stay unnamed, blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person close voice maintains steady lyric distance; diction tidal, cadence wave-like, aligning with librarian’s perceptual bias. No dialogue to test naturalism. Syntax varies; no filter-verb clusters. Metaphors consistent (sea, gears, moon); no head-hopping. Voice is distinctive but risk-averse, staying in meditative register without modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, rhythmic, with only minor scaffold (“the librarian’s… the librarian’s…”). Figurative language dense but patterned early, so forgiven. No tense slips or synonym loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts clean. Information density moderate—some sentences perform single job. Final image crisp, unmuddled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Titan-gear librarian in post-time tidal library is fresh synthesis; steampunk-meets-sublime. Moon-phased identity flux avoids werewolf cliché. Yet core action—smelting texts via contradiction—remains abstract, untransformed from prompt concept. Risk level moderate; execution safe rather than startling.</comment>
