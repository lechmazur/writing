<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Interiority is present but abstract—“subsume her own emotions” is told, not embodied. No micro-choice shows the cost of that suppression; the dealer remains a poised observer. The blotter petal is sensed, yet the moment never perturbs her calm, so contradiction is asserted, not dramatized. Closure is a serene exit, not an earned renunciation with visible price.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical return to glowing stones bookends the piece, supplying a gentle RR. Orientation is swift; amber grotto, dusk, single actor are clear within fifty words. Escalation is poetic accretion—glow intensifies as the “half-truths” are completed—rather than causal narrowing. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the grotto “whispers approval,” a felt but not costly reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>Setting is the story’s spine: luminescent stones dictate tempo and palette, their hum a metronome for craft. The grotto’s warmth, honeyed light, and crackle are filtered through a perfumer’s synesthetic attention—scent, color, static electricity—creating a believable sensory workspace. Spatial choreography is minimal yet clean; single figure, bench, box, exit. The final image of stones dimming then flaring back is a textbook setting-as-mirror, recharging the emotional output without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver nuanced counterfeit emotions—remains static; no tightening or trade-off appears. Pressure is atmospheric (grotto glow, dusk deepening) rather than tactical; the dealer never risks discovery, resources, or self. No option is foreclosed; the task simply finishes. Cost is aesthetic, not consequential, so escalation stays in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: engineered feeling versus authentic residue, explored via blotter petal that roots artifice in nature. No editorial comment spells this out; the grotto’s warm stones silently side with synthetic care. Final image of luminescence persisting after the dealer leaves offers a quiet conceptual re-pricing: artifice outlives its maker. Subtext is present but slight—reader senses the ethical hush yet isn’t forced to adjudicate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is perfumer-cool, synesthetic, precise: “soft glow of luminescent stones,” “velvety petal,” “intricate dance of molecules.” Syntax lengthens with chemical lyricism, then contracts at exit—“footsteps echoed softly”—mirroring task completion. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. POV stays tightly third-limited to the dealer’s sensory register; no filter-verb clutter. The detached affection is maintained without thinning texture, sustaining a distinctive aromatic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, light, or texture without scaffold. Metaphors (“honey-like light,” “tapestry of feeling”) stay coherent within the perfumery frame. No loops or near-duplicates; paragraph cuts are clean. Minor overwriting in the dusk-deepening sequence—three consecutive image-sentences—barely dulls the final line. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, ending on a hushed down-beat that satisfies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Core concept—artisanal forging of emotions for perfume—is fresh, marrying olfactory science with affective counterfeiting. Grotto-of-glow stones provides a memorable workshop, neither generic lab nor fairy cave. Risk is moderate: lyric vignette instead of plotted arc, but cohesion justifies the choice. If “blotter petal” were swapped for paper strip, the whole dissolves, proving irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
