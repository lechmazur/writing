<comment>The weaver’s interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“boundary-lessly trapped”) that tells rather than embodies conflict; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. Her only micro-choice—beginning to weave—lacks visible cost or risk, so the perceived deepening feels pre-ordained. The kerosene lamp and loom function as props, but neither state-change nor flaw complicates tactics. The final stance is serene acceptance, yet the price is asserted, not dramatized; Earned Stasis is declared rather than paid for on the page.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until dawn reweights the tapestry’s meaning, delivering a Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. Closure is legible—she steps back, lamp out, mist retreat—but the conceptual cost (“weights of burdens”) is named, not felt; no concrete constraint lingers. The pattern is taught early (shingled hush, fractal threads) and repaid in the final hush, satisfying coherence if not visceral price.</comment>

<comment>Bronze grotto, starlight, snowmelt, and fungal glow are economically braided through motion, anchoring every beat. The kerosene lamp’s warm circle and the loom’s glimmer function as micro-setting that literally lights the final image, passing the 9+ gate. Soundscape (“soft crunch of gravel,” “shingled hush”) is biased to weaver’s ear, never catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating white-room moments.</comment>

<comment>Stake—collect intangible burden-weights—remains abstract; no concrete test or increasing price escalates. Tension accumulates via denser imagery, but the only narrowing is the approach of dawn, which is external, not agentive. The weave’s completion is inevitable rather than costly; options are not foreclosed. Under Accumulative lens the cadence shift is present, but without a felt forfeiture the escalation plateaus.</comment>

<comment>Theme of measured burdens emerges through loom imagery rather than statement; no overt moralizing. The final tapestry as mirror-of-soul reconfigures prior motifs without spelling lesson. Subtextual invitation—viewer pauses, recognizes own weights—is elegantly implied. Ambiguity is preserved; complexity not collapsed into binary.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature favors hush, shimmer, mist—language mirrors fractal recursion. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for contemplation, clipped fragments for footfalls. No head-hopping; POV stays tethered to weaver. Register skews poetic yet remains legible; occasional archaisms (“calcify the ephemeral”) read as ritual diction, justified by craft-tradition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence openings; only two scaffold phrases (“With each step,” “As the night wore on”). Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Density is high but not purple; each line advances atmosphere or motion. Filter verbs minimal; no simultaneity errors. Final paragraph approaches loop: “testament to…depth of her understanding” echoes earlier phrasing, but impact is softened, not obscured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fractal-weaver trope is refreshed via sensory loom choreography rather than sci-fi gloss. Starlit grotto as sanctum is familiar, yet the fusion with weight-of-burdens tapestry yields a quiet inversion of hero’s-journey loot. Risk is lyric stillness in lieu of plot fireworks; coherence holds. Specificity of carved lamp burner and whalebone reverie keeps it from generic pastoral.</comment>
