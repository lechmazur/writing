<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The herald’s interiority is lyrically consistent—“shadowed elation,” “joy that was both dark and luminous”—but her motives remain abstract: steering dawn is a poetic assignment without tangible cost or contradiction on the page; no micro-choice risks failure or forfeiture, so the arc feels performed rather than compelled. Embodied emotion is present yet monotonic; the same awe-laughter registers at base, summit, and descent, flattening pressure. The glass lantern ritual is repeated but never surprises her or us; competence dominates, struggle is absent. Earned stasis is hinted—“she knew that her work was just beginning”—yet the price of endless return is asserted, not dramatized, keeping the closure luminous but weightless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the final sunrise is conceptually repriced by her unseen ritual labor—“the dawn was taking shape, a new reality coalescing from the darkness”—and the cost is the eternal recurrence she embraces, felt in the echo of laughter that “would linger until the next dawn.” Causality is accumulative/textural: each lantern adjustment adds luminescent density until the stars fade; no single beat reverses plot, but the pattern’s cadence tightens the stake. Orientation is immediate—emerald lighthouse, starry sky, alone—and never drifts; transitions are smooth. The lens ambiguity guardrail is waived because the accumulative pattern is taught early and holds through the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the emerald lighthouse interior becomes a vertical crucible—winding stairs, glass beam slicing walls, star-view apex—each stage constrains her lantern angles and bodily posture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices friction of stone, scent of salt, glare of refracted green light, while the digital world outside is only a flicker—“fleeting digital glimpses.” Weather is not backdrop but collaborator: laughing storm and twinkling stars answer her micro-movements, making atmosphere an active antagonist. Spatial choreography is flawless; lantern, beam, and horizon line track cleanly from base to apex to dawn sky, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shaping dawn via ancient ritual—is signaled in line four and deepens through rhythmic accumulation rather than option-narrowing reversal; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Agency is present but low-cost: she “carefully angles the lantern,” yet no beat risks failure, fatigue, or external resistance; escalation is a smooth luminosity curve, not a forked path. Visible price is asserted off-page—“weight of her responsibility”—rather than felt on-page, keeping cost conceptual. The tightening is a cadence shift, not a foreclosed option, satisfying the accumulative lens but capping entry to the 7-band.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the persistence of analog ritual inside digital ephemera; the contrast is shown, not lectured—“in a world after the last print newspaper, she clung to the Otherworldly routine.” Subtext operates through light imagery: refracted secrecy inside glass argues that meaning still hides from surface data. Final image of the lighthouse “sentinel of the shadows” offers a non-literal answer—ritual labor keeps darkness usable, not abolished. No moralizing sentence stains the close; resonance is earned through the lantern’s最后一次幽绿的微光.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient hovers at a lyric distance that stays consistent; no head-hopping occurs. Voice texture is incantatory—repetition of “emerald,” “shadow,” “laughter” teaches a pattern that pays off in the final echo. Diction stays within poetic-ritual register; “total internal reflection” is the single technical incursion, justified because the herald herself names the principle. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric clauses build ascent, then shorten at sunrise for release, showing sentence-level control.</comment>

<comment>Prose is generally lean and image-dense, but suffers mild template cadence—“As she…, the stars…”—repeated three times, dulling propulsion. Figurative language is coherent—light as shard, dawn as coalescing reality—but never mixed or purple. No scaffolding loops or synonym churn obscure causality. One overwritten line—“the air was alive with an otherworldly energy”—is generic filler amid otherwise specific sensory detail; artifact stays below closure beat, so 9+ is not disallowed.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-print nostalgia with mystical optics; pairing “total internal reflection” physics to a dawn-steering myth feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes—lighthouse guardian, laughing storm caller—are re-skinned through lantern choreography rather than inherited plot beats. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over causality, but coherence holds. The legend-to-come frame in the final paragraph edges toward epilogue shorthand, slightly diluting immediacy.</comment>
