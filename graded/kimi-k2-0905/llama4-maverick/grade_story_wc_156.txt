<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is evocative (“itch to bewitch the very fabric of reality”) and embodied emotion surfaces, but micro-choices remain broad gestures rather than concrete trade-offs. The hobo nickel warms/pulses but never forces a visible decision cost under pressure. Contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final shift to curiosity reads as declarative rather than paid for by prior mistakes or losses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored sound loops builds density toward a cadence shift that reweights the mural stake. Closure image—forest swaying, colors pulsing—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. However, no persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics; certainty surrendered feels symbolic rather than materially foreclosed. Orientation clear by word 120; lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>“Sound wave garden” is atmospherically vivid—tuning-fork hum, water against stone, angled mirrors—yet selection stays tourist-level rather than constraining Lena’s moves. Micro-setting objects (hobo nickel, mirrors) participate in action but don’t limit or endanger her; stakes remain internal. Final image recharges the mirrors and mural light, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure, so ceiling reached.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—signaled early. Accumulative escalation via intensifying sound/color loops deepens stake without narrowing external options; no tangible loss or irreversible trade-off materializes. Protagonist agency is present (she aligns mirrors) but pressure is aesthetic rather than consequential. Cost is conceptual only; visible price absent keeps score sub-7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual mutability emerges through image (shifting pigment, living forest) without overt statement. Subtext in hobo nickel’s “right questions” motif reweights at closure, linking grandmother’s luck to new curiosity. Avoids tidy moral; complexity acknowledged. Yet resonance leans abstract—no ethical collision or social cost—so tops out mid-7.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable; perceptual signature filters through synesthetic attention to sound-as-color. Rhythm modulates from languid garden hush to swirling crescendo, mirroring escalation. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional soft filler (“methodically playful touch”) slightly blurs diction, but overall texture is controlled and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence lengths swell/contract with sonic build-up. Some modifier stacks (“gentle hum…soft lapping…methodically playful touch”) flirt with padding yet stay within tolerable density. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Information density good; a few filter verbs (“seemed to be pulsing”) dull immediacy but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sound-reactive pigment + mirrored feedback loop gives fresh tilt on “artist brings art alive” trope. Garden-as-instrument concept feels specific to this piece; removal would collapse entire mechanism. Could edge 8+ with higher consequential cost, but concept alone is memorable and non-derivative.</comment>
