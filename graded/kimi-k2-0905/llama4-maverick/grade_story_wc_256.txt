<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The bell-ringer’s gentle curiosity is embodied in tactile lens-cleaning and sound-coaxing, but interiority stays generic (“felt an inexplicable connection”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the pilgrimage is declared, not tested under pressure, so the final smile feels unmotivated—no visible cost or renunciation earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: pattern of sound-discoveries thickens toward a Charged Poise closure (“the bell ringer simply smiled” reconfigures stance). Yet no persistent constraint or price shapes the final image; the smile is cost-free, so the Resonant Reconfiguration is present but weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Laboratory is evoked through scent, glow, and instrument curves; the carbide-lamp lens recurs as micro-setting that charges the final shelf-glint. Spatial choreography stays coherent; environment guides access to sounds. However, no environmental obstacle or resource alters a high-stakes choice, so the 9+ gate is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens through each new resonance found. Yet escalation is purely additive (more sounds, more wonder) without a tightening trade-off or visible price; agency stays at the level of noticing, not risking. Cost remains abstract, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of interconnection emerges through sonic patterning rather than assertion, culminating in the soft-focus unity image. Subtext is light—no irony or charged silence—but the ambient accumulation avoids moralizing. Ambiguity is present yet thin; counter-readings are possible but not painful, keeping the resonance pleasant rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains steady, hushed cadence that mirrors bell-ringer gentleness; perceptual signature favors aurality and golden light. Syntax stays controlled, with purposeful repetition (“the prism-song bell ringer…”) that teaches its incantatory pattern. No head-hopping or register drift; distance remains stable. While rhythmic, the cadence never modulates under pressure, so voice feels monolithic rather than应激-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description plus motion—with clean grammar and no scaffold loops. Metaphors (“music was like a warm breeze”) are familiar but not mixed; no overwriting clusters. Information density is high; paragraphs advance stakes or texture. Only minor cliché gusts keep it from 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a sound-archaeologist coaxing forgotten melodies from obsolete lab instruments offers fresh tonal science-fantasy angle. Execution leans on atmospheric stock (“golden shadows,” “warm breeze”) rather than idiosyncratic detail, so freshness is moderate. The pilgrimage frame is conceptually neat but not radically non-obvious. Sufficient particularity to feel memorable, yet could swap setting or object without breaking arc.</comment>
