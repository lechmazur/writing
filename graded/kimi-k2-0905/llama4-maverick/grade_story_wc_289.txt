<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is lyrical but drifts toward thematic summary (“seeking the thread that connected all things”). The twig spiral offers a tactile micro-choice, yet her arc stabilizes without a visible cost; the realization is gentle, not stinging. Whimsy is named, not tested under pressure. Earned stasis feels light, but the single-POV lens holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: image-density rises from cloud-burst to prismatic quiet, reweighting the stake from isolation to communal weave. Closure is a Charged Poise: the temple’s glint and the twig in hand reconfigure meaning without declarative payoff. Cost is conceptual—she now carries the pattern, not merely observes it. One soft transition (watching artists arrive) is legible and patterned early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lotus-temple/lily-pond dyad functions as micro-setting: its mirrored surface and tiered petals constrain her to water-edge contemplation and later supply the reflective canvas for the light installation. The thrush-nest twig is handled twice, becoming a portable shard of the habitat she fuses into art. Scent and water-sound narrow to the hush before reveal, charging the final poise. Spatial choreography stays crisp—no impossible drift from bush to plaza.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—connection vs. solitary secrecy—declared early but remains low-heat; no live option is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: color and community gather, rather than a choice that narrows paths. The installation invites her contribution, yet rejection is never risked; cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Agency is receptive, not decisive, fitting Accumulative lens but capping tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spiral/thrum/temple motifs: private secrecy refracted into shared art. No overt thesis statements; the final image reweights the twig from keepsake to conduit. Subtext whispers in the nest’s “hidden meaning” that she never names, letting reader complete the loop. Ambiguity lingers—connection is made, yet future letters she ghostwrites remain unaddressed, preserving fruitful tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is color-acute and synesthetic: “prismatic quiet” is coinage that feels natural to Lena’s letter-writer ear. Rhythm breathes—long lapping sentences for pond-stasis, then clipped clauses as artists bustle. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Free-indirect glides between lyric elevation and grounded foot-dangling, held steady by single POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts clean. Occasional soft scaffold: “As the… / As she…” stem repeats 3×, but never in peak beat. Metaphors (cloud-burst, prismatic quiet) stay coherent and thematic, not piled. No synonym churn or filter-verb clog; information density high, momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fusion of ghostwriter + public-art spiral is fresh; neither trope dominates solo. Lotus-temple rising from water feels mythic yet rendered as observed fact, not fantasy rule-break. Whimsy avoids quirk-for-quirk’s-sake by anchoring in sensory detail. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than twist—but coherence justifies the gamble.</comment>
