<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Interiority is mostly mood-labeled (“pang of melancholy,” “haunted euphoria”) rather than embodied; no contradictory impulses play out in scene. The archivist’s only micro-choice is to stow the photo—low-stakes, no visible cost—so the required earned change/renunciation is absent. Gently-thorough trait is asserted, never dramatized under pressure. Thus character feels illustrative, not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: repeated blooming/tide/photo motifs deepen tone rather than cause plot turns. Closure is a Charged Poise—the jetty left in darkness with photo archived—offering conceptual cost of eternal deferral. However, no causal trigger narrows options mid-story; the covenant remains off-stage lore, so escalation is pure texture. Orientation is clear by word 50; no lens ambiguity, hence meets short-form bar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Jetty-at-twilight is vividly sensory, filtering flora and waterlight through archivist’s cataloguing gaze. Blooms seem to react to her presence—an effective micro-setting that mirrors interior shift. Spatial anchors hold; weather and distance affect pacing. Yet environment never constrains her literal path or tactics; hence vivid but not choice-shaping, keeping it below 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve small moments”—is declared early but never tested by competing demand; no resource, risk, or ticking clock complicates it. Middle consists of iterative noticing, not tightening. Thus escalation is purely atmospheric; no visible price or foreclosed option appears on page. Meets short-form minimum (one deepening) but lacks pressure legible under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s afterlife emerges implicitly via photo-to-archive cycle, avoiding overt moral. Final image of blooming-in-darkness reweights earlier floral motifs. However, repeated abstract phrasing (“weight of small moments,” “haunted euphoria”) edges toward thesis-statement, muting resonance. Still, particulars > platitudes; ambiguity lingers about couple’s fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“walnut-ink,” “weathered bench”) stays within archivist’s scholarly lexicon. Rhythm varies from long lyrical cadences to clipped notation, mirroring dusk settling. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs appear but serve cataloguing voice; thus acceptable. Distinct perceptual signature present, though not pushed under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Generally clean, but “blooming blooming” proximity and echoed “weight of small moments” create mild paraphrase loops. Several sentences open with “As…” or “The archivist…” in runs, producing template cadence. Metaphors (“ethereal glow,” “ripple effect”) are familiar; no mixed vehicles but lack freshness. Closure line avoids clutter, so artifact does not blunt final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—lonely archivist salvoves strangers’ love relic—offers quiet empathy but is not transformative; swap names or place and arc survives. Blooming jetty plus covenant concept hints at eco-ghost story yet stays observational. Specificity of walnut-ink lends tactile snap, yet overall combination feels gently familiar. No structural risk-taking; safe middle register.</comment>
