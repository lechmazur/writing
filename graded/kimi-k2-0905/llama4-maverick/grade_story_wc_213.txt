<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ember’s “credibly curious” trait is asserted repeatedly but never manifests as an on-page contradiction or risky choice; the switch from sirens to bell is externally prompted by a wind lull, not by her agency. Interiority drifts into abstract self-narration (“she felt a sense of satisfaction”) instead of embodied contradiction under pressure. The ending serenity is declared rather than paid for with a visible renunciation or flaw consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: micro-observations and bell tones layer until a quiet cadence shift reweights the stake from danger-warning to listening-beauty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final bell toll crystallizes the new role with undeniable pressure. Cost is only atmospheric (“solstice hush”); no concrete opportunity or relationship is forfeited, keeping the effect mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Wind, altitude, and cathedral are sketched with crisp specificity; the bell’s repaired crack and the swaying rope return to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean (“hand hovered above the rope”). Sensory economy favors sound and motion over visual catalog, matching POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty of listening vs. duty of warning—is declared early but never tested by an opposing force or tangible loss. Escalation is a gentle accumulation of bell tones, not a tightening that forecloses options; the sirens remain functional and available, so the shift is elective. No visible price is paid, keeping pressure mild under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: listening attunes one to hidden order. Subtext lives in wind/bell acoustics rather than overt statement. Final benediction image offers a quiet, non-literal answer. The absence of moralizing keeps theme emergent, but the lack of cost slightly blunts resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Ember’s perceptual filter; free-indirect bursts (“It was as if she was waiting…”) capture her hesitation. Diction stays within a humble technician’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with wind cadence; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and lyrical, but repeated abstract fillers (“simple life,” “humble life,” “true beauty”) create micro-loops that dull immediacy. Several sentences open with identical participial stems (“As she…”) forming template cadence. These artifacts never obscure causality but prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Storm-siren-tester turned bell-tender is a fresh occupation; microclimate sonification via bell resonance is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc—quiet worker discovers higher aesthetic calling—is a familiar template without complicating irony or risk, limiting originality.</comment>
