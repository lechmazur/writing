<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is serviceable: “weight…settling heavy” gives a body cue, and the nut moment is concrete. Yet contradictions are soft—she is “reluctant” but never hesitates once the blueprint appears; risk is absent. No visible flaw complicates her success, so the arc feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is linear: nut→memory→blueprint→reactivation→rescue. Each step follows, but pressure is external (night frost deadline) rather than a narrowing of options; the “graceless beauty” lens is named only at the end. Closure lands as Charged Poise—glowing path, grateful travelers—but cost is off-loaded onto anonymous strangers, not the caretaker.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Sensory selection is tight: dust-smell, stone echo, soft thud of nut. The orchard is sketched through action—overgrown paths, jagged stones—rather than catalog. Mechanical birds supply a succinct speculative texture. No single detail constrains her choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stake—restore labyrinth before frost—is declared late (~40% mark) and stays abstract; frost never threatens her physically. One tightening beat: final flourish of last impression triggers glow. Escalation is present but mild; no trade-off or resource lost, so cost remains conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of guided safety emerges through action, not sermon. The nut’s soft glow reprised at end offers quiet resonance, yet the caretaker’s interior never wrestles with the curse she supposedly tends—missed chance for moral ambiguity. Subtext stays thin; no silence or gesture complicates her altruism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent, with perceptual tilt toward tactile detail—nut “smooth” in palm, air “thick with dust.” Syntax is clean, slightly formal, matching caretaker’s methodical task. No rhythmic flare under pressure, but no filter-verb clutter; voice is competent rather than singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is trim: no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Some template cadence (“As she…, the…” opener repeats), but not dense enough to dull closure. Information density is moderate; sentences usually do one job. A few adjectival softeners (“soft, ethereal light”) could be sharper, yet clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of orchard-curse with mechanical-bird labyrinth is fresh, but both remain backdrop; neither bird nor curse influences tactics. Blueprint-as-guide is neat yet under-exploited—no misreading, no false path. The piece avoids cliché but also avoids risk: caretaker succeeds cleanly, muting memorability.</comment>
