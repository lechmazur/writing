<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—“serene anger” is a sharp, specific contradiction—but the missing person remains a cipher: no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion, just a placid mask. The final shared gaze is declared connection rather than dramatized reconfiguration; cost is asserted (“time seemed to slow”) not felt. Motive for the chase is stated, yet no micro-choice on the page is driven by the time-dilation obsession; the climax is passive observation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent stance on the ridge reweights the ink patterns into a shared cosmos, cost legible in the “world… unfolding like a map etched in disappearing ink.” Causality is lyric-accumulative; the pattern taught early (ink smudge → ink aura) holds. Orientation is clear by word 80. The missing person’s passivity keeps the beat from tightening further; no decision narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Wind-carved rock, drone shimmer, and eclipse after-light are filtered through Kael’s tracker gaze; every detail is selective, never catalogued. The ridge edge functions as micro-setting that literally frames the final image. Environment constrains no tactical choice here, so the 9+ gate is missed, but sensory economy is exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the missing person—yields one soft deepening: the ink patterns reveal disappearance as art, not defeat. No visible price is paid; Kael’s anger never tests a new tactic or forfeits an option. Escalation is textural (density of ink traces) rather than causal; the lens is accumulative, so this suffices, but cost remains conceptual only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through the ink motif rather than assertion; the final map-image reconfigures pursuit into acceptance without moralizing. Subtext operates in the drone’s quiet hum and the shared silence. No epiphany is voiced; the reweighting is imagistic, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost but for the slight abstractness of “possibilities unfolding.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Kael’s perceptual signature—pale eyes that notice residue, hair that whips like signal flags—creates consistent texture; no filter verbs dilute immediacy. Compression (“consciously wild hair”) is taught early and paid off in the wind ridge stance. Drone’s hum becomes metronome for cadence shifts. Voice stays in tracker’s lexicon; no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long tracking lines to the staccato of “Kael smiled, a small, enigmatic smile.” No synonym churn or template cadence detected. One mixed metaphor—“sea of uncertainty”—is minor. High information density: the drone is gift, sensor, and comfort in one clause. Closure image is crisp, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Albino tracker + disappearing ink + drone forms a fresh synthesis; trope of vanishing person is re-angled through ephemeral calligraphy. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric ending replaces confrontation, but coherence holds. The eclipse timing feels arbitrary—no rule is established—so the conceptual repricing is slightly convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>
