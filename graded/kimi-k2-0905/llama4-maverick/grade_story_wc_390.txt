<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Azure Coat’s interiority is lyrically consistent yet leans on abstract labels (“logically emotional mind,” “deep sense of purpose”) rather than dramatized contradiction; the embodied micro-choices under pressure are present but muffled inside lush atmospheric summary, so the final stance feels anticipated rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the artifact’s frequency locks to the marina, the cost framed by fading sunlight and the engineer’s exhale—felt, visible, irrevocable; the lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of sensory beats cresting into resonance), taught early and held without causal gaps, satisfying the 9+ gate though the tightening is single rather than compounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not postcard scenery; the creaking ice underfoot and lighthouse hum constrain every step and tuning decision, culminating in the crystallized sonic match—environment actively shapes tactics and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the artifact via resonance-match—is signaled early; pressure tightens once as sunset expiry looms, forcing precision in the tuning beat; cost is the irreversible commitment of the artifact to this place, legible in the closing hush, meeting the 8.0+ band though escalation is singular, not compounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emergent theme—fragile equilibrium between human intention and living systems—arises from the sonic-absolution conceit and ice-light imagery; no moralizing, final image of velvety darkness reweights prior specifics with quiet conceptual cost, achieving resonance without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature—measured, sonorous, attuned to vibration; rhythmic control mirrors the tuning process, accelerating during alignment, breathing at closure; no head-hopping, diction stays within engineer’s plausible lexicon, earning the 8-band though not radically idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: information-dense lines advance atmosphere and action simultaneously; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she could feel,” “seemed to”) dilute immediacy; no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift—clean enough for high-band though syllabic richness borders on purple during peak tuning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sonic engineering with sacred artifact in an ice-marina is fresh; “sonic absolution” remains conceptually atmospheric rather than tactically surprising, so ingenuity feels moderate—clever premise competently realized rather than rule-bending.</comment>
