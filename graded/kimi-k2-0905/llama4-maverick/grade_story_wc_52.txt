<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—the grain of ash wood as grief-map—but contradiction is only lightly sketched; widow’s “here and gone” ache is embodied yet never risks a micro-choice that could fail. Carving ritual dominates action; no secondary pressure or status clash enters, so stakes stay internal and static. End renunciation (setting tool down) is credible but cost is muted—no path foreclosed on page beyond the quiet finish. Voice particularity strong; motivation plateaued.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: rain, scrape, steam layer into a cadence shift that reweights loss from raw to workable. Closure is Charged Poise—final carved object + emptied kettle crystallize options; cost is felt (“moment was fleeting”). No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Single deepening suffices, but absence of external test keeps it just sub-8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Skylight loft, ash blank, and kettle function as micro-setting; each constrains attention and is handled tactilely. Rain diffuses light → soft time; kettle’s boil gives tacit clock; wood grain guides cut direction—details filter through widow’s selective grief-gaze. Vividness is selective, never touristic; smells of tea and sawdust braid. No spatial drift; environment stays coherent across small repetitive motions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containment of grief through craft—signalled early; one tightening as carving approaches finish. Escalation is cadence, not causal reversal; no option is foreclosed except the implied “never again” of his absence. Cost is atmospheric rather than tactical; pressure stays internal and steady-state. Sufficient for length but lacks a beat where containment could fail and force adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transience emerges through sensory recurrence (steam, shavings, rain) rather than statement. No moral delivered; final image of emptied kettle + completed carving reweights “here and gone” with quiet acceptance. Ambiguity lingers—will ritual suffice tomorrow?—inviting reflection. Avoids sentimentality; insight earned via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close maintained; perceptual signature filters every noun through tactile grief—wood “seemed to shift,” tea aroma “mingles.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with carve-strokes; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice distinctness judged on narrative texture alone; cadence mirrors meditative slow-time. Register stays within widow’s embodied lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet lean; sentences vary, no template cadence detected. Occasional softener (“seemed to”) slightly dulls peak beat; minor paraphrase loop on “sense of peace settle over her” repeated phrasing. Metaphors coherent (rust-hued peace) and kept in POV idiom. Opening and closing lines ear-tested; final sentence lands with hush.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>6.7</grade><comment>Widow-carpenter grief-containment is fresh angle; ash blank as time-capsule feels specific. Rain-beaded skylight loft offers micro-setting novelty. Concept of “crystallized time” named but not dramatized, lowering ingenuity. Avoids trope echo; no famous scene mimicked. Risk is quietness—safe middle, not bold.</comment>
