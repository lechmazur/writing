<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The negotiator’s interiority stays abstract—“uncommonly thoughtful expression,” “sense of calm determination”—rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the antique pull is fondled but never alters her next tactic. The ending’s “peace” is asserted, not paid for by a visible forfeiture. Label-only interiority recurs (“weight of responsibility,” “recycle mistakes into wisdom”), keeping her flat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the negotiator pockets the pull while the moon sets, an image that reweights the stalemate into fragile equilibrium. Causality, however, is thin—moon phases are named but never shape an on-page beat; the breakthrough is declared, not shown. Orientation is clear by line 4. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the single intensification is the pocketing gesture, but its cost is only poetic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mist-laden parapet is vividly filtered through negotiator perception—stones are “wind-scoured,” moonlight “swirling.” Micro-setting (the pull in her palm) constrains her emotional stance and recurs at closure. Sensory selection narrows to touch and sound, matching contemplative tempo. No spatial drift; geography stays consistent across the single static scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlocking prisoner exchange—declared early yet never tested in a live beat; tension stays rhetorical (“negotiations stalled”). No visible price is paid by the protagonist; the breakthrough is attributed to lunar rhythm off-stage. Single micro-turn is the pocketing of the pull, but it complicates nothing. Pressure remains atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of recycled wisdom emerges through moon/recycling figuration rather than authorial moral. Subtext operates in the pull’s tactile recurrence and the final moon-set image. Final paragraph risks overt thesis (“mistakes of the past could be recycled into wisdom”) but stops short of sermon. Ambiguity is preserved: forgiveness is uncertain, stance crystallized not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a furrowed, misty cadence with controlled anaphora (“As the moon…As the talks…”). Diction stays within negotiator’s contemplative register; no filter-verb clutter. Sentence rhythm modulates with wind/mist pulses. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction test is waived; interior voice remains coherent if generically poetic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean but leans on iterative mist/wind phrasing (“mist swirling” appears 4×). No mixed metaphors; moon symbolism stays consistent. Paragraph cuts are purposeful, each advancing image or beat. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif. Minor scaffold: “weight of” construction repeats; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lunar negotiation and antique pull offers fresh symbolic chemistry, yet plot remains a stock stalemate-unlocked-by-wise-intermediary. Risk is stylistic (lyric accumulation) rather than structural; payoff is atmospheric, not conceptual. Specificity resides in parapet weathering and pull craftsmanship, preventing generic anywhere-setting. Transformation test: swap moon for tide, pull for locket, story arc identical—freshness is surface-deep.</comment>
