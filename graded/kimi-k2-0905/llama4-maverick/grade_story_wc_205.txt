<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—‘burnished sorrow’ felt in the body while she works the shard. Contradictory impulses (rifle vs pen, sorrow vs hope) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—closing the notebook and smiling—earns its charge because the shard-analysis labour has been dramatised. Voice remains coherent, but the ‘defunct’ label is asserted more than tested; one micro-choice under live opposition would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shard discovery → devise analysis → re-imagine world → self-re-imagined. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard on the desk re-weights her identity with felt cost (‘still present…tempered’). Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The mirrors/‘visible time’ rule is taught early and paid off in the covered-mirrors ritual, satisfying the pattern waiver. Cost is legible but could be sharper—no concrete resource lost beyond spent time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid galleries, dust motes, flickering luminescence—selective sensory triangulation keeps momentum. The shard itself becomes micro-setting; its facets dictate analysis tempo and final image. Spatial choreography is clean: knelt retrieval → stow → lab bench → desk. No object teleport or white-room lapse; environment subtly guides choice (lab access, storm blackout). For 9+ it would need to constrain a live tactical choice—here it mostly frames mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove her civilisation theory—signalled early. One meaningful tightening: storm + time-visibility ratchet the unseen surveillance pressure, narrowing her options to ‘work on’ or surrender. Cost is time/stamina rather than a foreclosed path; no credible loss of reputation, tool, or data. Agency is internal (endurance) which fits situational lens; escalation is atmospheric, not causally irreversible. Fits 600-word allowance but stays mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme emerges: history is personal salvage, not objective truth. Subtext lives in the shard’s ‘reminder of the power of imagination’—a quiet conceptual repricing. No final-paragraph sermon; the smile and closed notebook let the image resonate. Ambiguity is present—her re-imagined world may still be fantasy—but complexity is embraced, not tidied. Could edge higher if theme constrained an external ethical choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early and held: ‘baroque asteroid’s dimly lit galleries’ sets cadence, paid off in ‘labyrinthine passages’. Perceptual signature is poet-archaeologist—she sees facets, dust, carvings with equal reverence. Filter verbs serve voice (‘she felt…’) rather than dull immediacy. No dialogue to test distinction; internal syntax remains consistent under storm pressure. Minor template cadence (‘as she… as she…’) but not obtrusive enough to bar 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; paragraph breaths match quiet labour beats. Information density high—single sentences do world-building, character, and object work. Metaphors stay coherent (‘river of fire’ fits her poetic lens). Occasional scaffold: ‘the shard…a reminder…a symbol…a talisman’ triplet is paraphrase-loop; trims would sharpen. No grammatical slips or typos. Closure image uncluttered, letting shard glint carry weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Premise—ex-revolutionary turned asteroid archaeologist after time becomes visible—feels fresh, not prompt-template. Synthesis of baroque architecture + visible time + mirror folklore is particular to this voice. Emotional core (sorrow as creative fuel) avoids generic survivor arc. Transformation test passes: swap her for a mercenary and the entire emotional stakes collapse. Risk is quiet rather than bold; still, specificity anchors universality.</comment>
