<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mage’s “earnestly naive” label is interior wallpaper; no contradictory impulse or visible cost emerges from that trait. The only micro-choice—drip-rate repair—is executed flawlessly, so devotion never truly brittles. Interiority drifts into abstract self-exposition (“cosmic imbalance”) rather than embodied contradiction. Closure arrives as triumph, not renunciation, so the promised fragility is never tested on the character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each drip and color wash layers density toward the bell’s toll. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the toll reweights the world, but the cost is only atmospheric, not personal. No constraint or price sticks to the mage afterward, softening the ache that high-band stories demand. Still, the pattern is legible and complete within its lyric frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct, salt air, and dawn hues are selective and POV-colored, not tourist inventory. The bell’s cracked lip and the dropper’s measured cadence function as micro-setting that directly constrains the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean: bell, dropper, mage, and light remain tracked. The final image of deepening sapphire charges the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—“brittle devotion,” “cosmic imbalance”—but never sharpened into a live trade-off. Pressure is atmospheric (sky colors, musical drips) rather than an option-narrowing threat. The mage never risks failure, loss, or renunciation; escalation is purely aesthetic. No visible price alters tactics, so the tightening is sensual, not consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of “brittle devotion made whole” is stated rather than dramatized through cost. The bell’s repair becomes a metaphor for restored faith, but the mage’s inner fractures are never exposed, so the metaphor remains one-way. Subtext is therefore thin; the toll simply affirms success. Resonance is decorative rather than reconfiguring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice modulates with dawn light and drip rhythm, giving perceptual signature. Diction stays within the mage’s plausible lexicon—no filter-verb stacks or register drift. Compression is purposeful: “lukewarm,” “plausible impossibility” teach the story’s temperature early. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior texture remains coherent.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense: each sentence layers color, sound, or motion. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is spare and pattern-taught (“plausible impossibility” returns to payoff). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propel momentum. Minor surplus in color adjectives but never to the point of purple or prop clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing drip-rate precision magic with devotional restoration is a fresh angle on familiar “broken bell” imagery. The mage’s lukewarm nature, however, is announced but never exploited for irony or failure, so the premise feels under-used. Risk is stylistic (lyric accumulation) rather than narrative, and the payoff is aesthetic affirmation. Sufficiently particular to avoid derivative label, yet not bold enough to feel inevitable.</comment>
