<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sculptor’s interiority is vivid—“symphonically minded” filters every perception—but the contradiction between wanting to heal silence and accepting that “years might pass” before return is only asserted, not dramatized with visible cost on this page. No micro-choice in the final beat forecloses an option; the exit is graceful but emotionally static, so the arc falls just short of earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each strum thickens texture until the porcelain’s integration reweights the sculpture’s meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—grove and reader left vibrating in “quiet heartbeat”—with felt cost (the sculptor’s solitary departure). Orientation is clear by line 4; the hedgehog event remains abstract but functions as mythic caesura, not causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grove is rendered through living detail—sap-stained fingers, root-level resonance—yet the porcelain insulator is the only object that materially constrains the final choice (it becomes the acoustic kernel). Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Weather and season are elided, but the body/tool micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>The dominant stake—“create music that can be felt”—tightens when the first strum awakens the alders; the porcelain’s insertion is the visible price that reweights the sculpture. Pressure is textural, not causal, so escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing options. A second tightening is absent, keeping the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: empathy is not proclaimed but enacted through vibration. The porcelain’s foreign fragility versus rough timber dramatizes the necessary fragility of connection. Final image—grove “swaying to the rhythm” the sculptor can no longer hear—offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: silence persists, yet is “no longer oppressive,” inviting reflection rather than closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance is stable; diction stays rooted in sensory craft (“soil and sap,” “stress cracks”) without drifting into academic register. Rhythm mimics musical phrasing—anaphoric “As the music…” pulses like slow strums. The grove’s voice is filtered through the sculptor’s synesthetic perception, creating a singular perceptual signature. No dialogue appears; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentence length varies to mimic musical cadence. One micro-loop: “the sculptor’s fingers began to strum the strings they had woven between the trees” restates prior image. Metaphors stay coherent (silence as fabric to be rewoven). No artifact touches the closing image; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “tree-song sculptor” concept refreshes familiar wounded-healer trope through acoustic craft rather than magic. Porcelain-as-resonator is a fresh, materially specific infusion. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending in a market that often demands louder catharsis—but the piece commits fully to its hush. Transformation test fails at 90%: swap porcelain for glass and grove for birch and the arc still functions, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>
