<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The astrologer’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; motives stay at “seeking respite” rather than concrete stakes. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the only micro-choice—lifting the feather—feels symbolic, not tactical. The closing “quiet satisfaction” is declared, not embodied, so the renunciation cost is inferred rather than felt on the page. Still, the POV remains consistent and the professional lens (landscape astrologer) does color perception, keeping the score mid-strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ambience thickens via bioluminescence, echoing corridors, and firefly motif until a Charged Poise ends the arc. Orientation is secured by ~130 words; the burnt feather acts as taught anchor that re-weights at dawn. No decisive change is performed, but the final “luminous respite” crystallizes options with felt cost—astrologer leaves at sunrise, path foreclosed. Causality stays soft (mood governs more than because/therefore), yet the pattern is legible and closure obeys the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting works: corridor acoustics, faint organism glow, and the feather’s char texture constrain mood and attention. Spatial choreography is clean; distances and light sources track across beats. Weather is irrelevant underwater, but time-of-night cues (“first light of dawn”) evolve consistently. The facility never becomes a tactical obstacle or tool, so while atmosphere is vivid, it stops just short of charging the final image at the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find belonging/rhythm”—stays diffuse; no external obstacle raises the price. Pressure is aesthetic (darkness, echo) rather than causal; the only tightening is the dawn clock, but sunrise does not force a trade-off, merely ends the vigil. No visible loss or resource spent; astrologer exits unchanged except for mood. Consequently escalation is present as cadence shift, yet cost remains conceptual, not visceral, keeping score solid but sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “hidden rhythms” emerges imagistically through fireflies, breath, and bioluminescent pulses rather than statement. Shadowseam wonder motif accumulates texture without overt symbolic captions. Final image reframes the facility as quietly alive, supplying a resonant reconfiguration. Avoids preachiness, though the insight skirts abstraction; ambiguity stays purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient maintains consistent lyrical distance; diction favors soft consonants and fluid cadence that mirror watery setting. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“shadowseam wonder” is taught early and reprised). Sentence rhythm modulates with paragraph breaths, supporting the “shared exhale” conceit. Voice risks swoon but stays disciplined; no dialogue to test naturalism, yet narrative texture feels deliberate and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is loop-free, with high image-to-word ratio; each sentence layers ambience or micro-action. Occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous respite,” “shadowseam wonder”) is justified by lyric mode and pattern-taught. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding; opening and closing lines carry echo symmetry. A few adjective pairs could be trimmed, but artifact level is minor and never clogs the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Underwater city astrologer” is fresh, and melding horoscope logic with bioluminescent ecology offers unique lens. Fireflies-inside-corridors image is unexpected yet seeded early, paying off at dawn. Concept doesn’t twist plot but reweights perception, satisfying the transformation test for lyric miniatures. Risk is moderate; could push further by letting the facility’s alien logic actually test the diviner’s craft, but within word count the angle feels distinctive.</comment>
