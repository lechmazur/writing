<comment>Kaelin’s obliging nature is asserted rather than embodied—she never weighs refusal or cost. The interior contradiction promised by “mechanically warm” is summarized, not dramatized; the sideways-time belief drives the plot but is stated three times before it is tested. Touching the nexus is the sole micro-choice, and it carries no visible trade-off or hesitation. Closure gives her awe but no renunciation or new constraint, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands a vivid image—Kaelin bathed in nexus-light—but the cost is only generic “wonder,” not a foreclosed path. Causal chain is thin: simulator fix → hologram → nexus → teleport; none of these steps is obstructed or paid for. Orientation is clear by word 50, yet the lens (Causal) is asserted more than demonstrated. The ending replicates rather than reconfigures; therefore the resonance is atmospheric, not structural.</comment>

<comment>“Mechanically warm hands,” sterile workstations, and the planet’s torpor-winged fauna give tactile specificity that mirrors Kaelin’s hybrid nature. The simulator chamber functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice and returning in the blue-light image. Selective sensory filtering (orange dusk, icy air, fan whir) keeps description lean and purposeful. No world-rule is broken; spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—prove sideways time—but never tested; the nexus simply invites her in. One escalation beat exists: simulator activates → nexus appears, yet Kaelin’s agency is limited to reaching out. No option is narrowed or forfeited; the trip sideways is consequence-free. Pressure remains conceptual, not tactical, so the tightening required for 8-band is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The theme of “subdued awakenings” is embedded in the torpor image and the quiet birth of the hologram-nexus, avoiding explicit moral. The final image reweights earlier twilight motifs, achieving a modest Conceptual Repricing. However, the insight—“universe full of mysteries”—is articulated rather than felt, docking sincerity. Theme coheres but does not deepen past the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice keeps consistent psychic distance; diction stays within Kaelin’s technician register (“pumps and valves,” “tightened the final bolt”). Rhythm swells intentionally during the kaleidoscope passage, mirroring disorientation. No dialogue is present, so voice distinction is not tested. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory compression under pressure reads deliberate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with varied sentence shapes and read-aloud rhythm. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only one job (“She smiled to herself…”). Mixed metaphors (“icy warmth,” “liquid fire”) are sanctioned by the prompt but still verge on cliché. No loops or paraphrase stacks; minor scaffold in the repeated “she felt” constructions keeps this just above artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>“Sideways time” plus xenobiology torpor yields a fresh splice of ideas, yet the execution leans on familiar wonder tropes (portal-touch, cosmic awe). The hologram-as-key concept is efficiently seeded, giving the piece a specific inflection. Risk level is conservative; no structural or perspectival gamble is taken. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight but not startlingly original.</comment>
