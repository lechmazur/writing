<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains ambient; she reacts more than chooses. The drake-feather arrival is a gift, not a test, so her smile never risks reversal. No contradictory impulse or micro-choice visibly raises the stakes; the final “peace” is unearned. The arc is a graceful receipt of beauty, not a crucible that changes her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery layers rather than causal chains drive the piece. Orientation is immediate; lagoon, post-dawn, single POV are set by line 15. Closure lands as Charged Poise—mirror-calm lagoon re-weights the “woven dawns” motif with felt stillness. The cost is present but soft: transience embraced rather than a path foregone, satisfying the 600-word lyric exception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting rules: the poet’s cross-legged body, the feather, and the wet sand constrain her in place; the mirrored lagoon surface powers the final image. Selective sensory filtration—salt hush, lapping melody, first light on iridescent barbules—keeps tourist-catalogue at bay. Spatial choreography is flawless: kite’s snap, upward glance, return to feather, footprints left behind. Weather timing (post-dawn burn-off) is consistent and stakes the mood shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover beauty in imperfection—is declared, not pressure-tested. No tightening reverses her options; escalation is atmospheric (mist lifting, kite lost) rather than decision-forcing. The single micro-turn is the feather’s arrival, which inspires but does not complicate. Agency stays observational; cost is contemplative, not tactical—adequate for lyric mode but sub-7 for conflict-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through feather, snapped kite, dissolving mist—never sermonized. The “woven dawns” motif recurs only as poetic output, not lived tension, keeping it below 8.5. Still, the closing image of lagoon-as-mirror offers a non-literal reprise that invites reflection without moral. Subtext operates in hush and glint rather than assertion—quietly resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric adopts the poet’s perceptual signature: synesthetic “burnished hush,” auditory “lapping melody,” kinetic “tend the poem.” Syntax lengthens with inhalation, shortens at kite-snap, mimicking breath. No dialogue, so voice purity is uninterrupted. Register drifts toward lit-speak (“conceptual essence of her being”) but stays within poetic self-talk; rhythmic control is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful; sentence lengths ebb and flow with tide and breath. Occasional stacked modifiers (“gentle lapping...soothing melody...harmonize the very essence”) flirt with purple but serve lyric accumulation. No loops or scaffold; information is dense and forward-moving. Filter-verb counts are low; immediacy holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: post-stillness shoreline as studio, poem-as-weaving enacted in real time. Trope of found feather is rescued from sentiment by kite-string counterpoint. Risk is formal—lyric stasis over plot—but commitment is full. Lacks a knockout synthesis that would make removal collapse logic; interchangeable with any quiet natural epiphany, capping below 7.</comment>
