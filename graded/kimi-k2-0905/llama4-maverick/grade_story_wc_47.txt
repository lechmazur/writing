<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s “quietly proactive” trait is asserted but never dramatized in a way that costs her anything; the flower acceptance is passive. Interiority drifts into generic healing language (“raw edges,” “slowly unfolding peace”) rather than embodied contradiction. The amber pendant is touched twice but never complicates her choice—no tension between clinging and letting go—so the change feels assumed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sunlight walk re-weights the pendant from wound to talisman, cost legible in the phrase “heart a little lighter, spirit a little freer.” Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: icicle pattern → flower → shared silence → recharged pendant. However, the viral-confession stake is named once and never re-enters the scene, so the tightening is purely tonal; no option is foreclosed on-page. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The moss garden is vividly filtered through Aria’s need for quiet: “soft earth beneath her feet,” “honeyed hush,” vines on rusting servers. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and smell, mirroring her inward turn. The server-garden mash-up never constrains a choice, so it enriches atmosphere without becoming tactical; capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding safety after public shame—is declared early but never tested; no external threat or internal dilemma escalates. Pressure rises only via ambient beauty and the stranger’s flower, an accumulative deepening, not a causal reversal. Because no live option is risked or forfeited, the cost remains atmospheric; eligible for mid-band only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “grafting pain into hope” emerges through the pendant’s re-figuring, but the story articulates it outright in the final paragraph (“the past’s pain was being slowly grafted…”). Subtext is lovely in the silent flower moment; elsewhere the meaning is named, not dramatized. Still, the image of server racks clothed in moss carries subtle post-civilizational resonance that lingers.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays tightly latched to Aria; perceptual signature favors hush, amber glow, and slow breath. Syntax is calm, long, and vowel-rich, mirroring the honeyed atmosphere; no drumbeat loops. The stranger’s voice is absent, so voice distinction is moot; internal diction remains coherent, if slightly therapeutic at peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and readable, but leans on abstract qualifiers (“serene,” “soothing silence,” “gentle transformation”) that cushion rather than sharpen. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops, yet information density is moderate; several sentences could lose “quietly,” “soft,” “slowly” without harm. Final image lands clearly, so artifacts stay below closure-damage threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic moss garden is evocative, and the viral-confession backstory freshens the retreat-to-nature trope. Yet the beats—wander → find pattern → receive flower → feel better—follow a familiar healing-arc template without surprise. The pendant’s re-purposing offers a small specific turn, but the overall journey feels foreseeable.</comment>
