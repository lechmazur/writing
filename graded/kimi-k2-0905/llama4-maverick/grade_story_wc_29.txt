<comment>Lyra’s cautious hope is shown through concrete risk-calibration at the dials and the embodied shiver when the hum arrives, but her interior contradiction never sharpens into a forced micro-choice that costs her anything; the “thrill of satisfaction” is label-speak that flattens the peak beat. No visible flaw or limit complicates her success, so the arc feels smoothed rather than earned. The colleagues remain a faceless chorus, supplying no status pressure or alternative stance, so the relationship crucible is absent. Closure is a clean win without renunciation or stasis, so the emotional price is only asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<comment>The causal spine holds: because Lyra tunes the sub-sonic band, she detects the pattern, therefore she can jam the tricksters, and the disturbances fade. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by word 60. The decisive change lands on-page—the counter-signal goes out and the community calms—but the cost is purely external (reports dwindle) rather than a felt price paid by Lyra, so the closure flirts with but does not reach Earned Stasis or Charged Poise. No persistent constraint or lingering consequence shapes the final image, keeping the victory lightweight.</comment>

<comment>The radio station is rendered through tactile console glow, dial clicks, and the low thrumming hum that vibrates in the body, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Astronomical charts re-appear with reweighted meaning after the signal succeeds, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: Lyra at controls, colleagues behind, static hiss shifting to hum, no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional filter—frequencies first, visual star-field last—so detail is selective rather than catalogic.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—protect the town from cosmic tricksters—is signaled early and tightens once: the pattern emerges, Lyra chooses to interfere, the disturbances cease. Agency is hers alone, but the price is off-loaded onto the community (fewer reports) rather than rebounding onto her tactics or body, so the cost remains conceptual, not visceral. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the pattern is a message, narrowing her options to jam or ignore; jamming is chosen and succeeds. Pressure coheres under causal lens, but the lack of a personal toll keeps the escalation just below the 7.0 threshold where cost becomes palpable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—human ingenuity can re-balance cosmic disorder—emerges through the event chain rather than statement, but the final paragraph drifts toward platitude (“world was full of mystery and wonder”). Subtext is thin: the charts and static carry no ironic gap or shifting meaning beyond their functional use. The emotional aftereffect is mild uplift rather than a lingering reconfiguration, because no private cost stains the victory. Still, the concept avoids explicit moralizing and lets the image of Lyra still tuning stand as a quiet, if lightweight, answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lyra’s perceptual filter—dials, hiss, hum, charts—without head-hop. Diction is slightly elevated (“arcane notations,” “ethereal grit”) yet consistent with an academic interpreter’s idiom. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under pressure (“She adjusted. The hiss faded.”), longer cadence for wonder at the end. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on internal texture, which remains character-specific and avoids generic therapy-speak except for the one “thrill of satisfaction” slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate, no template cadence clusters. Information density is high—each sentence advances action or atmosphere without scaffold. Metaphors (“stars twinkled like diamonds”) are stock but brief and do not obscure logic. One paraphrase loop occurs: “symbol of the power of determination and ingenuity” restates the prior sentence’s claim; a −0.2 nudge applies, but the closure image remains clear. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The celestial-trickster premise is familiar, but the sub-sonic radio counter-jam gives it a fresh procedural twist; the specificity of “subsonic frequencies” as both detection and weapon feels non-obvious. Lyra’s occupation as celestial signal interpreter is more than wallpaper—it drives every beat. However, the cosmic antagonists remain off-stage abstractions, so the conflict never acquires a unique mythic fingerprint. The ending’s reversion to stargazing wonder is safe; no bold structural or perspectival risk is taken, keeping the ingenuity in the competent middle band.</comment>
