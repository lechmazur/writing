<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority is present but generic: “fierce determination,” “sense of satisfaction” tell rather than embody. No contradictory impulses act in-scene; Emilia glides from calm historian to triumphant truth-seeker without visible friction or cost. The profession is label-deep—no archival grit, no tactile encounter with parchment that might contradict her rational creed. Closure is serene, not paid for; the illuminated letter becomes trophy, not tool that challenged her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: incremental discoveries reweight the myth. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—sunlight on dust motes re-prices the station as liberated space. Cost, however, is purely conceptual; no constraint or forfeiture lingers for Emilia. Orientation clean by 120 words; causality intact but slight—discovery follows search without resistance or twist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ivy, rust, damp earth are vivid and selective; they mirror internal state without overt symbology. Micro-setting works: the letter’s vellum texture functions as tactile arena. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible moves. Environment, however, never blocks or endangers; it decorates more than it constrains, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing a noble lie—signaled early. Single tightening: finding the letter reweights the myth. Because escalation is accumulative, one intensification suffices, yet the cost is off-stage (abstract “truth” vs. real jeopardy). Agency is cerebral; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid, capping escalation at 6.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: history as palimpsest. Subtext lives in ivy’s slow erasure of brick, paralleling myth’s accretion. Final image avoids moral statement, offers quiet repricing. Complexity acknowledged—yet the story shies from showing how truth’s rescue might wound or destabilize, limiting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close, stable, no head-hop. Narrative diction poetic but consistent: “skeletal fingers,” “morbid perfume.” Perceptual signature leans architectural, mirroring historian’s gaze. Rhythm controlled; no syntactic monotony. Filter verbs minimal; interiority generic but not contaminated by academic over-explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence lengths breathe. Occasional elevated diction (“palimpsest of history”) fits mood but edges toward purple. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing sentences anchor and resolve cleanly. Minor paraphrase within paragraphs (“faded signs and rusting ticket booths”) but not adjacent duplicates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Premise—historian vs. noble lie—is familiar; rose-petal countdown adds lyric hook but functions as ornament. Ivy-as-eraser is fresh micro-image, yet core arc (enter ruin → find doc → debunk myth) follows template. Specificity of vellum inks and royal scribe helps, but no radical inversion or risk taken. Transformation test: swap names, plot holds.</comment>
