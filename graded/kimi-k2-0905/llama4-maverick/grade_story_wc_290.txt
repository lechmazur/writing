<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Claustrophobia is named, not dramatized—no panic, spatial constriction, or decisions forced by enclosed space. “Prudently adventurous” surfaces only as tag, never as visible trade-off. Interiority defaults to stock wonder-phrases (“burning need,” “electric thrill”) rather than embodied contradiction. Final insight is declared, not earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands: crystal reweights her perception, claustrophobia dissolves, cost = impossible return. Causal chain is thin—organ music, crystal, cosmic vision arrive as gifts rather than because/therefore—but the Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is legible under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by 50 words. One soft teleporter: compass pick becomes skeleton key without setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sensory triage favors sound and texture—organ vibration, damp earth, rusted hinges—over visual clutter. Setting guides only one choice: music draws her to door; otherwise tunnels serve as atmospheric wrapper, not tactical constraint. Crystal-as-micro-setting charges final image. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Starlight pour is lovely but decorative, not choice-altering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake = find “vital key”; escalation = music lures, door opens, crystal awakens, cosmos invades. Each step is passively received; protagonist agency limited to following sounds and touching glowing object. Cost is poetic loss of former self, but price is asserted post-fact, not felt during beats. No meaningful narrowing of options—she gets everything except the ability to stay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme: discovery transmutes decay into renewal. Emerges via imagery (fallow → starlight) rather than moral tag. Ambiguity preserved—no sentence spells thesis. Church-organ motif recurs but does not reweight meaning; crystal does the thematic lifting. Final image of siren-call return invites reflection without forcing closure into moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Lyra; no head-hop. Diction drifts into abstract register (“conceptual repricing,” “spatial mutiny”) that feels authorial, not explorer’s. Rhythm repeats template cadence: “As X, Lyra felt Y” opener used four times, flattening voice. Sensory filter vivid (organ in bones, dusty air) but lacks idiosyncratic perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density in final third—“fabric of reality torn asunder,” “starlight pouring”—without pattern or payoff. Adjacent paraphrase: “ancient ones…lost to time” echoed twice in 30 words. Filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she realized”) soften immediacy. Otherwise clean grammar, varied sentence lengths. Read-aloud rhythm survives despite decorative overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing organ music with crystal-tech cosmos gives fresh glaze to standard “lost artifact” trope. Compass-as-lockpick is charming specific. Claustrophobic explorer angle underused, leaving originality untapped. Final “wistful rebellion” is paradoxical but not explored. Risk level moderate; execution pleasant, not bold.</comment>
