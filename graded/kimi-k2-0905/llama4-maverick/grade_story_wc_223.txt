<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters function as allegorical postures rather than flesh-and-blood agents; the crisis actor’s “benevolently ruthless” tag is announced but never tested in a costly on-page choice, and the survivor’s interiority is limited to “eyes lit up.” The alliance proposal is the single micro-choice, but it lands as a conceptual pivot without embodied stakes or visible price, so the required earned change/renunciation feels asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a lyric-accumulative closure (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens: the final “luminous absence” image reweights the chessboard and footprints, leaving the trio suspended in crystallized option. Cause-and-effect is loose—historian’s arrival and word-walk are more ritual than causal—but the pattern is taught early and the resonance lands with conceptual cost, satisfying short-form closure. Orientation is clear by ~60 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Whispering-gallery acoustics and creaking boards are filtered through pressure, guiding attention to footstep-spelled words; the chessboard’s pawn-void mirrors the political void, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track from facing to walking line. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, so 9-band gate fails, but specificity and tonal integration are strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—filling the leadership/interpretive void—surfaces early and tightens once when the alliance forms, narrowing options from standoff to collaborative walking. The cost is conceptual (embracing luminous absence) rather than visceral; escalation is lyric deepening, not rising external threat, adequate for 600-word lyric mode but lacking visible price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: small gestures (footsteps, missing pawns) rewrite history amid power vacuums. Final image reweights absence as generative space, avoiding moralizing. Subtext lives in silent exchanges and object resonance; complexity is honored without false equivalence. The luminous-absence trope flirts with abstraction but stays anchored to the closing tableau, delivering lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice maintains elevated, almost liturgical cadence that fits the gallery’s echo and ritual walking; compression and patterned elision are taught early (“whispering gallery…eerie silence”) and remain consistent. Diction stays within poetic register; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for hush, single clauses for footfall beats—supporting pressure without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean, with strong information density: each sentence layers symbol, setting, or emotional charge. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors, but faint template cadence in tripled adjective strings (“soft, deliberate pace”) and occasional filler “seemed to.” These scaffolds do not touch closure; final line is crisp and image-driven. Read-aloud rhythm varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of crisis-actor/survivor dyad, pawnless chessboard, and spell-walking historian feels fresh; the void-as-canvas premise avoids common post-coup tropes. Risky lyric structure is committed to fully and pays off in the resonant final suspension. Specificity of gesture-history lends authenticity; minus 0.5 because the core metaphor of “walking messages” verges on conceptual gimmick without physical stakes.</comment>
