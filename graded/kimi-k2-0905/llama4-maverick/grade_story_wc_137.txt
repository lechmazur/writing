<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Emilia’s skeptical curiosity is stated repeatedly but never weaponized; she never doubts aloud or tests the tile, so the “skeptic” half stays ornamental. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“felt an unexpected surge of courageously kind determination”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradictory impulses. The final ascent carries a quiet renunciation, but the cost is generalized (“sense of peace”) rather than embodied or priced on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each transcription session adds density until the whales’ song and tile patterns merge into a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words; the tower, sea, and season are anchored early. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the tile stills, Emilia descends, the unheard symphony persists—yet the only cost named is “newfound appreciation,” which feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower’s latticework, sea views, and whale-borne soundscape are selective and filtered through Emilia’s attention; the setting quietly guides her micro-choices (where she stands to listen, when she lifts the pen). Weather and migration timeline stay coherent and supply temporal pressure. The tile itself becomes micro-setting, but its physical constraints (size, weight, temperature) are never allowed to limit her handling, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unlock entangled memories”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: pattern density increases, whale song grows louder in her perception. No concrete option is foreclosed; transcription never risks failure, exhaustion, or irreversible change, so pressure plateaus. The tightening is aesthetic rather than tactical, yielding a mid-band score for accumulative escalation without a palpable price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as migratory song, reality as weave. Subtext resides in the unheard symphony—an image that reweights the tile from key to tuning fork. The story avoids moral statement, but the final peace feels unearned because no prior beat dramatizes what Emilia must surrender to attain it, muting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays glued to Emilia; perceptual signature leans auditory (“haunting songs carried on the wind”) and synesthetic (“melody that harmonized with the patterns”). Rhythm is languid, mimicking tidal cadence, but syntactic variety thins in middle paragraphs where “As she… As the days…” template recurs. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; whales supply the only counter-voice, effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line craft is clean but leans on abstract nouns (“fabric of reality,” “topology of the mind”) that cushion rather than pierce. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same insight (“entangled memories… interconnected memories… hidden patterns”) creating micro-loops. Figurative language stays coherent—no mixed metaphors—but filters and qualifiers (“seemed to,” “felt as if”) dilute immediacy at key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fusing a magic-square puzzle with whale song as mnemonic carrier is fresh, yet the execution drifts toward mystical sampler rather than transformative synthesis. The risk is lyric accumulation over causal stakes; consequently the premise feels lightly worn, not pressure-tested. Specificity of the tile’s symbols or the whales’ route could have pushed it higher; instead both remain pleasantly generic.</comment>
