<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but drifts toward poetic self-label (“sense of serenity wash over her”) that softens contradiction. No second character on page, so status/relationship crucible unused. Final “peace” is asserted, not embodied—no visible cost foreclosing an alternate path. Competence swamps struggle; seed care reads effortless genius rather than flaw-driven tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical layering of scent/images builds to Charged Poise at bloom. Orientation clean by word 80. Closure lands—“wildflower hush” reweights premise—but cost is only conceptual, not felt; no constraint persists. Pattern taught early, transitions legible, lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Treetop canopy is tactile—bare feet on bark, sap-stained fingers—yet serves mainly as postcard. Micro-setting triumph: seed in palm, wrapping-paper doodles, and final bloom image all constrain choice or charge closure. Sensory hierarchy skewed 80 % scent; visual/tactile under-used at climax. Environment never blocks or enables tactics; thus capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</question><comment>Single dominant stake—unlock “undercurrent of wisdom”—signaled early. Tightening is the bloom itself, a cadence shift rather than option-foreclosing choice. Agency is passive reception; no visible price paid. Escalation is lyrical density, not causal narrowing; meets Accumulative test but lacks tangible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: scent as conduit to immanent wisdom. Final “wildflower hush” image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtextual silence—no articulated counter-argument—keeps ambiguity alive. Avoids explicit thesis until last clause, keeping tension suspended.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves consistent perceptual signature: synesthetic scent metaphors, rhythmic anaphora (“the scent… the scent…”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Compression in bloom paragraph propels without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cut test passes. Figurative density peaks at bloom yet pattern is taught early, so −0.3 only. One scaffold loop: “cultivating serenity within motion” repeated 3× without fresh inflection. No mixed metaphors; diction stays inside POV lexicon. Final image line is crisp, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Corpse-flower + scent-genius is fresh synthesis; not a trope re-skin. Transformation test fails—plot survives if shifted to desert oasis. Risk is lyrical compression, but stakes stay modest; no structural daring beyond lyric accretion. Specific olfactory detail supplies freshness, yet premise remains comfortably within magic-herbalist genre.</comment>
