<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Luna’s yearning is lyrical yet generic—no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page. The statues’ shift from stone to flesh is reported, not chosen, so no cost accrues to her. Interiority stays at postcard level: “she smiled, knowing…” etc. The locust shell is clutched but never used to risk or renounce anything.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is present: statues physically change, orchard glows—Decisive Change with faint sensory cost. Causality, however, is magical hand-waving: music → instant awakening, no intermediate obstacles or price paid by Luna. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural, but escalation is a single sweep rather than tightening. Orientation is clear early; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Orchard is sketched with glittering trees, stardust flowers—visually specific. Living statues supply active pressure and spatial grounding. The sky-bridge and locust shell serve as micro-settings that re-appear in the final glow, earning the 9+ gate. Could constrain choices more, but imagery is selective and thematically coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is declared repeatedly yet never tested; no trade-off or resource lost. Escalation is one smooth wave, not a tightening; coincidence (music just works) does the work. Cost is off-loaded onto statues/setting, not protagonist. Agency is performative, not decisional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: art vs. mechanical coldness, beauty as fragile as a locust shell. Subtext is mostly stated—“she sought to reawaken beauty”—rather than discovered through jeopardy. Final image of dancing statues offers modest reconfiguration. Resists moralizing, but insight stays generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is gentle, musical, with consistent soft consonants that match “resonantly soft” texture. POV stays tight third-single; no head-hops. Diction occasionally drifts into lush brochure-speak (“blossoming dreams”) but remains controlled. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—quiet, then celebrative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid but relies on abstract clusters—“shimmered like stardust,” “music drifted…weaving a spell”—that blur more than sharpen. Several paraphrase loops (“the orchard was…”) stall momentum. No grammatical fault, yet density is diluted; final glow line lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—music awakens stone hearts—but gains freshness via locust shell as emblem of fragility. Enchanted orchard and sky-bridge violinist are vivid syntheses rather than re-skinned elves. Risk is lyrical, not structural; concept commits fully. Specific detail keeps it from feeling template.</comment>
