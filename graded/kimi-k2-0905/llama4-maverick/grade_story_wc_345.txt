<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria’s altruism is asserted, never tested; she drifts above the settlers like a gentle narrator, never forced to choose between competing goods. Lyra is a silhouette who “created” a garden; the settlers remain a chorus without individual stakes. No one pays a felt cost, so the communal “transformation” lands as abstract uplift rather than earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece is a lyrical montage, not a causal plot; the chalk messages function as oracle-ex-machina, eliminating protagonist agency. Closure is a mood-shift—“the planet’s energy signature began to shift”—rather than a decisive change paid for by anyone. Because no character’s options narrow, the ending fails the cost test under an Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, nebula light, and butterfly petals supply vivid postcards, yet none constrains a settler choice or charges the final image; the garden bell comes closest but is only sounded, not wielded. Spatial grounding stays impressionistic—settlers “beneath” arches, chalk “on” sidewalks—without tactile interaction. The result is decorative specificity that never turns into dramatic leverage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake is announced as “harness the nebula,” but no obstacle, rival, or trade-off ever materializes; pressure remains ornamental. Escalation is replaced by repetition of communal awe. Without a visible price or foreclosed path, the story drifts from beatific hope to slightly brighter beatific hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of communal uplift is stated outright (“they knew that they had created something truly special”), not emerged through contradiction or cost. The butterfly garden and chalk diagrams are offered as symbols, but their meaning never shifts; they merely decorate the same chord of wonder. Final paragraph’s moral summary caps the piece in uplift sermon rather than resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice stays consistent, with gentle anaphora and soft consonants that match the pastoral-nebula mood. However, the voice never individuates—Aria, Lyra, and the chorus of settlers all speak the same elevated, abstract register. The prose is pleasant but interchangeable; no perceptual signature distinguishes ghost from gardener.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentences flow cleanly without scaffold loops, but metaphor density is high and generic—“kaleidoscope of colorful creatures,” “beacon of hope”—without pattern payoff. Some phrasing drifts toward brochure prose (“lush trees and vibrant flowers,” “truly special”). Opening and closing lines are smooth; middle paragraphs sag under repeated uplift cadences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Altruistic ghost guiding colonists via chalk sigils is fresh, yet the execution drifts into eco-fantasy cliché: nebula energy, floating arches, butterfly garden as shorthand for harmony. Risk is avoided—no dark side of communalism, no ghostly regret, no settler dissent. The result feels like a gentle mural rather than a transformed trope.</comment>
