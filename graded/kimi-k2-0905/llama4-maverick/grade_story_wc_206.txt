<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Erebus’s calm-sage interiority is consistent, but the stakes never rise—his goal is static, no contradictory impulse appears, and the final smile is unearned because no cost is dramatized. The single on-page choice is the invisible final screw-turn; everything else is observation. Character is vivid yet pressure-free.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: thick sensory layering builds toward the chord release. Closure is a Charged Poise (crystalline note fills chamber), but the cost is only atmospheric; nothing is foreclosed for Erebus. Causality is thin—golden chip guides, box sings—so the reconfiguration feels aesthetic, not decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonance chamber as micro-setting: vibrating air, luminescent orbs, and the music box itself constrain every motion. Spatial choreography stays crisp; the chamber’s whispers literally tighten the final cadence. Selective sensory detail (midnight light, metal harmonics) anchors POV without catalogue drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—is declared early but never tested; no visible price or narrowing options. Escalation is textural (glow brightens, whispers deepen) rather than causal; tension plateaus until the note simply appears. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized on Erebus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through rust-covenant emerges via imagery, not statement. Subtext sits in the golden chip’s dimming: transmutation consumes its own source. Final image reweights silence as something repairable, but the insight stays general; ambiguity is present yet not piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV maintains consistent omniscient distance with a tinker-poet diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “covenant of rust”). Rhythm swells and hushes in sync with chamber hum; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“seemed to glow”) are few and voice-motivated. Syntax stays lyrical without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled; figurative layering serves atmosphere, not density bloat. One paraphrase loop (“light stolen by midnight” vs “reclaim the light”) and a few adjectival stacks near climax, yet meaning stays clear. Final crystalline note lands clean, no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: music-box repair as alchemical ritual, rust-as-covenant, truth-sensitive tools. Conceptual risk pays off—transmutation through silence feels inevitable in hindsight. Could swap names, but chamber-acoustic metaphysics is specific. Tone and premise are memorable, not quirky ornament.</comment>
