<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete— “quiet ache in his chest,” “hands feeling empty”—and the fresco fragment acts as an embodied, contradiction-holding object. The final beat earns a credible micro-choice: he accepts the bittersweet cost of transience rather than demanding permanence, foreclosing the option to stay inside the memory. The only drag is a slight over-reliance on diagnostic shorthand (“the joy had faded”) early on; under stress his voice stays specific (“breathless hush as the image snapped”), satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as an earned Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural dissolves but the “echo of its light” reweights the premise—joy is portable, not archival. Causal lattice holds: because he risks exposing the fresco fragment to the beam, therefore the image locks, therefore the memory arrives with cost. Orientation is clean (who/where/when inside daydream declared by word 30). No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (fog ↔ dissolution) tightens to the final flicker.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fog-claimed orchard is not backdrop but chemical bath: it actively eats the projected pigments and forces gentle projection tactics. Micro-setting inside the sleeve-holster of the silver cylinder governs the decisive beat—its hum decides when beam meets fresco. Sensory economy is tight: damp moss, cool fragment, pearlescent bloom—no checklist cycling. Final image reuses “grey silk” of opening fog, now charged with lost warmth, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim lost joy”—faces one visible tightening: over-exposure will white-out memory forever, a tactical risk taken when fragment meets beam. Cost is legible: the mural lasts only seconds before fog reclaims it, leaving him with after-image rather than possession. Agency sits entirely with Elian; no external antagonist needed. Could use one more intermediate beat where he actively rejects an easier, dimmer projection—would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory’s value lies in its evanescence, not its capture. Subtext is carried by the exposed-film metaphor—attempting to fix the image destroys it—made concrete when the light bloom flares if pushed. No explicit moralizing; the final “pensive mirth” is an embodied stance, not a thesis. The pitted brick wall, once marketplace canvas, now crumbling, quietly comments on public vs. private art, giving the theme plausible counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at tight psychic distance; perceptual signature favors painterly color verbs (“pearlescent,” “spectral fruit”) and light-based synesthesia. Rhythm modulates: long silk-sentence for fog entry, staccato “too much focus—white flare” under threat. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly Elian-bound. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“he sensed the hum”). Final clause “echo of its light…now warmed his chest” achieves Charged Poise without rupturing idiom.</comment>

<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay internally coherent (fog as grey silk, tree as frozen lightning) and serve physical logic rather than ornament. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density high: one line can layer tool cue, sensory data, and conceptual risk—“the memory he sought to project was a fragile, light-saturated negative, easily washed out.” No artifact touches closure beat; clarity propels rather than obstructs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Painting with light onto exposed-film memory” is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes; execution commits fully, following optical rules to their emotional end. Orchard reduced to fog and skeletal espaliers feels specific rather than borrowed Gothic set. Transience-as-joy subverts expected recovery arc. Risk—entire story unfolding inside a daydream—heightens meaning without gimmick, because dissolution is priced on-page. Minor proximity to “memory palace” motif keeps it from 9+ band.</comment>
