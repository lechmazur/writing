<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—math-desire vs. live-heart need—drives every beat; the micro-choice to drop the nautilus and channel grief into glass crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Kael’s understated departure motive and silent tear keep him from becoming a mere trigger. If the nautilus dismissal had carried a sentence of body-level regret, she’d hit 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sterile sphere → Kael’s leaving → re-valued method → living sun gift, each step foreclosing options. The final image reweights the premise—“So you don’t forget what it feels like” lands Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (her palm now empty, his path gone). No orientation drift; twilight & Nexus sketched by word 60. Clean publish-now closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ember Nexus twilight functions as micro-setting: residual magic dust under boot, vesper crickets, crystalline grit—choices happen inside it, not in front of it. The flawed sphere and nautilus act as embodied locales whose states change and constrain final action. One more sensory anchor (smell of ozone? heat shimmer on skin) would have nudged 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture density of presence”—tightens when Kael’s secret threatens permanent absence, forcing the improvisatory re-casting of the sphere. Escalation is single but decisive: the cold pulse flips to warm, living gold at visible physical cost (her abandonment of perfected math). Meets high-band cost test under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: life refuses static perfection; presence is forged through messy relinquishment. Subtext lives in gestures—nautilus dropped, tear unspoken. Final image answers the thematic question without sermon. Could flirt higher if an earlier beat had shown her mathematical safety actively harming a relationship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited to Elara stays locked; perceptual signature steeped in alchemical diction—“ethereal physics,” “logarithmic spiral,” syntax rhythmic yet precise. Emotional modulation compresses diction under grief without voice drift. Dialogue minimal but differentiated; Kael’s hushed brevity counterweights her analytical cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + concept), rhythm breathes with beats, no filler. Figurative layer is dense but patterned early (“scientifically romantic”) and pays off at closure. One tiny scaffold—“the precise timeframe she’d often tried…”—could trim three words, yet momentum never stalls. Clean grammar, strong verbs, audible read-aloud flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy alchemy fused with emotional physics feels fresh; the “sun you can hold” trope is retooled into a grief battery. Logarithmic spiral vs. chaotic gold reversal supplies a non-obrible yet inevitable conceptual twist. Risk is present but safe; a bolder structural gamble (mosaic shards of past failures?) could push 9+.</comment>
