<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyric, embodied, and contradicts itself in real time (“the thunder in her chest had finally broken”). Every micro-choice—shelving cartography, pocketing the stone, planting teacup herbs—reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only flaw is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she understood now”) right at closure, blunting the purest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard layers sensory density until the feather’s touch triggers the decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—roots dream, rain scent—re-weighting prior phantoms with undeniable conceptual cost (“home was not a place to be found but a foundation to be laid”). One hairline slip: late intro of feather method after prior searching beats; still, pattern is taught by payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but active constraint: skylight grime dictates discovery posture, hollowed atlas dictates hiding logic. Micro-setting—teacup windowsills, owl-feather dust—becomes toolkit for rooting. Final image of soil dream is charged by these exact tactile anchors, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she inhabit home as present tense—tightens through sensory accretion, not causal reversals. Escalation is density shift: nightly substitutions grow frantic vs. stone’s counter-gravity; final choice to plant herbs forecloses phantom travel with felt forfeiture. Cost is legible in breath-level cadence change from salt-spray to soil scent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: belonging is cultivated, not retrieved. Subtext coils through mirrored textures—glass seer / glass dome—until feather’s soft drag re-prices “language” as resonance, not symbol. Final rain image answers the thunder premise without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric glides into free-indirect without filter verbs: “her mind performed its harrowing trick.” Perceptual signature is mercury-silvered—fractured reflections, salt-spray, chill alpine air—never generic. Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to clipped precipice beats (“This felt like the final precipice”) under pressure; zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Density is surgical—“labyrinthine bookstore, a universe of paper and dust carved into a mountain” does world, scale, and metaphor in one breath. Sentence variety propels: participial opening, em-dash insert, final monosyllabic punch. Clean copy; no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope—orphaned seer seeks magic stone—flipped into anti-quest: artifact’s power is to anchor, not reveal. Bookstore-mountain as living archive feels unprecedented; feather-as-braille reinvents “lost language” without exposition. Risky lyric compression pays off; specificity makes the premise inseparable from this voice.</comment>
