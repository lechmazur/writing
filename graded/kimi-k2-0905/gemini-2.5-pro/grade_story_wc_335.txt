<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—mentoring while retreating—are alive in every beat; the backward walk is not a label but a live tell that costs him spatial dignity and foreshadows his own exile-trap. Elara’s micro-choice to restack scrolls instead of fleeing crystallizes her internal shift and repays Kael’s abrasive lessons with earned reciprocity. Both characters remain knowledge-bound; neither is granted omniscience or therapeutic self-diagnosis. The mentor-status crucible is fully dramatized: power tilts when she kneels, proving resilience can reverse roles without speech.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s kneeling to restack scrolls re-weights “home” from escape to co-rebuilding, paying visible cost in forfeited immediate departure. The Causal lens holds: because Kael maps loss as the key, therefore Elara chooses attachment to the broken place itself. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words (“dust motes settle,” “empty playground swing”). The final image carries persistent constraint—the exile rule survives—but her stance reconfigures its meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominates: velvet-draped pedestal, scuffed floorboards, and tea-dregs slate act as tactile arenas that constrain how knowledge can be extracted. The playground-swing creak outside threads through as auditory clock and exile metaphor without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clean despite Kael’s backward shuffle; scroll-collapse lands as physical obstacle that Elara re-orders. Environment does not merely echo mood; it furnishes the only tools (cube, leaves, dust) that can be traded for passage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elara will internalize Kael’s brutal resilience lesson—tightens when the shadow-cube warns that premature return equals permanent entombment. One meaningful escalation: the map vellum’s “forget your mother” clause converts abstract exile into felt sacrificial cost, foreclosing fantasy of painless homecoming. Agency stays internal but visible; her final choice to stay and restack is an active forfeiture of the exit cue she finally possesses. Under Causal lens, the tightening is irreversible: once she sees loss as key, leaving would betray the map she requested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: resilience is not heroic departure but patient attachment to damaged ground. Subtext is encoded in gesture—Kael turning away to hide tremor, Elara kneeling to tidy his chaos—rather than exposition. The ending resists moral by leaving exile-rule intact; theme re-weights via stance, not sermon. No late symbolic graft; scrolls, dust, and shadow accrue meaning through use, not retroactive label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara yet permits Kael’s exterior crumbling; perceptual signature is hush-sensitive (“quiet enough to hear dust settle”). Syntax lengthens during tea-reading intensity, then fractures into short bursts as Kael retreats, mirroring his panic. Dialogue carries subtext: “Bring me your cup” is both command and confession of need. Voice never drifts into explanatory omniscience; metaphors stay sensory, not cerebral.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and interior tilt (“His long, scarred fingers traced the lines left by the moisture and dregs”). Rhythm modulates from languid opening clauses to staccato charcoal-scratch verbs. Minor scaffold: “then another” repeated in retreat beat; does not dull closure. No mixed metaphors; mirror-shard skin and tea-geometry share consistent fragility motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shard-mirror archivist reversing through his own fragments freshens the mentor trope; tea-leaf cartography as exile-mapping feels inevitable yet unmined. Reversible exile as bureaucratic after-life bureaucracy is conceptually bold, committed to without infodump. Micro-risk: choosing quiet ending over escape spectacle; pays off by redefining “home” as co-labor. Specificity of jasmine residue on slate cannot be swapped with generic divination.</comment>
