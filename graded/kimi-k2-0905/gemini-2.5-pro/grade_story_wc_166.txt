<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is lush—his dance is a need, not rebellion—but “memory is not a disease” drifts toward thesis-speak near the peak. His embodied contradiction (craving connection while embracing exile) stays active in scene, yet the final beat edges into tidy calibration: the cosmic verse appears and his stance flips almost painlessly. Cost is felt (obsidian skin, unerasable), still the pivot from translator-stuck to cosmically-anchored hinges on a single inward gasp more than on a prior mistake or risk. That keeps him just shy of the 9-band where earned flaws must visibly bite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the exile frame flips from isolation to cosmic conduit, cost etched in literal skin. Tension escalates along an Accumulative/Textural lens—gaps widen, starlight pools, obsidian blooms—each loop tightening the same stake rather than causal turns, fully earned by the pattern taught early. No orientation drift; anchors (twilight garden, scrying dust) surface inside 120 words and re-cohere at the end image. The only micro-slip: “he began to fledge” abstracts the exact beat of surrender; a sharp verb or image there would remove the hairline wobble keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden, body, stone weave into one micro-setting that actively limits foot placement and channels starlight; spatial choreography stays crisp through spin and stillness. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—cool moss, cold obsidian, violet dusk—never tourist catalogue. The final image of skin-constellation depends on the garden’s open sky for scale, meeting the 9-band gate for setting-as-constraint, but description peaks early and reprises mostly in echo; one fresher sensory jolt in the last 100 words would have nudged it over.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“write memory back into the world”—is declared up-front and tightens through pattern intensification: gaps widen, dust awakens, skin accepts the ink. Agency resides in attention and surrender rather than external opposition; the requisite single deepening (his choice to attend his own heartbeat-gap) narrows options from dance to anchoring and carries visible price (irreversible mark). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence never intrudes. The cost’s emotional magnitude feels proportionate to the lyric scale, though a slightly sharper external jeopardy whisper (ban patrol? discovery risk?) could have pushed tension into 9 territory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the right to remember is proven by turning memory into somatic fact. Subtext operates through image—dust drinks light, obsidian replaces skin—never slogans; “cosmic verse on mortal skin” stays motive, not maxim. The ending offers Charged Poise: Kaelen stands illuminated yet permanently marked, a living refutation the regime cannot unwrite. Resonance deepens because the body itself becomes banned text; no tidy moral is pronounced, only an irreversible new grammar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains obsidian grace: syntax lengthens and softens during dance, fragments into star-breath at the anchor-moment, then firms for the final epitaph-on-skin. Perceptual signature—measuring voids in primrose exhale—remains idiosyncratic and consistent; no head-hops or filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within Kaelen’s poet-exile lexicon; the single overt phrase “cosmic verse” is justified because it is literally enacted. Rhythm modulates cleanly with pressure; the lyric pattern is taught early and paid off in the final clause “ etched into his very skin,” earning the high band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence is near-flawless: sentence openings vary, no template churn, and metaphor density peaks only at the climax where it is earned. Tight concision—every line layers image or heat; scaffolding is minimal. One mixed vehicle—“pinpoint of perfect shadow” rubbing against “cool dark fire” momentarily blurs physical logic, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9+. Otherwise, propulsion, clarity, and sonic pleasure are exemplary.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8.7</question><comment>The nostalgia-ban + tide-dance fusion feels genuinely fresh, and the cosmic-ink payoff grows inevitably from the premise. Specificity—granite-cool moss, violet sky, dust-mote scrying—grounds the speculative frame. Risk in structure (quiet lyric escalation in lieu of causal reversals) pays off, but the concept’s boldness is slightly undercut by familiar “rebel artist vs. dystopia” bones; a sharper societal oddity or biological cost could have pushed originality into 9+.</comment>
