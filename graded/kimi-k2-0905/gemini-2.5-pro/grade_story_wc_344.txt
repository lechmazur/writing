<comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—“driftwood nostalgia,” “quiet obsession that hummed beneath her ribs”—showing contradictions in real time. Micro-choice of uncapping the vial is tied to a visible cost (light itself is swallowed) and forecloses retreat. Slight over-tidiness in the emotional arc—ache resolves almost too neatly into “purpose fulfilled”—keeps it from 9+. No safety-hedging; flaws complicate the attempt.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is a therefore/because chain—scrap prophecy → mirror chamber → eclipse key → gear-turn → golden dawn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors collapse to one true reflection and the distant morning finally “feels close,” cost paid by the swallowed light and the centuries of failed selves. No teleporting props; the gear pattern is seeded in the satchel early. Orientation is anchored by word 60. Exceeds 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>Frozen library above clouds is not postcard scenery—it supplies the literal frost that seals the Orrery and demands the eclipse counter-move. Micro-setting of the obsidian vial acts as portable void, constraining the only tactic that can succeed. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies, mirrors, gear, and planetary arms remain trackable. Hauntingly bright light is returned to as thermal, visual, and moral pressure—earns its descriptor every beat.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore the Orrery or remain in perpetual twilight—signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: the moment she uncaps the vial, the only live option becomes the crescent keyhole; all other timelines are literally blinded. Cost is legible on-page: the light she has lived under for centuries is devoured, and every mirror-Elara who failed becomes silence. Agency is hers; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<comment>Theme of repair as self-repair emerges organically through image and action, never thesis statement. The Orrery’s restart mirrors her own internal re-gearing; “rhythm of repair” reweights from metaphor to literal ticking. Subtext in the mirror hall—countless selves already broken—makes the final singleton image earned. Could use one more oblique echo to tighten the abstraction, but resists moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is crystal-specific—“water-smoothed wood held in the hand,” “hauntingly bright frost.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during discovery, then compresses into staccato gear-mesh at climax. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-motivated. Dialogue absent by design; prose itself functions as character breath.</comment>

<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is patterned early—light as cruelty, frost as skin—and paid off when both shed. Rhythm accelerates across the uncapping beat without sacrificing clarity. Opening and closing lines reverb: twilight → golden morning, driftwood → fulfilled rhythm. Minor lexical illusion “visceral drop” could be more idiomatic, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Lunar-eclipse locksmith who picks locks with shadow is a fresh conceptual twist; eclipse-as-key feels inevitable in hindsight. Frozen library above clouds, mirror-hall of failed selves, and obsidian eclipse-ink are synthesized into one coherent mythic engine. Risk taken in making light itself the antagonist pays off. Near-echoes to Borges and “Hugo-award finalists” are transformed through tactile gear-and-shadow mechanics.</comment>
