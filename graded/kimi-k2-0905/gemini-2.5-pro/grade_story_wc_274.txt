<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“a wave of vertigo… scream in her ears”), motives are consistent, the micro-choice to transmit the letter is credible, and the final cost is felt. The “bravely conflicted” label is slightly diagnostic, but the embodied pressure compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery → moral rupture → irreversible act. Orientation is anchored by line 3; closure lands with visible cost (“the world outside… unaware of the story about to be written violently upon it”). One minor causality bump: the pre-Unification terminal’s exact continued connectivity is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cryo-vaults, frost-rimmed cabinets, and archaic terminal are tactile and POV-filtered; snow both insulates and threatens. The setting constrains the act (only one hidden terminal reaches the ghost grid). Minor over-reliance on visual; other senses appear but are sparse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus social peace—is signaled early and tightens once: the letter’s transmission forecloses retreat. Cost is legible (“betrayal to the silent… figures”). Escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than a spiral, sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: archival purity as complicity. Final image of blank snow about to be “violently written upon” reweights all prior preservation work without moralizing. No motif checklist; the snow and archive reappear with shifted charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains a precise, archivist-attuned perceptual signature (“frost-rimmed data-vanes,” “pneumatic tubes”). Syntax tightens under pressure; no head-hop. One clause edges toward elevated register (“conceptual repricing” tone) but stays within Elara’s professional lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences vary; no loops or paraphrase churn. Strong verbs and nouns dominate. A single mixed metaphor (“ghost in the machine” beside “whisper of ventilation”) is minor. Momentary filter-verb cluster (“felt a pang”) but immediacy recovers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frozen-archive-as-panopticon feels fresh; the dormant-network gambit nods to cyber-icepunk but is grounded in tactile detail. Emotional specificity carries the piece past trope. Risk is present but not radical; synthesis is competent rather than revelatory.</comment>
