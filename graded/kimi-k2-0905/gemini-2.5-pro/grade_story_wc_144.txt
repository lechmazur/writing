<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s calm, tactile brilliance is lived-in: her blindness is never a superpower but a constraint that forces inventive methodology. Every micro-choice—dipping fingers, tracing seams—reveals a hierarchy of values: craft over self, precision over haste. The enduring cost is the audible draining of time, felt in the harbor horns; she forecloses rest, maybe future commissions, to finish. Interiority is concrete (“her useless eyes”) and never explanatory; the only flaw is near-perfect competence that edges toward sainthood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure thickens through sensory density until meaning ripens. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; anchors never drift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the now-still water and distant chain-clank reweight every prior flutter into earned stasis; the cost is the solitary stillness she accepts. Two microscopic skips—no explanation of how carbon wire rides the strut and a slightly convenient instant bond—keep it from perfect 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist, condensation-slick windows, and vibrating floorboards are not backdrop but instruments: they transmit sound, register time, and mirror internal tension. The repair shop itself is a micro-setting whose every bench-scratch and water basin constrains method; spatial choreography is immaculate as hands move from bowl to wing without a lost micron. Environment literally guides choice: the depot’s horn is the countdown she cannot see. Final image of distant anchor chain leverages setting to crystallize cost—her stillness versus the world’s motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the ship sails blind without this drone—rings from first line to last. Escalation is purely textural: each horn blast layers density, thinning available time while sensory detail sharpens. Agency is crystallized in the patch moment; no outside savior appears. Cost is felt in the final stillness, but because the price is opportunity/ exhaustion rather than a visible forfeiture, it just misses the 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “repair as translation between chaos and order” emerges through recurring feedback loops: torn wing → chaotic ripples → perfect concentric circles. No character names the theme; it accrues in tactile imagery. Subtext simmers in the contrast between the harbor’s brute industrial motion and her miniature precision. Closure reprises the image of still water, now charged with the cost of isolation—an earned, non-allegorical resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-limited dips so close to Elara’s skin that syntax mimics her groping certainty: clause lengths tighten as horn blasts interrupt. Diction stays within a blind craftswoman’s ken—no visual adjectives, only texture, temperature, vibration—creating a rare perceptual signature. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken. Register never drifts; filter verbs are purposeful (“she could feel” is knowledge boundary, not hedging).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary from short surgical bursts to longer liquid lines that mirror water motion; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“its whirring a dissonant, painful thrum”). Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves by sonic image. Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphors, high information density—every clause advances repair, time, or sensation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blind engineer decoding fracture via refracted water ripples is a fresh, non-obvious problem-solving frame. The synthesis of artisanal craft and industrial freight in a liminal rail depot feels specific rather than steampunk set dressing. Risk—making a climax out of tactile water inspection—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Remove Elara or the ripple-method and the story vanishes; concept is inseparable from execution.</comment>
