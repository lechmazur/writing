<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “curiously steadfast” trait is dramatized in the final lie; earlier beats show micro-choices (crab-pot nudge, rye offer) that escalate from chaos to persuasion. Interiority stays concrete—brass recorder as “cold weight,” not label-speak. The filial debt motive is clear, but Silas and Eva remain sketches; their lack of interiority flattens the crucible and caps emotional cost at mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: each failed tactic narrows options until the lie detonates the deal. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—fob discarded, Silas exiled, recorder warm—cost felt in Eva’s snarl and Elara’s shadow retreat. Orientation locked by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Minor slip: Boro beat stalls rather than tightens, but it doesn’t touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brine, mildew, phosphor-kelp stall, and splintered crate are filtered through Elara’s thief-senses and guide her stealth choices. The pier’s rotting geometry is tracked without spatial drift; the recorder as micro-setting constrains the final tactic. Weather (rising tide) mirrors ticking clock but never alters physical possibility. Enough specificity to reach high band, though not quite charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled early and paid off when the lie’s strain is wax-sealed. Three successive failures escalate risk: chaos → legal plea → bribery, each foreclosing a channel and raising social exposure. Final reversal is protagonist-forced with visible price (Silas’s ruin, Eva’s scorn). Stakes stay personal, not abstract, satisfying short-form scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: loyalty as recorded currency—once forged, once broken, once counterfeited. Subtext lives in the recorder’s click and the serpent’s false scale; no moralizing line spells it out. Ambiguity lingers: Elara owns a brittle archive of betrayal, future value unknown. Slight deduction for “sound of trust breaking” echoing too neatly in closing beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction—“ghost in homespun,” “sycophantic laughter”—carries idiosyncratic rhythm without purple drift. No head-hops; Silas and Eva rendered only through Elara’s ears and eyes. Dialogue sparse but functional: Silas’s “little bird” and Eva’s hiss carry status cues. Recorder’s click and tossed fob provide the final percussive cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative load is controlled—“metallic tang of unspoken agreements” risks abstraction but is anchored to taste. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed moment: “comforting unease” is stated twice; second instance could compress. Otherwise clean propulsion, high density, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar pirate-market trope is refreshed by sonic espionage premise and blacksmith-encoded flaw. Recorder-as-currency and wax-cylinder payoff feel specific rather than gimmick. Risk is moderate: lie-as-forgery reverses power without violence. Not radically new, but synthesis of sound-theft + metallurgic con makes the angle memorable.</comment>
