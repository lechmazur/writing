<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, obsessive mission is credibly particularized: the orris-root comfort gesture, the precise catalog of grey contagion, the furtive swaps. Interiority stays concrete—she smells violet/earth, feels the frantic heart—without therapeutic self-labeling. The final realization that she seeds questions, not life, is earned by earlier stealth beats and visibly costs her the priestess self-image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pattern of tiny anchor-drops tightens stakes by increasing visibility risk and refining her theory. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “she wasn’t waking the houses at all” reweights every swap under a social-cost frame—she’s now a question-peddler, exposed to residents’ gaze—felt in the new lightness/flamingo beat. No plot amnesia; props remain tracked; orientation anchored in first 40 words. Persistent constraint: once the orris shard is left, she can’t undo the trace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Salt-mud, bruised-lavender sky, and the jagged rhizome create micro-setting objects that constrain tactics (covert scent, tangible mis-placements). Spatial choreography is clean from rock garden to stoop to lawn. The “quiet bay in spring” never lapses into postcard; each sensory note is filtered through Elara’s bias against sterility. Final image—garish flamingo on perfect lawn—crystallizes the reconfiguration and is inseparable from the closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can micro-disruptions keep the bay alive—tightens when the white-cube insertion exposes her to discovery (one meaningful escalation). Agency stays micro but cumulative; the orris deposit is the decisive push that forces her conceptual flip. Cost is legible: loss of anonymity (man now studies lawn) and her prior self-definition. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative density of consequences.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of creeping normality versus curated chaos emerges through the sequence of swapped objects and color invasions; never stated but crystallized in the flamingo image. Subtext uses silence—residents never speak yet their interior shift is legible through exterior color. Complexity is honored: no moral that all disruption is good, only that noticing is survival. Final image’s gaudy pink answers the grey contagion without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Free-indirect texture is consistent: “salt-heavy air smelled of mud and nascent blossoms,” “fashionable contagion” reflect Elara’s educated, sensory bias. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for dawn bleed, clipped for heart hammer. Compression is taught early (“a shard of hush inserted”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is specific enough to separate her from generic flaneur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence opens, grounds, and stakes. Figurative language is selective—daydreaming streetlights, bruised lavender—and stays coherent under pressure. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates for the deposit beat, then exhales into twilight retreat. Final line cadence mirrors first, recharging “hushed blaze” without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—guerrilla beautification to fight aesthetic monoculture—is fresh, yet grounded in grandmother folk-practice. Stakes miniaturized to flamingo scale feels inevitable rather than quirky because specificity (orris scent, grey palette) anchors it. Risk of twee averted by cost of exposure. Not a radical paradigm shift, but synthesis of gentrification critique with tactile magic is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
