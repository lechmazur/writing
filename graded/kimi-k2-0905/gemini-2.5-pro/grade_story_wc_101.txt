<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s hunger-driven persistence and the embodied bell-ringing renunciation land with cost; interiority stays concrete (“let its pure tone ring out once”). The shift from anonymous terror to communal garden is earned, though the elders’ “rusty gates” memory beat edges toward label-speak. All micro-choices feed the stake; no competence over-balances struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the single bell-note crystallizes options and reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each food drop tightens trust until Elara’s public vow forecloses secrecy. Cost is visible in the empty food sacks replaced by seeds. No orientation debt; terra-cotta arbor anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Monochrome want, wind-as-marauder, and the skeletal arbor act as micro-setting that constrains every choice. Sensory triage (cheek-hollows, stomach growls) mirrors internal lack. The ridge’s clay pillars physically stage the final vow and supply the garden’s foundation—setting directly charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—community survival vs. dignity—tightens when anonymity flips to mutual recognition; bell replaces rice, seeds replace food. One meaningful escalation: Elara’s declaration turns passive receipt into co-creative risk. Cost is the foreclosed option of endless charity; garden labor is the visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><question>9.0</question><comment>Theme of memory-as-seed emerges through the bell and orange-tears without slogans. Final image reconfigures past loss into future cultivation; ambiguity lingers—donor stays buried, yet community is already changed. No moralizing, just reweighted silence filled with hoe scrapes.</comment>

<question>6</question><question>8.8</question><comment>Lyrical third-person compresses exposition into metaphor (“monochrome of want”) yet stays legible. Rhythm modulates: short clauses for hunger, elongated for garden dawn. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays in Elara’s bias. Bell’s chime supplies acoustic texture that bookends the piece.</comment>

<question>7</question><question>8.6</question><comment>High information density—each sentence carries both image and stakes shift. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. “Amplified quiet” is coined once and paid off in final scrape-murmur. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.3</question><comment>Post-sanction garden-from-bell feels fresh; donor anonymity inversion avoids savior cliché. Risk is taken in quiet ending rather than triumph, and coherence holds. Could edge higher with sharper socio-political specificity, but synthesis of hunger + heirloom bell + terra-cotta arbor is memorable.</comment>
