<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Arthur’s guilt and vocational crisis are concrete; the micro-choice to leave the heart with Elias crystallizes his shift from verbal apology to active witness. Interiority stays specific to a prison chaplain’s diction (“useless weight of his apology to an empty cell”). Yet the decisive change is articulated by Elias, not dramatized through Arthur’s own embodied beat, so the cost is vicarious rather than personally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Arthur relinquishes the mechanical heart and adopts a new pastoral stance—Earned Stasis with felt cost (he must now “look for cracks,” abandoning the old script). Causal chain holds: Thorne’s suicide → Arthur’s guilt → consultation → Elias’s reframing → Arthur’s renunciation. One minor slack: the shop’s spatial anchors (who/where/when) arrive after 120 words, but the delay is purposeful and waived because the final image re-uses the window/light motif.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dust motes, brass teeth, and the storm-lit gutter are filtered through Arthur’s clerical eye, fusing sacramental hush with tactile repair-shop grit. The window’s “single, brilliant spear” is re-activated at closure, re-weighting the premise. While the broader city remains generic, the micro-setting of bench, gears, and puddles constrains the final metaphor and earns its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Arthur’s need to atone for failing Thorne—is signaled early and tightens when he hands the heart over, foreclosing the option of further verbal ministry. Pressure is coherent but externalized: Elias supplies the insight that reframes Arthur’s vocation; Arthur’s own tactical adaptation happens off-page. Sufficient for this length, yet the visible price (relinquishing the heart) is symbolic rather than materially felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—grace as unearned light, not merit-badge forgiveness—emerges through the storm-window image and the lockbox metaphor, avoiding sermonizing. The final line (“start looking for cracks”) offers a Charged Poise that reconfigures Arthur’s ministry without moralizing. Subtext in Elias’s past as prisoner-craftsman deepens the resonance, though the story keeps its theological assertion implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Arthur’s perceptual filter: sacramental cadence, prison jargon, and mechanical metaphors mingle without register drift. Elias’s dialogue carries ex-con brevity (“We talk a lot about what we deserve…”), distinct from Arthur’s more formal interior monologue. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts naturally under the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; strong verbs (“swallowed,” “wrestled,” “pierced”) carry load without modifier clutter. One near-loop: “He felt the old, useless weight… a silent God” restates prior guilt, but the line’s cadence serves as prayer-like incantation, forgiven. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; the final paragraph lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clockwork heart as despair-lockbox is fresh, and the grace-through-clouds trope is salvaged by the repair-shop crucible and ex-con mentor. The combination of prison chaplain + antique mechanist yields a specific moral geometry not easily transferable. Risk is moderate; the piece leans on familiar religious imagery but redeems it through tactile detail and earned restraint.</comment>
