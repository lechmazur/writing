<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s ache-to-bridge-distance motive stays concrete through tactile actions—stroking waxed leaf, decoding grooves, kneeling at the sapling; each micro-choice is traceable to the core want. Barrow’s nose-led shifts from rest to alert to final sigh externalize stakes without anthropomorphizing. Internal contradiction surfaces once (despair at “simple crack”) but is overridden by persistent ceremony; cost is the two-day trek and the irreversible pivot from searching to tending. No stock interiority; every beat is filtered through sensory minutiae of scrap-metal world.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cylinder re-prices from audio relic to seed-map, crystallizing “distance into closeness” at the sight of matching leaves. Causal spine: cylinder-smell → groove-reading → dog-compass → geothermal cave; each because/therefore step trims options until only nurturing remains. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within first 110 words via scrapyard dust, lean-to, hand-crank. Cost is felt: two-day water-starved hike, pivot from scavenger to steward, dog’s spent sigh—no tidy reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Red dust that “settles on everything” and geothermal steam that “kisses her face” deliver sensory pivot points; environment literally guides nose and foot. Scrapyard, cracked flats, and subterranean terrarium evolve as pressure tightens—each locale constricts choice until cave warmth asserts new rule-set. Wax leaf and cylinder function as micro-settings that constrain decoding posture and time-investment. Final image—phosphorescent fungi illuminating matching sapling—charges thematic re-pricing; setting is inseparable from closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—is signaled paragraph one and tightens when cylinder fails sonically, forcing groove-reading gamble. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded fragment funnels option space toward single geothermal vent, with dog’s scent alerts dramatizing narrowing map. Visible cost: eye-strain, thirst, disappointed expectation at fissure—all on-page. Agency remains Elara’s; Barrow complicates but never solves without her interpretation. No reversal, but deepening pattern satisfies lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance-as-responsibility emerges through concrete recurrence of leaf motif rather than explicit statement; waxed relic becomes living sapling, reweighting “past stories” into future stewardship. Subtext resides in dog’s silences and rock pivot—no moralizing required. Final image re-prices reader’s understanding of grandmother’s intent without sermon. Ambiguity resides in whether seed can survive; complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s perceptual filter—dust taste, loupe glare, moss warmth—without leakage into dog mind. Diction stays sparse, metallic, scavenger-apt: “hand-crank,” “husk of a city,” “iron bones sing.” Rhythm accelerates/shortens during decoding fatigue, then widens into cavern hush—intentional cadence shift. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue; narration owns consistent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero template cadence or synonym loops; sentences vary from fragment (“A single, decisive thump.”) to rolling fungal glow line. Figurative choices (“map of a world that no longer was”) stay physical, never purple. Density high—every line advances image, action, or tone; no filler exposition. Proofing clean, pronoun paths clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic quest is inverted: goal is not salvage but cultivation; cylinder is not media but map; dog is not tracker but translator. Synthesis of olfactory navigation + groove cryptography + geothermal terrarium feels non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Specific detail—wax leaf matching chloroplast green—prevents generic eco-fable. Risk of quiet botanic ending paid off by conceptual repricing that reweights entire journey. Fresh angle earns bonus.</comment>
