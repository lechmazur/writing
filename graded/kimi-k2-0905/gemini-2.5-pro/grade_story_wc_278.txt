<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Guilt as low-frequency hum is embodied and specific; interiority stays concrete through sensory anchors (amber, circuitry-as-constellation). The final etching is a micro-choice that visibly costs—forecloses the loop of denial—earning the quiet. Contradictory impulse (preserve vs silence) co-exists in-scene, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: *Papa* reconfigures the firmware and the psychic noise; cost is the now-silent terminal and the amber left as tombstone—loss made legible. Causal chain: letters → lab → firmware → constellation etching quiets the loop; each step tightens options under the Accumulative lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>City-nebula, bruise-sky, and sterile server rows are filtered through Elian’s tattooist gaze—star-charts on skin vs circuitry on metal—so setting constrains the final etching pattern. The amber’s tactile presence acts as micro-setting that charges the closing image. Spatial choreography clean: studio → desk drawer → lab terminal tracks without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the guilt-hum—tightens when firmware spits Lyra’s panic; each because/therefore beat raises the cost of leaving the loop unaddressed. Etching the celestial harp is a decisive turn that forecloses retreat; price is the resurrected voice forever stilled. Escalation is single but sufficient for 660-word length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular: archiving ghosts vs tattooing stars—both attempts to map absence. The amber’s preserved gnat mirrors digitized baby-cries; final image reweights both as memorial, not prison. No statement of “healing”; resonance is the hush itself. Complexity: archival impulse both resurrects and buries grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is constellation-obsessed, compressed, lyric; syntax mirrors needle-flicks and circuitry paths. Perceptual signature constant—light, amber, stars—without filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Texture taught early (“meteor hush”) and paid off in final stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: each sentence moves—either advances star-map, anchors guilt, or translates firmware. Rhythm accelerates during etching beat, then halts with *Papa*. One soft scaffold: “the state he understood best” slightly explains what line already shows (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; figurative control tight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Firmware that translates baby cries into text is fresh speculative tech; pairing it with constellation tattooing creates a singular synthesis. Amber as both tombstone and tool repurposes static artifact into active agency. Risk—lyric compression of grief into circuitry—pays off in closure without gimmickry.</comment>
