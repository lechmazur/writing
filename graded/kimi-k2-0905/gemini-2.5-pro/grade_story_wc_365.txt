<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s obsession is embodied in concrete sensory ritual; the shard-in-hand micro-choice to “push” rather than block the cascade crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays anchored to physical cues—concrete chill, ozone scent—avoiding diagnostic speak. The final renunciation is earned: he pays with permanent exile of the visions and accepts the parental silence he once resented. Only cap is the slight abstract leap in motive phrasing “weight of a withheld truth” before it’s dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: shard gaze → layered visions → locating Elara’s universe → deliberate redirect. Each beat tightens options until the final dissipative push forecloses return. Closure lands with visible cost: the instantaneous silence of the bay and the collapse of all parallel views, a Charged Poise that reconfigures his occupation from hunter to archivist of finality. No causality breaks; even the off-stage physics is implied by consistent sensory rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The repair bay is not backdrop but instrument: gantry geometry guides line-of-sight for shard-gazing, concrete temperature cues urgency, and residual coolant scent flags the breach moment. Spatial choreography stays clean as Kael shifts from floor-sit to energy-channel push. The shard itself acts as micro-setting that constrains the final tactic. One minus: “abandoned spaceport” status is declared, not exploited for social context or further physical obstacles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth about Elara—signals early and escalates through sensory convergence (chai + coolant) that confirms cross-universe murder, not accident. The decisive tightening occurs when Kael realizes blocking is impossible and chooses redirection, paying with the eternal loss of the visions. Cost is visceral: the bay’s instantaneous silence replaces the lifelong hum. No external coincidence; pressure is purely knowledge-driven under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of cartography: to map ghosts is to evict them. Subtextual refrain of parental protection versus filial quest accrues through the silence that greets each sensory discovery, paid off when Kael replicates their protective omission by sealing the nexus. No moralizing; final line “the map was complete” offers resonant, non-literal answer. One hairline slip: “weight of a withheld truth” leans toward thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Kael’s perceptual filter: syntax lengthens during shard-gaze, contracts to fragments at redirect. Diction stays within a technician-poet lexicon without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext through sensory idiom. The shard’s “fractured” world-view recurs with shifting emotional color, proving rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening pattern; high information density—each clause adds new sensory or causal data. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. The single scaffold-like phrase “the truth landed with its full, crushing weight” is earned by prior sensory layering and thus reads as payoff, not boilerplate. Peak beat prose stays concrete: “hum…screamed, then snapped into silence.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sensory-mapper as cosmic grief-counselor feels fresh; parallel-universe mechanic is retooled into personal archaeology rather than adventure tourism. The causal reversal—accident was actually cross-dimensional assassination via resonance—twists a standard tragedy template without breaking internal logic. Specific detail (chai scent, coolant pitch) prevents generic “multiverse” feel. Risk of quiet ending paid off by Charged Poise silence.</comment>
