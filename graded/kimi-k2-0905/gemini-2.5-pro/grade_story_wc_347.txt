<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s weary resignation and the inherited “ghost-blueprint” instinct give him a sharp, specific interiority; the silent nut-assembly shows a micro-choice that costs him the nut’s soul. The moment he watches the traveler collapse safe outside crystallizes his stubborn spark into earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc stays efficient rather than complex.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: horn-call → caretaker duty → nut-beacon → birds repelled → path glows → traveler exits. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the nut is hollowed, frost locks the cliffs, Elias sits with the cost. Orientation lands by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Copper-etched mechanical birds, frost filigree on granite, and the “drop of solidified night” nut are tactile, selective, and filter through Elias’s practiced eye. The cliffside perch and lethal frost constrain timing and tool-use, charging the final frozen armor image. Spatial choreography is immaculate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get the traveler out before frost—tightens once: the beacon’s subsonic pulse forecloses stealth and spends the nut. Cost is visible in the cracked husk and Elias’s spent posture. No escalation curve beyond the single beat, but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant grace emerges from the nut’s spent husk and the frost’s beautiful prison; no statement, only image. The graceless beauty tone itself becomes the thematic answer. Ambiguity lingers: salvation bought with a cursed tool.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s joints and wind-bitten perception; diction is weathered, rhythmic, never drifts into editorial gloss. The subsonic “scream” and frost “filigree” carry his stonemason sensibility. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; strong verbs (“shoved,” “thrummed,” “stuttered”) propel. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Information density is high—every clause adds weather, tool, or bodily stakes. Frost image returns reweighted, no clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Clockwork orchard, tidal maze, and telekinetic nut-assembly fuse into a fresh myth without feeling like a checklist. The “graceless beauty” conceit is risked but earned by the final cracked shell. Could edge higher if the blueprint ghost had sharper consequence.</comment>
