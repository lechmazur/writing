<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s methodical-playful nature is dramatized in every choice: the pocket-pat that finds the nickel, the systematic “survey” of the garden, the deliberate seven-bounce sequence. Interiority stays concrete and embodied (“absorbed by his bones,” “brush still poised”). The final smile crystallizes a credible renunciation of certainty; cost is felt in the mirrored nickel that now reflects only one wide eye. The apprentice stays functional backdrop, so status/relationship bullets don’t apply.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the single mirrored nickel reweights every prior layer, making the multitudes he tasted legible at felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sonic refraction adds density until the cadence shift of the mirrored surface. Orientation is taught early via scaffold/sun-warmed brick; the dissolve at “world fell away” is purposeful disorientation that pays off. No causality breaks; the hobo nickel’s evolution tracks cleanly across awakenings.</comment>

<comment>Sound-wave garden is rendered through tactile acoustics: “cool, humming turf,” “glass ferns vibrated,” “low, resonant chimes.” Micro-setting (the nickel) constrains every tactical choice and charges the final mirror image. Cathedral scaffold anchors the return, letting turpentine scent collide with rain-wet stone. Spatial choreography holds: the coin’s angle, the seven structures, the apprentice’s upturned face remain trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled in first paragraph and deepened with each refracted garden. Each bounce narrows options by dissolving the previous reality, forcing new orientation. The seven-tone convergence is the decisive tightening that forecloses escape and crystallizes the mirrored stance. Cost is visible: the flawless nickel erases the prior carvings, leaving only his wide eye.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative erasure of images on a single coin: certainty is a surface that can be scraped away. The final mirrored surface offers a Conceptual Repricing—reflection as both gain and loss. No moralizing; the apprentice’s unanswered question lets resonance linger. The hush after “something that rings” invites reflection without thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is restorer-specific: color-as-sound (“blue crystal spire”), paint-layer metaphors for realities. Syntax tightens under pressure—“Light, brick, turpentine rushed back”—mirroring the silent implosion. No dialogue contamination; apprentice’s two lines carry tonal contrast. Filter verbs are scarce; immediacy holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long languid clauses in liquid twilight, staccato triad at re-entry. Metaphors stay internally consistent—sound as fabric, garden as instrument. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. "Bewitch" used thrice with intentional escalation, avoiding repetition fatigue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mural restoration + acoustic physics + hobo nickel as existential passport. Nested awakenings device feels inevitable because the nickel’s carved surface literally re-carves each time. Risk of infinite-regression handled cleanly by re-entry within the same pause. Not a template in sight.</comment>
