<question>1</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s vocation as “between-worlds translator” is credibly embodied: the pocketed lens, the deliberate mis-painting, and the grandfather’s whisper all feed one continuous interior mission. Emotion stays physical—tightened fingers, the sudden lighter glass—rather than label-heavy. The final renunciation (history freed, lens lighter) is earned by the scene’s micro-choices and carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but modest; we feel duty but little self-doubt, so the arc is more ritual than fracture.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the painting’s surface re-set, the crew acknowledged, the lens loses weight—cost felt in that exhalation and irrevocable change of the object’s heft. Causal chain holds: wrong painting→lens reveal→unfastening→truth breathed into present. Orientation (who/where) is clear before 120 words; rooftop market, shadowed tent, single POV. No teleporting props or retro-patches; every beat grows from the last.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Alchemist market “strung high above rooftops” is sketched with the exact sensory economy the rubric prizes: planks creak, canvases smell of linseed + ozone, bottled starlight glints. The lighthouse painting becomes a micro-setting that constrains the decisive act; its reef’s absence is the spatial flaw that unlocks truth. Bodies move credibly through tent shadows, lens-to-eye gesture tracked without drift. Only one minor里程 marker (the city name withheld) keeps it from the 9-band’s razor edge.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—honor erased sailors—remains coherent; pressure tightens when painter’s lie is literally locked in pigment, forcing the unfastening. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of hidden image accrues until transparency flips meaning. Cost is embodied: lens loses weight, history breathes out, protagonist forfeits secret power. No external antagonist needed; the canvas itself is the adversary, and the reversal is protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through pigment, not sermon: overlooked histories physically buried under paint are literally brought to light. Subtext runs in silence—ghost-hand on rail, market woman’s wordless watch—so insight is experienced, not declared. Final image of “corrected light” on reef offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question. There is minor thematic echo (“overlooked histories” is prompt-near language) but it is buried mid-story, not moralised at end.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: smoke you “could almost hold,” “whisper-thin map of a dream,” lens “cool, familiar weight.” Rhythm modulates from languid market drift to crystalline “eternal instant” without syntactic monotony. No dialogue to distort; internal diction stays within an archivist-poet’s lexicon. Compression taught early (“elusively tangible like smoke”) pays off in closure’s translucent paint.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “canvas smelled of linseed oil and ozone” plants setting + stakes in one sniff. No filler-verb stacks or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (lens as lamp, history as freight). One paraphrase loop (“constant companion” / small hand / carried) is minor. Opening and closing lines both punch—anchor and re-charge—with natural rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fantastical “alchemist’s market”+“truth-through-wrong-detail” method feels fresh yet inevitable. Premise could have slid into boutique whimsy, but grounding in maritime cover-up and grandfather’s bequest gives it moral heft. Risk of conceptual micro-art-history is high but commitment is full; no late rule invention. Specificity of *St. Elmo* and reef error gives the twist character not gimmick.</comment>
