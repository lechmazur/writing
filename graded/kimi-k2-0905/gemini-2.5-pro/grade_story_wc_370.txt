<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—empathic hunger vs social panic—stays concrete in micro-gestures (twisting the card, thumb-smoothing creases). The final shift from “shelter must be empty” to “shelter can hold another quiet seeker” is legible and earned. Still, the cost is more conceptual than visceral; we feel the insight but not the forfeiture. A sharper bodily or relational price would push this to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the invitation left unsigned becomes a tangible admission of error and a silent promise of future connection. Causal chain holds: refusal → regret → library vigil → perceptual dissolve → recognition → amended stance. One minor slack: the “staying while leaving” technique is introduced late and functions more as metaphor than rule; it doesn’t break causality but slightly blurs the lens. Cost is felt through the un-crumpled card and the relinquished safety of total solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Athenaeum is evoked through scent, weight, and the hush of “dormant knowledge,” all filtered through Elias’s sensory priorities. The laundromat façade is named once and never used to constrain choice, so the “hidden-in-plain-sight” promise stays decorative. Micro-setting of oak table and green-shaded lamp does charge the final image when the invitation is re-placed there. More tactile negotiation with shelves or exits would have nudged this past 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to endure empathy without drowning—tightens when Elara’s sorrow is perceived risk-free, proving shelter can include presence. The single meaningful turn is the dissolution of Elias’s either/or belief; options reconfigure from isolation vs overwhelm to shared quiet. Pressure escalates via sensory accumulation (clock, scent, footstep) rather than external obstruction. A clearer forfeiture (e.g., the conclave now permanently closed to him) would have pushed 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges: solitude curdles unless it can accommodate selective intimacy. The invitation’s creases become a quiet motif for flawed human choice; its final smoothing reweights the meaning of shelter. No moral is declared; the resonance is in the image of two silent readers sharing a star-mapped book. Slight deduction for the abstract phrasing “enlarged tranquility” that edges toward thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual grammar: vellum scent as balm, clock voice “soft and deep,” Elara’s sorrow perceived as “gentle” before name or face. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens at the click of the latch, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; even Elara’s grief is inferred through stance and book-clutch. One clause drifts toward editorial: “a testament to such nestled paradoxes”—minor register lift, but it recedes quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and double-duty: “crumpled invitation…softened and wrecked by the anxious twisting of his hands” reveals object state and interior torque in one breath. Figurative layer is restrained; when it appears (“heart a frantic bird”) it coincides with actual stillness, so it reads as character perception rather than ornament. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase hiccup—“contained and limitless” / “nested paradoxes” within three lines—keeps this just under 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The empathic recluse hiding inside a 24-hour-laundromat library is fresh, and the “stay while leaving” perceptual trick reframes classic social-anxiety tropes. Yet the society itself, the conclave, and the invitation’s esoteric filigree feel like off-the-shelf secret-society furniture; they decorate rather than redefine the conflict. The core insight—shelter can include silent co-presence—feels inevitable but not radically surprising. A sharper institutional or metaphysical rule would have lifted this into 8+ territory.</comment>
