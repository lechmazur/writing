<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interior contradiction—keeper of light addicted to absence—drives every micro-choice from fingertip-handling the Edelweiss to shelving it beside other hollow trophies. His alpine vertigo, salt-stung solitude, and decision to monumentalize a stranger’s grief are concrete, embodied, and costly; the renunciation of the flower onto the high shelf visibly forecloses his own chance to relinquish memory, earning Earned Stasis. The “borrowed memories” quirk avoids label-speak because it is dramatized through sensory jolts and physical handling, not diagnosis. Only the thinnest sliver of motivational clarity is missing: why thirty years of detachment suddenly crave this specific decoding; without one more concrete trigger the causal arc nicks sub-9 territory.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: shelving the flower crystallizes two irreversible losses—the stranger’s mountain grief and Silas’s chance to jettison his own—under the Accumulative/Textural lens that threads alpine/sea motifs until the final sweep of the beam reweights them. The drive pattern is taught by line 5 (“only the wet, shifting colors of the opal dock”) and paid off when the same chromatic instability now frames the tower shelf; cost is undeniable in “one less ghost in the world.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 9; no lens ambiguity, no causality breaks, no soft reset.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The opal dock’s color-shifting planks, the salt-bleached piling, the lighthouse beam’s metronome—these micro-settings literally constrain investigation tactics: Silas can only “observe gaps” because the fog erases footprints and the wet wood refuses to hold them. Environment charges the final image: the shelf between shell and float becomes a miniature seashore where mountain and ocean converge, making the conceptual cost legible. Sensory hierarchy is keeper-specific—he attends first to textures that speak of absence (faint prints, silent gulls). No spatial drift; no exposition dump; no mere postcard.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens through one meaningful deepening: realization that the ocean is “vast enough to rival a mountain” forecloses the possibility of return or rescue; this is the text’s only pivot yet it reweights all prior fragments. Protagonist agency is attentional, not physical, but still causal: each nightly handling of the flower narrows his emotional options until shelving it becomes irreversible renunciation. Cost is visible in the hollow-space sensation that ends the penultimate paragraph; no coincidence resolves the conflict; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the impossibility of relinquishing peak moments without external witness—mountain memories need an oceanic tomb, and solitude itself demands a keeper to catalog its absences. Subtext operates through recurring gaps—no descent memory, no face, no name—until the reader intuits that forgetting is not erasure but relocation into another keeper’s archive. Final image of the flower shelved among maritime relics reweights the entire motif: alpine purity becomes another curio of isolation. No moralizing, no thesis statement; resonance is purely imagistic.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is keeper-specific: perceptual bias toward absences, weather-chewed syntax, maritime lexicon (“salt-bleached,” “nautilus shell”), rhythmic echo of the rotating beam in paragraph-length alternations. Compression is taught early (“the man’s departure not as an event, but as a sudden, hollow space”) and sustained; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Internal metaphor family—light/dark, peak/depth—remains consistent without mechanical repetition. Dialogue absent by design; interior monologue stays within plausible keeper lexicon and never slips into academic gloss.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “The beam of the lighthouse cut its rhythmic path through the fog, a metronome for his thoughts” simultaneously advances atmosphere, stakes, and interior cadence. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and pattern-driven (opal/color-shift; beam/metronome). Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends using sibilance and maritime diction. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” concept could feel abstract, but the final image grounds it—keeps this just below 9.0.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of alpine Edelweiss with maritime lighthouse is non-obvious and specific; the “borrowed memory” mechanic refreshes psychic-drift tropes by anchoring each flash in tactile object handling rather than generic visions. Risk is quiet—no shock twist—but the inversion of detective logic (decode via absence, not evidence) feels fresh. Even the gull motif subverts expectations: gossip-birds fall silent, offering absence instead of clue. Transformation test fails: this exact emotional arc could only happen in this salt-stung, peak-haunted convergence.</question>
