<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is rendered through precise, embodied action—every shutter adjustment and mirror tilt externalizes the "spiralingly calm" trait. The absence of voiced self-diagnosis keeps empathy visceral, not therapeutic. Yet the character’s flaw/limits stay static; nothing in the canal encounter forces Kaelen to question or pay for that calm, so the arc is flat. Still, micro-choices (leaving one shutter ajar) foreclose the path at visible cost—an enduring vigil—earning credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece runs Accumulative/Textural: shutter-lines incrementally weave a welcoming pattern whose cadence shift (light-star descending) reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the lone persistent slit of light crystallizes guardian duty and reconfigures the canal’s darkness from dread to companionship. Causality stays internal but coherent; no external test challenges the tactic. Cost is present yet gentle (eternal watch), satisfying the 9+ quick test’s "persistent constraint" clause, though not heightened by sharper peril.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and lock-keeper’s cottage are sketched with sensory economy; every visual note serves the light-weaving action. The dental mirror and body-attention replace broad panorama, meeting micro-setting rule. Spatial choreography is flawless—shutter angles, reflection geometry, and guardian stance remain trackable. Environment directly enables the climax: only that exact shutter lattice can launch the star-message, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"teach darkness it is not alone"—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accrual rather than external opposition. Protagonist agency is pure attention and craft; each shutter slit narrows options until the single beam becomes the irreversible gift. Cost is lifelong vigilance, felt when the dock quiet returns as "sleep rather than dread." Escalation is subtle but legible; entering 8.8+ would require a sharper forfeiture or reversal under higher jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: illumination offered, not imposed, reframes loneliness into shared cosmos. The shutter-light tapestry and mirror-star reprise at the end act as Conceptual Repricing—the canal’s rule-set is rewired from menace to quiet fellowship. No explicit moralizing; rejection of force keeps complexity intact. Final image leaves persistent ambiguity (eternal vigil vs. healed dark) that invites after-thought without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distilled, ritualistic, almost incantatory—syntax elongates then contracts like breath, mirroring the "spiralingly calm" psyche. Perceptual signature favors optical minutiae (shutter-sliver angles, thumbnail mirror) over auditory detail, fitting a guardian whose tool is sight. No dialogue, hence no convergence risk; every descriptor is filtered through Kaelen’s patient gaze. Patterned repetition ("one slat… another…") is taught early and pays off in the beam-path release, satisfying lyric-mode rules.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic—each sentence layers image, motion, and metaphor ("wet ink under a bruised sky"). No loops or scaffold; figurative control stays coherent even in peak beat ("firefly sighing its last"). Rhythm accelerates subtly as shutter-slits narrow, then exhales when the light dives. Register remains elevated but consistent with mythic guardian voice; no cluttered micro-movements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The "teach darkness the value of stars" premise is fresh, avoiding exorcist or warrior tropes in favor of gentle optico-poetic engineering. Shutter-weave as loom and dental mirror as star-cannon are novel instruments that feel inevitable once shown. Tension between stillwater dread and humble medical tool supplies memorable specificity. While quiet-guardian tropes exist, the tactile light-coding and empathy-without-speech angle supply non-obvious inflection.</comment>
