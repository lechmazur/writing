<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Kael’s weary titan-in-miniature is vivid via silent motion and the library’s hush; internal contradiction shows in the gentle hand against cosmic ruthlessness. The micro-choice to set the pellet rather than hurl it embodies “regally unpretentious.” No second character, so status/relationship crucible is N/A. Motivation stays abstract (“balance”) rather than dramatized want vs. fear; the cost is cosmic, not personal, so renunciation feels lightly rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pellet dissolves into the rune, the false star gutters, and the throne’s legitimacy is quietly amputated—cost is the library’s erasure and Kael’s dissolution, both legible. Causal chain: centuries of marginalia → pellet → rune → severance holds without gaps. Orientation is complete by “ancient temple library suspended…” (~15 words). Single-scene default met; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Environment is the micro-setting of body-and-lectern: the basalt pedestal, star-chart, and captured starlight dome constrain every motion. Sensory detail is selective—cold dense weight of the pellet, violet pulse—never catalog. The library’s “quiet hum between heartbeats” mirrors Kael’s restraint, charging the final fade. Spatial track is clean: aisle → scroll → scriptorium → nexus under dome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore cosmic balance by unmaking a lie—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each cipher tightens the lattice until the pellet’s release deepens cost. The decisive intensification is the pellet’s dissolution; options narrow to one final command. Price is the library’s and keeper’s erasure—felt but not viscerally personal, keeping it just below high-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image rather than thesis: ink that cannot write yet stains reality = truth too potent for narrative. The graceful collapse of a lie without spectacle argues that cosmic justice is quiet attrition, not spectacle. No moralizing final line; the fading library reweights earlier “whispers” as sufficient revolution. Ambiguity lingers: was erasure worth balance? Answer is implied, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature is Kael’s silent, tactile noticing—“bare feet making no sound,” “cold dense weight.” Syntax mirrors compression: long cadence for spiral aisles, clipped verbs at climax—“He focused his will.” No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Register stays austere and mythic without academic drift; elliptical compression is pattern-taught early and paid off in the dissolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; no looped stems or synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and consistent—“phantom river,” “borrowed light”—no mixed vehicles. One minor scaffold: “a carefully constructed lie woven into the fabric of history” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure. Opening and closing images (silent feet → silent echo) create elegant bookends.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of titan-in-child with cosmic librarian is fresh; ink-pellet as anti-weapon is specific rather than trope. The “graceful collapse” resolution subverts expectation of apocalypse, risking quietness yet succeeding. Transformation test fails if Kael were merely a human archivist—scale and erasure are intrinsic. Slight proximity to “silent cosmic librarian” archetype, but embodied scale and pellet mechanic differentiate.</comment>
