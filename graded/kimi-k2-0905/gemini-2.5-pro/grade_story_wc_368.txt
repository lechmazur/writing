<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s donor-heart curiosity is concrete and embodied; the chalk-dust sun-trails are active micro-choices that externalize motive. Interiority stays sensory—dye-master sight, loupe, refraction—never label-speak. The final renunciation (“some people are prisms”) costs him the chance to possess her story, a credible forfeiture. Only minor gap: we never feel the old life he’s leaving behind, so the change’s full weight is inferred rather than suffered on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the morpho-wing image reweights the premise—stories refract, not stick—charged by the chalk-map he can no longer complete. Causal chain intact: because he tracks light, he sees refraction, therefore abandons claim to ownership. Orientation anchored by word 70; no lens drift. Cost is legible in the abandoned chalk arcs and the unasked question he swallows. One hairline slip: the donor-heart backstory is told, not dramatized, but it primes the final insight without breaking linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating tea-house is sketched with tether-chains, valley mist, and eastern-window sun angle; each detail later constrains the chalk-trail experiment. Micro-setting mastery: the morpho wing on dark wood becomes the lens that reframes color theory. Spatial choreography clean—patrons’ hush, steam curls, her hand-over-heart exit—no floating bodies. Weather thickens across the season, cueing the final mist exit. Meets 9+ gate: the wing/tool charges the final image; only the absence of tactile tea-house routine keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he solve her story-magnetism?—tightens when light arcs refuse straight causality, forcing renunciation. Escalation is textural: each sun-trail adds density until the pattern break (curved light) forecloses possession-goal. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. Cost visible: the chalk map ends incomplete, the wing remains inert on the table—his method defeated. Could edge 8.8+ if a sharper tangible loss (a vat spoiled, a patron lost) had been tied to the revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—perception vs possession—emerges through refraction physics, never named. The morpho wing’s return re-weights “color” from pigment to light, enacting the insight. Final image of prisms refuses moral, invites counter-reading: is curation a higher ethic or an evasion? Subtext in steam-curl questions and her silent hand-over-heart outperforms any statement. Achieves 9+ resonance without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person dye-master voice carries perceptual signature: loupe, vat, pigment, refraction—lexicon never drifts. Syntax breathes with observation—long calm sentences, then clipped “I think I understand” under stress. No head-hop; interior certainty matches sensory limits. Dialogue (two lines) carries indirection and subtext. Meets 9+ quick test: rhythmic control sustains valley-mist wonder without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “a sliver of impossible sky” does triple image/symbol/job. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances chalk-map, character, or refraction concept. Metaphors stay inside physics of light; no mixed vehicles. Minor over-adornment in “quiet, explosive knowledge”—two adjectives where one would burst—but it lands in closure beat so the flare feels earned, not purple. Clean grammar, varied paragraph rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cardiac transplant + optics + tea-house ethnography feels inevitable, never grafted. Tropes transformed—no butterfly = soul cliché; instead structural color becomes epistemic method. Risky choice to make climax a refusal, yet groundwork (curved chalk) makes it feel surprising but not gimmicked. Valley-mist wonder tone and dye-master profession are specific to this piece; swap any element and the refraction metaphor collapses. Minor proximity to “butterfly effect” idiom, but text explicitly rejects causality, sidestepping echo.</comment>
