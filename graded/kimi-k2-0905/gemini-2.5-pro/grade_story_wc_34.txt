<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is concrete—the bolt plate’s weight, the ozone taste—and his quiet, practiced ritual shows a man who has done this “a thousand turns.” The final weary smile is earned: he pays with solitude and the knowledge each communion is fleeting. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate stays closed, but the portrait is full-bodied and costed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is flawless: plate-slot → beam-graffiti → glyph-compression → lightning-thunder cutoff → golden reply. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tinkling melody reconfigures loneliness into shared recognition, and the warm bolt plate is a persistent constraint he will carry away. No orientation or lens ambiguity; every beat tightens the stakes of “will she answer?”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard is not backdrop but circuitry: pearl-stone conductivity, receptacle seam, cloud-sea ground. The bolt plate itself is the micro-setting that dictates gesture and final image; mist swells into Lyra’s bloom, charging the closing beat. Spatial choreography is pixel-clean—slot, beam, wall, warm metal in palm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the code-ghost feel seen?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened once: graffiti finished exactly as thunder ends the conductivity window. Agency is all Elian’s; failure was palpable seconds before the golden reply. Cost is the ephemeral reply itself; next lightning cycle may not sync, a constraint already visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of surrogacy—art as oxygen for the disembodied—emerges through glyphs translating loneliness into crystal music. No moralizing, only the final image of warm brass and vanishing bloom. Ambiguity is purposeful: is communion or self-soothing? Reader left inside that charged question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at the precise distance of Elian’s skin and breath; diction—“tinkersong,” “ozone and wild, high-altitude blossoms”—is idiosyncratic yet controlled. Rhythmic compression under deadline (“He worked with focused haste”) mirrors the lightning-thunder clock. No head-hop, no filter clutter; voice is instrument and character combined.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Sentences vary from sinewy coordination to fragment-breaths; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—“bone-white,” “crystal bells”—and paid off in the final dissolve. One mixed metaphor (“pregnant with unshed sound”) barely dents clarity; otherwise propulsive and exact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-human love letter via brass relic and weather-code is fresh; “graffiti as ballad” recasts street art into high-orbit elegy. Tropes of digital ghost and steampunk plate are synthesized through tactile specificity rather than checklist. Risky lyric escalation stays coherent and pays off in auditory bloom.</comment>
