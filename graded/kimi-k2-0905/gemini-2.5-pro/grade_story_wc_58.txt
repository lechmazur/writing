<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—"ghost of warmth" in the thread anchors tactile memory. The micro-choice to write is the only visible decision; earlier “projection” is narrated, not chosen, so agency is diluted. Cost is present but abstract—companionship with the absent—limiting full earned contradiction. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature ("cartographer who had finally arrived") keeps characterization above the 8-line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the thread reweights healing from erasure to container, felt cost in “magnificent, heartbreaking design.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (smokeless horizon, rust chrysanthemums, scarlet thread) tightens the cadence until the final image reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors clear by line 40. Persistent constraint: island sealed until spring, isolating the act of writing with irreversible solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Autumn garden is not backdrop but instrument—cold bench sharpens physical attention, decay scent mirrors thread’s faded dye, wisteria skeleton frames final “mournful fire.” Thread-as-micro-setting constrains the only path to Elara; without it, projection collapses. Selective sensory hierarchy avoids tourist catalog; only three smells, two colors, one texture earn page space. Meets 9-gate but for absence of lived-in tool manipulation beyond initial cradle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map healing through someone else’s absence—signals early. Pressure escalates by density: each sensorial layer (horizon, scent, thread warmth) deepens the need to articulate Elara’s retreat. Single tightening at the loom vision forecloses option to mourn conventionally; instead Kaelen writes, paying isolation cost. Cost is visible—night falls, light gone, ink still flowing—foreclosing retreat until spring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges without declaration: healing as spatial containment, not erasure. Subtext lives in gesture—thread pulled from fringe equals lifeline pulled from world. Final image reweights earlier “map” metaphor—Elara stepped inside her own cartography, heartbreaking yet triumphant. Resists moralizing; instead offers resonant Charged Poise: two strangers share a map drawn by absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature—“perfume of rust-colored chrysanthemums”—is narrator-colored yet fused to Kaelen’s bias. Syntax modulates: long breathless clause during projection, then clipped final sentence mirroring dying light. No head-hopping; Elara’s interior is filtered through Kaelen’s translocation, preserving POV modesty. Register stays within literary-funeral idiom without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentence variety propels: temporal participle opener alternates with noun-phrase crescendo. Figurative logic intact—“ghost of warmth” literalizes later when dye retains body heat. High density: one sentence can scent, color, and foreshadow (“fallen pear leaves plastered to moss” = map adhesion). Final line cadence mirrors loom shuttle stop, earning rhythmic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—obituarist for the living—flips grief ritual into cartography; not mere novelty but catalyst for entire method. Transformation test fails if thread changed to random object; carpet-as-canvas and sealed-island clock are irreplaceable. Loom-as-mapper device freshens sea-loss trope. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off in resonant CR without expositional cheat. Only hairline slip: “senseless squall” leans familiar.</comment>
