<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet addicted to silent watching—grounds every beat; the lens-box gesture crystallizes his renunciation of further evasion. Lena remains oblique, yet her charcoal-on-stone act makes her grief legible and stakes concrete. Their shared flaw—mutual surveillance instead of speech—compounds until the final offering, earning the thaw. Cost is felt: he abandons a decade of desk-anchored safety, she exposes her coded pain to the very gaze she distrusts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ticket-image thickens the pattern until the cenotaph scene reweights the stake from suspicion to shared mourning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lens transfer reconfigures silence into an audible offer, no words required. Causality is inside the metaphor system—doodles are not props but compressions of time/grief; no teleport or outline sequencing. Orientation anchored by word 60 (registrar’s desk, forecourt, after-hours).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “crystal whispering forecourt” and rain-slick granite recur as tactile mirrors of internal glassiness; the projector lens functions as micro-setting that literally reframes what Elias sees. Environment constrains the climax: wet charcoal clings to stone, making Lena’s public confession irreversible. Weather and light are not backdrop but the surface on which grief is written and read. Spatial choreography is clean: desk → doors → park → cenotaph, no impossible jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can silence be transmuted into honesty—tightens when Elias realizes the doodles are grief, not accusation; this narrows his options to either keep collecting or step forward. One visible cost: he forfeits his ritualized safety (leaves the desk) and Lena forfeits the privacy of her cipher. Escalation is an accumulative deepening, not causal reversals; the cenotaph beat is the decisive intensifier. Agency remains with Elias’s decision to spy-then-reveal, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recurring image-chain of magnified miniatures: every doodle is a private lexicon whose meaning is re-priced when inscribed in public stone. Subtext is carried in gesture—ticket placed, lens offered—not exposition. No moral is stated; the final image of tear-lit moonlight on wet stone lets the reader feel honesty as refraction rather than speech. Ambiguity is retained: thaw is only “delicate,” not redemptive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “curve a cool weight,” “dense ringing silence”—syntax mirrors his hushed precision. Diction remains within registrar-class vocabulary; no register drift. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests in lyrical but concrete compression: “crystal whispering expanse,” “wings of bone.” Free-indirect dips are clean; no head-hop. Rhythm slows into long sentences that mimic held breath, then fractures at climax to mirror release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym churn. Metaphors are specific and consistent (glass, wet stone, charcoal) without stacked purple. Density is high: one sentence often performs atmosphere + interiority + propulsion. Only nit: “crystal whispering” appears twice—once as forecourt, once as park moonlight; the echo is purposeful but teeters on over-leitmotif. No grammar slips; pronouns clean; paragraph cuts are crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—grief communicated through discontinued concert tickets—feels fresh and specific; the projector lens as decoding device is an elegant repurposing of obsolete tech. Risk is taken with near-wordless story, but payoff lands. Slight deduction for recognizable trope of “public chalk/graffiti confession” and cenotaph as grief-site; still, fusion with magnified doodles keeps it from cliché. Transformation test passes: swap lens/tickets and the entire symbolic engine collapses.</comment>
