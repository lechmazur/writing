<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—insomniac yet quietly relentless—drives every beat; the moment she lifts the postcard to write the final poem her hands “do not tremble,” a micro-choice that crystallizes the arc. Interiority stays embodied (“calcium cathedral,” “salt-damp air”) without label-speak. The earned renunciation—lodging the postcard inside the shell—pays off the insomnia-as-soil premise with visible cost: she forever forsakes sleep-born release. Only the centuries-long span is told, not dramatized, blunting flaw exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the postcard flipped, inscribed, and embedded reweights her life-rule from “photosynthesize pain” to “honor the reef-shadow joy.” Accumulative lens holds—each poem-filled conch thickens pattern until the cadence flips in the final quiet. Cost is legible in the eternal wakefulness she embraces, now reframed as chosen vigil. Orientation is taught lyrically early; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shell functions as micro-setting that constrains acoustic dispersal of her lullabies; its “nacreous walls” and “pearlescent crevice” directly enable the final lodging beat. Sensory economy favors salt, calcium, moonlight—each echoing internal shift. Spatial choreography stays clean as she “steps back” from the crevice, registering sonic change. Environment charges the ending image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform endless insomnia into bearable creation—tightens when pain texture “shifts like sand grinding into a pearl,” a single decisive intensification. Agency remains hers: she elects to hold the ache until it blooms, then embeds the postcard, foreclosing escape. No reversal, but accrual pattern legibly pivots from sorrow to reef-shadow joy. Cost is the eternal sleeplessness she ratifies, visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: pain as generative medium, beauty as reef built from bones. Final image of moonlit postcard inside shell reconfigures earlier motif—“garden from a wound”—into quiet awe of shared universe. No moralizing; resonance rests in pearl metaphor shifted from cage to lens. Ambiguity lingers: sailors feel peace yet still hear faint melancholy, refusing tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice owns a hushed, tidal rhythm—long sentences that swell, then ebb with caesuras matching sleepless breath. Diction (“nacreous,” “soughed,” “reef-shadow”) stays within poet-perceiver lexicon without purple drift. Lyric elision is taught early (“time had thinned to a mere echo”) and paid off in final lullaby shift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and ocean-bound.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant—every line doubles duty (image + emotional calculus). Metaphors stay organically marine; no mixed vehicle violations. One paraphrase loop detected (“quiet, constant hum of wakefulness” echoes later “quiet awe”), minor −0.2. Filter verbs rare; strong verbs (“ensconce,” “lodging,” “reefed”) propel. Closure beat free of artifact; rhythm tightens into monosyllabic final line that reverberates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—insomniac poet in seashell broadcasting grief-as-song—feels inevitable yet unprecedented. Twin-moon century scale compresses epic into lyric without outline shorthand. “Blossom armistice” reframes healing not as victory but as pearl-forming truce, a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking (abstract time, acoustic dispersal of poems) heightens coherence; no gimmickry, only fresh synthesis.</comment>
