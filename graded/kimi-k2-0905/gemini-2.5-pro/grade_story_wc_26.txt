<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s solitude, perceptual acuity, and grief-riven caretaking are embodied in micro-gesture and object-use; the river-stone cue and refusal to excise Elara’s trauma show a believable, flaw-laced hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is alive: meticulous archivist vs. lover who will risk archive integrity for wholeness. Final integration act is earned by prior causality—the slow comparison montage—and carries visible cost in renewed sorrow. No head-count or status issues; single-POV sustained.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens is declared early (“subtle blight… devouring”) and every beat follows because/therefore logic: detect → compare → accept shadow → integrate. Anchor (who/where/when) nailed inside 60 words. One meaningful tightening at the video-comparison beat narrows options to ‘accept or mutilate’; cost is palpable in “I’m not letting you fall” and the warmed stone. Closure is a Decisive Change + felt cost: archive restored but grief crystallized.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cloud-top library is sketched with orchid-memory vines and pearl console—selective, tactile,立刻让规则可信. Micro-setting object (river stone) constrains the final act and is charged in closure. Sensory hierarchy biased toward visual/tactile fits archivist POV. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift. Weather twilight used as temporal cue, not symbolism dump. Meets 9+ gate: tool (stone) charges final image.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s psychic wholeness—signalled in paragraph two. One escalation axis: corruption spread → Kael’s narrowing options. Agency is quiet but present: choosing comparison method, then integration sequence, each with on-page cost (hours of attention, emotional reopening). No coincidence; pressure grows via because/therefore. Closure pays the price: restored memory but luminous regret. Could be sharper if a tangible resource (time limit, power drain) had tightened mid-scene.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ‘shadow as inseparable petal of light’ emerges through action, not lecture. Subtext carried in gesture shift (fingers curl inward) and color re-version to frost-blue. Final image reweights premise: hope includes sorrow. No moralizing line; silence after whisper carries resonance. Integration sequence acts as non-literal answer to “what is wholeness?”—avoids tidy profundity. Minor docking for “shape of hope” phrase edging toward prompt-echo.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—visual minutiae, botanical metaphors—tracks with archivist vocation. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during integration to mirror breath. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Free indirect clean: “her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes” filters through Kael’s noticing. No head-hop or register drift. Lyric compression taught by first paragraph and paid off in final silver-blue image.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates: long cadence for contemplation, clipped verbs (“He initiated”) for act. Figurative language pruned to one sustained vine/rose metaphor that does not invade every sentence. No loops or synonym churn; information dense (“a garden of thought… suspended”). Strong verbs (“carving,” “devouring”) replace modifiers. Occasional elevated phrasing (“spectral light-vines”) justified by POV. Closure line uncluttered, lets image resonate. Minor participle opener but sequence remains clear.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Memory-as-orchid, shareable-dream post-society, and sky-library are familiar tropes, but synthesis with trauma-curation and non-deletion ethic feels fresh. Comparison-across-time method repurposes mundane video review into soul surgery. River-stone reweighting rather than magical MacGuffin avoids cliché. If transplant characters to new setting, core emotional logic collapses—proof of specificity. Risk-taking in quiet, anti-heroic resolution (integration not victory) pays off. No close famous-echoes detected.</question>
