<comment>Lyra’s shift from guardian to midwife is embodied in the single gesture of lowering her hand; the shadow-merge beat makes the cost visceral. Kael remains a gentle catalyst, almost too pure, but the story keeps his wants foregrounded. Interiority is concrete and musical rather than analytic; clairvoyance loss is dramatized as silence, not label. The moment of self-recognition as “fearful jailer” lands because it’s forced by the present image, not retro-speech.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s song changes, Lyra’s foresight is surrendered, and the price is audible in the new note. Accumulative/textural lens holds: each stutter or brightening of the cave re-weights the stake until the final pulse re-tunes the world. Orientation is swift—cave, noon, two characters—within the first 60 words. The causal chain is thin but coherent under an accumulative design; the decisive act is placement, not theft, and the cost is her emptied sight.</comment>

<comment>The cave is never inventory; every crystal sound or refraction alters Lyra’s footing or perception. The oscillating crystal that finally guides Kael is a micro-tool that dictates trajectory, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective sensory triage—sound first, light second—mirrors her clairvoyant habit. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single slow walk to the pearl.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“guard or release the Heartstone”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the music stutters. Mid-story deepening occurs when her scrying fails; the option of denial is foreclosed in the shadow-merge beat. Cost is legible: permanent loss of foresight. One micro-turn suffices for this length; escalation is textural (cave’s song growing stranger) rather than causal, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the rightness of relinquishing control; no character sermonizes. The re-tuned world is offered, not promised, keeping ambiguity alive. Final image of “sweeter song” reweights every earlier discord without declaring a moral. Shadow tableaux (flower, laugh, frost) carry subtext of ordinary magic now amplified.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tightly anchored to Lyra’s perceptual filter; sound verbs dominate, matching musical premise. Syntax lengthens during the rush of returned sight, then shortens at release, reflecting pulse. No dialogue clutter; when Kael speaks it’s low and resonant, a foil to crystal chime. Free indirect thought is clean: “Was her role to guard the pearl, or to guard it for this exact moment?”</comment>

<comment>Prose is lyric but disciplined; no mixed metaphors or filler stacks. Sentence rhythm modulates with scene tempo—long clauses for meditation, single stressed beats for the final note. One paraphrase loop (“she saw… she saw… she saw…”) is purposeful, a triplet that mimics cascading vision. No artifacts in the closure beat; final line earns silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest trope is inverted: guardian enables rather than blocks, and the priceless object is amplified, not seized. Shadow-communication mechanic feels fresh and is set up early through environmental behavior. Accumulation of sonic imagery reframes the cave as conscious without anthropomorphic speech. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric resolution—but coherence stays high.</comment>
