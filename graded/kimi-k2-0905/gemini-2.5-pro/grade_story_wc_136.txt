<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s mentor-loss motive is visceral, his “trembling certainty” embodied in brass hand and careful footfalls. The punch-as-fare device externalizes an internal contradiction: seeking answers while preparing to surrender agency. His micro-choices (punching air, stepping into black) earn the guardian transformation. Minor slip: “analytically artistic” is asserted twice rather than shown through idiosyncratic perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each crack-vector → ticket punch → starlit vault tightens options toward the keeper cost. Orientation anchored by 78 words; seamless single-scene arc; punch-hole blackout is a crisp Decisive Change. Closure lands with conceptual price—mentor’s self-erasure becomes Elias’s future—visible in “accept a fare, a responsibility.” One causality micro-gap: punch’s rule-set never foreshadows energy-for-truth exchange, but pattern coherence survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Asphalt arrows, sodium glow, and brass chill are selective, POV-filtered. Micro-setting (punch, satchel strap) constrains the final act. Seamless dome of alien constellations reconfigures meaning; setting literally is the fortress. Slight over-reliance on visual; a sniff of cold stone or metallic ozone would sharpen the portal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find mentor—tightens when cracks funnel Elias to the brick wall lock; punch-drill is the irreversible trade-off. Cost is conceptual: once inside, he can’t return unchanged; mentor’s constellation confirms the price. Agency drives every beat; no coincidences. Escalation stays causal but could be sharper if earlier cracks hinted at energy tariff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of cartography-as-sacrifice emerges through concrete images: unfinished map, star-schematics, constellation of the old man’s self-immolation. Subtext in “accept a fare” reframes exploration as toll. Avoids explicit moral; resonance lingers in the idea that every mapped truth demands a cartographer’s life. No tidy binary—mentor’s choice is both loss and transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lean, lyric, syntactically varied; “sacred, silent midnight” cadence matches Elias’s ritual precision. Perceptual signature—cracks as language—remains consistent. No filter-verb clutter; punch’s silence is rendered as “no sound, but the air wavered.” Minor echo: “trembling certainty” repeated verbatim; a variant pulse or flutter would maintain freshness under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: longer clauses for city drift, fragments at portal punch. High information density—strap-adjust, map-dare, punch-myth compressed in three sentences. No mixed metaphors; only one paraphrase loop (“trembling certainty” x2). Closure line “mapped his final route and arrived at his new beginning” is tidy but not redundant; momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Phantom ticket punch as veil-perforator is a fresh inflection on portal fantasy; cracks-as-arrows urban geomancy feels specific to this city. Mentor’s self-constellation subverts vanishing-dad trope by making absence active service. Risk-taking structure (single shard → cosmic cathedral) pays off. Slight proximity to “starlit vault” tropes, but cosmic archive of unspoken truths reweights it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setup: crack-reading at start. Development: chooses punch over retreat. Payoff: accepts keeper fate—none of this works without his meticulous mapping drive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Introduced early, used twice (portal, fare acceptance), meaning reweighted from key to contract; story collapses without its brass silence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mystery-unraveling governs every beat—cracks, punch, star-schematics; closure reveals the final mystery is the cost of knowing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Trait enables crack-translation and punch-innovation; cost is the artistic side that must surrender to eternal guardianship—visible in the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dare drives entire plot; refusal option never considered, but its terms shift from location hunt to self-sacrifice, reconfiguring stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signal early, mechanics legible, shapes every block walked; without arrow-cracks no path to wall or portal exists—indispensable navigation engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is the fortress; star-patterns supply truths that force keeper choice; vault’s glow is the resource Elias must now maintain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Midnight divide is lyrical frame rather than ticking clock; sets mood but never narrows options—ornamental more than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Motive propels every step; confronted by mentor’s constellation, motive flips from discovery to inheritance—dramatized, not told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Tone modulates from trembling anticipation to calm acceptance; final poise crystallizes the tremble into purpose—charges closure image effectively.</comment>
