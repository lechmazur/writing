<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Anya’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—somatic flash, soil grit, locked jaw—while contradictory impulses (freeze vs. tend the pine) coexist in the same beat. The photograph’s cloth-soft edge and her thumb-nail earth anchor PTSD without diagnostic jargon. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: she renounces flight, pays the cost of staying present, and the earned stasis lands cleanly. Voice remains singular; no secondary character pressure required.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: drone-shadow pattern intensifies, then recedes, reweighting the stake from ambient threat to embodied endurance. Closure is a Charged Poise—watering can lifted, cost felt in the ache of joints—no path cleared, but stance crystallized. One shard only; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3. No causal missteps; ellipsis of the actual attack is legitimated by somatic echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass-paneled arboretum, cliff surf hum, and resin scent are filtered through Anya’s horticultural eye; every detail either narrows choice (muted roar permits her vigilance) or mirrors internal pressure (shadow slides across the living fossil). The watering can and pocketed photograph function as micro-settings that constrain final action. Spatial choreography holds: she never drifts from the pine’s pot. Environment and tool jointly charge the closing image—no decorative backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—staying present versus being re-annihilated—tightens when the drone-shadow revises the sky from sanctuary to threat. Escalation is textural: sound deepens, light slides, body locks; no external antagonist needed. Agency is renunciation: she does not flee; the cost is the resurgence of flashback ice and joint ache. One meaningful intensification suffices; coincidence (toy plane) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the juxtaposition of ancient pine survival and her own fragile endurance; no authorial statement required. Subtext lives in gesture—fingertip on frond equals self-soothing touch. Final image (tiny pine watered) reweights “optimism in realism” without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: sky still menaces, hope still enacted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is botanist-intimate: “slow, deliberate language of growth,” “leaf uncurl,” resin scent. Syntax compresses under stress—“Her breath hitched. Through somatic markers her body knew first”—then lengthens again as calm returns. No dialogue, so voice purity is total. Rhythm modulates with nervous system: scream-whine → muffled surf → deliberate pour.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“ice bloomed in her stomach”—no mixed metaphors. High information density: “automated beam of the new lighthouse” locates era and isolation in five words. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Wollemi pine as PTSD tether is fresh; drone-shadow triggering freeze links ecological rarity with psychic fragility. Conceptual risk—no overt plot, only internal endurance—pays off via Charged Poise. Specificity of horticultural care anchors universality. No stock tropes; “pearl of stillness” is retooled as somatic technique rather than self-help slogan.</comment>
