<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete—trailing fingers in bruise-colored water, feeling cold seep into knuckles—embodied and particular. The trembling hands on the journal, the sudden quiet that lifts his gaze: micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values (truth > safety) with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (shame vs devotion) stay simultaneous, not summarized. Final renunciation of public vindication for private faith is earned by prior tactile listening to the hull and mud.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore—radio silence → dawn → end of window → salvage completed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s “inherent truth without sun” reweights the family lie from betrayal to sacrifice, cost felt in the vast yet serene upheaval. No teleport of props or knowledge; grandfather’s journal was the logical payload of a lockbox hidden where flawed plans were dumped. Orientation anchored by word 30; no ambiguity at closure.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Twilight barge canal is not scenery but a force: thick water resists pole and hook, imposes slowness, dictates tactical patience. The corroded lockbox’s drag-through-silt is tactile, lived-in; the crumbling abutment supplies the only purchase point for grappling. Radio static and silver dawn line are time-and-place cues integrated into action. Final image of “thoughtfully clear” dawn light recharges the water’s earlier bruise-color, now morally recalibrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—prove grandfather’s innocence—tightens when elegant vs flawed blueprints are revealed, foreclosing easy revenge. Escalation is one deepening: the salvage haul switches goal from treasure to moral reframe, price paid in physical exhaustion and permanent surrender of public vindication. Agency remains salvage: Kael’s muscle coils, pries lid, accepts disgrace-to-protect truth. Cost is visceral—mud-stink, groaning metal, dawn silence that ends the_radio_window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: lies as load-bearing structures. No character ever utters “sacrifice” or “truth”; the concept is re-priced by the sundial’s dark-readability image. Subtext in the final sentence—“shape of his own foundation”—recasts architecture from public monument to private moral scaffold. Complexity preserved: rival remains nameless, evil unavenged, yet emotional aftereffect is unmistakable serenity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is noir-lyric without purple drift: “color of a day-old bruise,” “surfacing leviathan”—metaphors stay concrete to water and iron. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“He braced his feet, his muscles coiling…”—then exhales into the final serene clause. Perceptual signature consistent: Kael notices cold, weight, rust, silence—tactile empiricist. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within self-taught canal-poet lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold, high density: single sentences perform triple duty—e.g., “Slowly, a small, heavily corroded lockbox broke the water’s surface, shedding mud and dark water like a surfacing leviathan” (setting, object embodiment, metaphor). No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new mechanical or sensory info. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges sundial paradox. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: salvage-as-epistemology, sundial usable in darkness, architecture-as-sheltering-lie. Specific synthesis makes inevitable hindsight: canal silt → hidden lockbox → two blueprints → sacrifice revelation. Risk of quiet ending paid off by conceptual re-pricing rather than revenge set-piece. No derivative echoes; canal noir meets family-ethics ledger.</comment>
