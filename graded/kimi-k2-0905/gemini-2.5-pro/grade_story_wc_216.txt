<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s obsession with “texture of time” is embodied in tactile rituals (holding the shard for hours) and micro-choices (inventing the coded garage-sale board). The final moment of borrowed-time erasure is earned by these cumulative acts, so the renunciation feels credible and costly. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, relying instead on bone-light and sand-slippage metaphors that stay sensory. Flaws (obsession, loneliness) actively complicate the quest instead of serving as decorative back-story.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard-triggered memory floods Kael, re-configuring his stance toward death, and the cost is the irreversible dimming of his own remaining light. Causal chain holds: “garage-sale” lure → willow message → wall-panel resonance → timeless echo. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“emerald silo that hummed”). No teleporting props; the urn fragment states are tracked throughout. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the final cadence shift, satisfying escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The silo’s green lattice becomes a micro-setting that physically channels the memory; its translucent wall-panel is the pivot object. Selective sensory focus (low hum deepening to chord, shard warmth) mirrors Kael’s narrowing attention. World rule—“numbers lost meaning”—is shown via barter poetry, never declared in exposition. Weather is absent, but the thinning bone-light performs equivalent atmospheric pressure. Spatial choreography is clean: base garage-sale → ascent to heart panel → pressed shard → wall resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“feel time’s texture before personal light expires”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the traveler’s message offers the sole path to that sensation. Agency: Kael devises and persists in the coded garage-sale tactic; the resonance event is triggered by his deliberate shard placement, not luck. Cost is the final vanishing of his borrowed-time anxiety, paid by surrender to the urn’s immortal afternoon. One meaningful intensification suffices for this length; escalation is present and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: a container of death becomes the vessel that abolishes death-awareness for the living holder. Subtext operates in the willow-glass message—life/memory encoded in detritus. No final moral states the thesis; instead the glowing walls promise “a library of lost feelings,” inviting reader contemplation. Ambiguity remains—Kael’s future light is still finite—but his stance has been repriced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Narrative distance stays tight third-person, filtering perception through Kael’s bone-light metaphor set. Syntax lengthens for obsession beats (“He would hold it for hours…”) then fragments at trigger (“Kael’s breath caught”). Diction remains within plausible post-Collapse lexicon—no academic register drift. No dialogue; therefore voice distinction bullet waived. Free indirect style cleanly handles internal chord-flood without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “metallic wound spilling secrets” compresses container, injury, and revelation in five words. Rhythm modulates to echo emotional intensity, slowing during shard-meditation, staccato at traveler-message reveal. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical (sand, bone, lattice). Sentence openings vary; no template cadence detected. One paraphrase risk—“a life measured in years he could no longer comprehend” slightly echoes preceding clause—but does not obscure causality or dull closure image, so kept within minor range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-numeric world + garage-sale poetry as semaphore + silo-as-resonator converts familiar post-apocalyptic tropes into lyric memory-machine. Willow shard reprises ancient elegy yet feels specific to this world rule. Premise commits fully—no late tech cheats—and follows emotional implication to timeless poise. Risk (elliptical causality) paid off through taught pattern and coherent closure. Slight proximity to “inverted urn” trope but transformed by ceramic physics and bone-light stakes.</comment>
