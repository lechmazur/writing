<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelan’s interior contradiction—exiled tutor turned cosmic pattern-seeker—remains concrete and embodied; the basalt stone’s dent externalizes his fall and later marks the pivot to acceptance. Micro-choices (letting the stone fall, the tear of awe) show values hierarchy under pressure. The “beauty in the difficult” motive drives every beat and is finally vindicated with visible cost: permanent exile embraced. Missing 9-band because the silence-translation method is told more than dramatized—no tactile struggle or error that would reveal flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the auroral checkmate reweights exile from punishment to privilege, cost etched in the dropped stone and the tear. Causal lens holds throughout—every luminous pulse is earned by Kaelan’s silence-charting labor. Time, place, and stake are anchored within first 120 words; no orientation debt. One minor elasticity: the instant leap from mental map to sky-show could use one intermediary beat to tighten causality, but the gap does not rupture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge, purple sun, tooth-aching magnetism—sensory triangulation is vivid and selective, filtered through a chess-master’s taxonomic eye. The nexus functions as micro-setting: its magnetic pauses literally provide the “squares” Kaelan plays on, constraining his method and final revelation. Weather and geography evolve with the eclipse, mirroring internal shift without symbolic overstatement. Missing 9 only because the stone’s physical texture is under-used mid-story; one more tactile beat would have locked the object-as-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove beauty exists inside exile’s hardship—is declared early and tightened by each silence decoded. Escalation is accumulative: every mapped quiet increases cognitive load and risk of failure, visible in bodily fatigue (“tear traced through dust”). No external antagonist is needed; the nexus itself supplies coherent pressure. Cost is legible—the dropped stone signals permanent abandonment of royal identity—but could be sharper if we sensed an irreversible physiological toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: pattern recognition as existential defiance. Subtext carries in gesture—thumb on groove, tear, release—never in thesis. The eclipsed covenant reframes from mythic blame to natural law, avoiding moral binaries. Final image reweights earlier motifs (stone, checkmate) without sermon; reader left to feel the bittersweet triumph. No thematic echo phrases; resonance lands through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Kaelan’s perceptual bias—chess notation applied to landscapes. Syntax is rhythmic yet precise, mirroring methodical thought; no filter-verb clusters. Diction remains within lexicon of fallen court academic. No dialogue, hence no voice-distinction test. One microscopic slip: “system of perfect, interlocking logic” nudges toward abstraction in a peak beat; a concrete metaphor would preserve immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold. Figurative language is restrained; when it appears (“ghostly ribbons”) it is accurate to physics of aurora. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for contemplation, staccato for mapped silences. Zero paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines frame and resolve with imagetic precision. Minor tense stability perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of grandmaster cognition with planetary magnetic mystery feels non-obvious and wholly specific. Silence-as-notation reframes SETI-like listening into intimate human stakes. Risk is taken with lyric accumulative structure instead of causal duel; payoff succeeds. Could push slightly further into alien sensory vocabulary to escape familiar “aurora” palette, but transformation is evident.</comment>
