<comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid—stone bead in soil → marrow-chime, toxic dew burn—yet his memories remain imported: “he remembered giving her the bead,” not lived on-page. Contradictory impulses (hunger for knowledge vs. dread of poison) are implied but not forced into a single pressured moment; the final stance is acceptance, not choice. The cost is felt (Lyra dissolves), but Elian’s agency is largely receptive; still, within lyric-accumulative design this reads as credible renunciation. Voice-specific perception (“alchemical orchard,” “moon-petal vines”) keeps him individual, not archetype.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sightings + floral toxicity intensifies until knowledge transfer. Closure is Charged Poise: Lyra’s dissolution reconfigures Elian’s vocation with undeniable conceptual cost (“his work… was just beginning”). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established by line 3; no penalty. Causality is thematic rather than plot-logical, appropriate to lyric mode. One tightening: Night Phalaenopsis bloom concentrates stakes; cost legible in Lyra’s vanishing and Elian’s toxic-scarred skin.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Glass greenhouse vs. winter-cracked fields creates immediate inside/outside pressure; toxic dew and century-bloom supply concrete micro-constraints. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and chemo-sensation over visual catalog. Spiral bead functions as portable setting-as-tool, charging final image. Spatial choreography clean: Elian’s hand, potting bench, vanishing hem track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will Elian receive the alchemical legacy without lethal cost? Escalation via intensifying toxicity and lengthening cameos; persistence of poisoned flowers forces him to keep working despite danger. Agency is endurance/attention rather than decisive act—valid under Accumulative lens. Cost visible on skin burns and in Lyra’s dissolution; options reweighted: he inherits knowledge but loses guardian and must shoulder risk alone.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image-chain: venomous nurture, debt as bloom, love as acid—never sermonized. Final image (“stone bead clutched”) non-literally answers how devotion outlives death. Ambiguity maintained: was the toxicity necessary or excessive? Reader left to weigh poison against fruition. No late thematic echo; resonance arises from pearlescent pollen settling “within him.”</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-close distance stable; perceptual signature rich in alchemical diction (“blood-fern,” “weeping soul-blossom”). Rhythm modulates: long hypnotic sentences for greenhouse hush, clipped fragments at climax (“She raised a hand—not in farewell but in release”). No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on narrative texture; no filter-verb clutter. Lyric compression taught early (“faint chime echoed… in the marrow”) and paid off in final pollen cloud.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence potting soil → bead → bone chime does three jobs. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (botanical/alchemical). One mixed image—“veil swirled as if in phantom wind”—minor, doesn’t fog closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies: sibilance mirrors hush, then staccato dissolves. Proofing clean; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Combines ghost-romance and alchemical-botany tropes but particularizes via toxic dew, century-orchid, marrow-chime bead. Debt-as-poisoned-bloom feels fresh; not mere gothic pastiche. Risk taken: passive protagonist, lyric structure—coheres under Accumulative lens. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving specificity. No derivative premise penalty; world logic internally consistent.</comment>
