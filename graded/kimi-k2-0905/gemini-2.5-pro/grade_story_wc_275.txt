<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist stance and plant-empathy are vivid; the knife-touch crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The refusal to wield, enacted in concrete micro-choice (sheathe→box), earns her continuity credo with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Father remains off-page, so relationship crucible not tested; headcount stays within limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the dome’s quiet until the sheathing act ruptures and reweights the meaning of “quiet.” Closure is a Charged Poise—knife boxed, rose burning—cost felt in the foregone violent path. Orientation anchored by word 50; no ambiguity. One tightening suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dome, canvas scrap, and knife function as micro-setting that constrain kneeling, hiding, and moral choice. Silica dunes, glass panes, and rose rows are filtered through Elara’s plant-biased eye, never touristy. Spatial choreography clean; no prop teleport. The boxed blade returns in final image, recharging “quiet” with menace contained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“quiet continuity vs. violent heritage”—is signaled early and tightens once: knife temptation → sheathing forecloses the bounty path. Cost is the retained weapon itself, perpetual threat now domesticated. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory beat adds moral weight until the single turn. No reversal beyond the decisive negation, sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Continuity-through-fragility theme emerges from rose grafting and knife refusal, never sermonized. Final rose “brimming with quiet strength” reweights “tranquil blaze” without moral tag. Subtext in ozone/blood scent and leather grooves carries the ethical tension. No thematic echo in closing paragraph—image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical, distance held tight inside Elara’s perceptions; perceptual signature is plant-empathic, not horticultural cliché. Syntax lengthens then compresses with sunset tension; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice purity uncontested. Knife personification (“legacy of violence waiting”) stays within her lexicon. Rhythm modulates from languid tending to single clipped sheathing—audible payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences multi-task: “sun bled…curved panes” sets scene + stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (dome = etched quiet, rose = secret). Only minor scaffold: “a time of flight and folly” could compress. Final blade-sheath sentence is propulsive, sonic. Clean grammar; pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing plant-empathy with post-collapse pacifism feels新鲜; bounty-hunter’s-daughter trope is inverted by refusal arc. “Inculcating plants with values” could read twee but is grounded in tactile detail. Risk: lyric stasis over causality, but accumulative design justifies it. No close echoes; specificity (silica dunes, ozone scent) keeps it singular.</comment>
