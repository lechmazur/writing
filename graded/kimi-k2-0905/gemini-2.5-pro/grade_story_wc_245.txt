<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s tactile synesthesia is embodied in every beat—pressing bark, tracing fossils, turning the ring—so interiority stays concrete. Grief for Elara is shown through sensory overload, never named, and the final harmony lands as earned stasis: he renounces literal silence, accepting composite grief. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the ring acts as proxy antagonist. Micro-choices (etching C-sharp, turning into emptiness) crystallize his hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each touched object deposits a musical note, density rising until the final chord reweights grief. Causality holds—ring warms, notes layer, emptiness vibrates—so the final harmony is inevitable, not coincidental. Closure is a Charged Poise: the forest’s million frequencies resolve, grief retains shape yet becomes bearable, cost felt in the bone. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“silverleaf frond”) and spatial choreography stays clean; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is filtered through Kaelen’s skin-hearing: “deafening orchestra” becomes a lived constraint, forcing the quest. Micro-setting—the ring, fossil flower, weeping moss—act as tactile waypoints that steer choices. Ironwood trunk and crystalline rivers return in escalating beats, their texture charging the final chord. Weather and geography stay consistent; no exposition dumps, only sensory action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform unbearable grief into bearable shape via sonic cartography. Pressure tightens as each note forecloses alternative paths; failure means eternal dissonance. The final resolving chord is activated by Kaelen’s active turn into “space between things,” paying the cost of perpetual sensitivity. No coincidence; escalation is Accumulative density culminating in pattern break.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from motif: silence ≠ absence but integration—grief not erased but harmonized. Subtext operates in touch-language; no explicit thesis. Final image reconfigures premise: “the quiet blaze of his spirit” is the resonance, not a moral. Ambiguity lingers: harmony is fragile, cost is lifelong sensitivity, yet meaning is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Kaelen’s synesthetic perception; diction stays tactile (“cool whisper,” “vibration thinner than spider silk”). Rhythm accelerates with note-discovery, then widens into chordal cadence at closure. No dialogue, so voice purity is uninterrupted. No head-hop or register drift; compression in peak beats is intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length to mimic sonic waves. Metaphors are consistent—sound as texture, grief as dissonance—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often maps terrain, advances plot, and shades emotion. Final line “quiet blaze” is crisp, non-clichéd, recharges earlier “quiet blaze of concentration.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Blind cartographer who maps via touch-music is fresh; ultrasonic forest as emotional amplitude is a non-obvious synthesis. Grief-resolution through acceptance of perpetual sound turns familiar “seek silence” trope inside-out. Risky second-person fragment “There.” is pattern-taught and pays off. Specificity makes premise inseparable from this story—generic swap would collapse.</comment>
