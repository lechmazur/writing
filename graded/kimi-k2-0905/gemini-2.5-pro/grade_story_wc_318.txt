<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The ghost’s mournfully eager need to re-inject laughter into the house is palpable and gives every spectral tug on the pull-cord its emotional logic; the contradiction between violent mechanical noise and tender lullaby-hum is dramatized in-scene, not summarized. Interiority stays concrete (“He poured his whole being into the third try”), and the single tear–twitch smile shows a credible micro-change with cost for both haunter and haunted. No secondary character presses back hard enough to function as crucible, and the son remains off-stage echo, capping the score just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<comment>The causal chain is lean and legible: silence → memory of yard-care love → three-pull start → hallway roar → recognition → fragile smile; each pull tightens options until the engine’s scream becomes the only speech left to him. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the smile is a lived-after change, the cost is the eternal engine-drone he must now keep feeding. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“three seasons ago”) and spatially tracked from garage to hallway; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip from not dramatizing the son’s beat keeps it just below 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory economy—“plastic housing faded,” “pull cord handle hung like a silent promise”—grounds the tool-as-setting and keeps the tunnel’s acoustic properties causally active: the roar bounces, leaves shred, song warps. Weather and season are externalized through brittle brown leaves tracked indoors, mirroring the family’s emotional drought. Spatial choreography is flawless: garage → hallway → wife steps into wind. The leaf blower’s two-stroke specifications are accurate and materially affect the noise texture that carries the lullaby. Final image—hair strand across face—crystallizes setting, body, and memory in one tactile moment.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break silence, restore laughter—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through three pull-cord attempts that heighten spectral expenditure; each failure costs intangible “being” until the engine ignites, narrowing his agency to that single deafening idiom. The hallway wind that macerates leaves also macerates grief-symbols, a visible price that alters the wife’s stance from fear to recognition. No coincidence resolves the tension; the son’s freeze upstairs and wife’s tear are direct reactions to the ghost’s chosen tactic. Cost is legible on-page: he is now bound to an eternal yard-maintenance purgatory, she to a bittersweet memory-trigger.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: love persists as noise, caretaking outlives breath, memory rides combustion rather than whisper. The folk-song fragment carried inside mechanical scream is the subtextual carrier of intimacy—no moral is extracted, only the re-weighting that a leaf blower can be a lullaby. The final smile reconfigures grief from raw absence to painful continuity; ambiguity stays alive—laughter is not restored, only its possibility replanted. No thematic echo lines or sermonizing; imagery of shredded leaves and off-key wind does the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person ghost POV remains stable, filtered through a perceptual signature attuned to sound, vibration, and yard-care memory—“leaf blower symphony conductor” idiom shapes every metaphor. Syntax stretches into rhythmic crescendo during engine-start beats, then contracts to hair-strand detail at the wife’s epiphany, mirroring the sound wave. No head-hopping; wife’s tear is observed externally, her interior access denied to keep spectral limitations clean. Diction stays inside a working-man’s lexicon (“pull cord,” “two-stroke,” “macerate”) reinforcing credibility.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers action + sound + metaphor (“the engine screamed to life, a deafening, atonal blast that ripped through the home’s stillness”). No filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops; only one participial opener and it tracks logically. Metaphors stay coherent—wind as symphony, roar as speech, shredded leaves as grief—without crowding peak beat. Final line offers a sonic after-image (“the roar of his symphony softened”) that resolves rhythm and theme simultaneously. A lone near-cliché (“single tear”) is saved by its physical wind-caused catalyst.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The ghost-as-yard-guy trope is refreshed by the specific conjunction of two-stroke timbre and half-sung lullaby embedded inside it; the “symphony conductor” conceit is literalized through spatial acoustic direction. Risk is taken—leaf blower as love letter—and it pays off because the mechanics of noise-carrying-memory are worked out in-scene rather than asserted. The premise could not swap tools (vacuum, drill) without breaking the folk-song transmission, giving it irreplaceability. Transformation feels inevitable once the hallway’s echo properties are seeded.</comment>
