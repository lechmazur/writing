<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Celeste’s contradictory impulses—protecting her father while exposing truth—are shown in embodied beats (circling telescope, cool nib against palm); her final choice to confront Davies is motivated and costs her filial silence. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Micro-choices (dialing, holding nib) reveal value hierarchy. Only flaw: the “devotedly observant” trait is asserted more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: each question to Davies is a because/therefore demolition of premise. Closure—Celeste’s father now “among the stars”—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the orbit motif with earned cost. Orientation anchored by word 48; no spatial drift. One meaningful tightening: the phone call itself narrows options to public rebuttal. Minor slip: journalist’s whispered “His brother…” feels slightly convenient as first crack.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s rotating dome and star-dusted glass walls constrain Celeste’s solitude and supply the final image; the mahogany desk anchors prop handling. Sensory selectivity favors sound (hum, click dead) and tactile coolness of nib. Spatial choreography clean: she moves from desk to curved wall without teleport. Environment mirrors internal orbit but avoids overt symbolism. Slight overreliance on visual; scent of rain is the only non-visual cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—father’s posthumous reputation—signaled in opening paragraph. Escalation is intellectual: each logical contradiction raises the cost of silence for both Celeste and Davies. Protagonist agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves. Felt price: her inheritance already sold, filial loyalty publicly sacrificed. Could use one more visceral consequence (e.g., Davies threatening print deadline) to push tension past intellectual plane.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—orbits of regret vs. hidden sacrifice—emerges through star-path and nib images rather than assertion. Subtext lives in Celeste’s calm playfulness masking grief. Final image reweights “orbit” from trap to transcendence without moralizing. Avoids tidy binary: father is neither pure villain nor martyr, but a man who chose a prison. Minor abstraction in “kingdom of ink and pulp” phrase, but context justifies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Celeste’s perceptual filter: “magnate, the titan” is her internal shorthand, not encyclopedic. Syntax mirrors her methodical mind—parallel “if…then” clauses during phone duel. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under stress. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Davies stammers, she speaks in cool logical cadences. Only micro-drift: “veined like old blood” may exceed her likely simile bank, but emotional charge forgives.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences advance plot, character, and metaphor (“rosewood nib…old blood”). Rhythm accelerates during phone duel via short, punchy questions. Zero synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors (satellites of sorrow, star-dusted velvet) stay coherent and scene-anchored. Opening and final lines echo orbital motion, creating lyrical bookend. One near-purple line—“kingdom of ink and pulp”—but it pays off thematically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle: white-collar scandal reframed as daughter’s logical proof rather than expose. Nib-as-evidence and observatory-as-orbit-control room are specific inflections, not generic thriller props. Orbit motif synthesizes grief, astronomy, and journalistic spin into one coherent metaphor. Risk taken in static, intellectual climax rather than physical act; coherence justifies choice. Familiar “fallen magnate” premise is reanimated through daughter’s inverse detective work.</comment>
