<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to “unbind” sound yet terrified of rupturing the hush—drives every micro-choice; her arms aching and heart “full, not with noise, but with completion” embodies cost without therapy-speak. The inherited bowl and ship-mast violin act as embodied heirlooms that tighten stakes; her final renunciation (playing into absorption rather than breaking silence) is credibly earned. Only the grandfather memory tilts toward label-speak (“the words…echoed in the hollow of her chest”), keeping this just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the droplet’s “magnificent” ping re-prices the entire premise—silence is no longer lack but vessel. Causal chain holds: because she absorbs silence, therefore she can gift it voice; the persistent constraint (hush must not shatter) shapes every tactic. Accumulated texture escalates through harmonic shimmers in dome and hull until the final image crystallizes options with unmistakable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-instrument and shipwreck rib-cage literally constrain acoustics and enable the harmonic duet; the cracked pane that feeds the bowl is the micro-setting that charges the final image. Rust-colored pear skeletons, saline air, and weeping glass are filtered through Elara’s hyper-aural priorities, never tourist-catalogued. Spatial choreography stays clean: bowl on bench → beneath pane → droplet landing; distances track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find beauty in the unfinished song”—tightens when each note risks violating the hush; escalation is the increasing harmonic response from dome and hull that reweights silence from void to resonant partner. Visible price: muscle ache, the absorbed note never returning, the droplet as single earned payoff. No false reversals; coincidence merely complicates absorption physics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: beauty is not restoration of lost noise but collaborative completion with ruin. The droplet re-weights the apple-tree ghost and ship-mast violin into a single new instrument. No moralizing; the silence-as-voice paradox is left charged and ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: auditory synesthesia (“horsehair tasting the saline air”), compressed lyric cadence that mimics held breath, and micro-shifts in psychic distance mirroring harmonic waves. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elara’s sensorium. Final compression—“a single, perfect drop”—is rhythmic payoff taught from first long note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: “rust-colored skeletons of pear trees” packs sight, mortality, and orchard history in five words. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Mixed-metaphor risk (“searching vine” arpeggio) is brief and absorbed by overall lyric consistency; no loops or scaffold. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “echo-harbor violinist” concept fuses post-climate elegy with acoustic necromancy; shipwrecks as resonant chamber is fresh, inevitable in hindsight. Risky refusal to break silence pays off thematically and sensorially. Specificity of salvaged mast violin and condensation bowl prevents generic eco-fable.</comment>
