<comment>Lena’s grief is rendered through embodied tremor and the tactile curl; Elias’s “quiet hum” and unhurried blanket-adjustment show his mellow therapist identity without label-speak. The final smile is credible because the music and eclipse ritual have visibly re-weighted the curl from despair to tender relic. Interior contradiction is present but soft: Elias’s “cautious exuberance” is named once, not dramatized in action. Still, micro-choice hierarchy is clear—placing the curl to earth is the costly beat that forecloses endless mourning.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s hand closes tenderly, not desperately, re-pricing sixty years of sorrow into wonder; cost is the visible tear-streak under the corona. Causal chain holds: kalimba loop → eclipse → earth-touch → melody shift → new grip. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One soft spot: the “beneath the hush of dreaming roots” phrase is abstract and late, but it does not break lens (Accumulative/Textural) because the final image reweights the stake.</comment>

<comment>Sage Ridge is sketched with economy—dust, sagebrush, blanket, stones—yet each detail is re-used: dust returns on the curl, stones “coaxed” by sound, blanket becomes altar. Micro-setting (the curl as landscape-in-miniature) constrains the final choice. Spatial tracking is flawless; no impossible body positions. Sensory hierarchy respects crisis: narrowed sight to the “sharp-edged” sun, widened to corona brilliance at release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Lena re-frame the curl or stay frozen—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: eclipse totality forces the hand-to-earth beat; no outside rescue. Agency is Lena’s micro-choice to release the desperate grip; price is the sob and later the shaky smile. Escalation is accumulative: music density increases, sky darkens, corona ignites new meaning. Cost is legible in the changed grip and raspy admission, “It was so beautiful.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: wonder is not the opposite of grief but its next skin, shown when the eclipse light re-prices the curl. Subtext lives in gesture—earth under palm replaces words. Final image returns to light, not therapy-talk, avoiding thematic echo penalty. Ambiguity is preserved: lifelong wonder is promised, not guaranteed, yet the stakes have undeniably shifted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias’s sensorium; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: “slow crawl of afternoon shadows” mirrors his unhurried tempo; kalimba tines “coax quiet from stones” is therapist-apt. Syntax breathes with elongated commas under eclipse chill, then tightens at diamond flash. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is pure narrative texture—controlled, consistent, without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: looping pre-eclipse sentences elongate, then fragment at totality (“A strange, ethereal twilight…”). Information density is high—each sentence advances image or emotional charge. No mixed metaphors; corona-as-hope is single, sustained vehicle. Minor scaffold: “the life, still humming, still here” is partial paraphrase, but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, and is spoken to Lena, so momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Eclipse-as-healing-catalyst could feel contrived, yet the story roots it in therapist’s deliberate timing and kalimba acoustics, giving the magic an “ordinary” procedural frame. Baby curl relic is familiar, but its re-weighting through earth-touch feels specific to this ridge, this music. Risk is moderate—eclipse trope plus grief ritual—but execution avoids sentimental shortcut. Fresh inflection: therapist uses environmental phenomena as adaptive instrument, not cliché angel-device.</comment>
