<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara’s need to “interrogate the source” crystalizes late but is dramatized in the rooftop demand; her prior micro-choices—knocking, accepting cold teacups, pressing the seal into soil—show incremental commitment with visible cost. Elias’s dual nature remains credible because every beat of instruction is tied to the building’s sensory detail; when the lock/key metaphor lands, it reconfigures their relationship without violating earlier behavior. Interiority stays concrete (“curiosity began to curdle into a need”) and avoids label-speak, though the pivot from passive pupil to active challenger could be seeded one beat earlier for full 9-band push.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the spiral impression in the planter reweights every prior lesson and exposes the “agreed upon lies” as the bridge it always was. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each sensory detail of groaning pipes and sun-bleached floorboards layers until the rooftop night sky reframes them as falling stories. Causality is clean: the borrowed-sugar invitation → weekly tea → seal gift → need for truth → rooftop interrogation → identity reveal; no beat resets or off-stage shortcuts. The final image carries undeniable conceptual cost: Clara accepts custodianship of an archive that will outlive her, a stasis that forecloses ordinary human connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is the co-protagonist: drafts under doors, chipped plaster as argument, sun-bleach as cat testimony—each detail is filtered through Clara’s architectural POV and later revealed as Elias’s literal body. The rooftop garden during the Perseids supplies the only open sky in the piece, letting the cosmic scale mirror the building’s memory scale; the seal pressed into the planter’s soil gives a micro-setting object that physically anchors the closure. Spatial choreography is flawless (7B door crack, hallway palm-press, rooftop ivy pot) with no white-room gaps. For 9+, the environment could have constrained a tactical choice on the roof (e.g., trellis blocking escape), but it already charges the final image enough to land near ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“becoming fluent in building language”—tightens when the seal amplifies whispers from ambience to command, forcing Clara from listening to ownership. The meaningful deepening occurs on the roof: knowledge that Elias = building collapses her student role and demands librarian commitment; options narrow from “learn” to “archive forever.” Cost is legible: she buries the seal, symbolically burying her freedom to leave. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; one additional mid-story obstacle (a tenant threatening to sell the building, say) would have pushed this into 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of intimacy with the inanimate past: every affectionate lie (he’s “just a man”) is revealed as the necessary fiction to endure the enormity of eternal memory. The spiral seal evolves from gift to key to buried contract, reweighting affection into duty without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence—cold teacups, never-leaving apartment—long before explicit reveal. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: a fossil galaxy pressed into soil = one life orbiting an immense archive, the cost felt in the act of burial rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Clara’s perceptual grammar: sentences curl like plaster, verbs echo architectural decay (“wreathed,” “settling,” “whisper”). No head-hop; Elias’s interior is accessed only through Clara’s sensory inference until he speaks from the air, a reveal that fits the building-voice premise. Psychic distance compresses under pressure—“she had to interrogate the source” is the closest we get to her assertive interior. The lyric pattern of building-as-body is taught early and paid off in the final aerial-shift metaphor of falling stars as stories, keeping voice coherent and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with selective sensory detail; no filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent (draft as arrival/departure narrative) and avoid purple stretch. One mixed image—“silhouette stitched from twilight”—is borderline but justified by the later reveal that Elias is literally immaterial. Clause variation is excellent; paragraph cut test passes—removing any paragraph would delete either causality or texture. Minor scaffolding: “agreed upon lies” phrase repeats three times; trimming one instance would polish but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise fuses ghost-story with architectural history in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh: the architect who loved his building into sentience is now its operating system, teaching fluency through synesthetic lessons. Specificity—peeling wallpaper pulse, sun-bleach as cat biography—makes the trope un-swappable. The spiral seal repurposes the conventional crest into a galaxy/memory hybrid, transforming antiquarian prop into cosmological key. Risky rooftop cosmic scale pays off by mirroring micro-life spans against geological memory, achieving conceptual repricing without gimmick.</comment>
