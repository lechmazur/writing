<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s “orderly calm” versus love of anarchy is shown only in summary; no embodied contradiction plays out in-scene. The final gesture—holding the stone chip—offers a charged poise, but the cost (his world still slides toward gentrification) is acknowledged more than felt. Interiority stays competent yet generic; no moment forces him into visibly painful trade-off. Earned stasis is credible, but emotional specificity is mid-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: the inspector leaves with contradictions, Kael keeps the stone, the Revel’s hidden order is now legible. Causal chain—graffiti plan → visible efficiency → inspector’s confusion—holds cleanly. Time/place anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. The “because/therefore” lens dominates; one meaningful tightening suffices. Cost is conceptual (Revel must keep living its double life) and visible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Perpetual carnival-flotilla is sketched with swift, multi-sense strokes (calliope, fry-oil, lapping water). Details are filtered through Kael’s path-finding POV; spatial choreography stays clean. Setting constrains tactics—graffiti skin is the only “ledger” possible. The stone chip functions as micro-setting object that charges the final beat. Specificity is high enough for 8.0; could reach 8.5 if environment altered a final micro-choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve Revel’s autonomy—signalled in paragraph 3. Escalation: impending privatization → graffiti counter-order → inspector’s disorientation; each step narrows options and raises visibility risk. Agency is cerebral (designing the graffiti code) yet effective; cost is the permanent need for secrecy. One decisive tightening at the inspector walk-through satisfies length-appropriate pressure. No causal or lens break.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—coded resistance within apparent chaos—emerges through action, never sermon. Graffiti shifts from decoration to covert infrastructure, reweighting “messy freedom” as strategic competence. Final image of Kael clutching stone while staring at dark water offers quiet conceptual repricing: survival now equals perpetual double life. Ambiguity stays productive; no moral spoon-feeding.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Kael; perceptual signature (“thrummed through worn soles”) is vivid yet consistent. Diction stays within carnival argot; no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates: long sensory sentences for crowd scenes, clipped clauses when inspector appears. No head-hopping; one POV throughout. Could edge higher with more idiosyncratic syntax under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences pull double duty (scene-setting + character state). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor scaffolding: “chaotic symphony” and “ceaseless lapping” are familiar phrases but functional. High information density; paragraph cut test passes. Artifacts do not touch closure; momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival-as-city and graffiti-as-ledger feel fresh yet inevitable. Dual-order protagonist who weaponizes art to fake disorder is specific, not stock. Inspector’s confusion reverses expected slum narrative without twist gimmickry. Concept commits fully; no retreat into safe generality. Risk feels integrated, not ornamental.</comment>
