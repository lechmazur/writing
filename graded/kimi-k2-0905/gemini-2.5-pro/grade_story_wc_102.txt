<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative but drifts into lyrical self-diagnosis (“the ache in her chest eased…”) rather than dramatized contradiction; the breathing method is shown twice yet never truly complicates her stance under pressure, so the “healing” feels announced, not earned. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “sparks” image reweights the premise that love is never unused. Causality is soft—inhale/exhale pattern is poetic but not a true constraint; the tear’s luminescence is a late rule tweak. Orientation is clear by 90 words; one transition inside the single scene is fluid. Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct and jasmine are economically sketched; the camera-obscura box functions as micro-setting that constrains her posture and attention. Spatial choreography is clean—no drift in prop or body position. Final image of sparks drifting from the bloom is charged, satisfying the 9+ gate, but the bridge stones remain generic; more tactile navigation would lift higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—locate the fate of unused love—signaled early. Escalation is textural: breath cycle sharpens/dissolves the image, a gentle deepening rather than option-narrowing. No price is visibly paid (no failed attempt, no forfeiture); cost is purely contemplative. Agency is observational; the “healing” is realization, not decision, limiting band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love transmutes into worldly beauty rather than being stored. Subtext is carried in the inversion of the camera image and the dissolving focus, avoiding overt thesis. Final sentence is borderline thematic echo but saved by concrete image (“light for other things to grow by”). Resists moralizing, invites contemplation; ambiguity is purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent with an artist-viewpoint: “pilgrim of sparks,” “luminous ghost of reality.” Perceptual signature is strong—notice of light, dew, vein-like petal rivers. No dialogue, so naturalism not tested. Filter verbs (“she began to breathe”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Sentence variety and cadence mirror breath cycle without mechanical repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten: three liquid-light metaphors in two sentences create minor density drag. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Opening and closing lines anchor and resonate. One homophone-risky phrase (“read” for “red” not present); copy is clean. Peak beat (spark epiphany) avoids figurative muddle, earns its metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Camera-obscura + kwan-yin tear + breath ritual is a fresh synthesis; spiritual tech trope is individualized through handmade mahogany box and milky quartz. Concept of “unused love” repurposed as ambient light is non-obvious. Risk is moderate—lyric accretive structure could have collapsed into abstraction but stays legible. Not transformative enough for top band yet distinctly voiced.</comment>
