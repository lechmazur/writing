<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is rich and character-specific—his “cheerful frustration” and quiet theater of memory reveal a coherent, obsessive psyche. The embodied emotion is present yet occasionally drifts toward lyric summary (“gloomy cheerfulness”) rather than visceral contradiction. Micro-choices under pressure (tuning, bowing, seashell placement) align with motives. Earned renunciation at the end is visible, but the cost feels more conceptual than bodily, keeping him just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each bow stroke tightens the search for a precise frequency that literally points to the scarred floorboard. Orientation is clean—observatory, night, workbench—within 120 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty patch of floor reweights the entire quest, leaving Elias with a lifelong, solitary task. The cost is legible but lightly felt—more wonder than wound—so stops at 8.7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory-as-tomb is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered: dust motes, wind-howling counter-melody, grime-caked dome slit. The half-built cello and silver-painted shell function as micro-settings that constrain every tactical move. Spatial choreography is flawless—bow, shell, floorboard triangulation tracked without drift. The empty floorboard at the end recharges the setting rather than the sky, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode Thorne’s riddle—tightens through each failed hum until the tone locks in, foreclosing further shortcuts. Pressure is causal and accumulative: every micro-adjustment of bow tension narrows the next option. The visible price is the observatory’s ozone-thick air and Elias’s trembling arm, but the cost is more metaphysical than material. Sufficient tightening for this length, though not searingly painful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge is carved into terrestrial scars, not star charts. The shell’s silver lines and the cello’s raw wood reweight from artistic curiosities to cosmic detectors without any thematic exposition. Final image—Elias caressing the shell—offers a quiet, non-literal answer: the universe’s typos are the map. Avoids sermon; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-loyal: “monotone prayer to physics,” “dust motes dancing in slanted moonlight.” Syntax mirrors Elias’s obsessive precision—long, sonorous clauses that tighten into shorter bursts at the reveal. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent. Minor over-poetic residue (“gloomy cheerfulness”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned—no metaphor pile-ups at peak. Rhythm modulates with bow-stroke tension, accelerating then dropping into absolute silence. One paraphrase loop (“resonant hum” echoed twice in adjacent clauses) is minor. Clean grammar, no scaffold, strong paragraph cuts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of amateur lutherie, seashell cartography, and cosmic typo-hunting feels freshly synthesized. The premise turns the banal floorboard into the climactic coordinate—an inversion that is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with a nearly static, single-scene arc that relies on sonic epiphany; coherence holds. Specificity of silver-lacquered shell ridges and half-varnished spruce keeps it from reading as gimmick.</comment>
