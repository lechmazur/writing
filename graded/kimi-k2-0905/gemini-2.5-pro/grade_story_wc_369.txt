<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Aris’s quiet obsession with tree-memory is palpable and idiosyncratic; his micro-choices—polishing, angling the sextant, tweezering the shard—embody the interior contradiction between caretaker and voyeur. The ledger-scratching beat crystallizes a hierarchy of values: archiving grief outweighs personal comfort. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate stays closed, but the renunciation (accepting the shard’s warmth as enough) carries a felt, scaled cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is slender but intact: shard-fall → analysis → moon-healing → mosaic placement, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard’s acceptance reframes Aris’s lifelong quest as endless, now visibly priced by the mosaic’s expanding spiral. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; moonlight’s pattern-break reweights the stake without contradiction. Cost is present—the shard’s warmth replacing sorrow—but lightly felt; hence no 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tower, storm, and broken sextant constrain every tactical move: rain drives him inside, cracked lens enables dream-mapping, moonlit aperture heals the shard. The sextant’s brass spiderweb is the micro-setting that literally refracts choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or teleports. Only the forest’s off-stage existence prevents the 9+ gate—environment does not charge the final image, it merely frames it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—witnessing arboreal grief—tightens when the shard’s sorrow-meter spikes to an unprecedented level, foreclosing the option to stop. The moonlight reversal softens rather than escalates, but the softening itself is the costly trade-off: he must accept partial knowledge forever. Under Accumulative lens, density peaks at that spike; no further reversal required. Cost is visible—he slots the shard into an ever-growing, unfinishable mosaic—yet the price feels conceptual more than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: archiving sorrow is a living, additive duty rather than a cure. The final pearlescent click reframes prior shards as collective memory rather than tragedy, a Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No character articulates a thesis; silence, glow, and mosaic do the work. The emotional aftereffect—solemn awe—lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance, diction precise yet modest (“basso complaint,” “dizzying fall”). Filter verbs are minimal; perception is filtered through Aris’s professional solitude. Rhythm accelerates only during dream-map projection, mirroring his frantic pencil. Voice never breaks POV modesty; no 9+ only because syntax stays safe—no signature fragmentation or risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Metaphors (“grief like pollen,” “stone throat”) are coherent and sparse. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by concrete image. A single hairline slip—“internal misery” verges on label-speak—keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The quantified-sorrow / tree-memory synthesis feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; no template story replicates this exact lattice. Risk—using a broken sextant as emotional spectrometer—pays off by charging the closure. Specificity of craft (copper-wire sorrow-meter, slate projection) resists swapping. Transformation is complete: remove any shard of the concept and the whole mosaic collapses.</comment>
