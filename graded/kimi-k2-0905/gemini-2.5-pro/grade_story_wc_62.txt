<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s haunted diligence and tactile obsession feel lived-in; the embodied chiseling, storm-lit greenhouse vigil, and final quiet renunciation all spring from a single, contradiction-laden impulse—finish grandmother’s slate to learn how communal sorrow “connects.” Interiority stays concrete (cool ribbon under fingertips, thunder inside ribs) and avoids label-speak. The cost—trading literal grave-name commerce for an abstract, unsellable web—hurts on the page. Only the grandmother’s “spectral mentorship” drifts toward convenience, never fully dramatized as an active pressure voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each night’s retracing layers density until the storm-panel ruptures into the web-image; closure is a Charged Poise where the slate’s unnamed lacework reconfigures Elias’s vocation. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The single causal micro-turn is the storm-night breakthrough—enough at this length. Cost is felt in the unsold, unnameable stone left among “living, growing things.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, damp-earth rot, and monarch flight paths are filtered through Elias’s stone-carver eye (texture first, color second). The bench, slate, and ribbon function as micro-setting that literally supports every beat; their spatial relations stay coherent. Weather moves from orange-winged calm to pane-rattling storm, tightening the final image of a web that must “endure” like the glass. No credibility stumbles; greenhouse botany and carving tools read accurate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode grief’s shape—tightens when each ribbon story and slate line forecloses easier marketable inscriptions. The storm acts as situational pressure, not coincidence, forcing the final chisel stroke. One visible cost: Elias abandons a salable product for an abstract sculpture no mourner will buy. No redundant reversals; one meaningful escalation suffices at 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern, not sermon: grief as living network (orchid veins, ribbon, butterfly trajectories) rather than monument. The refrain “The journey is the only home” re-weights from personal nostalgia to communal endurance without moralizing. Final image of the web-stone left “among the living, growing things” offers resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo in closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stone-carver-close: syntax favors chisel-taps, tactile verbs, muted palette. No head-hop; grandmother’s voice is inference only. Free-indirect bursts (“the thundering in his soul”) modulate distance at climax. Dialogue absent; prose rhythm mirrors patient, iterative carving without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Compression avoids loops; every sentence adds chisel-sound, texture, or pattern. Mixed metaphors (“orange wings like ember… skeletal fingers”) stay internally coherent. No filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph lands with crystalline sparseness after lush storm passage—cadence shift supports closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing grave-carver craft with butterfly migration as grief-map feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk lies in lyric abstraction; specificity of tools, slate dust, and greenhouse decay anchors it. No trope recycling; “network” thesis grows from lived gesture, not concept. Transformation test passes—this exact vocation and season are inseparable from the arc.</comment>
