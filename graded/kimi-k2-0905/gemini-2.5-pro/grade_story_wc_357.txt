<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—save the silver-leaf orchard—drives every beat; her micro-choice to ride the inverted river up the arch reveals grit and skill without exposition. Interiority stays sensorial (“hum in teeth and bones”) rather than diagnostic. The final gesture—shearing the shard—carries visible cost as gravity slams back and droplets fall: earned stasis accomplished.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard harvest crystallizes new options for the dying orchard while time/physics exact an immediate price (planet reclaims gravity, river collapses). Causal lens holds throughout—each beat banks on because/therefore: arrow tip hum → follow river → crystal seared away → fall back. No teleporting props; orientation anchored by “ochre soil” inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is never backdrop: inverted river functions as reversible road, floating geode as vault of memories, droplets as ticking clock. Skiff and arrow tip act as micro-setting that constrain maneuvering and sampling. Sensory hierarchy obeys pilot’s priorities—engine note, instrument vibration, canopy sight-lines—never tourist catalogue. Final image of glowing shard inside insect-chirp quiet re-weights whole journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save orchard—tightens when blight is framed as planetary amnesia; one-hour gravity inversion supplies live countdown. Mid-story deepening occurs as she enters the geode: knowledge narrows to “memory of strength,” option space collapses to steal or fail. Cost is dramatized as droplets begin falling—visible, ticking price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as planetary remembrance vs. human intervention; no character lectures us. Arrow halves (tip/shaft) silently argue that discovery is completion, not conquest—final shard theft leaves arrow mute, resonance achieved. Image of seed pod explosively greening inside crystal reweights earlier blight without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will shard restore balance or re-trigger colonial extraction?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains disciplined pilot focus; perceptual signature favors motion, vibration, spatial orientation over visual lushness, consistent with orchard-flight profession. Syntax flexes with pressure—short percussive clauses during skiff buck, elongates in still cavern. No head-hops; filter verbs vanish when stakes peak. Distinct diction (“anechoic heart”) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry dual duty (e.g., “world turned upside down with a grace that defied its own violence” conveys physics miracle and emotional awe). No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during exit race, mirrors falling droplets. A single instance of slightly ornate “gossamer-fruit” is justified by character occupation; does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Inversion-gravity orchard is fresh, but true ingenuity lies in treating “echo” as accumulated biomass memory stored in crystal—science-fantasy logic that feels inevitable after arrow set-up. Risk of lyric cavern scene pays off via charged poise ending rather than convenient tech fix. Specificity of inverted river as navigable road transforms familiar “floating rocks” trope. Final image reframes settler arrow from weapon to bookmark.</comment>
