<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with scar-stories is vivid, embodied in the ritual of coffee-ring augury; the moment he touches the ivy’s vegetal memory his own wound re-opens on the page. Internal contradiction is alive: he wants closure yet compulsively re-cuts. The final renunciation—“not meant to close… but to carry”—is earned by the tunnel-vision scene that forces the cost on him and the plant. Only micro-slip: “quiet, lonely archivist” verges on diagnostic label, blunting full 9-band edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (anesthesia hush, ivy pulse, coffee rings, hourglass weight) intensifies density until the protagonist’s stance crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the act of “pulling back” from the tunnel reweights the premise—archivist, not healer—at visible cost (“raw, vibrating agony”). Causality holds: because the miracle preserved the break, therefore he must carry it. Pattern taught early (returning geography) and paid off in final image of frosted glass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower room, ivy vine, coffee-stained map and clouded hourglass form a micro-setting that directly constrains his ritual and final realization. Dawn light turns “sterile,” reframing earlier meteor hush into something colder—an environmental mirror of his shift. Spatial choreography is tight: cup placed on map, tunneling body bent over table, ivy’s tremor legible. One notch down from 9+ only because weather itself doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can scar-reading deliver peace?—tightens when the miracle instead gifts vegetal telepathy, complicating his method. The tunnel action forces a trade-off: deeper knowledge = re-opened wound, foreclosing the option of erasure. Cost is palpable in ivy’s “panic” and his own “raw, vibrating agony.” Slight reserve: escalation is single-turn; no secondary external pressure beyond self-surgery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the urge to archive pain versus the impossibility of healing it. Ivy’s vegetal memory and the hourglass’s opaque sand embody time that can be felt, not fixed. Final image reweights obsession into vocation without moralizing. Resonance lingers—“quiet, lonely archivist” is a life sentence, not a noble calling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains razor-close psychic distance; perceptions are filtered through a man who notices “geography of scars” and “meteor hush.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with tunnel intensity; diction stays within a self-taught philologist’s lexicon. No head-hop; ivy’s pulse is experienced as alien intrusion, not omniscient exposition. Rhythm control peaks in the fragmentation sentence—“a violent tearing… preservation of the break”—mirrors rupture on the line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory, emotional, or symbolic information. No filler loops or scaffold; mixed metaphors kept coherent (“archipelago on the paper sea”). Only minor register lift—“codified,”“conceptual repricing”—slightly above POV norm, but justified by his clinical obsession. Final line lands with imagistic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scar-reading meets vegetal telepathy, collapsing forensic empathy onto botanical memory. Coffee-ring cartography as divination tool is specific and unforgettable. Hourglass as opaque weight rather than visible sand reframes time-as-burden. Conceptual integrity holds—no retreat into generic trauma plot. Risky lyric compression paid off in charged closure.</comment>
