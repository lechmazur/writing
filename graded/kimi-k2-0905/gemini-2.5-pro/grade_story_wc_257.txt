<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—grief-numb craftsman vs. sudden, urgent mentor—is dramatized through origami micro-choices that visibly cost him the last relic of his dead wife. The woman’s arc is shown only through mirrored posture and one whisper, yet that single line (“My brother…”) crystallizes her shift from hollowed to re-occupied; both changes are legible and paid for by the stencil’s surrender. No stock therapy-speak; body cues (“shoulders curved inward”) are specific and tied to telescope navigation. Flaw: we never learn her name or one internal contradiction, so the relationship crucible is only half-forged—keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment> Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the projected twin constellations re-weight the tattoo stencil from grief-icon to shared cosmos, and the cost is the irreversible gifting of the last physical trace of Anya. Drive lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural—each origami adds density until the final cadence shift on the dais. Orientation (who/where/when) is nailed inside 60 words; no ambiguity at endpoint. Persistent constraint—the observatory’s “curtains of intention” only part for earnest hope—shapes every tactical fold and telescope walk; the final image is felt, not explained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment> The observatory’s layered curtains and polished obsidian benches are tactile, smell-less, gravity-bound; the vellum stencil’s snip is audible, its lotus fold resilient—tools that constrain Elias’s choices and charge the final beam. Body-as-micro-setting rules: the woman’s inward-curve posture dictates sight-lines and telescope selection. No filler astronomy dumps; star names enter only via coordinates she must act on. One minus: we get no shift in temperature or echo under the dome—slight sensory gap keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment> Dominant stake—“can he re-purpose his grief-art to resurrect another?”—is signaled in paragraph one and sharpened each time he sacrifices another scrap of the stencil. Escalation accrues by textured density: crane → fox → star → lotus, each fold foreclosing his retreat to private mourning. The woman’s first voluntary step onto the dais is the meaningful tightening that flips spectator to participant. Cost is always visible: the stencil literally shrinks until it is the projector’s mask—no abstract stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment> Theme emerges as the inverse alchemy of grief: dust of dead stars becomes new worlds, scrap of dead skin-art becomes living constellation. Subtext is coded in silence—no spoken line until the final whisper—forcing the reader to read gesture and paper creases. The ending avoids moral; instead it offers an image that re-weights the meaning of “artificial” from fake to lovingly handmade. One decorative echo—“bloom” appears in prompt and closing line—leans toward thesis-statement, barely shaved back.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment> Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: metal polishes, vellum resists, light refracts—his jeweler’s precision shapes every verb. No head-hops; the woman’s mind is inferred only through externals, keeping POV modest. Syntax modulates: longer sentences for slow grief-work, fragment-like beats when the beam fires. Dialogue is minimal but pitched correctly—her whisper is child-simple, contrasted with his crafted metaphor. Filter verbs appear only when they mimic a telescope’s mediation (“he saw her then”)—voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment> Sentence rhythm alternates between polisher’s circular cadence and the origami’s crisp imperative verbs, mirroring action. No paraphrase loops; each image advances either emotional pressure or spatial clarity. Metaphors are clean: “curtains of intention” extends logically to “lens” and “beam.” High-density lines (“Inside, he wrote a set of celestial coordinates…”) carry three jobs—object handling, motive reveal, and foreshadowing. Only nit: “timeless observatory” is slightly cliché diction amid otherwise fresh choices—doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment> The origami-coordinate courtship inside a sentient observatory is fresh, yet the grief-struck artisan teaching mute beauty to mourn is a familiar archetype; specific jeweler-tool detail and the “genuinely artificial” cosmos concept push it above template. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, no twist—but coherence is high. The stencil-as-lotus reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Could edge higher if the woman’s grief had a more particular texture than generic loss.</comment>
