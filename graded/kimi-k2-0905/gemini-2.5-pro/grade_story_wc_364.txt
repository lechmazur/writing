<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet determination is embodied in every micro-choice: cold forge for a year, satchel packed with bread and twilight-silk, palms pressed to stone. The barter of sensory memories—plum-burst, orchard breeze—makes the sacrifice concrete and particular; the hollowing cost is felt. Interior contradiction is present yet subtle: hope vs terror of the lock he might open. One slip: “state caught precisely between understanding and confusion” is diagnostic self-label mid-peak; −0.3, else near 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because the magician bled the arches, therefore Elian descends; because he offers memory, therefore the arch steadies. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the blue tracery reweights the premise: personal past can be coin to buy planetary future. Cost is legible: “flavors of his past now just empty words.” Orientation clean by 120 w. One micro-turn inside the cavern suffices. Minor scaffold in “slow but undeniable heartbeat” echoed next sentence; −0.1. Publish-now caliber.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating stone arches, petrified dust, geode lattice—details are filtered through Elian’s smith/orchard eye; visual and tactile hierarchy obey his priorities. Environmental pressure is real: dust ruins fruit, blue veins restore it. Micro-setting of silk-as-conduit constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly down shaft and back. Final image of arch “solid grace” recharges earlier crumbling motif. Tool (cold forge) could have constrained more on-page, else 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save home—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: memory barter forecloses retreat; the empty tongue is visceral price. Agency is continuous; no outside rescue. Coincidence absent. Could use one earlier visible loss (tool, time) to sharpen tactics, hence not 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular barter: sensory past vs planetary future. No moralizing sentence. Final blue tracery offers non-literal answer—healing begins in wounds, cost is personal erasure. Resists tidy maxim. Slight thematic echo in “coax resilience from rubble” phrasing −0.2, else 8.7.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s perceptual palette: “calloused but careful,” “captured twilight.” Syntax breathes with descent—longer sentences underground, clipped emergence. No head-hop. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Diction within rural-smith lexis; no sudden academic intrusion. Rhythmic control under pressure in memory-offer paragraph. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>High information density: single sentence packs forge-cold, orchard-death, silk-conduit. No synonym loops; metaphors (“petrified bones,” “captured twilight”) stay coherent. Sentence variety propels descent→stillness→ascension cadence. Opening line anchors voice and world problem. Final line delivers image that recharges “azure defiance.” One near-muddle: “slow but undeniable heartbeat” slightly abstracts—could be viscerally sharper; −0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dying orchard + floating arches + memory-economy feels fresh yet inevitable. Bartered awakenings reverses typical mage-destiny trope: powerless smith pays with taste. Risk in quiet, almost ritual plot pays off via charged final image. Specificity of plum-burst memory could belong only to this world. Transformation test fails if names swapped—arch-silk-geode nexus is inseparable.</comment>
