<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet, precise nature is vividly embodied in the soil-and-chlorophyll stains and the ritual of sorting; the interior contradiction between placid routine and the ache to “decode” sustains tension. Yet the moment of transformation is slightly under-cooked—his final identity shift is declared rather than shown through a micro-choice that costs him something tangible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: leaf falls → anomaly found → prod → world awakens, each beat tightening possibility. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pearlescent soak re-weights every prior leaf, and Elian’s shimmer carries undeniable cost. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/where) arrive ~130 words—just late enough to notice, but the later payoff justifies the hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arbor’s ashen bark, clay bowls, and mica-spire monument are tactile and POV-filtered; the moonstone speck’s cold against wooden tweezers is a masterful micro-setting that later charges the final image. Environment literally guides choice: the floorboards accept the light that re-green the world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—will the message be read?—tightens when the unique speck arrives; the prod forks the path irreversibly. Cost is visible in the tremor that flakes away centuries of ash; the price is the arbor’s sorrow made mortal and Elian’s loss of anonymity as “tender of small things.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of epic prophecy: microscopic tenderness, not heroic force, restores the world. The re-greening reframes every prior monument of forgotten leaves; no moral is stated—only the felt repricing that the smallest attentions can tilt cosmos-scale grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, mossy delight threaded with hush-light imagery (“brittle as spun sugar,” “long, slow sigh”). Rhythm swells from whispered catalog to luminous release without head-hop; diction stays within Elian’s humble lexicon even at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Sentences vary in cadence; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors mar the climax. Information density is high—each flake of mica, each chlorophyll stain earns its keep. Only a single near-paraphrase (“quiet existence…lived during the hush”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>The “seed-sorter-as-savior” trope is inverted through miniature monuments and dust-speck scale, avoiding epic cliché. Folklore of color-sacrifice feels fresh when paid off by literal re-coloring of bark and moss. Risk: lyric accumulation over causal turns—yet coherence holds.</comment>
