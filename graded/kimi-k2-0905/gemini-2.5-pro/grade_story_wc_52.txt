<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s widow identity and grief-management schema are vivid, but the “hauntingly practical” trait is asserted more than dramatized—her carving choice is calm, not visibly costly. The interior contradiction (grief vs. need to function) is present yet static; no micro-choice after the first cut tests this stance. The memory of Leo’s stillness is concrete and character-specific, anchoring motivation. A final visible cost—blood on the wood, or irreversible relinquishing of the memory—would have pushed this to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the first carved line crystallizes the lesson of stillness, reweighting her future. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal; pressure intensifies through sensory density (rain, kettle, scent) rather than branching options. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no disorientation persists. The cost is conceptual—she surrenders the intact blank, now forever altered—visible in the final image of “newly scarred block.” Meets 9+ quick test except the constraint could be sharper; minor hairline slip keeps it at 8.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft functions as both macro-environment and micro-setting: the kettle’s shrill crescendo and the overhead rain create spatial pressure that times the carving decision. The ash blank acts as portable setting/object; its cool solidity and fresh-cut scent constrain hand movement and mark irreversible change. Sensory economy is precise—three senses interleave without catalog. The loft’s isolation mirrors her interior isolation, charging the final silence. Meets 9+ gate: the blank’s altered state directly shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest usable wisdom from loss—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: rain → kettle shriek → blade bite, each layer tightening sensory cost. Agency is present but internal; the carving act forecloses keeping the wood pristine. No external antagonist is needed; grief’s friction is the pressure. Cost is conceptual yet legible—she trades the blank’s purity for embodied memory. Lacks a second beat that forces tactical adaptation, capping it just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: presence over dominance, stillness as control. Subtext lives in the cub memory—power shown via surrender, not force. No explicit thesis statements; the carved arc is the argument. Final image reweights the blank from potential to record, offering quiet irony—she “contains” Leo by releasing him into the wood. Resists moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter: rain sounds, kettle pitch, ash scent are priority-ranked as a seamstress-costumer would notice. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long clauses in calm, staccato fragments at whistle peak. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter. Lexicon stays within her plausible diction: “costume,” “shriek,” “grain.” Distinctive signature: she measures time in kettles and grief in wood. Near 9+; minor over-adjectival (“rust-hued peace”) keeps it 8.7.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Sentences carry double duty: “the rain came down in sheets, drumming...” sets sound, pace, and metaphor in one sweep. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—stillness as ocean, memory as shard—without mixed metaphors. High density: one sentence can anchor body, tool, and emotional state. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; clause length mirrors kettle crescendo. Closure line “newly scarred block of wood” is crisp, propulsive, artifact-free. Hairline only: “rust-hued peace” edges purple, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh angle: lion-tamer widow who tames grief via carving stillness, not spectacle. Memory of tamer sitting still to gentle a cub upends whip-chair cliché. Ash wood’s “calm thunder” scent is particular, not generic symbol. Conceptual reprise—control = presence—reweights carving trope. Risky quiet ending lands cleanly. Slight deduction: widow+carving could drift toward Etsy-grief trope without the cub memory; specificity rescues but not quite 8.5+.</comment>
