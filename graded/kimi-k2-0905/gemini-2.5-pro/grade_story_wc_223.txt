<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s shift from feigned to lived grief is viscerally embodied in the tear-streaked climax; the contradictory impulses—survival guilt versus defiant witness—coexist in her paced alphabetic rebellion. The Regent’s “benevolently ruthless” mask cracks via micro-gesture (thumb tremor) that echoes the knight’s click, making status dynamics legible. Micro-choice hierarchy is crisp: witness testimony > personal safety, paid for with the ash-taste memory and the final silent stare. Cost is felt: she trades her anonymity for the prisoner’s release, a credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage is tight: because Elara once performed grief, she can weaponize its authenticity; therefore the Regent flinches; therefore the key turns. Closure is a Decisive Change—door unlocked, prisoner freed—charged by the Conceptual Reprice that the board never had pawns. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are present by line 4; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The obsidian chessboard is not mere scenery—its missing pawns literalize the absent populace and constrain the Regent’s war-game worldview. The whispering-gallery acoustics amplify every click and foot-scrape, turning marble into political instrument. Dust on the floor receives Elara’s alphabet, fusing micro-setting with tactic. Spatial choreography is flawless: high barred window, perimeter track, central board—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will truth outlive erasure?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: the tapping prisoner answers Elara’s first code, raising stakes from solitary witness to conspiracy. Cost is visible: Elara’s tears strip her protective anonymity; the Regent’s composure fractures in public. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the pawn-less board as state apparatus that literally cannot imagine commoners. Subtext lives in footfalls—alphabet as graffiti of the powerless. Final image reweights the premise: a single key-turn redefines mercy versus amputation. No moralizing; resonance is the groan of the unlocking door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays inside Elara’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is theatrical—lights, acoustics, blocking—yet never clichéd. Compression is taught early: “nomadic penumbra” is legible twilight. Rhythm accelerates with shorter sentences during the tear-streaked climax, then exhales with the groaning lock.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “tears…paths through grime” does double descriptive and moral work. No mixed metaphors; obsidian board holds literal and symbolic logic. Final line ends on sonic image—“groan that echoed”—that propels closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Crisis-actor turned living witness is a fresh angle on post-collapse trauma. Alphabetic pacing as covert graffiti weaponizes theatrical craft into insurgent historiography. Chessboard missing pawns reconfigures a tired metaphor into literal state blindness. Risk—the tearful confrontation—pays off by forcing the antagonist’s humanity leak.</comment>
