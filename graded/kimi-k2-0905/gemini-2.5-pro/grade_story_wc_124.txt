<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is precise—his “measured act” of breathing, the vial as tactile anchor—showing embodied contradiction between smell-avoidance and scent-seeking. Grief is revealed through sensory micro-choices (sliding the vial under UV, inhaling at the end) rather than labels, earning the final tears. Motive remains stable: understand the ghost-scent → recover Elara → accept loss. Closure cost is visible: the breath he once rationed becomes the breath that accepts her absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens: because he fears smell-memory → therefore avoids scent → therefore visits greenhouse → therefore tests vial → therefore discovers Somniflora → therefore inhales/cries. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“humid air of the greenhouse”). Closure is a Decisive Change: he shifts from olfactory defense to deliberate inhalation; cost is the irreversible blooming that lasts “one and only” night.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting: UV lamp, condensation-slick glass, violet glow constrain every action—no bloom without lamp, no reveal without UV. The vial doubles as portable setting fragment, charging the final image when its “faceted coolness” meets warm scent. Spatial choreography clean: he moves workstation→plant→UV table→plant again without drift. Sensory hierarchy biased to a scent-avoidant nose, narrowing to ozone/linen/stars at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will he survive the scent memory or be hollowed by it? Pressure tightens when UV lamp converts curiosity into live confrontation with bloom-time limit. Agency: he chooses to place vial under UV, chooses to breathe in—each act narrows escape routes. Cost legible: once Somniflora opens, grief can no longer be dodged; the flower’s death parallels irrevocable acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through reversal: scent as assault → scent as relic. Subtext carried by object-upgrade—vial from empty threat to love-letter. No moral stated; final image of tears on “clean linen and distant stars” invites reader to feel memory’s beauty/price without dictation. Conceptual repricing: extinct bloom becomes living elegy, reframing loss as inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent perceptual signature: olfactory bias, light-fracture obsession, lantern-dealer diction (“faceted coolness”). Rhythm modulates—long humid sentences early, short staccato at bloom (“And then it came.”). No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Filter verbs minimal; “he suspected” justified by reflective moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence opens setting, stakes, sensory defense. Figurative language selective—only two metaphors (sun as “crystalline splinters,” grief as “damp wool”) and both tie to glass/fabric textures Elias would notice. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and cadence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (tears + scent) without explanatory gloss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of extinct-flower science with perfume noir gives fresh angle on grief. “Aromatically cautious broker” is occupation rarely paired with greenhouse resurrection, making details feel inevitable yet surprising. Conceptual risk—quiet inhalation instead of grand gesture—pays off by reweighting scent from weapon to sacrament. Transformation test fails if swapped: only a lantern dealer would think in refracted light and faceted glass.</comment>
