<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory shame/resolve pulses in every beat: the pillbox engraving against his thumb, the memory of hesitation in Vienna, the sudden warmth of the metal when Kestrel says “she.” Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—he memorizes the snow-map then destroys it, chooses onward motion over retreat—so the renunciation of flight feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, no diagnostic labels; even “quiet ache” is anchored to physical pillbox pressure. Only nit: colleague remains a cipher, so the cost is slightly abstracted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is lean and unbroken: Kestrel’s offer → coded snow message → coordinate reveal → Elias commits. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scuffed snow erases retreat, the pillbox becomes talisman, and the final stride reconfigures his world from hunted to hunter. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; mist and “tilt of the earth” teach ephemerality early. Cost is unmistakable: the map he destroys is literally the only copy, and his new war is now inescapable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mist-as-ally is more than mood; it justifies the meeting, the dead-drop method, and the zero-record stakes. Zephyr Bluff is sketched in three sensory strokes—silver hush, damp rock, crunch of old snow—then used: the damp air softens footprints, the melting canvas accepts coded glyphs, the watery dawn lightens as Elias turns away. Pillbox functions as micro-setting; its mirrored lid gives rear-view surveillance and its weight steadies his hand. Spatial choreography is flawless: ten-pace distance, stick-tip lettering, boot-scuff erasure all track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach the wounded colleague before the Vienna network—signalled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Kestrel warns “they think she’s the loose end.” One meaningful escalation: the snow-map moment converts abstract guilt into a live coordinate with a ticking clock. Agency is crystalline: Elias deciphers, memorizes, then destroys the map, forfeiting any later reference; this act also burns the retreat option. Cost is visible—he now carries only memory and metal toward Pyrenees danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of refound courage emerges through the pillbox and the erased map rather than any statement. The engraved date reframes from gravestone to compass; the scuffed snow literalizes “leaving a trace by removing one.” Subtext in Kestrel’s rasp—“I can only vouchsafe the location”—implies the world is too broken for grand redemption, only hand-offs. Final image of steady pace toward dawn reweights the earlier “frozen moment” into forward motion without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptions filter through his tradecraft habits—pillbox mirror for rear watch, wind direction for voice carry. Syntax tightens under pressure: “He didn’t turn but watched a flicker…” shows split attention, a spy’s habit. Diction is concrete, no spy-thriller jargon; “gnarled walking stick” not “oak-shod staff.” Kestrel’s rasp and curt nod distinguish him in two lines, no need for more.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or filler; each sentence carries double duty—e.g., “The world was reduced…promise of spring” layers weather, mood, and thematic tilt in one breath. Figurative control: mist “silver hush,” footprints “softening,” purpose “sharp enough to cut glass” —three metaphors, each precise, never stacked. Paragraph rhythm breathes with beats—long sentence for mood, fragment for crunch of snow, staccato for code transmission. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, no editorial commentary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Spy-meets-handler is familiar, but snow-as-eraseable-code and mist-as-recordless-ally feel freshly specific. Transformation test fails if you swap tradecraft details, since the pillbox talisman and Vienna-specific guilt are inseparable from Elias’s arc. Risk taken: minimal exposition, no gunfire, yet tension holds. Not quite a startling synthesis, but the quiet dead-drop in melting snow lingers.</comment>
