<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s deafness, solitary artistry, and the need to “release” rather than impose music create a sharp, embodied interiority; every micro-choice (tracing a crack, selecting a tree, pressing the porcelain) is a credible, costly act of listening that culminates in the earned silence of aftermath. No stock phrases, no explanatory dumps—just observed tension and release. The single flaw: the “symphonically minded” tag is asserted twice rather than dramatized inside her head, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the grove now “listening” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—her silence has become communal resonance. Causal linkage holds: because she reads the Old One’s autobiography of cracks, therefore she strums, therefore the alders answer, therefore the silence is transmuted. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors arrive by line 3. One beat of mild convenience—every tree yields a perfect interval on first strike—does not breach causality at this lyric register.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator constrains every tactical choice and is palpably present in the final image; the stress-cracked Old One functions as micro-setting that dictates the entire score. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: sound is texture, light is angle of grain, cold is porcelain density. Weather (“cool air that followed the hedgehog”) is both calendar and metronome. No static cataloging; each detail is filtered through the need to find a resonant site.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—create audible music inside her own silence—tightens through each strum; every note is a visible price (splinters, bark shudder, chest resonance). Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of harmonic layers increases until the grove itself becomes instrument and audience. No external antagonist needed; the antagonist is the locked grain, and it is overcome by sympathetic vibration that costs her total bodily effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: listening as mutual sculpting—tree of woman, woman of tree. The final silence that “listens” back is a Conceptual Repricing of both music and deafness. No moral, only an inverted equation: creator becomes audience, silence becomes medium. Subtext is carried in touch, splinters, and the porcelain’s cold weight—never stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person deep POV maintains psychic distance equal to the reach of fingertips on bark; no head-hop, no filter verbs. Diction stays within a solitary artisan’s lexicon—“grain,” “ridge,” “filigree,” “insulator”—while syntax lengthens and shortens to mimic musical phrasing. The porcelain’s density, the C and G intervals, the “low hum” vs “sharp, clear G” are perceptual signatures unique to this narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the performance: long anacrustic sentences lead to single-beat releases (“a low, resonant C”). No scaffold, no loops; every sentence either advances the sequence of notes or tightens the bodily cost. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“autobiography of tension”—never overwriting the physics of vibration. The final line is an ear-test triumph: five monosyllables that throb (“The world was no longer quiet.”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The entire conceit—tree-song sculpture via porcelain bell on stress-cracked alders—is non-obvious yet inevitable once the physics of tension and release are established. The silence-deafness reversal freshens the familiar trope of artist-as-medium without resorting to magical deafness clichés. Risk is taken and paid off: a 700-word lyric sequence whose climax is a collective hush. Removing any alder or the porcelain collapses the harmonic logic; the synthesis is irreplaceable.</comment>
