<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich, tactile, and specific—her bare feet on chilled flagstones, the silver circlet’s pulse, the violet thread she clings to. The trauma flash is embodied (orange terror, indigo deep) rather than labeled. Her final act of weaving colors into sunrise/calm sea feels earned because the circlet’s mechanics and her daily ritual were seeded early. Only quibble: the “profound peace” tag is slightly abstract at the close, dulling the cost edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she survived the capsize she seeks a new music; because she heat-maps the cereus she finds violet potential; because she fuses trauma with bloom the glass blooms pearlescent white. Orientation anchored by word 40. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—silence is no longer absence but “space where new music can begin”—with conceptual cost: exhaustion and the irreversible opening of both flower and memory. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is both literal pressure—humid bubble against eternal frost—and metaphoric instrument: its panes become the score she light-paints. Spatial choreography is clean (bench-circlet-flower-glass). Frost, flagstones, and violet thermal bloom constrain her choices and charge the final image. One hairline slip: “winterglass” is never defined beyond poetic portmanteau, but the perceptual logic is consistent enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—render silence into visible music—tightens when trauma’s orange/indigo threatens to drown the cereus violet. Escalation is her decision to fuse rather than banish trauma, visible in the color shift on glass. Cost is legible: the bloom opens once, exhausts her, and the old roar is transmuted not erased. Could be sharper if the circlet’s energy drain was physical (trembling hands, nosebleed) but the emotional price still lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges silently: artmaking as transmutation of grief, silence not as lack but as canvas. The pearlescent white is the non-literal answer—beauty that contains terror inside it—without moralizing. Subtext is carried by color itself: violet = potential, orange = fear re-tuned to sunrise. No echoic thesis statement; final line lets image reprice silence. Complexity preserved: trauma is softened, not cured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly elevated register suits a woman who hears in color. Syntax flexes with pressure—“the violet deepened, swirling with threads of silver”—without purple overload. Perceptual signature is consistent: thermal vision always filtered through circlet bias. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. One template cadence (“She… She… She…”) in para 1, but it teaches pattern and pays off in ritual rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dense yet breathable: each sentence layers sense, motion, and metaphor—flagstones / chilled / silent; thermal tapestry / cool blues / placid gold. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective: only two metaphors (ocean symphony, cellular anticipation) and both thematic. Final sentence propels outward—“space where a new kind of music could begin”—without exposition. Copy-clean except missing hyphen in “winterglass.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic grief-translation via botanical thermography is not a trope catalog. Risk—the entire climax is a light show inside a greenhouse—pays off because color logic is taught early and stakes are emotional, not world-saving. Specific detail (silver circlet, violet bud) prevents abstraction. Trauma-transmutation through plant bloom feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at outset. No derivative echoes.</comment>
