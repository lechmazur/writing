<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s quietly analytic stance is consistently rendered through embodied micro-choices (robotic claws, pulse steady, writing the final note). The contradiction between intellectual detachment and the undercurrent of personal grief is implied but never dramatized in a single sharp beat, so the interior conflict stays observational rather than double-edged. The final renunciation—leaving the globe—feels credible, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally charged on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Mosaic design (surface vessel + submersible shard) teaches its pattern by word 150; transitions are legible; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images reweights the stake until the final Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands in the last two sentences: the narrator’s grief is reweighted by the snow-globe image, costing him his previous need to “untangle.” The cost is undeniable—his own grief is released—so the RR criterion is met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is the micro-environment of the library and the snow globe itself; both constrain every manipulator-arm move and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (sonar fluke, velvet fused by heat). Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies/objects track. The globe’s internal light is the setting detail that reconfigures meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“physics of letting go”—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening: the globe reveals stasis = death, tightening the thematic noose. No external antagonist, but pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each artifact (books afloat, fused box, globe) raises the cost of preservation. The price is conceptual yet legible; the narrator forecloses further retrieval, accepting entropy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relation between preservation and life; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of “final exhale” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in the silence of the girl who will never turn a page again. The ambiguity—whether stasis is mercy or murder—lingers, fulfilling the complexity mandate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice is calm, compressed, scientifically precise—“pulse steady despite the profound strangeness.” Diction stays within submersible-operator lexicon; rhythmic control tightens in the final paragraph where short clauses mimic exhalation. Distinct perceptual signature: narrator notices heat-fused velvet, swollen book-flowers, internal globe light—each filtered through analytic bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver setting, object, backstory, and emotional tilt. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (spectral sentinels, pale flowers) are sparse and coherent. Final third is clean—no figurative muddle. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line offers resonant image. Minor register lift (“esoteric,” “entropy”) is justified by narrator’s scientific frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses Earhart red herring with quantum snow-globe tomb—fresh synthesis. The miniature library inside the globe is a specific, irreplicable object that recharges the theme. Narrator’s goal—“physics of letting go”—is not a prompt cliché but a conceptual stake pursued to a non-obvious reversal: letting go = stop fighting entropy. Risk-taking (micro-setting as entire universe) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
