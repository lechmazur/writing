<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s contradiction—seeking music in silence—remains embodied through gesture and camera work; Lyra’s disembodied advice sharpens his micro-choices. The final renunciation (no film, no audience) costs him any future performance, a price legible in the closing walk-away. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The lone weakness: Lyra’s pressure is memory-only, so relationship-as-crucible does not activate, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor’s silence is “entirely changed” into song, cost paid by Elian’s irrevocable expenditure of the night and the camera’s empty shutter. Accumulative lens holds: each mapped silence adds density until the final chord breaks pattern. Causality remains clean—no off-stage shortcuts—and orientation is anchored by word 60. One hairline slip: “fifty years” is externally supplied, not character-bound, keeping it from a pure 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harbor, moonlight, and derelict pylons are filtered through Elian’s perceptual bias toward absence; every visual note is tethered to his sign-language transcription. The collapsed pier functions as micro-setting that literally supports the final chord. Tool-as-setting (the film-less camera) constrains the climax: its click is the only audible artifact, forcing the issue. A half-step shy of 9 only because weather and water temperature never push back tactically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—tightens via accumulative density: each mapped site adds weight until the ferry landing’s aggressive stillness forces the final expenditure. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible in bodily exhaustion (“his hands fell still”) and the irreversible loss of the unrecorded night. Pressure escalates once, decisively; a second tightening would push it to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory is an unfinished score that can be completed only by accepting its erasure. Subtext lives in gesture—each sign is a plea to the forgotten rather than a statement about them. The final chord reweights earlier mappings from archival act to requiem. No moralizing line intrudes; the harbor itself sings the answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter; diction (“rippling sheet of silver,” “spectral symphony”) mirrors his musical synesthesia without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates in the final paragraph, mirroring the desperate ballet of hands. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat. One minor echo—“silence” repeated eight times in 100 words—drops it from 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; clauses breathe with the tide. Figurative language is selective—moonlight as cathedral, crane as ghost—never stacked in crisis beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. A single mixed vehicle (“aggressive silence…pushed back against the moonlight”) is forgiven because the personification charges the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—composing music by photographing silence with an empty camera and notating it in an invented sign language—is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk: the entire drama hinges on an absent audience hearing an unrecorded song, yet the story lands the stunt. Transformation is complete: the harbor becomes instrument, Elian becomes conductor, reader becomes witness. No derivative template in sight.</comment>
