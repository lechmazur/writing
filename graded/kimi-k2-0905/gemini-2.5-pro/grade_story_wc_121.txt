<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—fighting the memory vs. embracing it—drives every beat; the moment he stops resisting, buoyancy vanishes and the prison dissolves. Embodied emotion is vivid: tablet grit, ozone taste, boot soles finally pressing. The renunciation of flight costs him his literal loft, a price legible on the page. Only nit: the “labyrinth of self” tag is named, not dramatized, slightly abstracting motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing viaduct greys into dawn, Kael lands, tablet turns to mud—cost is visible and felt. Causal lens holds: accepting the memory seeds the stable coordinate that ends the loop. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; later disorientation is taught and paid off. One micro scaffold: “procedural generation” is explained rather than shown, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The viaduct’s shifting glow and rain-slick metal act as both jail and tool, guiding Kael’s descent to the origin tile; environment directly constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is tight—ozone, wet metal, internal light—filtered through Kael’s gravity-defier bias. Spatial choreography stays clean as geometry reconfigures around him. Micro-setting (tablet, boots) charges the landing beat when gravity returns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the loop by locating its seed—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes retracing must go backward through the algorithm, not across the bridge. Agency is internal: surrender to memory; this narrows options from endless flight to one coordinate. Cost is the永久 loss of weightlessness, a felt forfeiture. Escalation is single but sufficient: frantic shifting slows to stillness as he accepts the drop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: acceptance of irreparable loss dissolves self-imposed prison. The tablet’s devolution from cosmic map to dried mud reweights “meaning” from external code to internal scar. Darkening brightness motif modulates from sterile warden-glow to grey dawn, mirroring Kael’s shift from denial to integration. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, yet always Kael-sighted: “each droplet…like a fallen star” is perceptual, not decorative. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during loop chaos, then steadies as geometry stabilizes. No head-hopping; flicker-Kael is external hallucination, not POV drift. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and justified; diction stays within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Prose is dense, musical, scaffold-free; sentences carry two jobs—image and causality. Metaphors are controlled: “sterile, unblinking eye” appears once and fits warden function. No loops or synonym churn; openings vary. One mixed image—“drop and the ripple”—is abstract but paid off by the literal fall memory, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Time-loop plus procedural-generation is familiar, yet the fractal self-prison seeded by a specific memory of letting a hand fall offers fresh inflection. The gravity-defier gift is inverted: not escape tool but perspective shift that must be surrendered. Tablet devolves rather than reveals—nice reversal. Concept commits fully; no late rule cheats. Risk is quiet but coherent, not gimmicky.</comment>
