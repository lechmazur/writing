<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s curator reflex with the emerald lens is concrete and specific; his shift from despair to sonic strategist is legible. Interiority stays in historically-trained perception rather than abstract emotion. The “warm A loaf” beat crystallizes his stake, but the council/elder voices remain off-page silhouettes, so relationship pressure is muted. Earned cost is present—the city sings itself back to life—but his personal flaw/compromise is not foregrounded, capping depth at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: frozen silence → lens reveals fracture → memory of resonance → bread cue → communal song → thaw. Orientation anchors by line 4; no drift. Closure is a decisive physical change (ice cracks, water returns) charged by the anthem’s cultural cost—memory made kinetic. The “rosewater dread” abstraction is the only minor causal hiccup, but it doesn’t break linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grotto, phosphor-moss, stone oven, and emerald lens are tactile and POV-filtered. The waterfall-as-ice-curtain evolves from spectacle to threat to sounding-board, directly enabling the sonic solution. Spatial choreography holds as the chorus moves to the frozen base. Micro-setting (lens in palm, bread steam) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“save culture by saving lives”—is signaled early and tightened when fractures are seen. The single escalation beat (song pitch rises → ice groans) narrows options from passive prayer to active resonance. Cost is the city’s vocal exhaustion and the implicit risk that song could hasten collapse. Agency is collective but protagonist-guided, meeting lens criteria.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: cultural memory as living force, not archive. Subtext sits in the shift from lens-as-relic to lens-as-tuning-device. The reprise of the bread ‘A’ quietly reweights identity from static symbol to edible, shared act. No moralizing, but the “rosewater dread” phrase edges toward ornamental abstraction, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Alistair’s curator sensorium; perceptual signature is color-filter, archival cross-reference, and sculptural vocabulary. Rhythm modulates from elegiac opening to urgent imperatives at climax. No dialogue, so voice carries all exposition without strain. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” feels like rubric intrusion, not character thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative load is moderate and purposeful—“web of deadly potential” is exact. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, mood, and stakes. Minor scaffold: “the sound returned first—a gentle hiss that grew...” restates the obvious beat, but it lands outside the closure third, so 9+ remains open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Frozen waterfall saved by song is fresh; linking it to high-altitude aqueduct resonance grounds the magic in plausible tech memory. The bread-initial custom feels idiosyncratic yet believable as diaspora ritual. Risk is moderate—sonic thaw could have read as deus ex machina, but the archive seed is planted early. Overall, a memorable synthesis rather than shock twist.</comment>
