<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s “accidentally prophetic” gift and his drive to retune give every beat purpose; embodied emotions (the quiet weight on his chest, the lamp hum) show rather than label. Micro-choices—typing fortunes, packing the bag—trace the arc from conductor to traveler with visible cost. Interior contradiction (control vs. departure) stays active in-scene, not summarized. Only minor lapse: no status pressure from another on-page character, but single-POV design excuses it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: microdot arrival → fortune writing → cookie distribution → sugar-glaze transfer → keeper’s exit, each beat narrowing options. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses the keeper path, bag in hand, cost legible in the abandoned typewriter. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—his prophetic reputation—shapes every tactic. Minor elasticity: off-stage agents resolved by cookies, but causality remains internal to Elias’s orchestration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse, lantern room, sea-fog, and sugar-glaze cookie are tactile tools that constrain movement and transfer. Sensory hierarchy (tinny bell, ghostly metronome beam) mirrors Elias’s metronomic control. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: binocular perch → distant diner → taillights vanish. Environment charges final image: keeper turns from beam to dark stairs, setting the cost of departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: maintain harmony by covert direction; tightening occurs when fogged exchange becomes irreversible once cars vanish. Agency is Elias’s orchestration; cost is relinquishing his post and identity. No coincidence resolves—luck only complicates visibility. Price (abandoned typewriter) visible on page; would like one earlier tactical loss to edge higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges: art of unseen control vs. need to relinquish it. Fortunes-as-music metaphor reweights from public prophecy to private departure; final line retunes the song for himself. No moralizing; resonance lingers in lighthouse silence. Could edge 9+ if one fortune recurred with altered meaning at exit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual signature: “faint, tinny echo,” “ghostly metronome.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at exit (“He packed… He descended”). No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom—achieved. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within keeper-poet lexicon. Rhythmic control teaches pattern early and pays off in final sparse line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers job, tool, and mood. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Varied sentence openings; paragraph cuts land on tactical pivots. “Tinny echo,” “salt-scar,” “discordant music” are fresh yet precise. Proofing clean; zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse keeper as clandestine communications composer, microdot printed in sugar glaze. Fortune cookies as dead-drop vectors feels inevitable yet surprising. Concept commits fully—no retreat to exposition. Risky lyric exit paid off by earlier pattern; specific detail makes trope transformation stick.</comment>
