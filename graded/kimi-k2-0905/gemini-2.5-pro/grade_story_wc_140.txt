<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nameless narrator’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a single poison label while trying to build a whole self from strangers’ fragments—are rendered in scene through the tactile layering ritual. Emotions are embodied (the “violet” of grief pressed against the “warm gold” of wonder) without diagnostic labels. The final Earned Stasis—renouncing official identity yet claiming a private memory—carries visible cost: the container empties and the horn shatters the composite self. interiority remains consistent, compressed, and particular to this ghostly stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each overheard fragment layers density until the poison label is reweighted into a lived memory, then releases at the horn blast. Closure is the Charged Poise—container walls thin, memory is momentarily owned, then surrendered—leaving a felt after-cost of perpetual erasure. Pattern taught early (rhythmic layering), transitions legible (low tide → high tide → retreat), no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final image: “the quiet slap of water” against an emptied box.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container-corridor, tide level, and diesel brine are filtered through the ghost’s urgent selectivity (“rust-holes and shadowed canyons”). The Evergreen container acts as micro-setting: its dust smell and membrane-thin walls constrain the layering ritual and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is tight—voice moves from container interior to quay to bulkhead without drift. Environment constrains choice and charges closure; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a composite memory substitute for an erased life—tightens as each layer adds sensory density and risks dissolution at the horn blast. Agency is the deliberate layering act that forecloses official identity; cost is the knowledge that the memory will dissipate. Escalation is textural: violet grief + gold wonder + poison label = phantom history that collapses. Under accumulative lens, the deepening reweights the stake; visible price is the empty container and the retreating tide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of erasure-as-freedom emerges from the specific ritual rather than assertion; the poison label’s reincarnation as regretful choice reconfigures meaning. No moralizing—final image invites reflection on transient ownership of memory. Subtext resides in silence after the horn: the cost of ghosthood is eternal rehearsal without arrival. Complexity sustained: freedom and void are the same act viewed differently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric first-person texture is consistent: syntax compresses under pressure (“I layer. I take...”) yet expands into sensory metaphor when the container walls thin. Perceptual signature—sound bending, color as emotion—remains character-bound. No head-hopping; patterned elision (“a woman in Marseille”) is taught early and paid off. Voice modulates with tide phases without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers material or advances atmosphere; minimal scaffolding. Rhythm mirrors tide—long sentences swell, then fragment at horn blast. No mixed metaphors; figurative language is coherent (violet grief stays pigment, never liquefies). One paraphrase loop detected (“the tide breathes in... breathes out...”) but it is pattern-taught and serves cadence; no closure touch, so cap not triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—ghost building self from overheard cargo fragments—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky second-person address to “you” never appears; instead, the port labyrinth becomes a memory loom. Poison label repurposed from prop to scar without gimmickry. Specificity of “impossible softness of newborn daughter’s hand” anchors abstraction in mortal detail. Resists allegory; emotional truth exceeds surface novelty.</comment>
