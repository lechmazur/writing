<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority—his surrender to the reverie, the micro-choice to shift from interrogation to legacy—is vivid and embodied. The contradiction between archival duty and psychic captivity is dramatized, not labeled. Still, the antagonist remains a heat-haze cipher, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is one-sided; the earned shift lands but with only half the possible cost visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the coordinate reveal reweights the entire diary quest and carries undeniable conceptual cost—he must now bodily enter the site of Elara’s death. Accumulative lens holds: beach-art iterations tighten pattern until the final arrangement breaks silence. Orientation is taught early via zeppelin brass and salt-snap transition; no因果 breaks. One minor scaffold: “searing reverie” is repeated twice in adjacent sentences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, urchin skeleton, and brass desk each constrain action or attention—lagoon swallows light, urchin dictates delicacy of parley, desk hum anchors return. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors Kaelen’s narrowing perception. Spatial choreography across water is clean; heat-haze distance keeps antagonist indistinct without White-room syndrome. Environment directly charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract truth from encrypted past—tightens when Kaelen abandons interrogation for legacy, narrowing his option set. Pattern-break of beach-art from question to statement delivers the single meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt via antagonist’s first micro-gesture and sunlight lessening, but price could be sharper (no resource lost or bodily risk yet). Sufficient for this word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of archival aftermath—“what remains when the fire goes out”—emerges through beach-art shift, not assertion. Final image of stone/urchin/seaweed offers resonant, non-literal answer to Elara’s sacrifice. Ambiguity lingers: is preservation itself a violence? No moralizing capsule; particulars carry weight. Slight deduction for abstract “fever dream rendered in ink” early on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Kaelen’s perceptual filter—brass vibration, salt sting, driftwood weight. Rhythm flexes from languid clause-strings inside reverie to staccato “He dismantled… He laid” at pivot. No head-hop; diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon without academic drift. Final coordinate decoding keeps psychic distance intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “fragile cage of a sea urchin’s skeleton” does triple sensory/specific/symbolic duty. Only one paraphrase loop (“searing reverie… searing quality”) and one register lift (“conceptual repricing”-like phrasing in commentary). Otherwise rhythm breathes with escalation, no mixed metaphors. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fused premise—archivist psychically trapped by encrypted diary—feels inevitable yet fresh. Beach-debris parley reverses typical interrogation scene into silent material argument, a risk that heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity of floating library + obsidian lagoon anchors universals. Minor echo of “mirror lagoon” trope, but black-water-as-memory-warden transforms it.</comment>
