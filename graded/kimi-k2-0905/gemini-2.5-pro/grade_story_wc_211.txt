<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—archivist of feeling vs. savior by amnesia—is dramatized in the moment he presses the wax shaving to his mind; the embodied shudder of “phantom thrum” and the cloying apple-blossom scent externalize the cost. His oath to preserve vs. duty to erase crystallizes in a single, irreversible renunciation that lands with felt price. No diagnostic self-labeling; the flaw (curiosity/hubris) drives the fatal discovery. Voice stays idiosyncratic: maritime memory as tuning fork is character-specific and non-transferable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the foghorn redefined from beacon to sonic shield reweights the entire premise; the cost is the city’s future amnesia, legible in the funereal scent shift. Causal chain holds: Horn silence → wax cut → immersion → prophecy → scribe’s invert oath. Orientation anchored by line 9 (ancient orchard atop the Spire) and reinforced by sensory cues. No lens ambiguity; the drive is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting—the iron tongue memory and the wax shaving—constrains the immersion mechanics and charges the final image. Maritime Museum salt-dust scent returns as funereal apple blossom, reweighting atmosphere. Spatial choreography clean: rooftop garden → filtered air → city below. Selective detail (caramel-colored blank, diamond stylus) serves POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (save city by erasing its emotional archive) is signaled early and tightens when Elian realizes his life-work is the lure. One meaningful reversal: preservation becomes weaponized deletion. Cost is visible: he must betray his oath and orphan the archive. Agency resides in the decision to immerse and the consequent invert duty; no external coincidence resolves the threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse paradox: recorded feeling becomes bait, erasure becomes mercy. Subtext operates through scent and sound imagery rather than assertion. Final image of “silent city gleamed” offers resonant non-moral answer. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermon; complexity stays intact—salvation through cultural self-lobotomy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian with perceptual signature of antiquarian precision (“paper-thin wax cylinder phonograph shaving”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under shock (“A cold realization…”). No head-hopping; knowledge strictly bounded—he alone interprets the dead tongue. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence survives without it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from measured开园句 to staccato prophecy fragments. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors (velvet disquiet, sonic bulwark) stay coherent and specific. High information density: “fragile, paper-thin wax cylinder phonograph shaving” compresses object, fragility, and process in one breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise inversion—foghorn as monster-repellent, archive as lure—is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Maritime memory as decryption key is fresh and specific to Elian. Risk-taking in quiet, anti-heroic resolution (forget, don’t fight) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic “city in peril” template.</comment>
