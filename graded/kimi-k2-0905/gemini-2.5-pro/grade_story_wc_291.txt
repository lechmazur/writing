<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s prosopagnosia is more than label: it dictates why he paints absence, not likeness, and why the quarry becomes his “canvas.” The moment he drags joyful color into gray and then lances the void, his empathy is awakened through action, not exposition. Interior contradiction is alive—he wants feeling yet avoids crowds—final renunciation (leaving the painting in the mist) costs him the comfort of detachment. No secondary characters on page, so relational tests waived; single-POV interiority stays consistent, embodied, textured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the scratch unifies killer/void and victim/light, reweighting Elias’s life rule (“I need absence to feel”). Causal lens holds: because he cannot read faces, therefore he paints structural void; because he lances the canvas, therefore empathy arrives as cost. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“the shadowed quarry exhaled…”), so no penalty. Persistent constraint—prosopagnosia—shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quarry, ribbon, mist, and stone recur as micro-setting that constrains palette and最终决定：the cold rock literally scrapes the ribbon, determining the color clash Elias must paint. Sensory selection skewed to tactile (cold wet mist, frayed silk) mirrors Elias’s face-blind reliance on texture over sight. Final image—the canvas left staring into fog—crystallizes setting as both literal and symbolic void. No spatial drift; bodies/props tracked cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken empathy—tightens when the act of painting becomes a wager: if the void stays mute, he remains numb. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of color-versus-gray strokes increases until the lance moment reweights the stake with irrevocable cost (the canvas wound). No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent under chosen lens. Cost is visible: the scratch is “pure absence,” foreclosing his prior emotional anesthesia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy is not recognition of faces but recognition of absence. Subtext lives in gesture—touching ribbon to stone wordlessly marries party/grave. Final image reframes earlier “fading bruise” ribbon as the exact color inside the wound, tying life’s vibrancy to its erasure. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—he gains feeling yet walks away, leaving art as corpse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: noticing texture, temperature, shape—never faces. Syntax lengthens for methodical ritual, then fractures into short clauses at lance beat, mirroring rupture. No dialogue, so voice strain risk averted. Diction stays within artist’s plausible lexicon—“masquerade ribbon,” “light-devouring gray”—without academic drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances palette, mist, or emotional stakes. Metaphors are spare and consistent (“wound in the earth,” “canvas wound”). Rhythm modulates: long painterly cadences contract to two-word slash clause at climax. No mixed vehicles or filter-verb stacks; information density high without purple overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Face-blind portraitist who paints absence to feel is fresh synthesis; cold-case ribbon as pigment source further twists genre expectations. Risk—quiet lyric ending without detective twist—pays off via conceptual repricing. Specificity of “fading bruise” silk against granite could not swap into another story without collapse. Premise followed to ruthless implication: empathy awakened by void, not justice served.</comment>
