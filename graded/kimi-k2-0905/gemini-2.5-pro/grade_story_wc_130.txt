<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elian’s interiority is concrete—his fingers tracing chips as “data points” and the quiet invitation he sends through the glass eyes show embodied grief without therapy-speak. The contradiction between quantifying loss and surrendering to its emotional chaos is lived in scene, not declared. His final micro-choice—picking up the cooled eyes with “buried optimism”—earns a credible, visible cost: the void is renamed, not erased. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship-as-crucible inert, but the self-pressure is sufficient for Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice projection makes the “before” (formless ache) and “after” (patterned, nameable absence) legible with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each chip, crack, and glass-eye glow adds density until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. No causal tricks are required; the mosaic’s physical logic stays intact. The persistent constraint—the void remains framed, not filled—shapes the final image and forecloses easy catharsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is never backdrop: the dripping stalactites nourish the trees, the moonlit fissure supplies the only light that can activate the glass eyes, and the mosaic path literally encodes the algorithm of loss. Micro-setting rules—cobalt tile depressions accept the eyes; wet limestone scent crowds perception—constrain placement and timing. Spatial choreography is flawless: kneeling, palm-to-stone, lattice on wall all track cleanly. Environment charges the final image: the same moon that lit the void now watches the seedling of optimism break surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quantify grief or remain haunted by its formlessness—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each stone-chip “vector.” The single meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice reveals that absence and presence interlock; this forecloses the fantasy of erasing loss and reweights the stake to living alongside it. Cost is visible: the hum rises, the eyes cool, and the conjurer’s optimism must sprout in soil that still contains the void. No reversals are needed; the pressure is cumulative and conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through the lattice image: mathematics of emotion is not solved but reconfigured into a living theorem. Subtext resides in silence—no dialogue, only dripping water and the orchard’s breath—forcing the reader to supply the emotional algebra. The closing seedling image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: growth is possible only inside the framed void, not after it. No moral is stated; the reweighting is optical and visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual signature—wet limestone scent, spiral nebulae of grout, the hush where humming should be. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses into short clauses at the hum’s ignition, mirroring cardiac pacing. No dialogue means voice must carry all texture; it does, via taxidermist eyes “like captured stars” and the seedling simile that recharges earlier fertility imagery. Register never drifts above the conjurer’s quietly scholarly idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, causality, or emotional density. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—glass eyes “like captured stars” sets up their later capture of star-bright lattice. No mixed metaphors; lattice, void, seedling form one coherent optical field. Information density peaks in the lattice paragraph where three sensory channels (sight, sound, touch) operate in one sentence without crowding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing grief-mapping with cavern horticulture feels fresh, not grafted; the “living theorem” reframes a familiar bereavement arc into spatial mathematics. Risk is taken by refusing a character return or speech, yet the lattice image earns the gamble. Specificity—cobalt depressions, stalactite drip cadence—prevents concept from sliding into allegory. The premise would collapse if transplanted to daylight orchard or digital grid, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
