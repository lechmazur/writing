<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s grief-anchored obsession is palpable through embodied ritual (brass tag, lamp-lighting, purposeful dive); the vow to “see her music” drives every beat. Interior contradiction surfaces once—physics vs. promise—yet the plunge still feels inevitable. Cost is visible: years of isolate preparation climax in the drowned library where he renounces surface life for an inner indigo vision. Missing micro-choices under water (only stillness) keeps him just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each lit lamp, descending lantern, and sinking book thickens the memorial mood until the dark library becomes the pressure chamber that forces the internal color vision. Closure is a Charged Poise—total darkness births indigo—as the final image reweights every prior light motif without exposition. Causality is emotional, not plot-based, and lands with conceptual cost: he surfaces “calm,” the world finally inhabited again. Pattern taught early (lantern/light) and paid off in blackout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea-level pier, black water column, and tilted silted library are sketched with economical, sensory strokes that never stall momentum. Brass tag functions as micro-setting anchor; rebreather gauges supply tactile reality that later contrasts the metaphysical color bloom. Spatial choreography holds across descent—no impossible positions. Environment actively squeezes options: only in total darkness can the color be “heard,” satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfill the luminous vow—tightens through accumulating imagery: each lamp lit subtracts another surface comfort until the only remaining move is into blackness. One meaningful intensifier: switching off torch in the library eliminates every external cue, forcing internal synesthetic payoff. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—he emerges exhausted, no longer empty. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memorial-as-sensory-transmutation emerges wordlessly: public ritual (lanterns) versus private synesthesia (indigo). No moral stated; instead, final image re-prices grief into aesthetic vision. Subtext pulses in objects—brass tag, swollen books—carrying silence and color. Avoids sentimentality by keeping revelation non-verbal, lit only by remembered Bach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Silas’s perceptual filters: salt spray “cool on his face,” books “like tired old men.” Diction is lyrical yet controlled—no register drift. Sentence rhythm elongates for descent, shortens for torch-off moment, mirroring pressure. No head-hop; metaphor “meteor hush” is taught early and echoed at immersion, sustaining texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean but imagistic; every clause advances atmosphere or emotional pressure—no filler. Metaphors stay consistent (lamps=stars, books=bats) and serve theme without crowding. One near-loop: “lights…lights” in open could compress, but cadence justifies echo. High information density; opening line anchors both voice and stakes immediately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic grief-dive feels fresh; library-as-chapel-of-silence twists familiar shipwreck trope. Lamplighter profession is specific operational detail that motivates nocturnal access. Risk lies in quiet, near-plotless arc; reward is internal color vision. Could tip toward derivative elegy without the sensory inversion—indigo chord perceived in blackout—but the inversion is well-earned.</comment>
