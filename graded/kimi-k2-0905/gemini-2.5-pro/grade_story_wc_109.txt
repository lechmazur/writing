<comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—cartographer of an impossible night—drives every micro-choice; the obsession is embodied in the ink-stained finger, the hush-listening posture, the final glyph. The moment the last star winks out crystallizes a credible renunciation: he accepts the cost of eternal witness, foreclosing any ordinary cartographer’s life. No second character, so relationship/status bullets waived; the “mildly obsessed” trait is not label-only but enacted. The 9+ quick test is nearly met: contradictory impulses (map-maker vs. map-the-unmappable) act in scene, and refusal to stop carries felt cost—only the causal linkage to prior beats is hairline shy of flawless.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the completed glyph reconfigures the night from void to territory under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible in the single star’s extinction and the wind’s sigh—external indices of an internal price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no disorientation. Persistent constraint—the storm-sealed tower—shapes every tactical silence-summoning. Lens holds without waver; no causality break.</comment>

<comment>The ridge fort’s granite and slit-ceiling star are not backdrop but instruments: the stone amplifies silence, the slit provides the sole clock. Micro-setting—the gold leaf booklet—constrains choice: its fragility forces slow tracing, determining glyph precision. Spatial choreography is immaculate; wind and salt silence track across body and page. Environment charges the final image: wind softens the instant the glyph closes, proving the map altered reality’s texture. 9+ gate met: environment constrains tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map the endless night—tightens exactly once: the star’s disappearance collapses possibility into necessity, forcing the final glyph. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action, coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is atmospheric yet felt; options narrow from “chart darkness” to “accept sole stewardship.” No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges silently: knowledge vs. the unknowable, charted via absence. The ambered hush reweights from sensory detail to ontological territory at closure. No thesis stated; final image of dying embers on fingertips is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—does the map summon or merely record the dark—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains psychic distance; perceptual signature is geologist-cartographer: “granite of the storm-tossed ridge,” “marbled hush.” Syntax lengthens under pressure, mirroring the slow trace. No dialogue, so bullets waived. Patterned diction (“silence heavy and saline,” “taut pause…sharp as a shard”) is taught early and paid off in final glyph. Zero head-hop; voice remains singular stone-against-storm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with hush-to-gale cadence; sentence variance avoids drumbeat. Information density high—one line can anchor setting, stake, and metaphor: “a single star pulsed, a final diamond stud in a vast, dimming velvet.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor near-repeat of “silence” in adjacent sentences (−0.2) but does not touch closure. Figurative language serves texture, not decoration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartography of darkness via silence—is non-obvious synthesis of mystic surveyor + negative space. Risk: entire story is static monk tracing air, yet stakes feel lived. Specific detail (flaking gold leaf, slit-star clock) prevents abstraction. Transformation test: swap elements and concept collapses. No close echo of famous scene; voice is singular.</comment>
