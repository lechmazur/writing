<comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“salt-laced dust…tasted like failure”), but the epiphany turn—“the crestfallen artist was gone”—is stated more than dramatized; the shift from paralysis to cartographer arrives in a single sentence rather than through a visible micro-choice that costs him something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the shattered tarot box is re-ordered into a hand-drawn map, a Conceptual Repricing that makes the “luminescent ache” the new compass. Causal chain holds: because he cannot paint whole faces, he maps fragments instead; the lighthouse spiral physically guides the collage. Cost is felt—“fingers black with charcoal,” “mind quiet for the first time.” One bump: the time jump across hours of labor is compressed into a single paragraph, slightly blurring the moment of decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The circular stone room, rotating lamp beam, and salt dust are sharply sensory and filter through the artist’s painterly eye. The broken tarot coffer becomes the micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice: he arranges its splinters into the new map, so the object-as-setting charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he re-see coherence after fragmentation?—tightens once when the box breaks and again when he decides not to repair but to re-chart. The tightening is textural (pattern break) rather than causal; pressure is felt but not merciless. Visible price: surrender of the old tarot “system” and of intact wooden box, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of re-ordering chaos through deliberate fragmentation emerges from the collage-on-floor image rather than assertion. Final line offers a resonant reconfiguration: cartographer of the fractured soul re-weights “luminescent ache” from wound to tool. Avoids moralizing, but the tarot archetypes (Fool, Tower) flirt with overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, synesthetic, and consistent: “constellation of disconnected features,” “geometric impossibilities.” Long sentences breathe during reflection, then tighten into staccato cataloguing of threads and splinters. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature stays individual and idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences do two jobs (image + interiority). Minor loop: “luminescent ache” is repeated verbatim twice within fifty words. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral staircase echoed in spiral of fragments—no mixed vehicles. Charcoal dust, hemp fiber, and cracked leather give tangible specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “map your own fracture” conceit feels fresh in flash length, though the broken-artist-escapes-to-lighthouse is familiar. Risk: collage-as-therapy could read as craft-project; rescued by tarot shards becoming literal cartography. Final image of inner coastline is memorable and specific to this voice.</comment>
