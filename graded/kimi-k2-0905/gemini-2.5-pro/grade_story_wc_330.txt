<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—silence vs. the need to “interpret silence as possibility”—is concrete and embodied; his micro-choices (chiseling, fitting the halo, finally singing) all flow from this. The ten-year voicelessness renounced in a single sustained note carries visible, audible cost, earning the Earned Stasis closure. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; occupational detail (carousel carpentry) is specific and germane. Voice distinction not required; internal voice remains coherent, carpentry-tactile, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the instant Elias sings, silence is repurposed into sacred listening; cost is the decade of voicelessness now spent in one exhalation. Causal lens holds throughout: wrong turn → oasis → discovery → restoration → song. Orientation (who/where/when) anchored by word 40; no disorientation. Wind-gust coincidence complicates rather than rescues. Persistent constraint: the restored mare and her crown literalize the price of permanence—he can never again claim silence is absence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is the micro-setting of the derelict train car: velvet-stripped seats, peeling gilt, splintered poplar mare—every surface is tactilely engaged during carving. Weather (focused gust) functions as plot agent, not backdrop. Spatial choreography clean: fragment travels from mane → palm → bench → brow without teleport. The halo fragment itself serves as portable sky, constraining his choice to crown the horse and triggering song. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence be transmuted into living art? Pressure tightens when the fragment’s glow rewrites his task from repair to creation. One meaningful turn: fitting the halo into the groove → wind → song; this narrows his future to a voiced stewardship. Cost is irreversible: once sound is loosed, the old mute refuge is gone. Agency remains internal yet forecloses path; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: silence → gleam → listening. No character ever names the theme; the final “listening” silence is shown via the mare’s glass eyes reflecting the crown. Subtext in gesture: the bells measure time he never expected to need. Ambiguity preserved—song could be joy or elegy. No moralizing, no echo of prompt language. The conceptual repricing: silence is no longer absence but a charged container waiting for voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: wood grain, tool weight, internal luminescence. Syntax mirrors carpentry rhythm—short, chisel-like clauses that widen into lyrical release at the song. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs minimal; internal phrasing (“felt,” “seemed”) always justified by sensory uncertainty. Register remains within a craftsman’s lexicon; no sudden poetic inflation until the final breath, which reads as break-out ecstasy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence either advances carving progress or escalates atmospheric pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stake in one motion: “Elias, the silent carousel carpenter, had found the train by taking a wrong turn.” Metaphors are spare and physically coherent—“spun moonlight” is the only figurative stretch, justified by fragment’s appearance. Rhythmic variation matches wind crescendo; final paragraph lengthens to sustain the sung note. No line could be removed without collapsing momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of abandoned circus train + halo fragment yields a fresh mythic space without exposition dumps. “Misting hush” as active antagonist is an inventive inversion of noise-as-threat. Wrong-turn origin is trope, but repurposed as spiritual vocation rather than mere plot entry. Singing after decade of silence is earned by tactile buildup, not melodramatic twist. Specificity of poplar mare, velvet-lined groove, and brass bells prevents generic allegory. Risk: lyric escalation could have tipped into purple, but restraint keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: silent carpenter introduced word 1. Development: silence limits his tools to chisel/wood, prevents calling for help, forces patient carving. Closure: song expends the stored silence as currency. Cost: future life must now include sound; oasis ceases to be refuge. Irreplaceable: any non-silent protagonist would break the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Setup: discovered inside mare’s mane beat 1. Development: glow redirects carving from repair to coronation; fragment companion on bench. Closure: flare triggers wind → song; crowns mare, mirrors in her eyes. Causal pressure: without luminance, no wind cue, no voice. Irreplaceable object; no substitute could pulse dawn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Setup: “misting hush clung” word ~30. Development: hush blankets choices, demands wind bells as clock. Closure: hush transmuted into listening silence after song. Shapes tactics: keeps him inside car, filters sensory scope to tactile. Swapping hush for mere quiet would lose atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Setup: “quietly persistent argument against the stillness” declared. Development: persistence shown via daily carving, new flourishes invented. Closure: persistence culminates in halo fitting and song. Trade-off: patience consumes years; song spends the saved time. Trait visible in action every beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: voiceless premise established. Development: throat unused decade implied. Closure: sustained note erupts; reweights silence from absence to vessel. Narrows future: can never return to mute refuge. Without this exact act, Resonant Reconfiguration fails.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: wrong turn mentioned word 15. Development: mechanics never revisited; oasis functions as given. Closure: no callback to route or map. Swappable with “stumbled upon” without structural change; thus mid-band cap. Serves as entry key, not ongoing constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Setup: described paragraph 1. Development: decay provides raw material; spatial limits force single-file carving; wind corridor funnels gust. Closure: train car acts as resonance chamber for bells and song. Resource provider: wood, velvet, brass all scavenged. Setting actively shapes final acoustic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Setup: wind bells hung to “measure days.” Development: single evening breeze triggers chime → flares fragment. Closure: chime softens into listening silence. Time tracked perceptually, not numerically; sufficient for micro-tightening. Tactic alteration: he rushes to finish before dusk wind.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: “purpose of his hands: to interpret silence as possibility.” Development: every carving stroke tests thesis; halo discovery rewrites goal from repair to creation. Closure: song proves interpretation successful. Conflict: silence vs. voice; cost is lifelong refuge. Motive stated once, dramatized throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Setup: “whispering gleam” first attached to fragment. Development: gleam modulates from cool to warm, cues wind flare, reflects in mare’s eyes. Closure: steady gleam becomes sacred night-light for listening silence. Coherent across calm, crescendo, and hush reprise. Tone shift carries thematic reweighting.</comment>
