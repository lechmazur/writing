<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s “technician of sorrow” vocation is vivid, but the interior contradiction promised by the premise—curiosity vs. the cost of hearing the dead—is only labeled, never dramatized. The single micro-choice (offering the lullaby beat) feels altruistic but not personally costly; we see no evidence that this call drains him, limiting the felt price. Leo’s worry is embodied, yet his status reversal hinges on a single breath, too slight to register as crucible-level change. The fail is motivational: Elias’s curiosity never complicates the closure, so the arc stays flat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: hearing-aid pulse → locate Leo → translate rhythm → closure. Orientation locked by line 4; spatial choreography across the atrium is clean. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pulse fades to hum, Leo’s breath syncs, cost is conceptual—grandmother’s peace transferred—rather than personal to Elias. The mild deduction: no persistent price boomerangs on Elias, so the “circuit” imagery stays metaphoric, not materially charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: glass/steel echo chamber literalizes “reeling hush,” constraining how far sound/pulse can travel and why Elias must walk slowly. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—auditory pulses guide camera-like sweeps. Fog and marble root the twilight window without seasonal cliché. The fountain bench becomes the charged spatial pivot where photograph object, pulse, and grandson converge—setting directly enables closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Leo receive the peace offered? Pressure escalates via pulse tempo—frantic → soft hum—under Accumulative lens; tightening is the cadence shift itself. Elias’s agency is translator, not decider, so cost is displaced onto Leo’s relief; protagonist risk remains abstract. Sufficient for short form, but the absence of any tool failure or personal toll keeps it shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silence-as-care: the dead speak in heart-rhythm, not advice, implying love is presence not performance. Subtext lives in the unheard syncope—Leo’s fear literally arrhythmia-ed until quieted. Final image of Elias receding into mist reweights “incidental heroism” as unnoticed service; no moralizing line breaks the spell. Deduction for faint echo of “vulnerable voices” prompt language in line 1.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric, elevated register fits the cathedral-atrium scale; diction stays within Elias’s technician metaphor family—“circuit,” “receiver,” “frequency.” Rhythm mirrors content—long sentences swell, then shorten as pulse calms. No dialogue clutter; single spoken exchange carries subtext of disbelief vs. recognition. Perceptual signature is consistent: sound-first, then visual—maintains occupational bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; strategic repetition (“reeling hush”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Metaphors are spare and coherent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the only tool he needed” + “the only sound” echo same opener; not severe enough to dull closure. One paraphrase loop: “a technician of sorrow and his job was to close the circuit” could compress, but at 759 words the density is otherwise high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise splice—“contact tracer for hearts” via obsolete hearing aid—is fresh, integrating tech nostalgia with spiritual medium trope. The photograph as living EKG is an inventive re-price. Risk of preciousness is averted by concrete acoustic mechanics. Could swap “grandson” with any relative, so freshness is concept-level, not character-level—hence stops at 8.0.</comment>
