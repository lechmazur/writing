<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Xylar’s ache is evoked through concrete nebula imagery rather than labels; the gear-handling beat crystallizes its flaw—seeking a calculable escape from feeling. The final broadcast is earned because the earlier empathy-sonar has already been dramatized as both perception and wound. Slight abstraction in “inherited sorrow” keeps it from 9-band, but interior contradiction and embodied reaction remain consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the instant Xylar flips sonar from map-making to gift-giving, the premise reweights—light becomes transmission, not resource. Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore linkage of sensing → discovering gear → rejecting calculation → emitting empathy, each step narrowing options. Cost is palpable in the release of the ancestor’s metal logic and the open-ended expenditure of self that follows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nebula garden is more than postcard: hydrogen veils and falling-petal light-motes constrain visibility and timing, shaping the sonar method. The gear’s impossible solidity against the gaseous backdrop supplies the micro-setting prop that forces the conceptual pivot. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold nullity versus swirling color—mirrors the emotional shift from scarcity to emission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the sacrifice cycle—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the gear proves calculation bankrupt. One meaningful deepening: “light wasn’t a resource… it was an emission” reweights the core conflict from logistics to gift. Agency remains Xylar’s throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension, only the renunciation of the mechanical path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the futility of routing love like cargo vs. the efficacy of simply radiating it. Gear/sonar dualism reconfigures at closure—metal silence vs. felt pulse—offering resonant non-literal answer to “how to share light.” No moralizing; the final image of garden beginning to bloom is charged poise that invites reflection on transmission versus consumption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is cosmic-sentimental yet precise: “gossamer veils of hydrogen and helium” keeps the diction within Xylar’s expanded lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for drift, staccato “ping” repetitions for search beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to Xylar’s empathy-sense. Filter verbs (“Xylar perceived”) are few and motivated by the alien sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, backstory, and causal nudge (“For eons… brilliant, hungry consumption”). Metaphors stay internally consistent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “the garden’s” phrases could trim, but artifacts never touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm swells naturally toward the final broadcast clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy-as-sonar repurposed from scout to gift is not a trope template. Calculating-machine-gear in a stellar nursery feels inevitable yet unforeseen, and its failure seeds the conceptual flip. Risk in cosmic-sentimental POV pays off by making the universe feel emotionally legible without anthropomorphic cliché. Specificity of “nebula garden” versus cold metal gives the conceit durable novelty.</comment>
