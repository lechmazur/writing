<question>1</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—dutiful archivist vs. truth-seeker—beats live in every tactile micro-choice (the gloved finger, the neck-craning readjustment). The coral stamp is not a prop but an extension of his perceptual bias; its texture grounds the final renunciation, paying the conceptual cost of silence. No stock phrasing, no epiphany label—just embodied stillness that forecloses the easy path of announcement.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: the blackout’s reclaimed stillness becomes the earned stasis of complicit silence, the coral stamp’s weight the visible price. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, each sensory drip, moss-glow, and salt-sealed drawer tightens the same stake—truth vs. systemic erasure—until the final image reindexes the entire archive. Causality is lyric but causally intact: because the stamp matches the ghost-mark, therefore Elias chooses complicit correction, not heroic exposure. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by sentence two.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The phosphorescent moss is not mere scenery—it is the only usable light source, forcing Elias to contort his body and read the stamp match; environment literally shapes tactics. The crystallized-sealed drawer’s shriek sacrilege is the micro-setting’s audible cost, mirroring the archive’s larger sealed lie. Saline-treated paper, kelp-vellum, and leviathan-hide bind the city’s drowned identity to the tactile truth Elias unearths. Spatial choreography is flawless: from dome drip to shelf-base moss to secretary desk, every object’s distance tracks.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover honest origin vs. preserve civic myth—tightens once, decisively: the stamp-match forecloses the option of believing the founder myth. Under Accumulative lens, each sensory Stillness accretes until the blackout itself becomes the pressure that makes silence actionable. Cost is visible: Elias forfeits heroic acclaim and accepts lifelong complicit labor; the coral stamp’s weight in his palm is the tangible price. No coincidence, no antagonist needed—the archive itself is the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: histories are palimpsests whose real authors can be glimpsed only in the negative space of stains and silence. The reclaimed stillness is not a metaphor stated but a lived reconfiguration—Elias’s quiet choice revalues every prior archive hour as collaborative erasure. Subtext breathes in gesture: the act of closing the tome without announcement is the moral climax. Final image offers conceptual repricing—silence itself becomes the first honest index entry.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elias’s tranquilly perceptive filter: “tranquilly perceptive” is not told but enacted in the steady, unsentenced noticing of condensation drip and moss glow. Syntax elongates and compresses with physical constraint—long clauses when he cranes, staccato when drawer shrieks. Diction stays within drowned-archivist lexicon: “cartouche,” “kelp-vellum,” “frond-symbol” feel organic, not glossary items. Zero head-hop; no POV leakage even at peak discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Prose rhythm mirrors the blackout’s hush: varied sentence lengths, no template cadence, no scaffold. Every line telescopes—salt-sealed drawer shriek carries sound, tactility, and metaphoric guilt in eight words. Figurative language is spare and precise: “ghost of an impression” is exact, not decorative. Zero loops, zero filter-verb stacks; information density peaks in the stamp-match beat without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The drowned library blackout as revelation engine feels inevitable yet fresh; no prior story couples archival silence with oceanic blackout to invert the heist trope into complicit stewardship. Leviathan-hide tome and coral stamp are not quirky ornaments but necessary forensic tools that could not be swapped. The quiet inversion—discovery leads to concealment—rejects heroic revelation cliché. Risk is embraced: silence ending in a silence that charges the entire preceding text.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Indexer’s vocation drives every beat—classification, posture, stamp comparison, final re-indexing vow. His tranquilly perceptive trait enables the micro-spot of the discoloration and the neck-craning workaround under blackout. Removing the indexing lens collapses the plot; the discovery is only legible through cataloguer’s gaze.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>9.7</grade>
<question>Introduced as query-marked artifact, handled in two active beats (drawer retrieval, moss-light comparison), reappears clutched in final image, its rough texture grounding the new lifelong task. Its spiral fronds reweight the entire archive as stolen goods. Irreplaceable—no other object could ghost-match the “water damage” and instigate the moral inversion.</question>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>9.4</question>
<question>Blackout’s literal silence is reclaimed by Elias as strategic cover; the stillness shifts from imposed outage to chosen complicity. Concept shapes his final stance—silence becomes the first honest index entry. Without it, the ending would default to noisy revelation cliché.</question>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>8.8</question>
<question>Trait enables the noticing of discoloration and the calm workaround of blackout constraints; same trait costs him the heroic role, forcing complicit endurance. Trait is dramatized, not labeled—shown in steady breathing, unflinching posture, and silent decision.</question>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>9.0</question>
<question>Neck-craning readjustment to moss-light is the pivotal beat that makes the stamp-match possible; physical contortion mirrors moral repositioning. Action is singular, non-swappable—without it, the ghost-mark stays unread and the story stalls.</question>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<question>Hypothesis is signaled early (“dissatisfied with that conclusion”) and its mechanics—stamp vs. discoloration—drive the single decisive test. Method turns curator lore into forensic tool, reframing centuries of attribution as theft.</question>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<question>Forgotten drawer and blackout-forced moss-light are micro-settings that supply the only workable tools; library’s vertical scale (dome drip 100 ft above) creates acoustic hush that enables silent vow. Setting actively withholds and grants revelation.</question>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.9</question>
<question>Blackout creates real-time clock—emergency biolamps flicker, condensation audible for first time—forcing Elias to exploit transient darkness before power returns. Time pressure is live, though less acute than a bomb timer.</question>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>9.2</question>
<question>Desire is dramatized in every beat—catalogue honesty vs. civic peace—and culminates in costly renunciation of acclaim. Motivation intersects with vocational identity; removing it voids the stakes entirely.</question>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>9.3</question>
<question>Dappled resolve is enacted via shifting light (biolamp shadows, moss glow) and internal modulation from doubt to clarified complicity. Tone charges the final image—silent clutch of coral stamp—turning quiet into ethical stance.</question>
