<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory calm/rage is continuously embodied (the statue body vs. screaming hurricane) and drives the micro-choices—winding the timer, refusing to open the envelope early, finally trembling. The scars motive is kept concrete through the photographer’s negative and the key. The shift from vigil to exit is credibly paid for by the hour of forced stillness, so the decision to leave carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: timetable hiding-place → timed vigil → key/negative → telescope lock → departure. The timer’s ping supplies the Decisive Change with audible cost; the negative’s silhouette and the key re-weight the past and future in one image. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no lens ambiguity. Closure is clean, no off-stage assists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory is sketched with cinematic economy—skull-dome, iron catwalk, dead-eye telescope—each detail later re-used (key fits the motor panel). Storm below is both vista and mirror, but never stalls action. Space is tracked cleanly; no floating bodies. Micro-setting (timer, negative) constrains the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he face the scars or stay suspended”—is signaled early. The one-hour timer creates a single tightening coil; options shrink to ‘open envelope or not’ until the external key forces the issue. Cost is visible: the trembling hands and the storm’s retreat both mark the price of ending the vigil. Agency remains Elias’s throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scars as lived cartography emerges through negative, timetable, key—no abstract lecture. Final image (city light through cloud-break) offers quiet CR: the map is forward, not backward. Theme stays implicit; no moralizing tagline. Storm-kissed wonder modulates into wary hope without flattening the moral ambiguity of his past “corrosive” art.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a poet’s perceptual signature: observatory as “skull holding a single stormlit thought,” timetable pages “obsolete as dead constellations.” Syntax mirrors mental state—compressed in vigil, elongating at exit. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with timer clicks. Register stays within a censored poet’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are dense but breathe—variation in sentence length, no template cadence. Metaphors are internally coherent (storm/vigil/darkroom) and paid off. No loops or synonym churn; “acid of his memories” is the only slightly stock phrase but is earned. High information-to-word ratio without purple drag. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combines vigil, obsolete bus route, darkroom timer, and observatory into an idiosyncratic whole; the timetable-as-map and undeveloped-negative-as-scar are fresh turns on familiar tropes. The “vigil in pause” concept is executed as literal timed detention that flips into mobility. Risky compressed lyricism stays legible under causal lens. Would fail if parts swapped.</comment>
