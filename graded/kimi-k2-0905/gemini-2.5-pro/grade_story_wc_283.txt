<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s monastic interiority is vivid—cataloging buttons as divination, trembling at the jar—yet the emotional contradiction (duty vs. rebellion) stays mostly stated, not embodied in a single fraught gesture. The final renunciation is earned by the causality of the chart and the silent voice, so the cost is legible; still, we never feel his body under the ticking sand, only the idea of pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: he refuses to flip the hourglass and steps into dawn, the rolled chart and stoppered jar the visible price. Causal lens holds throughout—each button parsed literally unscrambles the prophecy syllable-by-syllable—so the final fork is inevitable in hindsight. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is rendered through selective sensory filtration—gritty light, resin-caked windows, canyon shelves—each detail doubles as emotional filter and physical constraint (access to buttons = access to fate). The wooden toggle’s burn scar literally charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.Spatial choreography stays clean across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal agency versus collective doom—tightens exactly once: the moment the last grain falls and he walks past the clock, foreclosing reset. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the city’s time is now unmeasured, his role obsolete. Pressure is accumulative/textural; pattern break (silence after cacophony) reweights stakes rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: prophecy as editable text, history as compost of small disobediences. The button taxonomy recasts grand fatalism into intimate moral algebra; the final image of dawn outside the cliff-shadow offers a non-literal answer—time unmeasured is possibility reborn. No moralizing line mars the exit resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; diction (“whisper-thin trickle,” “monastic”) mirrors the hush of the warehouse. Rhythmic control peaks in the cascade of whispers and the single-voice resolution, pressure released in syntactic thinning. No head-hopping or register drift; perceptual signature is consistent antiquarian quiet.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—“canyon echo,” “knot of tangled history”—never stacks into purple. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory detail, world rule, and emotional tilt. Clean copy, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The hourglass-turner who unwrites prophecy by sorting lost buttons is a fresh synthesis; the canyon-echo jar literalizes oral history as reverbed sound. Risk is quiet—no pyrotechnics—but the conceptual flip (prophecy = comma, not period) feels inevitable once the toggle’s burn is placed. Specificity of button-intent taxonomy prevents swap with generic artifact.</comment>
