<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s guarded-charm façade and hidden desperation are palpable; the gourd-seed fondle and “raw steel” switch show earned layers. His final reckless-sacrifice turn, though, is announced more than psychologically built; we needed one earlier micro-choice demonstrating he’d risk civilians to foreshadow the mass-mind wipe he triggers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: wilting flower → census threat → greenhouse → orchid sabotage → cognitive blackout, each beat a crisp because/therefore. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city-wide silence is the undeniable new state, Kaelen’s smile the felt cost. Slight bump: the seed’s parasitic power is revealed very late, so the orchid plan feels outline-declared rather than pre-seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Community garden rows, glass-house steam, and the orchid’s “fleshy receptacle” are tactile, plot-functional, and bias-filtered through Kaelen’s scholar-perception. Spatial choreography stays clean across two locales; the greenhouse tools (fungi wall, orchid core) literally enable the climax. Tiny over-tease on “floral syntax” mechanics, but setting never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving untaxed thought—announced early and sharpened when readers learn roots are being decoded. Escalation is a single, decisive tightening: passive resistance → active cognitive sabotage with city-wide fallout. Legible cost in the sirens’ sudden silence and Aris’s fearful protests. Could use one intermediate obstacle beat to earn the jump to mass-mind disruption, but pressure stays coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of cognitive autonomy emerges through pollen-coded resistance and the orchid EMP, never sermonizes. Subtext thrives in Kaelen’s charm-as-weapon and the elderly woman’s “boiled cabbage” compliance. Final silence offers a resonant non-verbal answer to “what is a free thought worth?” without moral tag. Dock fraction for “stand guard over your own spark of defiance”—a near-thesis utterance that slightly overlays the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Kaelen, perceptual signature rich: “daggers wrapped in silk,” “bioluminescent fungi” read as his scholarly diction. Rhythm accelerates into staccato declarations under siren pressure; no filter-verb clog. Aris’s dialogue distinct but brief; no head-hop. One模板化 clause chain (“He moved … he pushed …”) is acceptable under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong verbs and sensory nouns propel every line; no scaffolding, no mixed metaphors. Figurative layering (“wilting sunflower was a period on a sentence”) stays controlled and image-driven. One paraphrase loop: “converging chaos was no longer approaching; it was here” essentially repeats. Otherwise, density and propulsion peak in the orchid-insert beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Taxable thoughts” + garden-steganography + biolum orchid mind-jam is a fresh, inevitable synthesis of SF and solarpunk. Conceptual risk—mass cognitive blackout as personal liberation—fully embraced, not hedged. Specificity of the chronophage-gourd seed makes the tech feel discovered, not contrived. Transformation test passes: plot collapses if any gimmick is swapped.</comment>
