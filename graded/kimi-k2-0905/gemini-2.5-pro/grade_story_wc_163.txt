<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s ache for “belonging” is concrete—he fondles the feather, maps geothermal pulses, stakes his last minutes on the light-jelly show. Elara’s arc from curt disbelief to tear-soft awe is visible in her reflection and single whispered line. The shared exhale crystallizes a new relational state with felt cost: the station is still dying, but they are no longer alone. Interiority stays specific to Kaelen’s astrologer lens; no stock labels, though “rhythm of belonging” flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the meadow of jellies reconfigures meaning—belonging is shared wonder, not location. Causal chain holds: Kaelen’s months-long mapping → timed energy pulse → jelly arrival → Elara’s stance shift; sunrise deadline tightens every beat. Cost is legible: the city still collapses, the sub will leave, the feather keeps its scar, but isolation fractures. Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Deep-sea pressure is lived-in—groaning bulkheads, equalized case, failing conduits—choices constrained by available power and viewport darkness. Micro-setting of the burnt feather in pocket anchors past fire against present abyss. Spatial choreography clear: corridor → dome → shared reflection → violet upper water. “Shadowseam wonder” tone modulates from dread to luminous hush without purple overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove belonging before sunrise”—is signaled early and tightens with each flickering conduit. One meaningful deepening: the jellies’ arrival turns abstract theory into shared visceral experience, foreclosing Elara’s cynicism and Kaelen’s exile. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (migration timing) complicates rather than solves. Cost visible: they gain connection yet still lose the city.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: bioluminescent migration reframes home as synchrony, not geography. Subtext lives in Elara’s reflection-softening and the unspoken pact of the exhale. Final image of violet water reweights the feather from anchor to suture—loss remains, but is shareable. Avoids sermon; “belonging” is felt, not defined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kaelen’s astrologer perception—geothermal “circulatory system,” jelly “meadow of stars.” Syntax lengthens under awe, then compresses at the exhale. Elara’s single whispered line carries maximal subtext; earlier curtness contrasts. No head-hopping; diction stays within Kaelen’s poetic yet plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene—short clauses during corridor walk, longer cadence at dome reveal. Figurative language is selective: “symphony of stressed metal,” “galaxy of bioluminescent life,” no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or relationship. “Shadowseam wonder” could feel mannered but is earned by prior darkness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Landscape astrologer” in abyss is fresh; pairing geothermal cadence with jelly migration creates specific synthesis. Feather relic recurs without checklist feel—handled twice, reweighted at end. Risk taken: climax is contemplative, not explosive, yet stakes feel absolute. Transformation test fails if moved to surface city—setting is integral.</comment>
