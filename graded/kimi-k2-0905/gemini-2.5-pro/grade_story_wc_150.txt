<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for lineage yet doubting the stories—are dramatized in her tactile, slow-motion handling of earth and stone; the embodied cost (blisters, fatigue) is visible. The final realization that departure itself is the legacy is earned by her prior micro-choices to wander, touch, and postpone violent excavation. The “hollowing” is shown via her hesitation to taste the fruit, not told. Only the mason’s presence dilutes the crucible; he is a neutral tool, not pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ship-carving reweights the premise—interruption becomes perpetual beginning—at exact moment stone meets sun. Causal lens holds: every beat (wandering, freeing sundial, hoisting) is a therefore-link that narrows meaning toward that image. Cost is legible in her blistered palms and the irreversible placement of the stone. Orientation anchor who/where is taught by word 38 (“catacomb orchard”); no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but antagonist: roots grip bones and tools, dictating tempo and forcing her gentle method. Micro-setting of the limestone disc—its underside carving—literally rewrites family myth. Sensory hierarchy obeys diaspora gaze: she smells “faint blossoms” but also notes “silver vein” on bone, outsider-insider tension etched into what she notices. Spatial choreography is clean; stone, root, and arch remain trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore faith in lineage—tightens when displaced sundial appears; freeing it becomes the single meaningful escalation. No external antagonist; pressure is orchard’s entanglement forcing slower tactics. Cost is paid in sweat, cracked fingernails, and the irreversible act of sealing the carving into place. Coincidence (finding disc) complicates but does not resolve; final meaning is her active reinterpretation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as inversion: exile is not truncation but perpetual launch. Subtext is carved, not spoken—ship pointing east beneath a timekeeping stone re-prices diaspora grief into forward motion. No moralizing; final paragraph merely lets weak sunlight hit the blank dial, inviting reader to feel the reweighting. Ambiguity lingers: she still doesn’t know the ancestor’s name, and that ignorance is accepted as part of the legacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Elara’s body and perception; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is precise—she notices mineral veins on clavicles and tastes soil air as “cautious enchantment.” Rhythm accelerates under root-prising strain via sentence fragmentation, then lengthens at the final lift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; free indirect style is clean (“she believed…”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is spare and purpose-driven: “silver vein slithering over bleached-white clavicle” fuses bone, metal, and tree in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; register remains within Elara’s plausible vocabulary. Opening and closing lines act as tonal brackets—root trace to sun strike—creating echo without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard concept feels freshly specific: roots braiding through bones reverses usual memento-mori trope into life-death symbiosis. Ship carved on underside of sundial reconfigures diaspora narrative from failure to eternal departure—an inversion earned by prior wandering method. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative design rather than twist; payoff is conceptual re-pricing rather than spectacle. Slight familiarity of “returnee restores faith” frame keeps it from 9.0 territory.</comment>
