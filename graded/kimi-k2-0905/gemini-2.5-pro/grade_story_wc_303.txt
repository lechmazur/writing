<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—career myth-maker vs. plant-touched truth-reader—is dramatized in concrete micro-choices: the hand that trembles on the cup, the knife that cuts the vine, not the violin. The final forfeiture (empire for a green stem) is legible and costly, yet the “mulberry ache” leans toward label-speak; the ache is repeatedly named rather than freshly embodied in the exit beat. Still, the hierarchy of values is visible and consistent. Voice remains coherent; emotional arithmetic stays slightly tidy but not enough to rupture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: plant vision → cracks imperial chart → therefore Elias propagates cutting and pens the heretical report, each step shrinking his future. Velvet observatory, coffee stain, and vine are kept physically present so closure image—the cutting in his palm—reconfigures destiny with felt cost. Time anchor (“before the Empress’s impending solstice address”) stays live, sharpening the urgency to act now. No causality breaks; the perforated destiny is literalized in the cracked porcelain lattice and paid for by exile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Refrigerated observatory air, velvet drape, and marble pedestal are used, not toured: the cold keeps the violin alive, the velvet blocks sky-light so the stain can be read. The vine cutting inherits the glacier memory and becomes the tactile future; environment thus constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-anchored (coffee bitterness vs. refrigerated chill). Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Micro-setting (the cup, the offshoot) charges the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—empire complicity vs. living truth—tightens once: the vine memory collapses the sanctioned origin story, forcing either silence or sabotage. Agency is decision, not duel; Elias’s single act of propagation forecloses imperial safety with on-page cost (the report left behind). Pressure stays causal; no coincidence rescues him. Escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word span; the perforated destiny visibly narrows to the single leaf-line in the cup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme—history as cultivated myth vs. living memory—emerges through the twin images of ice violin (sterile trophy) and moist green cutting (rooted future). Subtext lives in gesture: turning cup upside down to read fate == archaeologist flipping artifact to see hidden side. Final image answers the central question without moral exposition: he walks toward wild valleys carrying the real archive. No thematic echo sentences; the mulberry ache is the only near-label and it recurs enough to feel like tic, not insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic third-person intimate carries botanical precision (“leaves like dark green hands”) without purple overload. Perceptual signature—an Empire myth-keeper who tastes bitterness in coffee and sees constellations in sludge—stays consistent. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors are POV-plausible (“velvet as dark and deep as the midsummer sky”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens naturally under shock of plant contact. Cadence modulates: longer clauses for museum calm, staccato repeats for the perforated destiny.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>High information density: one sentence can stage setting, backstory, and emotional state (“His official task…polishes thrones for living”). Figurative language is selective, not carpet-bombed; no mixed metaphors. Minor template cadence in “the… the…” openings but not clustered in climax. Final line earns its lyric lift (“fertile pang of planting something true”) without overwriting. Clean grammar, pronoun clarity, no synonym loops observed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Frost-Lords tribute violin + plant-based lie detection is fresh synthesis; no prior echo in published canon detected. The coffee-stain astrology reframes a throwaway superstition into historiography tool. Conceptual risk: turning imperial star-chart into cracked, leaf-pierced porcelain makes abstract “perforated destiny” visceral. If names and geography were swapped, the core inversion—archivist betrays-archive-to-grow-vine—would still hold, but the specific ice-music relic and botanic telepathy feel inseparable here. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
