<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s grief-shocked interiority is vivid: “the sorrow was a formless, heavy water he could not cup” marries metaphor to embodied helplessness; the polishing ritual externalizes contradiction—he polishes to clarify memory yet risks erasing it. Despair and craft twine in every micro-choice, culminating in Earned Stasis: he keeps folding pain into cranes, the cost (lifetime labor) legible. No secondary character for status crucible, but single-POV depth compensates; only a hairline short of 9 because the final stance is crystallized rather than dramatized in an overt scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure delivers a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica dream flips grief from drowning sea to navigable current—conceptual cost indelible (“a part of him now”). Causal linkage holds: gem polishing ascends while memory plunges, each frictioned facet a because/therefore step toward the climactic projection. No orientation drift; setting anchors inside 120 words via floating tea garden. Persistent constraint: the cranes will never fly, a lifelong price shaping future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the mnemonic gem doubles as tool and world-rule tutor; its stardust adheres to fingers, grounding physics. Spatial choreography across crystalline stairs is impossible yet coherent within taught anti-gravity logic. Final image recharges lotus-lantern + gem pair, reweighting their meaning from unfinished craft to grief engine. Tea garden returns as promised future, fulfilling closure gate for 9-track.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—shape grief into bearable form—tightens with each ascending step and abrasive facet; visible price paid in raw knuckles & inhaled gem dust. One meaningful deepening: polished dream reframes loss as current rather than void, foreclosing suicide or denial options. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible; missing 9.0 only because escalation is incremental rather than a single decisive reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated images of light/lanterns inverted into sorrow-lenses; no abstract pronouncements. Subtext resides in unspoken promise broken by her shadow’s drift. Final crane fold offers conceptual repricing: beauty now inseparable from ache. Avoids sermon; could edge 9 if an earlier motif (bamboo frames) also reprised in last beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains lyrical compression: “descends while ascending” teaches paradox pattern early, paid off in mirrored descent. Perceptual signature—calloused fingers read memory in mineral—stays consistent. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests in rhythmic clause strings and artisanal diction (“washi paper, pearlescent”). Psychic distance tightens appropriately under peak dream projection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. High density: single sentences fuse motion, memory, metaphor (“folded his grief into a thousand origami cranes”). Occasional poetic uplift (“powdered starlight”) is earned by voice register, not purple. One near-loop: “each upward step a plunge deeper” echoes earlier ascent/descent—functional recurrence, not artifact. Closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inverts ascension trope into emotional excavation; anti-gravity archipelago fused with grief-recording gems feels novel yet inevitable. Specificity of lantern craft and gem-polishing replaces generic soul-journey. Dream playback at apex carries conceptual risk that pays off. Hair under 9 because core arc (pilgrimage to relive memory) is recognizable beneath fresh ornaments.</comment>
