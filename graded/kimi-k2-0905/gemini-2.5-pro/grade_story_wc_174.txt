<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s urbane-calligrapher persona is vividly embodied in early micro-gestures—fluid bend to retrieve the stick, brush-on-vellum recall—yet his contradictory impulses (serenity vs. vivisectionist doubt) are dramatized in real time, not summarized. The final decision to “reverse the trajectory” is foreshadowed by tactile re-examination of the carved alder, so the choice carries visible cost: he accepts Elara’s accusation as a constraint on future art. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak; even the metaphor “meteor hush” is filtered through his stargazer sensibility. Only the prior relationship with Elara is sketched off-stage, but that is within BRR allowance for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the campfire stick becomes a baton passed back to himself, crystallizing a new artistic stance that accepts narrative responsibility without abandoning ambiguity. Causal linkage holds: Elara’s absence → stick on floor → doubt → decision to stage a second puppet show that complicates the first. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts via recursive re-reading of carved symbols and memory of the hollow-eyed patron. Cost is legible in the final image—“point toward the dawn”—which promises sleepless labor and possible further failure. Orientation is anchored inside the dome by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome functions as a resonant micro-setting: its “meteor hush” and curved viewport externalize Kaelen’s internal after-collision silence while the polished concrete provides a literal stage for the stick prop. Sensory selection skews auditory and tactile—absolute quiet, traced notches—mirroring a calligrapher’s haptic bias. Spatial choreography is clean: stick on floor → bend → trunk → viewport stars, no impossible moves. The dome’s derelict tech history subtly reframes the ethical stakes of transmitting narratives into empty space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether subversive puppetry is vivisection or emancipation—tightens through the stick’s re-examination and the memory of the hollow-eyed patron; the single meaningful deepening is the decision to stage a reply show, which narrows options by committing time, reputation, and artistic identity to a public risk. No external antagonist is needed: internal ethical pressure suffices. Cost is visible in the final baton image—he forecloses the option of perpetual unaccountable provocation. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break (second show) reweights the stake from aesthetic purity to dialogic responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: narrative irresponsibility as a form of subtle violence. The half-lit epiphany motif is embodied, not labeled—puppet king’s silent fall, hollow-eyed patron, dawn suggestion—each image reframing what “enough light” means. Final image resists moral absolutes: dawn is only a “possibility,” preserving ambiguity while acknowledging obligation. No sermonizing paragraph; the stick’s symbol for abdication is repriced from cynicism to accountability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice carries a calligrapher’s tactile precision—“delicate dance of brush on vellum,” “perfectly rendered ideogram”—yet stays restrained, aligning with urbane serenity. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then shortens at the decision beat, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Register remains elevated but plausible for an artist who carves ideograms; no corporate drift. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“he felt the first tremor”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies gracefully; sentence openings rotate between prepositional, participial, and noun starts, avoiding drumbeat. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per high-pressure paragraph—so density never stalls momentum. No synonym loops or scaffold; “stick” is reused, not euphemism-churned. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, not explanatory. Minor tic: two “hush” variants within four lines, but the echo is purposeful, not unconscious.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Puppet-theater ethics in a derelict radar dome is a fresh synthesis; the stick as baton-to-self is a non-obvious reprise. Risk is taken—quiet ending, no blood—but coherence holds. Transformation test fails only if relocated to another art form, proving specificity. The hollow-eyed patron detail prevents this from being a purely cerebral exercise. Slight deduction for echoing “artist-as-vivisectionist” trope, though the puppet angle revitalizes it.</comment>
