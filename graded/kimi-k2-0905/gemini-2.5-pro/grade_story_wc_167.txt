<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Interiority is glass-specific and sensory—light-bending, salt texture, calloused hands—never abstract therapy-speak. The final renunciation is fully seeded by the pond-ripple epiphany and the decade-long obsession with static light; cost is visible in the dawn rainbow that atomizes his monument. Flaw: the “noctilucent reckonings” phrase drifts toward label-speak, momentarily loosening embodiment. Still, motivation, flaw, and change cohere under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s dissolution reweights the premise that value resides in permanence. Causal lens holds: because he understands transience via interference rings, therefore he refuses to save the atrium. The price is the structure itself—thousand-fold rainbow becoming vapor—felt on the page. Orientation anchors within 50 words; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Harbour, granite outcrop, brackish pond, and glass facets are filtered through glazier’s eye for refraction and angle; environment directly supplies the insight mechanism. The dawn fog and salt scent tighten the stakes by foreshadowing the bay’s reclaiming action. Micro-setting—the pond surface as dark mirror—constrains the method and charges the final image. One minor slip: “pearlescent glow” edges toward cliché, but it is immediately re-seen as vapor that will erase the atrium, so the cap stays north of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder vs. accept impermanence—tightens once: the interference pattern convinces him the atrium is built for a vanished world. Agency is internal (insight → renunciation) yet forecloses all external rescue options with visible cost: the rainbow blast itself. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative/textural under the lens. Could edge higher if a second, smaller cost (tool, coin, camaraderie) had been forfeited, but the single deepening suffices for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from glass physics: permanence is impossible because light and water never rest. Subtext is encoded in gesture—skipping stone, letting structure die—never sermonized. Final image re-prices value as seeing, not saving; ambiguity lingers (will he build transient works now?). No late thematic echo; the insight is earned in the pond moment, restated only by the silent rainbow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: sentences refract, syntactic angles vary, vocabulary stays within glazier’s lexicon (facet, geometry, vapor). No dialogue, so evaluation is rhythm and filter control; free indirect style is clean. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “felt”) are motive-driven, not hedging. Opening and closing lines book-end with light imagery that re-circulates meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long sentences for dawn hush, clipped fragments at ripple climax. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked; metaphors obey physical logic. Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or insight. One tiny scaffold: “a stone—not too large, not too small—” could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar “artist vs. impermanence” arc is refreshed through trade-specific detail: interference optics as epiphany engine, prism atrium as character rather than symbol. Risky quiet ending is handled cleanly; no twist grafted on. Synthesis feels inevitable: glazier + harbor + tide + optics = transience. Not groundbreaking, but specificity and causal integration lift it above template.</comment>
