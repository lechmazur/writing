<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The swallowed confession and need to measure guilt give the narrator clear, escalating motive that peaks in the final act of turning the valve. Interiority stays embodied—"gnawing anxiety," "cold dread," "crushing weight"—never sliding into diagnostic talk. Micro-choice (walking into the tunnel, grabbing the wheel) directly externalizes the internal contradiction: he both owns and denies responsibility. The earned exhaustion after closing the valve shows credible, physical cost, completing a clean, individual arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: confession → enters tunnel → hears clang → confronts wheel → shuts it, each beat a therefore linkage. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 20; no disorientation lingers. Closure—Decisive Change with cost: the ghosts quiet and narrator accepts lifelong weight, conveyed in the "bone-deep, earned exhaustion." Persistent constraint (he still carries guilt) shapes the final image and satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting details are sparse yet selective and POV-tinted: "rotted tie," "oily water," "weeping walls" surface only when they sharpen danger. Tunnel and submerged machinery constrain movement and supply the valve that drives climax. Sensory hierarchy tightens to sound (clang, hiss) under sleep-deprivation filter, mirroring drowsy alertness. Beaded valve wheel returns as micro-setting that literally and symbolically charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the measure of his guilt—tightens when the factory ghosts accuse; agency narrows to "solve" or be consumed. Escalation is singular but meaningful: the valve demands physical intervention that fuses external haunting with internal failure. Cost is visceral: metal groan, ragged breathing, permanent weight accepted. Coincidence (radio callers) complicates rather than resolves, keeping pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt-as-industrial-residue emerges through events, not exposition: ghosts replay a disaster, he replays his inaction. Final image revises the premise—guilt cannot be off-loaded, only carried. Subtext lives in gesture (wheel turning) and silence after clang stops. Resonant reconfiguration lands without moralizing, inviting reflection on complicity versus responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is cohesive, rhythmic, character-specific: short, tactile clauses mimic breath-holding exploration; hyphenated adjectives ("sleep-deprivation filter") feel like his engineer mind. Perceptual signature—radio chatter as rational tether—remains consistent and paid off when caller mirrors his predicament. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under fatigue. Compression ("drowsy alertness") is taught early and holds to final exhausted cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive; sentences multitask—"I clicked on my headlamp, its beam cutting a shaky circle in the absolute black, and began walking toward the sound" advances action, body, and mood. No loops, filter-stack, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into clipped clauses during wheel confrontation, then relaxes into longer fall-off, mirroring tension arc. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the beam/weight motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar haunted-industrial site is refreshed by welding the haunting to a psychic call-in show and making the protagonist’s task mechanical (close a valve) rather than exorcism. Synthesis of confession, radio interpretation, and industrial imprint feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (beaded condensation, oily foot-water) grounds the trope in lived detail. Risk—using late-night callers—pays off by externalizing internal blame, lifting score above mid-band.</comment>
