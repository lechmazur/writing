<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-riven paralysis is viscerally embodied—trembling hand, judge-and-jury compass. The interior contradiction—yearning for the sea while fearing he’ll repeat the shoal error—drives every beat. Micro-choice at the waterline (offering, not pocketing, the compass) crystallizes the hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interior voice stays salt-scarred and specific; no therapeutic self-labeling.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: compass held over dark water, the sea accepted as future judge. Causal chain intact—poles as penance → compass as verdict → shoreline as first breach in that penance. Utility-pole grid seeded early; final image reverses its certainty. Cost is felt: he has stepped off the gravel “crutch” with no guarantee, only the unreadable needle.</comment>

<comment>Salt-stink, bruised twilight, and lapping water are filtered through mariner senses—tide as accusation, horizon as jury. Micro-setting of the launch ramp (damp sand inches from boots) forces the final step. Compass brass and yellow kayak flash as charged objects inside the larger setting. Environmental mirroring is implicit: sky “bruised” matches his self-laceration without overt cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he face the sea again—signaled in para 1. Escalation is accretive: each sensory hit (laughing couple, phantom spray) tightens the noose until the compass becomes an offering, not shield. No external antagonist; pressure is memory and self-condemnation. One meaningful tightening at the final beat forecloses retreat without promising voyage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: navigation is not certainty but willingness to steer despite uneraseable error. Sea-as-mirror refracts from home to accuser to possible absolution without moral tag. Subtext carried in gesture—offering the compass rather than consulting it—rejects instrumental reason for exposed vulnerability. No final sermon; bruised sky and unread needle let ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s salt-bitten perceptual lens; diction (“phantom helm,” “keel broken on the shores of what should have been”) is navigator-poetic yet precise. Rhythm breathes with surf—long sentence swell, then short punctuations of fear. No dialogue, hence no voice leakage. Filter verbs rare and justified; brass “winking” is active embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors tidal drag and release; clauses lengthen toward horizon, then cut short on gravel thud. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—sea & sky & navigation metaphors sustain coherence; no mixed vehicles. Information dual-load frequent: “soft thud on the gravel a sound of finality” advances action + stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds salt, guilt, or spatial data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: the navigator ruined by a one-degree calculation he never personally steered—guilt via coordinate ghost ship. Utility-pole penance and compass-as-judge invert typical redemption arcs. Final image of unread needle over black water avoids tidy catharsis. Specific maritime detail (astronomical compass, shoals, recalculation) grounds novelty in lived craft.</comment>
