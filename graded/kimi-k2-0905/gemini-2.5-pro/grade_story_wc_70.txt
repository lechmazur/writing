<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's compulsive truthfulness is vividly dramatized; the refusal to hand over the lacquer box’s contents anchors his “preserve wonder” creed in a costly micro-choice. Lena remains slightly more functional than individuated, but her exhaustion and the moment of poetic comprehension land. Interiority is concrete; no label-speak. The final nod carries earned stasis: he keeps the box closed, accepting perpetual outsider status. A hairline slip: we never see Silas privately doubt or resent his affliction under pressure, so the depth stops just short of 9 territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Silas cannot lie, therefore he must plant a riddle; because the city sterilized wonder, therefore the drones starved. One graceful shard—Lena arrives, leaves—keeps chronology intact. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lacquer box stays shut, reweighting the city’s rule-set at the cost of continued blackout. Cost is legible in the humming dark that frames his final nod; the reader feels the price of wonder preserved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lightning tower is not backdrop but live resource—rationed watts arc overhead while citizens queue, forcingSilas’s rationing choice. Ozone-sweet dusk and sun-bleed pollen compress the city’s sensory collapse into one inhalation. Spatial choreography is pristine: booth, window, box, tower axis never drift. The lacquer box serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Only micro-gap: no tactile description of the box’s weight in hand, a missed haptic beat that could have charged the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can wonder survive routine?—tightens when the riddle forces Lena to re-enchant the drones instead of rebooting code. The matchbox/hand-off beat is the visible escalation that forecloses an easy data dump. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the city remains powerless because Silas will not commodify truth. A slightly higher score awaits if the towershown lightning actually scorched a bystander or cost Silas his job; as is, the price is felt but not bodily registered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without once stating “art vs efficiency.” The riddle’s coup de grâce—What cold routine has sealed my tomb?—re-prices the entire premise. No moralizing coda; the city’s future is left dark and possibly re-enchanted. Counter-reading allowed: Silas’s romantic intransigence perpetuates suffering. Earned wisdom via concrete particulars, not aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Silas’s shoulder, filtering dusk through ozone and lacquer gleam—perceptual signature is consistent. Diction stays inside his lexicon: “syrupy, nectar dusk” reads as his sensuous defiance of sterile jargon. No dialogue over-articulate; Lena’s lines are worn thin, functional. Rhythm climbs and subsides with the matchbox reveal, no drumbeat templates. One hairline slip: “tasting of ozone and the last of the day’s pollen” edges toward tourism, but forgiven because taste is the story’s first sensory hook.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences pull double duty: “the last rays of sun bleed across the sky, a syrupy, nectar dusk” layers visual, taste, and metaphor in one breath. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—storm-drinking, sun-spun glass—within bio-mechanical logic. Opening and closing lines are symmetrical without feeling engineered. Proofing clean; pronoun and prop state stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Bio-mechanical pollinators starved by optimized boredom is a fresh synthesis; the lacquer box as poetry-grenade weaponizes wonder rather than data. Risk taken: entire blackout left unresolved, but coherence holds. Could edge higher if drone-lore hinted earlier, yet the late reveal is justified by Silas’s secrecy. Avoids safety middle; commits fully to romantic intransigence.</comment>
