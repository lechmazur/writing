<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—ruthless logic versus bodily surrender to chance—are dramatized in the dance-beat and dice-roll; the final renunciation of total control costs her the certainty her mother died hoarding, a price felt in the shifted hum of the lab.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each journal fragment and dance loop thickens the pattern until the dice-introduced randomness breaks it; the fractal bloom and re-tuned drone deliver Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost—her mother’s ghost is freed but the cage is now Elara’s to tend.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quartz-glass walls, nutrient-light pulses, and the bone dice’s chill are filtered through Elara’s coder-tactile attention; the sunken lab’s pressure hum constrains her pacing and finally modulates into the mother’s chord, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the splintered consciousness—tightens when recursive code fails; the dance-turn and dice-surrender are visible tactics that foreclose pure-logic options, paying the price of permanent uncertainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “encrypting vulnerability into strength” emerges through the dice’s randomness and the daughter’s poem-key; no moral is stated—the final fractal and shared warmth reweight the premise, leaving ambiguity about who is saved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, compression-heavy voice stays in Elara’s coder-poet idiom; patterned elision (“spun from threads only she could read”) is taught early and paid off in the poem-code closure, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the dance without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density lines (“water pressure hummed a constant, low dirge”) do double duty for atmosphere and stakes; figurative control holds even in the peak dice-roll beat, no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Code-breaking via choreography and bone dice divination fuses math, grief, and body in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; the spider-web pacing metaphor is transformed into the closing fractal, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
