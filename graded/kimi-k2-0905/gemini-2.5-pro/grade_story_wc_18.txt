<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scientific craftswoman confronting her own grief through sympathetic magic—rings true; her embodied emotion (the frozen tear) and micro-choice to breathe onto the glass ground every beat. The broken sextant handled twice and the final grip of its cold metal give visible cost to her renunciation, earning the 9- gate. Small slip: “steady hand and focused heart” edges toward label-speak; stay inside concrete sensation.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mirror empties, the frost mountains collapse, and she pockets the sextant—conceptual cost legible in the shard-glitter and the new map she can now “read.” Accumulative lens holds; each breath adds frost density until pattern crystallizes, then shatters. No causal gaps; broken instrument, stump, fog, and breathing chain cleanly. Orientation anchored within first 90 words; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fog-ruined orchard, petrified stump, and frost-rimmed branches function as micro-setting that actively guides ritual placement and later shards underfoot, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys glass-maker’s eye: she notes silver filigree on branches, obsidian mirror surface, brass snap in sextant. Spatial choreography coherent across mirror placement and retrieval. Environment constrains choice—mirror must be level, air must be still—meeting 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve/re-create the lunar dream—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each breath deposits ice until impossible glass mountains bloom; failure line appears and erases them, tightening cost. Agency remains hers; no external rescue. Price paid is the irreversible shatter and the tear she loses; options narrow to “map she now knows how to read,” satisfying 8-band test.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from mirror/ice reversibility: boundaries dissolve between self and world, memory and matter, breath and starlight. Final image reweights premise—dream is not retrieved but translated into a personal cartography, resisting moral tag. Subtext lives in gesture: sextant pointed at mirror instead of sky, quietly declaring science made sympathetically porous. No late articulation of thesis, so resonance lands clean.</question>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice carries artisan precision: “silver filigree tracing dead apple branches,” “glass mountains” echo craft lexis. Perceptual signature—her eye tracks reflectivity, curvature, fracture—holds throughout. Compression in final breaths tightens rhythm under pressure without head-hop. No dialogue, so no convergence issue; interior syntax remains glass-smooth and character-bound, meeting 9- threshold.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft shows high-density layering: single sentence often handles tool detail, sensory body, and atmospheric tilt. Varied sentence rhythm avoids algorithmic patterns; paragraph cuts land on image pivot. No mixed metaphors; “fracture line thin as spider’s thread” stays inside physical logic. Occasional Latinate loft (“lattice of frozen breath”) barely nicks register but does not stall beat; closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Conceptual twist—astronomy by exhalation rather than observation—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesizes breath, mirror-craft, and orphaned ambition into one ritual. Frost-grown lunar highlands literalize an intangible memory without slipping into whimsy. Transformation test: swap glass-maker for potter and entire beat sequence collapses; specificity anchors originality.</comment>
