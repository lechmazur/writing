<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific to the keeper’s eroded psyche; the contradictory pull between duty and self-preservation is felt in the trembling hand on the swan. No secondary character appears, so relational crucible is N/A. The final renunciation—suspending purpose beside the star-river—carries visible cost in the acknowledged “temporary” peace, earning Earned Stasis. Minor withhold: the moment the keeper decides to burrow is slightly under-dramatized, a summary glide rather than a micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the keeper sits in stillness while the obsidian refuge and silent river re-weight every prior echo, the cost felt in the phrase “the peace would crumble again.” The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held to the final image; each sensory layer thickens until the silence becomes palpable. Causality is intact: the swan-fold triggers the burrow, the river triggers the release, the return is implicitly inevitable. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Black-sand bank, glass monolith, and star-river are not backdrop but active constraints: the river parts with predestined calm, denying splash or sound, forcing the keeper into passive witness. The origami swan functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid, its creases literally re-shaping space. Sensory hierarchy mirrors erosion—sight narrowed to light motes, hearing vacuumed, touch softened by paper cloth. Environmental specificity charges the final image: the obsidian’s light-absorbing face becomes the visible cost of erased memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—mental survival versus archival obligation—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through sonic hallucinations. One meaningful deepening: the Aeridor chronicle loops until the keeper’s grip on reality frays, forcing the burrow. Escalation is textural: each setting layer strips agency further—library folds, river silences, obsidian erases—until only witness remains. Price is unmistakable: the keeper concedes the peace is temporary, foreclosing delusion of permanent escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as parasitic burden, silence as non-negotiable resource. The star-river’s mute flow re-prices the entire concept of record-keeping—stories become disposable light motes. Subtext resides in gesture: the swan’s soft paper versus volcanic glass—fragility housing escape, permanence housing oblivion. Final image offers conceptual repricing: stillness is not absence but consumable commodity, finite and already leaking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a dusty, archaic register without slipping into mock-antique; syntax lengthens and contracts like breath during fold-transition. Perceptual signature is keeper-specific: “dust of ages was the only air fit to breathe” fuses body and archive. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Pattern-taught compression—“the library folded in on itself”—is legible and paid off by the quiet settling on the bank.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from fungal glow to monosyllabic shard; no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence slips library, catacombs, fungi, keeper role. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure, avoiding artifact. Minor loop: “silence was not an absence but a presence” echoes prior negation cadence; does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—memory-keeper who erases self to survive own archives—is fresh synthesis of existing tropes. Obsidian refuge as anti-mirror, star-river as mute story-debris: these images are specific, not quirky ornament. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—pays off in reweighted final silence. Could not swap elements without collapsing the conceptual engine.</comment>
