<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s grief-borne obsession is viscerally embodied in the worn tapestry and in the way he “clutches” and “aligns” it; the interior contradiction between arsonist past and curator future is alive in the final beat. The sister’s absence is made present through the trail of mole-carving, pin-pricked stars—each a micro-choice that re-weights his stake. The shift from torch to brush is earned, costly, and crystallizes his identity. No secondary characters appear, so relationship bullets are waived; the arc is solo but fully credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he burned the lie, he is exiled; because he is exiled, he can find her trail; because he finds the slash, he must finish her counter-vandalism. The tapestry-as-lens is set up in the first third and pays off in the final beat, satisfying closure with conceptual cost: he forfeits anonymity and accepts lifelong curatorship. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“Xylos Archive”). No lens ambiguity or telegraphing of twists; every object (mole, constellation map, easel) is因果 planted before it acts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archive is not backdrop but tool: the fissure-window angles sunlight, the pressure-plate mosaic is literally stepped on, the petrified-paper scent narrows perception to dust and time. Micro-setting is charged: the tapestry fragment doubles as map and lens, constraining the final revelation. Spatial choreography is clean—he “moves deeper,” kneels at the easel, holds cloth to window—no floating bodies. One minor over-adjective (“dust-choked silence”) but overall economy drives atmosphere rather than stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Elara’s erased voice—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the slash is revealed to be canvas. One meaningful turn: the slash flips from violation to medium, forcing him from vengeance to curation; the cost is visible—he abandons the safety of oblivion. Agency is internal but active: aligning tapestry, deciding to paint. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues him. Escalation is single but decisive, sufficient for 700-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emergent theme—art can weaponize its own erasure—arises from the vandalized portrait repurposed as palimpsest. Subtext beats sermon: the initials carved in the frame speak louder than any essay on plagiarism. Final image of “quiet, enduring fire in the dark” reweights the opening arson into generative flame without moralizing. Complexity is honored: the world that erased Elara remains unjust; Kaelen’s act is repair, not redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Kaelen; perceptual signature is analytical (“almost imperceptible shifts”) yet tender (“threads worn smooth as worry stones”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under rage—“Rage, hot and familiar, coiled...” No dialogue, so voice is carried by filtered perception and metaphor. Free indirect cleanly blends “he remembered” with sensory immediacy; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Varied rhythm mirrors breath: long sentence for descent, staccato for detonation. Information density high—“star-nosed mole... claws shaped with her characteristic impatience” packs world, artist-hand, and clue in one clause. Metaphors stay consistent (volcanic, cosmic, archival) and never mix violently. Zero loops, no scaffold; “dust-choked silence” is the only stock phrasing but is forgiven in opening anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arson-librarian turned curator in a necropolis archive, using vandalism-as-palette. Trail-of-art-clues reverses detective genre into elegy. Specific detail—tapestry weave as star-map lens—feels inevitable yet new. Risk taken: no living antagonist, yet stakes stay intimate and large.</comment>
