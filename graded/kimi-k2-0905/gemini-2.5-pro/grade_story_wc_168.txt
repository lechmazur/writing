<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s contradictory tenderness toward the box and the rookies is dramatized in the arm/shoulder pivot that costs his face; Kaelen’s mute reach mirrors it. Interiority stays concrete—“the topography of his pain”—never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: porcelain > own flesh. No safety-hedging: he owns the “stupid choice.” Earned stasis lands cleanly: the cracked relic stays his, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of the box thickens the cost strata until the final crystallization. Orientation anchored by word 32 (“granite spine of the ridge”). Closure is Charged Poise: Kaelen’s finger on the fissure reconfigures both their stances; cost is the unreturnable box and the irreversible scar. Causal chain intact: fire memory → scar → box refusal → silence understood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Moonlight acts as micro-setting: it silver-plates the pines and the porcelain, guiding attention to fracture lines that decide the fall. Ridge path constrains escape routes metaphorically—no place to flee the story’s price. Satellite “indifferent path” mirrors the girl’s later refusal, charging final image. Body-as-setting: scarred arm serves as lived topography the rookies must navigate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what it costs”—tightens when the box is refused; option of returning innocence is foreclosed. Single meaningful intensification: the floor-giving moment crystallizes the bargain. Price is visceral: beam-to-face, box cracked, belief lost. No reversal needed; pressure plateaus then hardens into stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the porcelain’s fracture pattern rather than declaration. Subtext lives in gesture: Kaelen’s silent finger-trace replaces moral. Final image answers “what does innocence cost?” with the cracked object itself—no sermon. Complexity intact: the girl’s refusal keeps guilt alive in Elias, unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; no leakage. Diction—“house screaming,” “slow dance of celestial bodies”—bears his firefighter-poet tongue. Syntax lengthens during memory, shortens on ridge, mirroring breath. Dialogue sparse, subtextual: “Bargained innocence” spoken once, carries full weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no filter-verb stacks. Figurative layers serve pattern: porcelain web = scar map. “Tributary carved by flashover” compresses geology and electricity in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with the stars’ procession; final sentence lands on monosyllabic closure: “price willingly paid.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Firefighter-as-mentor is familiar, yet the cracked keepsake as map for rookies freshens it. Risk taken: entire climax delivered in retrospective monologue; payoff is the rookies’ tactile acceptance. Specific detail—porcelain box, ridge under Perseids—roots universals in irreplaceable objects. Transformation test: swap box for generic medal and story collapses.</comment>
