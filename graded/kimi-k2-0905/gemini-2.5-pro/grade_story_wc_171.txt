<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his fingers cool on the clipboard, his voice “operatively gentle”—and his contradictory impulse to ritualize politics instead of argue it is dramatized in scene. The micro-choice to scrape dust and draw the sigil is a visible, costly concession to mysticism that forecloses his rational posture. The generals remain granite masks, yet their tremor and surrender are credibly rooted in war-weariness Elias gambles on. Closure is earned: his earlier exhaustion bet pays off when both enemies sign, foreclosing war at personal cost of credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because Elias reframes peace as ritual, therefore the generals’ fatigue is weaponized into signatures. Each beat tightens options—appeal to history, celestial cue, dust sigil—until only signing remains. Orientation is anchored within 120 words: terrace, twin moons, clipboard, century convergence. Closure is Decisive Change with felt cost: moons’ “unified light” dramatizes the irreversible political shift cemented by dust and ink.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cracked marble, night-blooming jasmine, and interlocking-moonlight are selectively filtered through Elias’s ritual agenda; every sensory note advances persuasion rather than decorates. The terrace’s physical decay—moss-filled cracks—supplies the literal dust that becomes the treaty’s sealing medium, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean: clipboard passage, dust tracing, stylus hand-off track without drift. Weather and celestial mechanics serve as live clock, tightening decision window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ending the Forever War—signaled in paragraph one. Single meaningful tightening: shift from abstract treaty to dust-and-moon ritual that narrows refusers’ exits. Agency is Elias’s; coincidence (celestial alignment) complicates timing but does not resolve—signatures are human, not astrological. Cost legible: generals surrender decades of hatred in public act that cannot be retracted without shaming ancestors.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Redemption through humbling ritual emerges via the dust sigil and Weeping Conjunction rather than authorial sermon. Subtext lives in silence: Kaelen’s tremor, Vorlag’s grunt carry more thematic weight than dialogue. Final image reweights marble dust from decay to covenant, achieving conceptual repricing without moralizing. Complexity preserved: peace is fragile, hatred only dormant, not erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual lens; no head-hop. Syntax—“operative gentleness,” “midwife a peace”—carries strategist cadence. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for persuasion, staccato fragments at sigil moment. Filter verbs absent; perception concrete. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when Vorlag’s grunt replaces speech. No register drift; diction stays within war-weary diplomat range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “marble beneath his worn boots cracked like a shattered promise” performs metaphor, anchors setting, and foreshadows treaty fragility in one stroke. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing sentences mirror with “dust” and “light,” creating purposeful echo. One minor adverbial cluster—“slowly drew nearer”—but cadence demands slack; does not obscure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar peace-conference trope is refreshed by ritual midwifing via astronomical dust rather than rhetoric. Celestial mechanics and archaeological sigil feel specific to this world, not generic fantasy furniture. Risk—letting antagonists stay stone-faced—pays off when smallest gestures (tremor, grunt) suffice. Could swap names without breaking arc, but dust-as-ink device is non-obvious and inseparable from climax.</comment>
