<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is present ("faith a fragile shield") yet stays generic; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. Kaelen's cynicism is declared, not embodied. The climactic "true, untroubled smile" arrives without prior emotional contradiction or visible cost, so the change feels mild. Relationships are sketched as found-family shorthand rather than pressure-forced choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: each chalk message → discovery → tactic change. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harmonic hum instantly flattens the magnetosphere and gifts a flight path—cost is conceptual (they leave the ghost behind) rather than embodied, keeping it shy of 9. No causality breaks or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dust that "tasted like rust and regret," floating rock arches, and the seized bronze bell are tactile, selective, and filter through survivor priorities. The bell’s silence and eventual resonance reweight the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent during the arch climb. A couple of tourist-catalog lines ("immense, silent rock arches") slightly dilute economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape via safe corridor—is signaled early and tightened by each chalk directive. Protagonist agency is collective rather than singular, but the climb-and-strike beat visibly narrows options and produces the resonant payoff. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the guardian planet) not personal/physical, capping entry to 8-band. Escalation is linear, not deepened by a secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of "brambled hope" emerges from orchard imagery and the mute bell that still resonates, avoiding explicit moral. The final "Go home" reweights prior material without sermon. Complexity is moderate—hope remains mostly affirmative rather than morally ambiguous—so resonance is solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice keeps a controlled distance, with occasional lyrical upticks ("symphony of desperation and trust"). No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to Elara’s perception. Diction remains within survivor lexicon; dialogue is minimal but natural. Rhythm modulates slightly; more sentence-level music could boost higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density, and largely free of scaffold; only minor template cadence in "They had already… they followed…" type strings. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. A few adjective clusters ("immense, silent rock arches") could be tighter. Closure line is crisp and image-driven. Overall clean with minor hairline slips.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Altruistic ghost-as-guide and a bell-as-tuning-fork are fresh syntheses within the stranded-colony trope. The chalk-message mechanic and magnetosphere resonance feel non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Could push further into moral ambiguity or survivor flaws for higher distinction. Voice and world retain memorable particularity.</comment>
