<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s affectionate skepticism is cleanly dramatized through the somatic-marker experiment; every light-stroke choice externalizes his shifting interior. Lena’s belief is similarly embodied—tears, breath-catch—so both arcs stay tactile. The closing hand-clasp crystallizes a mutual reconfiguration that costs Elias his last easy doubt; the pulse he feels is the earned price. Only a trace of “therapeutic” self-label keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he doubts but loves, therefore he designs the body-test; because the first image maps grief, therefore he risks a second; because the second maps love, therefore clasp. Each beat narrows his options until shared pulse forecloses solitary skepticism. Cost is legible in the final line—“their own perfect, irrefutable language”—where “irrefutable” itself is the price he pays.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The studio’s cavernous dark is immediate and functional: it erases visual confirmation so somatic attention must take over, weaponizing the setting. Camera remote, LED wands, and muscovite sliver are micro-settings that constrain every move. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, lights, and shutter clicks track cleanly. Only the geode’s literal presence at the end could have carried slightly more sensory weight to hit 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can shared feeling be proven—tightens through two on-stage tests whose failure would leave Lena isolated. Each light-painting attempt escalates risk: first accidental grief-match, second deliberate love-exposure, both with visible emotional price. Agency sits with Elias throughout; coincidence is nil. The clasp is not a solution but a foreclosing of his former safe distance, satisfying cost requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: intimacy as negotiated private language rather than telepathic miracle. The geode’s layered shimmer and the light-web’s fractal precision reweight the same idea—truth is laminated, not singular. No moral is stated; the final pulse against pulse is the resonant non-literal answer. A hairline slip toward explicitness in “they had found their signal” barely keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person stays latched to Elias’s perceptual bias—measured, physical, slightly detached—without ever leaking into Lena’s head. Syntax lengthens during the flowing spiral to mimic warmth, shortens during the brittle grief-web, proving rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (“Always”). One clause of clinical diction—“somatic markers”—is motivated by his experimental mindset and forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative choices (“spun glass,” “shattering ice”) are sparse, apt, and never mixed. Strong verbs—“lunged,” “slashed,” “blossoming”—propel without adverb clutter. Final line lands clean, no scaffolding, earning the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Takes the hoax of telepathy-pill folklore and reframes it as bodily semaphore, a fresh synthesis. The muscovite sliver—fragile, layered, translucent—becomes a literal lens that refracts both light and belief, an object impossible to swap out without collapsing the metaphor. Risk is taken: no antagonist, no twist, just two people in the dark proving tenderness; the gamble pays off. Specificity of method and image makes the concept feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
