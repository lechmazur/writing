<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession—mapping what walls “dream”—is vivid and embodied; her gentle handling of the scorched journals shows a hierarchy of values. Yet her interior contradiction (curiosity vs. the vow to leave the burden behind) is told rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice; the final renunciation is credible but cost is more conceptual than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the “burden of knowing” is left in the hearth, reweighting her prior maps. Causal chain holds: discovery of Prometheus → recognition of active harm → refusal to carry it. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early, cadence deepens, final image recharges. Cost is legible in the wave-form notation and the deliberate act of re-burial.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ivy-veined passage and soot-black hearth are tactile, olfactory, and constraining: the crumbling wall literally grants access to the secret. Micro-setting—the film strip held to a sunbeam—becomes the pivot where light reveals the molecular curse. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment is not static background but the very conduit of discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether knowledge itself is too poisonous to keep—tightens once the Prometheus formula is glimpsed. Escalation is textural: each scorched page increases the density of guilt until Elara’s only option is renunciation. Agency is present in the final act of re-insertion; cost is the forfeiture of potential absolution. Pressure is coherent but single-wave; no secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge as contagion, not salvation. The re-weighting of “seed of hope” into “contagion for the sky” is earned through the scientist’s fractured chronicle rather than authorial assertion. Final image of the wave-form labeled “a burden of knowing” offers resonant non-verbal answer. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether anyone else will ever hear the echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>POV is tight third with consistent perceptual signature: Elara’s hearing is “sensitively perceptive,” filtering every detail through acoustic bias. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, never drumming; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“acoustics,” “frequency”) without academic drift. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hop. Voice modulates from hush to chill without breaking texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, multi-tasking: “The walls here hummed with a low, persistent frequency of anxiety” fuses setting, metaphor, and character perception in one stroke. No scaffold or synonym loops; figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“legacy’s burden”). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propel momentum. Zero artifacts in closure beat; clarity never wavers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—echo-cartographer of post-climate ruins—is fresh and specific; the profession is not gimmick but lens. Trope of scientist’s fatal hubris is inverted: the journals reveal active accelerant, not mere failure. Molecular diagram as death-mask feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky quiet ending is earned; no retreat into safety. Particularity of “corridor echo cartography” resists transplant to any other story.</comment>
