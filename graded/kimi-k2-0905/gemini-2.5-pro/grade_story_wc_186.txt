<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—retrocognitive gift as curse vs library—grounds every micro-choice; the shard-handling beat embodies grief and hope at once. The final press costs him the comforting myth of randomness, a legible renunciation. Only the father-label “curse” flirts with diagnostic speak, not enough to dent the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each star-track calculation is a because/therefore that narrows to the keystone insertion. The closure is a Decisive Change—silence → pulse—paid for by the swallowed loneliness of generations, visible in the misted breath. Orientation anchors within 60 words; no teleporting props or knowledge cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pavilion dome operates as both telescope and crucible, constraining the exact angle of final insertion; shard-light interaction is tracked through tactile glass-polish and lavender beam. Bruised twilight and star-lanes are filtered via Elian’s cartographer gaze, never touristic. Micro-setting (velvet cloth, thumb-sized facet) charges the closing image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove pattern inside collapse—tightens when the once-a-century Cygnus conjunction forecloses delay; the shard’s hush intensifies stakes by swallowing echo, a felt price. Escalation is single-curve yet sufficient: each charted star alignment removes the option to wait another lifetime. No reversal, but the narrowing is causal and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—meaning wrested from ruin—emerges through the prism’s refraction of starlight into lavender pulse, not statement. The cosmic map reconfigures catastrophe as invitation, a Conceptual Repricing paid for by Elian’s acceptance of perpetual loneliness. No moralizing; the thistle-seed image carries the cost without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited remains locked to Elian’s perceptual signature: glass hum heard only in memory, starlanes read as “winter sky” not astronomy text. Syntax lengthens under starlight, then fractures into short clauses at shard insertion, mirroring tension. No head-hop; diction stays within custodian lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose breathes with scene: polysyndeton during assembly, then clipped release at click of shard. Figurative layer is spare—only “bruised twilight” and “thistle seed”—each pays off in closure image. No loops, no filter stacks; lavender beam lands clean. One near-miss: “world-ending quiet” skirts hyperbole but is earned by prior collapse vision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon-relight is familiar, yet retrocognition as star-map archaeology feels fresh; the shard of hush reverses the usual noise-into-silence trope. Collapse-pattern-as-constellation reframes disaster into instruction, a risk that pays off causally. Specificity of Cygnus Rift timing prevents generic stargazing.</comment>
