<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (“discover meaning in the mess”) stays visible, but interiority drifts into airy lyric labels (“lilac unease,” “soundless scream”) rather than embodied contradiction. The mandala act is a credible renunciation of verbal agency, yet the moment of cost—knees gritty, communal gaze—reads more symbolic than personally priced. No interior counter-voice argues against the gesture; the absence of lived doubt flattens the arc to graceful tableau rather than crucible. Character functions as thematic vehicle, not fully individuated psyche under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory grain adds density until the mandala reweights silence into shared focus. Closure is a Charged Poise—the flake at the center crystallizes options without verbal payoff—cost felt in irreversible shift from private witness to communal altar. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting objects. A single, meaningful tightening occurs when the flake is placed, foreclosing further speech acts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist-wrapped grotto, damp archways, lavender-grey shroud body the story’s pressure: moisture deadens sound, forces tactile strategies. Micro-setting—thumbnail tile flake—functions as portable acoustic memory, constraining Elara’s pivot to visual language. Spatial choreography holds across drifting spectators; no impossible distances. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV priority—touch over hearing—mirroring society’s sensory loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will shared meaning arise without words—signaled early. Escalation proceeds via accumulative sensory deprivation; final intensification is the flake’s placement, narrowing options from speech to pattern. Cost is conceptual: surrender of verbal authority; felt in collective lean-in, not private wound. Agency remains internal/attentional, adequate under short-form situational pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: meaning migrates from acoustic to visual resonance. Subtext operates in gesture—shoulder slump read as paragraph of loss—avoiding thesis statements. Final image offers conceptual repricing: tile flake becomes fossilized promise, reweighting silence as medium not void. Ambiguity lingers—no guarantee the pattern will outlast mist—earning complexity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustained; diction stays within Elara’s perceptual lexicon (“fleeting chalk nebulae,” “whispering grotto”). Rhythmic control peaks at mandala pour—long cadence mirroring slow sand—then contracts to single flake gleam. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: each sentence layers sensory, conceptual, or emotional cargo. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent—“silence as symptom” sustains medical trope without drift. Line propulsion breathes with scene; paragraph cuts land on image pivots. One minor scaffold: “This was her argument against the void” summarizes what the mandala already dramatizes—−0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk nebulae + unlearning + mandala silence feels inevitable in hindsight. Societal aphasia rendered via sensory inversion rather than dystopic cliché. Tile flake as fossilized voice is concrete, not ornamental. Risk of lyrical over-inflation is flirted but largely controlled; still, concept edges familiar quiet-apocalypse territory, capping ceiling short of revelatory.</comment>
