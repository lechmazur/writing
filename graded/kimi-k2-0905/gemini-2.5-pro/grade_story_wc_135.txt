<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motives—collective memory as civic defibrillator—are embedded in every sift and catalogue; his tactile grief when the valve speaks and the micro-choice to display it on a pedestal rather than pocket it crystallizes a hierarchy of values. The woman’s entrance supplies second-character pressure, forcing Kaelen into a silent gift of witness that alters her posture and his own sense of usefulness. Interiority stays concrete—“phantom echo of brassy sound,” salt-beaded coat—never abstracting into thesis. Only minor flaw: the woman’s beat is largely expository; her agency is reactive, trimming top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final image of Kaelen turning back to the surf crystallizes both options—keep salvaging—and cost—he remains exiled in the liminal, buoyed yet bound. Causality is accumulative/textural: each fragment layers density until the trumpet valve becomes the pattern-break that reweights “absences” into shared memory. The cost is undeniable in the woman’s straightened spine—visible social repair paid for by Kaelen’s continuing solitude. Orientation, lens, and escalation hold cleanly across the two-shard window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ivory harbor is rendered through salt-mist taste, sucking sand, barnacle cartography—details that double as tools for Kaelen’s archive. The trumpet valve’s micro-setting (cool brass, engraved sigil) acts as pivot-object: it constrains his next move (clean, label, display) and charges the final image when the sea reclaims his gaze. Weather’s constant drizzle mirrors interior mournfulness without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean across workshop threshold and shoreline.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore communal narrative from detritus—tightens when the valve’s arrival offers a test: will meaning take root outside Kaelen? The woman’s recognition provides the single, meaningful deepening; her straightened shoulders externalize cost and foreclose despair. Agency remains accumulative—curation as quiet resistance—consistent with lens. No false cliffhangers; escalation is a cadence shift from solitary salvage to communal echo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges from repeated tactile negatives—single shoes, bleached words, silenced horn—never from lecture. Subtext lives in gesture: the grandmother’s tightened grip on children equals reclamation of civic future. Final line offers resonant non-literal answer: the sea’s next offering equals unending, honorable cost. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in unwritten catalogue pages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice carries salt-crusted, methodical perceptual signature—“slick, pale stones,” “liminal space between known land and unknowable sea.” Syntax breathes with tidal rhythm; no filter-verb clog. Free indirect glides cleanly between external action and sensed memory. Dialogue fragment (the woman’s whisper) carries gravelly regionalism without caricature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: high density—each sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or interiority; no synonym loops or template cadence. Figurative choices stay physically loyal; mixed metaphor absent. Rhythm modulates—long tidal sentences vs. crisp labeling beats. Only hairline slip: “foundation of their home, though broken, was still here” flirts aphorism yet is earned by prior concrete fragments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-catastrophe beachcomber of memory—feels fresh in its quiet refusal of heroic survival tropes; stakes are emotional archaeology. Transformation test fails if setting/name changed: the ivory harbor’s bleached specificity and tidal mechanics are inseparable from thematic math. Risk in elegiac pacing pays off through accumulative pressure rather than twist. No close echoes of famous scenes; voice owns salt-eccentric diction.</comment>
