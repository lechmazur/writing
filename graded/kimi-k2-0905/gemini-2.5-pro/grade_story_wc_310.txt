<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Kael’s quietly-enthusiastic fatalism is embodied in tactile micro-choices—copper coin, finger on console, slumping into chair—rather than labels. Interior contradiction (prophet vs. madman) threads every beat, and the final renunciation (curator, not cartographer) is earned by the earlier casting ritual. The single flaw: “stellar doubt” is named more than dramatized after the mid-point, muting peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each filtered burst adds density until the orchestra-tuning break reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the copper coin spent to buy a memory-library—whose cost is legible in the final “he just listened.” No causality breaks; orientation anchored in first 90 words; persistent constraint (burn-out risk) shapes the power-drain tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ambered deck, copper coin, and console hum are recycled as micro-setting that constrain every tactic (power budget, dish alignment, memory receptacle). Sensory economy favors auditory and tactile detail over visual clutter, mirroring Kael’s radio-tuned perception. The coin’s green patina re-appears in the closing image, charging the final reconfiguration. Enough specificity to breach 9+ gate; capped at 8.9 only because exterior spatial anchors remain sketchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will he resonate with the new universe?”—tightens when the stubborn pulse threatens the last working sensor. Escalation is accumulative: louder static → burn-out risk → memory fracture that forecloses future-orientation. Cost is visible: the dish could die, leaving Kael in true silence. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as the only future—emerges from the orchestra-tuning image and the coin-to-memory transaction; no final-paragraph sermon. Subtext lurks in the silence after rainfall on a dead world, letting reader feel the scale of loss without naming it. Backwards prophecy lands as a CR beat that retroactively re-prices the coin toss. Complexity honored; no false equivalence between prophet and madman.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is filtered through a radio-engineer’s perceptual syntax: “wavelength align,” “phantom signals,” “distill the chaos.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—“the noise fractured”—then widens into the lyrical rainfall coda, mirroring the signal-to-memory arc. No head-hopping; diction remains within Kael’s technical lexicon; punctuation clean. The copper’s “green with age” is the single metaphor, kept precise and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato bursts to the long sentence that releases the orchestra. Information density high: one sentence often performs world, body, and stake. Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Only hairline slip: “the familiar grip of stellar doubt” leans label-adjacent, but immediately embodied by finger on console.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Post-heat-death radio astronomy narrated through numismatic divination feels inevitable yet unseen before. Copper coin as both randomizer and currency for memory is a fresh synthesis; prophecy that works only after the event re-weights the entire quest. Risk—burn the last sensor for a ghost echo—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: swap coin for dice and the emotional math collapses.</comment>
