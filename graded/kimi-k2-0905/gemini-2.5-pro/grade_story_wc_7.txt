<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s palate-gift is vivid and embodied; every snip is a micro-choice that costs him visceral pain. The interior contradiction—he is a cook, not a surgeon of souls—drives the arc. Flaws (bitter nostalgia, hubris of rewriting culture) complicate each cut, but the shift from despair to hope is asserted more than dramatized in the final beat, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each tasted memory → specific pruning → new flavor, a clean because/therefore chain. The alignment clock creates tight temporal stakes; the final fruit is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—he must now distribute a history he has edited. One minor scaffold loop (“he tasted… Snip.”) repeats three times; not fatal but dulls the closure image slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse, broken panes, twin moons—selective, atmospheric, filtered through chef’s senses. The greenhouse constrains movement and channels the celestial light that powers the plant; its decay mirrors the cultural rot he edits. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt. The plant itself serves as micro-setting/tool, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: can bitterness be re-seasoned into hope? Pressure escalates as each snip narrows future options—once a memory is excised, it cannot be re-tasted. The celestial window supplies a hard external clock. Cost is visible (nausea, trembling hand) but could be sharper; the final price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cultural trauma is a recipe that can be re-balanced, not erased. The taste-metaphor avoids overt thesis; the final flavor of “rain after drought” reweights earlier smoke and metal. Resists moralizing; ambiguity remains—who decides the new recipe? The notion of “gentle rebellion” is lightly worn, lived through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person tight, chef’s perceptual signature—flavors as memory, synaptic soup, chlorophyll as conscience. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Snip. He tasted…”) echoing surgical urgency. No head-hopping; diction stays within culinary lexicon. One near-template cadence in the pruning sequence is noticeable but voice-motivated.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong density—most lines perform double duty (taste + memory + moral judgment). Occasional stacked metaphors (“physical manifestation of a society’s traumatic decline”) verge on purple but fit the lyric mode. Minor paraphrase loop in “He tasted… Snip.” triad; clarity intact. Final image is clean, luminous, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory-tasting botanist-chef performing neuro-culinary surgery on a culture is fresh and specific. The metaphoric system (pruning = rewriting collective memory) is pursued to logical, risky conclusion. Risk distinction: stakes are conceptual yet visceral. No close echoes; transformation test passed—story collapses if chef is swapped for generic gardener.</comment>
