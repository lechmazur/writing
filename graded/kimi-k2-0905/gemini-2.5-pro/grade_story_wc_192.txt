<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motives—cauterize to teach—are crystalline and drive every gesture; the iron ring, ash, scar all manifest her “difficult mercy.” Interiority stays concrete (“quiet of the starlight…lung filling with night air”) rather than diagnostic. The single micro-choice—pressing iron to brow—triggers the entire causal beat, and its cost (porous boundary now open) is felt. Only missing is a second layer of contradiction inside her to earn the 9-band.</question>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of ash/iron/scar images tightens until the breath-image releases. Orientation clean by line 4; transitions are invisible because the scene is continuous. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “fragile path across the void” reconfigures both their stances with undeniable emotional cost. The price is visible—“the loaded emptiness” now pulsed—so 9-band entry gate met.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary functions as micro-setting: grit under knees, iron temperature, starlight angle all constrain how the ritual can be performed. Spatial choreography remains exact—hand raise, knee settle, ring press—tracking body and object. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and temperature under crisis, matching POV. Environment does not merely echo mood; it supplies the only tools that make the scar-link possible.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach suffocating to breathe”—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when she literally risks re-opening her own wound. One meaningful deepening: the link shifts from one-way offering to two-way tremor, foreclosing her absolute isolation. Cost is legible: the boundary, once burned, is now permeable and demands future upkeep. Agency is renunciation/encroachment rather than victory, fitting short-form scale.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from asymmetry of mercy: sometimes love severs to save. Subtext lives in the iron’s temperature shift—cold → warm—signaling the transfer without moralizing. Final image of “a single breath, drawn in the dark” offers resonant non-literal answer: connection is no longer zero-sum. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in who will cross the path next.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual sieve: “silver light of distant stars,” “loaded emptiness.” Syntax lengthens under meditation, then fragments at the tremor—rhythm mirrors breath. No head-hop; Liam’s jolt is delivered as external symptom she feels, preserving distance. Diction (“cauterize,” “festering char”) is specific to her wound-craft vocabulary.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are sparing and coherent—fire as surgery, breath as connection. Information density high: one line can place body, tool, memory, and stake (“small, iron doorknocker ring…a relic she had pulled…”). Final line lands on monosyllables that mimic exhalation. Minor hairline: “timeframe that felt both like a breath and an eternity” is the only near-abstraction, but it is anchored in bodily metaphor.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar trope—burnt-bridge psychic reconnection—is re-inflected through surgical fire imagery and the inversion that severance was the gift. Scar-linking as teleport-of-sensation feels fresh because mechanics are tactile (iron temperature, eyebrow ridge) rather than magical exposition. Specificity of oak-tree childhood backstory is brief yet individuating. Risk taken: quiet renunciation ending instead of reunion; coherence sustained.</question>
