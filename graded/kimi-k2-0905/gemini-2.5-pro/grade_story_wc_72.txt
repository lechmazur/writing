<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her “indoctrinated fury” dismantled by embodied micro-choices (unclipping ampoule, digging silt). The contradiction between crusader identity and emerging tenderness is held in-scene, not narrated. Galen’s telepathy is less a second character than externalized conscience, so relationship crucible is waived; single-POV test is met. Final burial of the ampoule is earned renunciation with visible cost—she forfeits surface allegiance and accepts exile.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: each because/therefore linkage tightens options—lie revealed → gill recognized → poison refused → ampoule buried. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost: she becomes traitor to her own people; city’s lung survives. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit by word 50: “Mara’s gaze drifted… underwater city garden.” No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and held.</comment>

<comment>Forgotten underwater city is not backdrop but tactical environment—filtration membrane directly redirects sabotage to salvation. Bioluminescent flora and “crushed pearl / obsidian” paths are filtered through Mara’s shifting moral lens, anchoring sensory hierarchy. Garden constrains final choice: only because it lives does poisoning it become unthinkable, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent genocide of sentient abyss—signaled by line 5. Escalation is cascading revelations each narrowing agency: tomb→sanctuary→lung→mirrors her own body. Final tightening forces public renunciation with felt cost; no coincidence used to resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “certainty as cage” emerges through image pattern: foxglove beauty = poison, garden tomb = cradle, statue = mentor. No thematic echo spoken; insight is earned when she buries the ampoule—an act that reweights “purifier” into destroyer. Final image of bioluminescent vine pulsing brighter offers resonant CR: life acknowledges her nuance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person internal stays tight to Mara; diction—“foxglove-stained glass,” “sculpted stone and patient coral”—is POV-colored perceptual signature. Rhythm accelerates under revelation beats, breathes during garden traversal. No dialogue, so voice subtests waived; narrative register remains consistent and ocean-pressure compressed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Figurative language is selective—“voice of sculpted stone”—and paid off in closure. High density achieved with stacked nominalizations that still read as Mara’s educated lexicon. Final line cadence mirrors opening “secret settled” with “vine pulsed,” giving circular ear-test satisfaction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of espionage thriller with deep-sea eco-revelation feels inevitable yet unclichéd. Statue-mentor via telepathy reverses familiar AI-trope into geologic patience. Risk taken: no surface world shown, yet abyssal garden becomes complete moral universe—bold compression that heightens rather than narrows meaning.</comment>
