<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority—taste-mapping pressure systems, twisting the tin ring—keeps her particular; her “relentless need for proof” drives every beat. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so internal conflict stays summary rather than simultaneous scene. The closing realization (“her work was not about fixing people…”) is credibly foreshadowed and carries a visible intellectual cost. Despite the ornamental “luminous skeptic” label, embodied micro-choices keep her above archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance re-crystallizes as the aurora absorbs the carriers’ storms, cost legible in the clean taste of lavender replacing metallic/ozone signatures. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“lavender bluff…twilight”). Escalation is density-driven: each new carrier thickens the synesthetic palate until the aurora ruptures the pattern. Persistent constraint—the useless tin ring spinning “frantic”—survives the final image, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bluff’s crushed lavender, airborne ozone, and auroral curtain are filtered through Elara’s meteorological palate, never touristic. Micro-setting of the tin ring in her fist acts as a tactile compass-stand-in that constrains her method and recharges at closure. Spatial choreography stays clean as three carriers ascend from distinct paths. Weather is not backdrop; it is the decisive medium that externalizes her epistemic stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara verify the emergent compass?—tightens synesthetically: each tasted pressure front raises the cost of disproof. The aurora’s absorption of private storms is the single deepening that flips her investigatory goal into acceptance; price is the blank palate that ends her data stream. Agency remains observational, but the final stance crystallizes under undeniable atmospheric evidence. No swappable antagonist needed; pressure is systemic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme—knowledge systems too alive to be “fixed”—emerges from the converging storms and auroral absorption rather than thesis statements. Subtext operates in tasted metals, tightening until the clean-lavender close reweights “proof” into humility. No final moral is asserted; resonance is imagistic. Minor abstraction: “futuristic nostalgia” is named not dramatized, keeping theme shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s synesthetic register; diction stays within a field-scientist lexicon. Perceptual signature—taste as barometer—remains consistent, no head-hop. Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks as storms converge, then breathes post-aurora. No dialogue to distort voice. Compression like “terrestrially cosmic” is pattern-taught early and paid off in auroral descent, so elision reads intentional, not opaque.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty: sensory data + hypothesis test. No scaffold loops; repetition (“lavender…lavender”) is purposeful closure echo. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (compass, flock, harbor) stay nautical/orienteering. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“quivering,” “whipped,” “crackled”) propel. One pronoun glide—“their individual storms marking them as vessels”—reads clear via antecedent chain. Final image is clean, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic meteorology as character orientation feels fresh; “taste the weather-carriers” is a non-obvious detection system that reweights familiar aurora imagery. Transformation test: swap out synesthesia and the entire epistemic arc collapses. Risk—scientist protagonist who ends in anti-interventionist humility—avoids heroic-inventor cliché. Conceptual integrity sustained: no late rule changes. Minor sentimental tint in “lost coordinates finding their harbor” is earned by prior flock/vessel pattern.</comment>
