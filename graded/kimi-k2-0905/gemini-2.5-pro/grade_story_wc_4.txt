<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s calm puzzle-archivist persona is vividly embodied in his tactile handling of photos and the patient “linger” action, but interiority stays safely muted; we never feel a contradictory impulse that might fracture his composure, so the arc is smooth rather than revelatory. The final release of the paper-boat photo registers as quiet triumph, yet it is foreshadowed so gently that the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. Still, within the lyric-accumulative mode, the stance crystallizes with credible Earned Stasis: he closes the case, foreclosing further returns, and the town’s ignorance of his labor is the price. Characterization lands just above the “strong” threshold because the职业 self-containment is consistent, but lacks a pressure crack that would push it to exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mosaic shard structure is taught early—“dozens of black-and-white photographs” as geography of heart—and the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each seasonal layer thickens pattern until the spiral completes. Orientation is secured inside 80 words with lavender, factory ruins, dove-gray case, and Elias kneeling; no penalty. Closure is a clean CR: the final image (girl releasing paper boat) re-weights every prior arc into “a wide, bright expanse of recovery,” undeniable conceptual cost paid by Elias’s anonymity and the town’s unconscious healing. The because/therefore linkage is lyric rather than causal, but under Accumulative rules the cadence shift from soot-smudged tear to crescent smile is decisive and legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lavender sea and rusted factory are not backdrop but tools: the lavender scent displaces coal smoke in the first paragraph, enacting the very transmutation Elias seeks. Micro-setting inside the map-case—photographs as portable geography—supplies the tactile constraint that keeps Elias kneeling season after season. Spatial choreography is impeccable: case → plank → overlapping prints → final spiral tracked visually. The factory vines reach the roof at the exact beat the mosaic closes, charging the final image with environmental inevitability; setting passes the 9+ gate but caps at 8.1 because the lavender itself never actively alters a tactical choice—it embodies the achieved stasis rather than testing it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“transmute pain into masterpiece”—is signaled paragraph one and tightens through each seasonal accretion; the deepening is the growing spiral density rather than external opposition. No antagonist is needed under Accumulative lens; the risk is aesthetic failure, felt each time Elias aligns hidden contours. The meaningful turn is the final placement: paper-boat arc completes the spiral, foreclosing further edits and committing him to permanent invisibility. Cost is conceptual but legible: his life’s work will never be witnessed, a price paid in the closing latch of the dove-gray case.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating arc motif: grief’s curve answered by joy’s curve, until the spiral implies regeneration without sermon. Subtext resides in the silence—townspeople never know they are being healed—so the ethical weight of unseen labor accumulates in the reader rather than text. Final image reframes prior sorrow as fertile soil, a conceptual repricing that avoids tidy moral. The refusal to declare victory aloud keeps the piece in the 8-band, but the resonance is genuine and particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: lavender scent as “gentle balm,” conveyor belt “silent,” vines “creep.” Syntax lengthens and softens in parallel with the calm demeanor, then shortens at the final latch—“The puzzle was solved.”—creating rhythmic closure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction remains within the plausible lexicon of a contemplative archivist. The calm is not just labeled but enacted in cadence, earning the high-band mark.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet uncluttered: single sentences double as scenic action and metaphoric mapping—“the geography of a community’s heart.” No paraphrase loops; each photograph shard adds a new sensory angle. Metaphors stay coherent (spiral of life, arc of tear to smile) and do not invade high-pressure beats. Minor qualifier clusters (“against all odds”) keep it from 8.5+ but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—an invisible archivist healing a town via secret photo-mosaic—is fresh, yet the execution risks whimsy overload; the paper-boat finale just rescues it from sentimentality by its placement as conceptual key. Recurrent arc imagery feels inevitable in hindsight, not contrived. Risk is moderate because the concept could tilt toward preciousness, but the specificity of soot-smudged faces and slag-heap park grounds it. Synthesis is strong enough for 8.7, short of 9+ only because the emotional calculus is gentle rather than dangerous.</comment>
