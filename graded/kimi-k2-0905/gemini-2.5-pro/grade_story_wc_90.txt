<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism and grief-steward motive stay consistent; every photograph she anoints forces a visible body-weight shift that externalizes inner conflict. The micro-choice to forgive the universe—and her child-self—pays the entire cost of the quest, landing as earned stasis. Interiority rarely lapses into label-speak, though “ghostly resolve” edges close. One more contradiction live in scene would push this to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative lens is declared early and held: each photograph = one density unit, one knot, one lift toward the aperture. Closure—silver knots igniting into a dimensional doorway—offers clear conceptual repricing: the species’ sorrow becomes the key, not the lock. Causality is lyric rather than linear, acceptable under Accumulative/Textural rules. The tear’s rule set never shifts, and every beat adds weight/buoyancy data that charges the final image.</comment>

<comment>Scrap-Ark is sketched with industrial ghosts—grated deck plates contracting in sympathy, microgravity core—just enough to anchor the body-weight piston that powers each beat. Kwan Yin’s Tear operates as micro-setting: its cool ovoid feel constrains how long Elara can stay inside a memory before she must float or sink. Sensory economy is tight; no tourist catalog of corridors. Final dome aperture inherits the metallic symmetry, so environment participates in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The dominant stake—can sorrow be metabolized without violence—tightens photograph by photograph; each integration forecloses denial as an option. Buoyancy itself becomes a visible price: heavier = crippling grief, lighter = euphoric risk of losing contact with the deck, hence with the work. The final self-portrait forces the ultimate trade: forgive the emptiness or remain crushed by it. Agency stays internal but is irreversible; the doorway opens only because she pays with absolute acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that only by bearing the full freight of human despair can that despair be transmuted into transcendence. No character ever articulates this; it is shown via the gravitational metaphor and the stitch-pattern. Subtext resides in the silver knots—tiny scars that bind memory into cosmos. The ending image of parting space through acceptance offers lingering ambiguity: is it escape, exile, or apotheosis? That friction lifts the score.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: temperature of stone, taste of recycled air, vertigo of microgravity. Rhythm swells and contracts with weight shifts; short clauses when she sinks, longer floating phrases when she rises. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. One clause—“strange physics of her being”—teases explanation but is rescued by immediate bodily proof (deck plates buckle), keeping the voice honest.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet tactile: “needle thin as a whisper,” “thread of spun starlight.” No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacks. Mixed-metaphor risk in “lead weight” vs. “airy vessel” is justified by the literal weight–lightness physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke; final line resolves by image (swirling aperture) that recharges every silver knot before it. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Marrying Buddhist nonviolence, post-human survival, and literal gravitational emotion is a daring synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The tear-as-key, photograph-as-door, buoyancy-as-moral-choice configuration is non-obvious and impossible to strip out without collapsing plot logic. Risk is high—lyric sci-fi with zero combat—but coherence is higher. Freshness arises from internal physics, not surface ornament.</comment>
