<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Julian’s need to apologize is embodied and specific, but the interior contradiction—wanting absolution while dreading the rawness of contact—could be sharper in the first beat. The micro-choice to hand over the perfume bottle crystallizes hierarchy of values, yet his passivity while Vex rigs the device slightly blunts agency under pressure. Earned stasis lands because the cost is felt: the lilac scent fades, the orchard will still fall, and the apology changes nothing external, only internal terrain. Voice stays coherent, but “a deluge of sensation” skates dangerously close to therapy-speak summary; one more physical tic could have sealed the hairline gap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the acceptance that arrives is imperfect, expensive, and irreversible. Causal linkage holds—because Julian pays, therefore the bell answers, therefore the orchard’s erasure becomes bearable. The oscillator wires and perfume bottle are set up, used, and discarded in tight causal sequence; no prop teleports. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with “sheet music archive” and the diesel engine growl at the end re-anchors time. Cost is legible in the final image: the bottle is once again “just an object,” a brutal re-pricing of what magic can and cannot buy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archive is not mere wallpaper; the iron-gall ink staves and decaying paper literally conduct the current that lets grief complete the circuit. Proximity governs choice—Julian must place the bottle on the lectern, the clips must bite the filigree—so setting constrains tactics. The lilac scent is an atmospheric pivot that turns the archive from mausoleum to momentary portal. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the perfume bottle functions as portable environment that charges the final image when it reverts to inert glass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“apologize before the ground forgets her”—is signaled immediately and tightened by the chainsaw countdown. Agency is renunciation rather than action: Julian consents to the painful authenticity of the connection. The tightening beat is the hum ceasing; options narrow to live with the fractured absolution. Cost is visible: the orchard will still fall, the archive will be rubble, and the scent will stay sealed—he gains only internal geometry, a classic Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as phantom limb, apology as static charge between worlds. The motif of conductivity—copper wires, lilac molecules, musical notes as embers—accumulates quietly and reweights at closure when the current dies. No moral is pronounced; instead the final image of diesel light reconfigures the value of haunting. Subtext in Madame Vex’s metaphor-speak (“bell in a vacuum”) hints at commerce of grief without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Julian’s perceptual signature—his palm sweat, dental hum, taste of old arguments. Free indirect style is clean: “notes seemed to crawl” reflects his dread, not objective magic. Vex’s voice is sharply distinct—gravel wrapped in silk, occupational metaphor—without violating POV since Julian hears and filters her. No head-hop; oscillator dial twist is observed externally but through his bodily reaction, maintaining distance discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates with the hum—short percussive clauses mimic vibration—then exhales once the scent fades. No filter-verb clusters; “he felt everything” is earned by the prior sensory cascade. Metaphors are controlled: “dying embers” for notes is extended physically by the blue spark, so vehicles cohere. Only minor scaffold: “the weight in his chest was different, lighter” could compress to “his chest felt lighter,” but it does not touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The paranormal apology via oscillator and perfume bottle is a fresh synthesis of tech and ectoplasm; grief as electrical charge feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken—quiet ending, no ghost visual—but coherence is preserved. Transformation test fails if Julian is generic seeker, but the lilac-and-manuscript specificity anchors the idea to this orchard, this sister, this archive. Gossip-column exorcist trope is inverted: Vex wants story fodder more than salvation, complicating the moral geometry.</comment>
