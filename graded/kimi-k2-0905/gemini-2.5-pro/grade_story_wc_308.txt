<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelan’s vow of reverence and refusal to "disturb the dead" directly shapes the passive appraisal strategy, grounding every beat in a believable, historically reverent stance. The interior contradiction—yearning to travel without moving yet clinging to stillness—remains active in scene and charges the final renunciation when the hunter’s pulse is released. Micro-choices (kneel, climb, hum) bundle embodied cost and spiritual trade-off into visible motion. Only minor shortfall: no visible degradation of Kaelan’s body/state as price; the cost is existential, not visceral, so the score stops just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer, echo, and bird pattern thickens the canyon’s drone until meaning reframes. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “They are safe” reweights the arrowhead from weapon to witness, releasing the wander-pulse; Kaelan’s own path outward suddenly feels possible, an undeniable cost to centuries of stillness. Orientation is taught early and paid off at the end, so no penalty applies. One minor slack: the flock-reading method is introduced only once; had it been foreshadowed earlier, the tightening would feel even more inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bone towers function as both geography and instrument: their acoustic ribs literally amplify Kaelan’s harmonic skim, making environment = tool. The arrowhead’s volcanic glass and the fossilized rib ramp constrain how Kaelan can act (gentle touch, climb, perch) while charging the final harmonic flick. Sensory selection stays urgent—sound over sight, grit under knees—mirroring the vow of stillness. Setting details never stall motion; each is discovered through goal-directed appraisal, so the micro-setting test is satisfied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake emerges early: pacify the wandering pulse without violating reverence. Escalation is textural—each new echo, grit layer, and bird deviation thickens the cost of inaction until Kaelan must act by harmonic release. The tightening is singular but decisive: the flock’s chaotic scatter visually closes off the option of passive waiting. Price is conceptual (acceptance of outward journey) rather than tangible; still, it is legible on the page and reconfigures future options, satisfying the 8.8+ gate under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme—“grief needs direction, not erasure”—emerges from the hunter’s silent regret and Kaelan’s refusal to silence it, avoiding any final moral statement. The arrowhead’s reprice from weapon to witness crystallizes the idea, while the canyon’s endless echo motif mirrors the persistence of memory. Subtext stays in gesture: the hum, the sigh, the inert stone. Only a hair’s breadth from 9: the emotional aftereffect is poignant yet gentle; a sharper bite of cost would have pushed theme into lingering disquiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Kaelan’s perceptions, never ventriloquizing birds or hunter. Syntax lengthens in calm, then fragments under harmonic concentration (“They are safe. They survived. You can rest.”), mirroring psychic compression. Diction stays within a stone-skimmer’s plausible lexicon—“vertebra,” “locus,” “skim”—without academic drift. The rhythmic hum that closes the piece is pattern-taught early via canyon drone and paid off at the end, earning high-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is densely polyphonic: one sentence often layers metaphor, sensory cue, and causal push (“The wind, a patient sculptor, had peeled back a layer of grit...”). No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; volcanic glass / bone tower logic stays coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“acoustic heart,” “psychic one”) is voice-motivated and brief, not purple. Final third is clean—no artifact touches closure—so 9+ gate stays open; only minor scaffold in the repeated “pulse/echo” coupling prevents a perfect score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harmonic stone-skimmer who reads bird-flight as grief-mapper feels sui generis; no genre template matches this fusion of acoustic psychic, ossuary desert, and archeo-ghost. The “wandering pulse” concept is abstract yet grounded in a single obsidian chip, transforming familiar haunting into geologic echo. Risk is taken and paid off: centuries of stillness ended by a non-physical “skim” of thought—bold, yet causality holds. Specificity of detail (dusk-ravens, fossilized rib ramp) makes the world impossible to transplant without collapsing the story.</comment>
