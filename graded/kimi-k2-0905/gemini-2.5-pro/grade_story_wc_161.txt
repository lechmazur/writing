<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to Lena’s music while fabricating new pasts—are dramatized in the dust-ritual and the tarpaulin scramble; the final gift of the scroll crystallizes a credible shift from hoarding to sharing, paying the cost of vulnerability. Interiority is concrete (“words tasting like ash”), never diagnostic. The only minor slack is Anna’s near-perfect attunement, which softens the crucible slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the meteorite’s re-gifting reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens, making the before/after of trust legible. Causality holds—storm → leak → confession → shared scroll—without convenient resets. The piece stays within single-scene default; orientation is anchored by ~100 words. Cost is felt in the raw-voiced “It was a gift” beat. A hairline slip: the tarpaulin moment is a touch rushed, blunting the full tightening that could push higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The attic’s single skylight column, wobbling stool, and water trickle constrain bodily balance and catalyze confession; the meteorite chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (dust as nebulae, coo as counterpoint). Spatial choreography is clean—bodies, books, leak, cage track believably. One minor lapse: rain is seen but not heard or smelled under crisis-time compression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. release Lena’s echo—is signaled early and tightens once: storm threatens sheets → Elias risks fall to tarp → chooses to speak → transfers meteorite. The tightening is textural but sufficient for 700-word scope; the price (surrender of private myth) is legible. No false escalation or coincidence resolves the conflict. Could use one more intermediate pressure beat to reach top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation through shared vulnerability emerges via the meteorite’s trajectory and the scroll’s phrase, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: Anna’s hand on the ankle wordlessly counters Elias’s scarecrow isolation. Final image reweights “impossible” from private talisman to communal promise, inviting reflection without moralizing. Avoids tidy sentiment by keeping Lena absent and silence intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is astronomer-poetic (“dust-stars,” “microscopic waltz”) yet stays credible for a grieving amateur. Syntax modulates: long, star-mapping sentences in calm, clipped fragments during leak. No head-hopping; Anna’s interior is rightly opaque. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, voice-true. One minor filter verb cluster (“he imagined them released”) could trim, but it doesn’t mar the overall rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—dust “curling the edges of his life,” “bloom too fragile”—yet each figurative move advances atmosphere or character. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharged motif. A single near-overwrite (“universe of dancing dust”) survives because the pattern is taught and reprised at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing archaic pigeon courier with widower astronomer who maps dust nebulae feels fresh; the meteorite-as-love-token and music-as-scrolls are specific syntheses, not ornaments. Transformation test fails if names swap, proving integration. Risk lies in the quiet lyric arc rather than twist; the payoff is emotional reconfiguration, not surprise. Slight genre overlap with “grief attic” tropes keeps it just below top originality tier.</comment>
