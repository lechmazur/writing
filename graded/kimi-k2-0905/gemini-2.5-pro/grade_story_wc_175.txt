<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is consistent, tactile, and embodied; the moth-wing tool anchors micro-choices without epiphany-speak. The final renunciation—packing the wing and walking away—carries visible cost yet feels slightly under-causal because the decision is never actively resisted or endangered; stakes plateau rather than compound. Still, his esoteric-realist lens shapes every beat, and the earned stasis is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each woven arch adds density until the final sparse butterfly reweights the silence. Closure is a Charged Poise—"a soft place for the dying light to land"—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation and causality remain intact; no prop or knowledge teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating grotto’s moss, mist, and river-stone floor constrain posture, material choices, and even the butterfly’s flight path; setting is not backdrop but scaffold. Micro-setting (the moth-wing tool) charges the final image when Elias slips it back into its pouch. Sensory economy is tight; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor the overlooked histories—tightens through each knot; the dwindling butterfly count supplies palpable, visible cost. Agency is accumulative rather than reversal-driven: every lattice forecloses the possibility of future use. The final perfect male’s passage is the last live option extinguished; price is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: extinction as elegy, not rescue. The transient structures themselves become the argument—memory built to dissolve. Final image re-prices the premise: honoring is not fixing but witnessing. No moralizing; resonance is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside Elias’s perceptual rim: filigree of dust and light, soil grammar. Lyric diction ("blushing stillness") is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final blush of sky. Rhythm modulates with task tempo; no filter-verb clutter. Voice is distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers tactile verb, sensory filter, and causal linkage ("pulled the vine taut for the culminating knot, a prayer tied with the quiet reverence of a scholar closing a sacred book"). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphor. Final line earns its cadence without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The idea of architecture-as-elegy for insects is fresh; the extinct moth-wing as data-chip rather than talisman transforms familiar eco-grief. Risk—the entire drama is watching butterflies fly through wicker—pays off because the accretion of knots makes the silence audible. Could not swap elements without collapse.</comment>
