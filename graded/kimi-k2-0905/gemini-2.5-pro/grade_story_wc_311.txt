<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“spectral fingers,” “nameless, drowning fear”); micro-choice (angling the prism) crystallizes the grief-object with visible cost. Slight drift toward lyric label-speak (“shapeless agony”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystal in palm reweights Kael’s purpose under Accumulative lens—dust drawn inward, light trapped, grief named. Causality is lyric but coherent; the atlas page seeds the naming stakes early and returns in the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory ribs, copper dust, apricot-violet dusk, and the prism-as-micro-setting all constrain the ritual and charge the final image. Sensory selection stays inside Kael’s reaper-biased perception; spatial choreography is clean and pressure-guided.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—anchor the echo of Elara—tightens once via the prism ritual; cost is the visible crystal shard that forecloses permanent recovery. No second reversal needed for 700-word scope; pressure accumulates rather than pivots.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of naming grief emerges through the atlas-to-crystal pipeline, never sermonized. Final image offers conceptual repricing: a leviathan now has a name, yet remains lethal. Resonant ambiguity lingers—“distant intimacy”—without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is sustained, reaper-detached yet yearning: diction of “ferryman on a shoreless sea,” syntax lengthens under sorrow. No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is distinct and stable; minor filter verbs (“he felt”) are rare and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor (sun “bled out,” crystal “webbed with fractures”) returns to the naming conceit. Sentence rhythm breathes with ritual pacing; no overwriting even in the high-stakes crystallization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Reaper-astronomer grieving via star-myth atlas transformed into grief-crystal is fresh synthesis; risk of lyric ritualism pays off. Sacrifice-as-echo repurposes cosmic tropes into intimate physics; transformation test passes—swap any prop and the spell collapses.</comment>
