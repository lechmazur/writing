<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s need to escape his father’s lie and own a “true” story drives every beat; his decision to break the seal is irreversible, with embodied dread in the finger-on-rust moment. Interiority stays concrete (“lie tasted on tongues,” “copperlight repose”) without label-speak. The cost—accepting eternal disbelief—lands as visible forfeiture on the final line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: gravity reclaiming the suspended bodies reweights the entire premise of inherited lies vs. witnessed impossibility. Causal chain holds—because he opens the door, the timeless tableau collapses and his stigma calcifies. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s rust-needle silhouette, salt-etched sorrow, and copper-lit gloom constrain movement and optics; the confessional-lattice micro-setting literally filters the impossible image. Environment charges the final image—“silent, judging stones” inherit the cost he releases.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he verify an impossible truth at the cost of perpetual disbelief—tightens once: sealed door vs. personal legacy. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (salt, rust, hush) deepens the price of looking. The hovering tableau is the visible cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: lies fathers invent vs. silences physics enforces. The final image reprises “copperlight” as moral repricing—truth now belongs to the tower, not the teller. No articulation of thesis; resonance is imagistic and unavoidable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person syntax is oceanic, tidal—long clauses that suddenly narrow to the stab of “They hover.” Perceptual signature marries maritime weariness with theological dread (“confessional screen,” “trinity of deceit”). No head-hop; register stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Varied sentence cadence mirrors climb and vertigo; clauses tighten into single-word beats at reveal. Zero scaffold/loop; metaphors are internally coherent (rust, salt, amber). High density—every detail salts the later collapse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse-horror trope into metaphysical calendar of suspended guilt; confessional lattice repurposed as peephole into frozen original sin. Specific synthesis feels inevitable: only this reef, this rust pattern, could archive a moment stricken from time.</comment>
