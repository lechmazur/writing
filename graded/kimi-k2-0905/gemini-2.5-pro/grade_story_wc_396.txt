<comment>Kael’s desire to “map empathy onto action” is dramatized in every beat: the shard is handled, the mirror is chosen, the visions are endured, and the public translation of private truth costs him the comfort of neutrality. Interiority is concrete (“his consciousness to drift… an empty vessel”), never diagnostic, and the final stand between accuser and accused crystallizes a hierarchy of values—truth-telling over tribal calm—with the visible cost of becoming the community’s emotional lightning-rod. Flaws (outsider status, quasi-mystical duty) actively complicate the choice to speak; no safety-hedging. The single-scene crucible and relational pressure with Mara/Jorn satisfy scope; micro-revelations under cold apple boughs embody emotion without cliché.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s speech severs the village’s rush to blame, replacing it with shared mortal fragility—the cost is his irreversible transition from silent peacekeeper to exposed truth-bearer. Causal lens holds: because he seeks the shard → mirror yields vision → therefore he risks ostracism to speak. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“lighthouse orchard… frost-rimmed apple boughs”). No lens ambiguity; escalation tightens once—from accusation to empathetic exposure—sufficient for 700-word frame. Cost is on-page: “the weighted breath was finally released… a long, shuddering sigh,” communal and personal.</comment>

<comment>“Lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes” is not postcard scenery: the grinding ice is the existential antagonist, the frayed anchor-line is tactile, cold narrows perception to breath-clouds and cracking rope. Apple boughs versus sea-ice create an impossible, memorable micro-setting that charges the final image of fragility. Spatial choreography is clean—crowd, Jorn, Mara, Kael’s body in the middle—no impossible moves. Milky quartz shard and clouded mirror function as setting-in-hand, constraining Kael’s only viable tactic; removal would collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival vs. justice without scapegoat—announced in first paragraph. Escalation is one deepening: accusation → revelation → shared terror of ice. Agency is Kael’s decision to reveal visions, forfeiting anonymity. Price is paid on-page: communal shame-sigh, Jorn’s restored honor, Kael’s exposed otherness. Coherent under causal lens; coincidence complicates (wind/fray) but does not resolve conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—empathy as actionable courage—emerges through images (fraying rope, empty parkas, milky shard) rather than assertion. Subtext lives in silence: Jorn’s dropped gaze, Mara’s slumping shoulders. Final image of communal breath-cloud is a non-literal answer: shared vulnerability is the only warmth. No moralizing sentence; ambiguity remains—ice will fray another line someday.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Kael’s perceptual signature: “calmly intuitive sense,” “cool and smooth in his palm,” vision-access described as passive reception. Syntax lengthens during visionary drift, shortens for public verdict, mirroring pressure. No head-hops; narrator knowledge never exceeds Kael’s. Lexical choices—“keening wind,” “shriek of rope fibers”—are idiosyncratic yet transparent. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich: “You severed the anchor-line” carries history, fear, status.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose shows rhythmic control: “sharp edges and bitter weight” (opening) echoes in “sharp… weight” of truth at end. Metaphors are spare, consistent (ice, glass, breath); no mixed vehicles. Few adverbs, strong verbs (“drift,” “shriek,” “plumed”). No scaffold/loop; paragraphs advance situation or emotion. One clause—“a thing of sharp edges and bitter weight”—verges on abstraction but is earned by immediate sensory follow-through, forgiven at closure distance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse + orchard + ice-plain combines navigation, fertility, and doom in one impossible location. “Empathy mapped onto action” reframes familiar moral-dilemma plot through quasi-clairvoyant peacekeeper trope, but execution grounds visions in material shard/mirror mechanics, avoiding mystic cliché. Specific details (apple boughs rimed with frost, fray cordage) prevent generic transfer; story would collapse if re-skinned to desert outpost. Risk taken with compressed timeline and single-scene resolution pays off.</comment>
