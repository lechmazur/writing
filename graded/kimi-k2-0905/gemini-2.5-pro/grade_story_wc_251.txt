<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—“the static-filled broadcast only he could receive”—and his motivation stays consistent to the end. The micro-choice to cradle the stone while weaving hope threads is visible on-page and forecloses passivity. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, however; all tension is summarized, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A clear causal chain—prophecy → window plot → grotto amplification → chord shift—lands with conceptual cost: the town’s future is now an open, dangerous conversation. Orientation is anchored by line 10; the final image of the warming stone reweights stakes under a Charged Poise. Closure obeys the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt library, magnetized grotto, and mist-bound town are filtered through Elias’s professional attention to silence and signal. Each location constrains tactics: the grotto amplifies his hearing, the library offers vantage for the ninth bell. Specificity is economical—”a blue so deep it felt like the bottom of a frozen sea”—and the telescope, loaf, and gear reprise at closure to reweight meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can quiet art defy homogeny?—tightens exactly once when the ninth bell triggers the window displays, turning abstract fear into visible social risk. Cost is legible: the town outs itself to Authority surveillance, and Elias’s warmed stone signals irreversible expenditure of the grotto’s energy. Agency is accumulative rather than multi-reversal, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete refrain of lighted windows; no character sermonizes. The final image—Maya’s “I can draw that”—offers a non-literal answer: creativity becomes contagious contagion. Ambiguity persists (what will Authority do?), meeting the complexity bar. The loaf, gear, and telescope particularize the theme without abstract labels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—“he could feel them; he heard the unspoken words.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then compresses at bell-strike, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests are waived. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and justified by his psychic attribute.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic with selective metaphor—”bottom of a frozen sea,” “pawn bravely advanced.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density is high: one sentence often layers setting, interiority, and stake. The warming stone image recharges earlier lodestone logic without overwriting, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The synchronized-window rebellion feels fresh against the familiar dystopia-of-conformity frame; specificity of bread, gear, telescope transforms trope into lived ritual. Risk is quiet—no chase scenes—yet stakes feel large because the amplifier stone and collective chord are concretely staged. The final reprise of Maya’s thought is inevitable in hindsight, not predictable beforehand.</comment>
