<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to remain unseen yet desperate to matter—play out in real time as he risks exposure to plant the fragment. His embodied reaction (“quiet click of satisfaction”) and the precise micro-choice of aligning the label toward Anya reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The motivation scales credibly: from habitual retrieval of “faint magnetic ghosts” to a single high-stakes delivery that forecloses his anonymity. Cost is legible: once the tape is placed, his invisible way of life is jeopardized if ever traced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias retreats into darkness while Anya’s gratitude floods the empty room, re-weighting both their worlds. The moment carries undeniable conceptual cost—his visibility is felt even though he is not seen. Causality holds: every beat from grate-loosening to label-aligning drives toward this crystallized final image. One minor scaffold (“he watched … he watched”) in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library’s stuttering fluorescent pulses and the oak table’s spatial fixity constrain every move; Elias times his emergence to the blackout rhythm. The fragment itself functions as micro-setting—its ferromagnetic surface dictates how it must be cached, handled, and finally displayed. Dawn’s angled light through the arches becomes the mirror for Anya’s emotional flip, charging the last image. All detail is filtered through Elias’s professional attention to ducts, distances, and dead zones, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Anya’s irretrievable loss—tightens when Elias realizes the outage erased the oral-history server; the fragment becomes the last living trace. One meaningful deepening: his routine retrieval turns into a deliberate exposure gamble, narrowing his safe options to zero if mis-timed. Cost is on-page: each footstep toward the reading table increases the risk of being caught and losing his entire invisible life. Escalation is accumulative under lens, not multi-reversal, exactly fitting short-form allowance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: stewardship of forgotten voices versus the erasure modernity calls progress. The tape’s journey from duct to desktop re-prices “obsolete” media as sacred; the final image of Anya clutching “NANA, 1988” to her chest reweights the personal over the digital. Subtext in Elias’s silent retreat is the cost of caretaking—love expressed as disappearance. No moralizing, only the resonant reconfiguration that some archives are meant for hearts, not servers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual bias—silverfish grit, magnetic pulse felt in fingertips—never ventriloquizing Anya. Syntax lengthens in stealth sequences, then snaps to staccato as batteries flicker, mirroring his cardiac rhythm. No dialogue, yet the prose carries idiom of a maintenance ghost who counts distances in duct elbows and cache boxes. Voice modulation under peak stress (short clause bursts during the deposit) is controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: “desiccated silverfish and grit” does world, touch, and decay in five words. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for creeping, fragments for flicker beats. One scaffold paraphrase (“he watched … he watched”) is the only detectable loop; it dulls momentum minutely but does not touch closure. Metaphors stay physical and consistent: “dark offering on a silver altar” sustains the sacramental conceit without strain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Ferromagnetic ghost-reading as a literal sense is a fresh speculative graft onto archival fiction, made credible by tactile specifics. The inversion of visibility—becoming seen by making an object speak while staying unseen—flips the stock invisible-man trope into ethical service. Risk is taken and paid off: the entire emotional arc hinges on obsolete technology, not a nostalgic prop but the lone survivor of systemic erasure. Specificity passes transformation test: swap duct, tape, or outage and the story collapses.</comment>
