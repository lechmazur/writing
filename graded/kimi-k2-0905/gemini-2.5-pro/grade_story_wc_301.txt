<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied grief, the accordion’s weight as lungs, and the micro-choice to leave the instrument behind give credible interiority and a visible cost. The “daringly methodical” trait surfaces only once; more on-page friction between compulsion and method would lift the score. Closure choice is earned: renunciation of the relic and of mapping grief onto land.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (enter station → read graffiti → play one note → leave accordion) tightens options. The graffiti line is the decisive pivot that rewrites the map into self-agency; the single wheezing note is Charged Poise with cost—he abandons both father-music and brother-relic. No teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Damp-ticket hall, ivy-choked eaves, smashed porcelain, and the accordion’s duct-tape patches are tactile and POV-filtered. The station constrains movement—only one stall bears the message—so setting actively funnels the climax. Weather (mist, river breath) stays off-stage but the built decay mirrors the “raw” internal state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signalled early; pressure escalates when graffiti reframes the map as self-drawn. Single micro-turn suffices at this length. Cost is visible: he forfeits the accordion, the last audible link to brother/father; renunciation forecloses retreat into music-mourning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The map/territory aphorism risks overt thesis, but its appearance in vandal-scrawl on broken tile earns grit; the theme emerges from renunciation, not sermon. Final image—river indifferent, Elias perhaps learning to flow—offers conceptual repricing without moral tag. Quiet ambiguity lingers effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked; diction (“worn boots crunching... a chronicle written in silt”) is riverine and percussive, matching the grief-gravel texture. No filter-verb stacks; syntax lengthens for breath, then fractures in the single accordion exhale. Voice modulates with raw medication-stripped nerves without slipping into therapy register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “rawness he hadn’t known since... stopped the medication” does triple duty (time, cause, bodily stakes). Metaphors (sandpaper, broken lung) are purposeful and few; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for river memory, staccato for station entry. Zero paraphrase loops; accordion left behind, not re-explained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “grief pilgrimage” frame but pivots on graffiti-as-cartography-lesson, a fresh inversion. Abandoning functional accordion rather than playing a reel subverts expected catharsis. Specificity of duct-tape patched bellows and ordnance-survey map roots the story; without these, template would feel generic. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
