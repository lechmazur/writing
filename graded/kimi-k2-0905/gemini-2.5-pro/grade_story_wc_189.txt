<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara's tidal-pool chronicler mindset is vividly shown through her attention to the snail and her habitual deflection from raw pain; the jade cicada anchors her internal contradiction. The final renunciation is earned because her micro-choices (thumb-stroking, watching the snail) dramatize the shift. However, Kael remains a static sounding board; his interiority is assumed, not demonstrated, so the relationship crucible is one-sided.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece deepens by density, not causal reversals. The grotto, snail, and cicada accumulate into a pattern break that reweights the stake from loss to transition. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “time changes its song” crystallizes options with felt cost—she accepts the shedding. Orientation is clean by line 4; no ambiguity or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s threshold architecture—damp stone, starlit mouth, shelled walls—mirrors the emotional passage and literally frames the final image. The snail micro-setting constrains her attention and supplies the tactical pivot: slow, unhurried progress becomes the model for enduring Kael’s departure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: marine scientist notices fossil-wing veins and algae patches first.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to survive the impending separation—is signaled in Kael’s first line. Escalation is accumulative: each natural analogy (cicada nymph, starlight travel, snail inching) tightens the emotional vice until the only option left is acceptance. The cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the immediacy of shared grief for a diffuse, future bond.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: molting cicada, starlight latency, snail pilgrimage. The final line reframes prior images without moralizing—“time changes its song” is a conceptual repricing that echoes the cicada’s brief aerial life. Subtext operates in silence: Kael’s anxious mask versus Elara’s settled pool calm. No motif checklist; jade cicada and snail return with shifted emotional weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s perceptual signature—fossil-veined wings, tidal-pool metaphors, starlight travel time. No head-hopping; Kael’s face is read from the outside. Syntax breathes with emotional cadence: long reflective sentences build to the short, declarative final line. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal-only and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: sentence lengths swell and contract with reflection. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor stacking in peak beats. One minor paraphrase loop: “slow, unhurried progress” could compress. No register drift, no filter-verb stacks. Opening and final lines are propulsive and image-rich.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The tidal-pool chronicler using marine micro-analogues to process heartbreak feels fresh; the snail as emotional tutor is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is quiet—no twist, no antagonist—but the lyric accumulative structure commits fully. If names were changed the arc would still work, yet the marine lens is inseparable from Elara’s worldview, so transformation is partial.</comment>
