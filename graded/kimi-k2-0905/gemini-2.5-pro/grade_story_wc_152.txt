<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “foolish-old-woman” mask is vividly embodied in her slowed gestures and unassuming posture, while her interior needle-sharp calculus stays believably constrained to embroidery, eavesdropping, and one clandestine upload. The micro-choice to hijack the calibration channel grows directly from her established duality and costs her the safety of anonymity; the only minor slip is the off-page overhearing of “troop movements and timings,” which feels lightly convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the green glyph flashes, the stitched map is away, and Elara’s resumed stitching crystallizes both triumph and exposure with undeniable cost. Causal linkage holds: each earlier oddity (guards, Voronin, blackout, regulators) is threaded into the embroidered cipher and then into the three-minute uplink. The only hairline flaw is a two-sentence lag in the system that reads more like convenient suspense than engineered obstacle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The eternal candle’s unwavering flame and the dome’s groan under late-autumn cold are returned to twice, anchoring both spatial mood and the timing of the upload; the observatory itself constrains her route to the dusty auxiliary terminal. Selective sensory detail (golden light on spidery fingers) keeps the embroidery table alive without tourist clutter. The setting never over-explains astronomy tech, trusting the reader to feel the place through lived use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposure of the coup versus preservation of her cover—tightens the instant the calibration window is announced; the 3-minute uplink is an on-page ticking clock that forces the final risk. Agency is pure: she alone converts cloth into cipher and queues the burst. Cost is visible in the resumed, slower stitching—she has now weaponized her life’s work and can never feign harmless again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The unheard story motif migrates from abstract desire to concrete, dangerous artifact; the embroidered nebula physically re-weights from art to evidence in the final image. No moral is stated—only the candle’s steady glow and the hum of the dome imply that silence itself has been repurposed as broadcast. The theme emerges via the object’s transformed function rather than authorial commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara; perceptual diction (“spidery fingers,” “ghost-stitch”) is idiosyncratic to her embroidery lens. Syntax lengthens and relaxes during stitching, then shortens and accelerates at the terminal, mirroring interior pressure without drum-beat monotony. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat; the single POV supports both lyric accumulation and the causal turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density, and almost free of scaffold; only a faint echo (“the silence was now filled with a new echo”) edges toward self-paraphrase. Figurative language is restrained to two needle/flame images that avoid mixed-metaphor clutter. Rhythm modulates with task: long silk sentences vs. clipped terminal commands, propelling rather than stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The embroidery-as-cipher conceit freshens the classic spy-in-plain-sight trope; the eternal candle as unblinking witness adds a subtle uncanny charge without fantasy overreach. Specificity of the calibration handshake and narrow-band channel shows research translated into usable stakes. The synthesis feels inevitable—remove any crafted piece and the whole plot unravels.</comment>
