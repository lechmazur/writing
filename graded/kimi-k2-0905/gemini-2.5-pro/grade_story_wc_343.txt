<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s solitary obsession is credibly specific: a cartographer who maps by bird-plot, not land-mass. His interiority stays concrete—charcoal smudge, phrasebook crease—without lapsing into label-speak. The final quiet renunciation (“he wasn’t just an apprentice anymore”) is earned by the hopscotch-to-starling causal chain and carries visible cost: the lifelong duty mutates into unending conversation. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; desire remains single-track, flattening psychological depth a notch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: hopscotch scuff → archaic cant → starling vector → luminance reveal, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the map is finished yet the pursuit is infinite, reconfiguring identity with undeniable conceptual cost (“cartographer of living light”). Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Minor waiver: the hopscotch-code epiphany is a touch convenient, but the birds’ prior patterning justifies the leap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Airship is sketched via brass fittings, aging canvas, lantern-lit hold—selective, not touristic. The hopscotch board functions as micro-setting: its worn squares physically constrain Elias’s knees and later his interpretive leap, qualifying for 9+ gate. Starlings supply kinetic scale that mirrors internal revelation. Only gap: engine-oil scent is dropped once and never re-accessed under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the lost light—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates through each deciphered square/bird pulse. One meaningful tightening: pristine square 4 → “ignore the false dawn” forecloses premature satisfaction, forcing him to watch longer and pay the cost of dwindling twilight. Agency stays on-page; no coincidences rescue him. Cost is visible (lost daylight, lifelong solitude) yet could be sharper—no tool breaks or physical risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: knowledge as conversation, not conquest. The child’s hopscotch game re-priced into adult cosmic map embodies the idea without naming it. Subtextual irony—Elias seeks a “stranded” light yet discovers it is navigating—lands cleanly. No late thematic echo; final image lets cosmos speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “scent of old paper and engine oil a familiar comfort” is character-specific. Diction skews nautical-archaic (“gondola,” “vellum,” “cant”) consistent with inherited mariner culture. Rhythm tightens under revelation: clipped participles mimic bird-flicker. No dialogue = no voice contamination; narrative voice sustains singularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: “charcoal pencil poised over fresh vellum” does three jobs (tool, action, vocation). Mixed-metaphor risk in “ocean of blue” vs “fluid body” of birds is forgiven by cumulative cohesion. No scaffold loops; sentence lengths vary. One near-template cadence: “He began to note…” repeated twice—minor, outside closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of hopscotch, obsolete sailor cant, and murmuration guidance is fresh and specific; trope of lonely star-hunter is transmuted through bird-code. Risky compression succeeds: child’s chalk game becomes celestial instrument without breaking plausibility. Transformation test passes: swap elements and entire causal spine collapses. Close-compare to Calvino/Kipling only heightens distinction.</comment>
