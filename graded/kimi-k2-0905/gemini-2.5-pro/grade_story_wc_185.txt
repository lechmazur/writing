<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s solitude and singular purpose are sharply etched; his interiority stays concrete—eyes tracing ice-forks, bones protesting, blood-whisper at climax. The stoic mapkeeper persona is internally coherent, yet the story leans on professional label (“ripple-mark mapkeeper”) rather than letting a contradictory private want complicate his public role. Micro-choices—rising, carrying the fragile ice, releasing the pattern—map directly onto the bloom of hush payoff, so motivation stays causal and costly. No second character to pressure status, but that absence is within default for length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as an earned Charged Poise: the hush blooms, alien noise is folded away, and Kaelen’s hard-won stillness pulses back at him with visible cost—stone light steadies, his body settles into “earned repose.” Causal chain (hum → ice-map → release → inversion) is airtight; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Lens is causal throughout; orientation (who/where/when) anchored by line 3 and never loosens. The final quiet reweights all prior sonic torture without tidy exposition—exactly the resonant reconfiguration required.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harmonic caves are not backdrop but instrument: the drone’s angles press the ceiling, the Chamber of First Frost supplies the catalyst, the salt-veined pedestal steers handling. Milky quartz sphere functions as micro-setting—its glow and vibration codetermine every beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kaelen’s profession; crack geometry is read as “note in a symphony of nullity,” fusing body, tool, and locus. Spatial choreography stays exact across ice-carry, fingertip trace, and dust sift at inversion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened exactly once when the alien hum spikes to needle-point. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he fetches the ice map, internalizes it, then conjures the silence; coincidence supplies no shortcuts. Cost is visible on-page: the cave shudders, dust sifts, and the price is the fragility of the silence he now must guard. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; it forecloses the option to endure the noise and reweights his life-purpose toward stewardship of hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>“Silence as active force” emerges through concrete particulars, not thesis; bloom of hush is never defined but dramatized by folding the hum inward. Final image reconfigures theme—quiet becomes “rich, textured presence,” a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection on absorption versus erasure. Subtext of solitude versus stewardship surfaces in Kaelen’s repose: he has not escaped duty but shifted its shape. No closing moral is stated; resonance lingers in the pulse of the stone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person limited clings to Kaelen’s perceptual filter—“angles and edges,” “forgotten air,” “whisper of his own blood”—texture is geologic, not generic. Rhythm swells and shortens with pressure: long clauses during sensory build, fragment-like releases at inversion. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from distant ledge-sit to intimate skull-whisper. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of an aged, solitary mapkeeper; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse, selective—“noise that had angles and edges,” “symphony of nullity”—each image serves concept without clutter. High information density: every paragraph advances choice, perception, or atmosphere; no paraphrase loops. Proofing clean; grammar, tense, pronoun reference stable. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges “earned repose.”</question>

<question>8</question><question>9.0</question><comment>Fusion of geologic acoustics and mystic cartography feels fresh; “reading silence in ice-fractures” is a specific, non-obvious method. The inversion trope (amplifier becomes absorber) is grounded in material process—ice pattern released into quartz—so payoff feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky concentration on a single character and sensory concept pays off with intensified interiority. Details are irreplaceable: swap caves for forest or ice for leaf-veins and the entire resonance collapses.</question>
