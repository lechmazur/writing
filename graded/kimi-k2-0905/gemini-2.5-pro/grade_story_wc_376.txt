<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet obsession with lost candor is shown through his meticulous labor and the fern’s flinch at lies, giving his interiority texture; the final moment of kneeling to plant the seed crystallizes a believable, earned turn from scribe to cultivator of truth. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict never quite peaks under pressure, capping the arc just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The map’s assembly causally tightens options until the postal plate clicks into the vault, delivering a Conceptual Repricing that reframes honesty as literal seed-stock; the “before” (wilting fern, poisoned air) and “after” (clear air sprouting) are legible on the page. All props are planted early and retrieved without teleport; orientation is clean by 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city’s recycled air and ochre smog remain a constant pressure filter, while the fern on the workbench functions as micro-setting that constrains Elian’s perception of customers. The arboretum’s cool purity is a tactile reversal of that pressure, charging the closure image. Details are selective, lived-in, and never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering vanished sincerity—tightens when the map’s “convergence of echoes” phrase redefines the quarry from gold to truth itself. One meaningful deepening suffices; the price is conceptual (the atmosphere of honesty already lost) and becomes visible when Elian pockets the seeds knowing he must farm candor anew. No external reversals, but the single reweighting is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fern’s wilt, the postal relic, and seeds that sprout only in sincerity; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of planting a Veritas bloom reframes the entire city’s atmosphere as a crop that can be regrown, offering a resonant, non-moral answer to where lost conversations go.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Elian’s calligrapher eye: parchment smell, ink loops, seed surfaces “impossibly smooth.” Syntax remains calm and precise, mirroring his craft, then opens slightly at the arboretum reveal. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; diction stays within his plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense: each sentence layers sensory detail or causal link without scaffold. Metaphors (“sweet poison on the recycled air”) are spare, apt, and internally consistent. Zero loops, no register drift; final paragraph accelerates into a single breath that lands the image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of calligraphic precision with bio-botanical truth detectors feels fresh; the treasure is not gold but atmospheric honesty repurposed as cultivar. The premise commits fully to its internal logic and follows the implication that candor can be farmed like botany, avoiding allegorical safety.</comment>
