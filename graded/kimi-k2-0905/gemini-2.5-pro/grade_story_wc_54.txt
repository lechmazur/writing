<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—her recognition of the sextant shard carries a “quiet hum of curiosity” that is hers alone. Micro-choice under pressure is visible when she risks electrocution to hot-wire the dead grid. Flaw is present: she overrates structure as a source of hope, a misbelief the climax corrects. Cost is conceptual—she sees that hope is rewired, not calculated, yet the emotional price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: find shard → decode as grid key → scavenge carnival cables → slot shard → throw breaker → sky lights. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the galaxy projection reframes the terminal from “place of departure” to “monument to destination,” reweighting her entire premise. Persistent constraint—the diesel generators’ throaty hum—lingers under the final image, confirming price. One soft spot: the schematic-crossing beat is summarized, not shown, slightly blurring the because/therefore pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Electro-chromic ceiling as living star-map is the dominant environment; it literally reconfigures at closure, charging the final image. Micro-setting tools—greasy napkin, tarnished brass slot—constrain action: only that shard fits. Spatial choreography is clean: drift of confetti, gantry climb, floor-center stance all track. Ozone/popcorn mix ties carnival ghost to spaceport decay in one sniff, economical and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she wrest a vision of hope from structural ruin? Escalation is single but meaningful—each cable run narrows her physical options and raises electrocution/ruin risk. The tightening happens when she hurls the breaker: no retreat after that snap. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a burned hand or fried generator would have lifted the felt price into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery alone: star-chart as external hope, carnival trash as internal refuse, both cohabiting the same vault. No thesis is spoken; the closest is her silent realization that hope is “a current to be rerouted,” itself tied to the electrical metaphor. Final image reweights the premise—terminal becomes destination, not departure—without moralizing. Some readers may overlay “science vs. wonder,” but the text wisely leaves the polarity unresolved.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature filters every noticing through engineering logic—gradations, schematics, power flows. Syntax mirrors her mindset: parallel clauses (“redirecting flows…daisy-chaining…running”) mimic circuit diagrams. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. One register slip: “resurrect” for ceiling lighting is poetic intrusion; she’d likely think “activate.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs (“scuffing,” “blossomed”) keep momentum. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensorium or causal step. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“ghost of a ghost” sets tone without overwriting. Minor scaffold: “She looked up” is a neutral stage direction that could be cut for immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of derelict spaceport and overnight carnival is fresh; sextant shard as hidden key literalizes “maze of intentions.” Galaxy projection from ceiling panels externalizes hope without cliché. Concept risks puzzle-box cleverness, but emotional need anchors it. Transformation test fails slightly—swap “botanist” for engineer and story still runs; occupational detail is thin.</comment>
