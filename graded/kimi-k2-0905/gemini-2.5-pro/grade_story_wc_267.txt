<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A mute bellhop nursing a mangled larynx while ferrying meals to the woman whose career he maimed is a pressure cooker of interior contradiction; the guilt is embodied in the bolt he fingers and the tray he wordlessly hands her. The arc—endurance rather than flight—earns its cost on the page, but the soloist’s interiority is missing, so the relational crucible is only half-forged. Still, his micro-choice to leave the bolt beside her cup crystallizes hierarchy of values with visible price. Slight reserve: her silence reads as convenient blankness rather than equal subject. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the rust-colored stain on step 19 triggers memory, the bolt is the physical tether, and leaving it re-weights both their futures. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—the warmer air in his chest—yet the bolt’s decision could have arrived one beat earlier to tighten the final cadence. Orientation is firm within 120 words; spiral staircase geography is clean. One micro-turn suffices; no false escalation. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt-armored snow fortress is sketched in three compressed strokes yet constrains every move: the guests convalesce in opulent quiet, the staff glide in polished shoes, the staircase is off-limits—space itself enforces silence. Weather never moralizes, but the ever-present snow against armored glass becomes the hush made visible. The bolt and staircase function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory economy is expert; no filler description. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—is signaled early and tightens exactly once: he could walk out, chooses not to, and that renunciation reweights options. Pressure is internal, coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible in the bolt he cannot discard and the frostbite clarity he accepts. Could edge higher if the soloist’s stake were dramatized on-page rather than implied. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bolt’s journey: safety bought through muteness exacts a price only payable in speech forfeited. Subtext operates in gesture—the bolt placed beside porcelain signals apology without words. No moralizing line spells the lesson; the warmer lungful is the earned non-literal answer. Fortress-as-church, silence-as-vocation: metaphors stay concrete and particular. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distant is stable; perceptual signature in music and architecture vocabulary feels authentic to a former countertenor. Syntax lengthens for cathedral echo, contracts for bolt-in-pocket panic. No head-hopping; soloist’s silence is respected. Dialogue absent by design—voice carries through cadence of footfalls and tray-clink. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is near-flawless: high information density, zero loops, strong verbs (“whisper of snow,” “sheared bolt-head glint”). Figurative control maintained even at closure—no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“seraphically mundane”) is voice-motivated. Opening and final lines both earn their keep; no scaffold sentences. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mute-guilt-bellhop conceit is fresh;钢琴 bench螺栓 as relic of voice-loss is specific and memorable. Snowbound sanatorium for singers who shattered each other’s bodies offers non-obvious synthesis. Risk of endurance-over-flight is committed fully. Minor deduction: paraplegic-soprano trope verges on familiar, though bolt detail rescues it from template. </comment>
