<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s grief-tinged obsession is rendered through embodied ritual (the nightly drumming) and a single, telling relic—the atlas page—so motive stays concrete. His interior contradiction—clinging to a ghost reef while officially logging its death—drives every beat without therapeutic self-labeling. The final choice to keep tapping is a credible renunciation of escape, locking him to the station with visible cost: the vision fades and he stays, hands sore, hope renewed. Only the absence of a second character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the page, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal spine is immaculate: each failed rhythmic sequence → new data dive → refined pattern → final environmental trigger → missing beat discovered → successful summoning. The spiral-dot notation delivers a genuine Decisive Change that reconfigures both reality and Aris’s mission; the cost is the fleeting one-minute vision he can never hold longer. Orientation is secured inside 50 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaps. Closure lands with conceptual repricing: the reef is not gone, only periodic, and his mooring becomes voluntary sentry duty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s concrete hum and console-metal chill function as micro-setting, constraining both the drumming acoustics and the tactile memory of Lena’s touch. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Aris notices tidal gauges, salt corrosion, the “bleached white bones” outside—never tourist filler. The viewport’s transformation from boneyard to living reef is a spatial anchor that charges the final image. One nip: no smell or temperature shift during thermal inversion, a missed immediacy that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake—prove Lena’s “periodically eternal” sanctuary real—tightens through successive failed rhythms that still cost nightly stamina and sanity. The neap-tide-plus-inversion convergence is a situational pressure point that forces the last attempt; failure now would shatter the quest. Agency is pure: every data cross-reference and finger-tap is Aris’s, no coin-flip rescue. Price is visible: calloused hands, sleepless eyes, and the heart-slam of watching paradise vanish again—enough to meet the 8.8 cost threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of temporal hauntings emerges from the atlas page’s impossible archipelago and the reef’s spectral return—never sermonized. The final image reweights extinction: loss is not absolute but rhythmic, a pulse we fail to hear. Subtextual knife: science (data logs) cannot resurrect beauty—only artful rhythm can. No tidy moral, only the quiet command to keep listening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Aris’s marine-geologist perceptual filter: currents are “gravimetric distortions,” emotions register as “a slow, silent funeral.” Syntax lengthens under melancholy, then fractures into staccato taps under obsession. No head-hop, no filter-verb fog. The final heartbeat paragraph slows cadence to mimic the spiral-dot tempo—voice as instrument, perfectly controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “the sun bled into the horizon” does double duty for time and wound. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “towering structures of coral, vibrant with shades of magenta and electric blue” is precise, not purple. Opening line anchors both voice and stake; closing line crystallizes the new mission. One micro-slip: “indifferent blue” appears twice—acceptable echo, but keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rhythmic summoning of a temporally fugitive reef is a fresh synthesis of climate grief and time-slip fantasy; no Trope-101 here. The spiral-dot as missing metronome feels inevitable in hindsight yet unguessable on first read—true structural ingenuity. Risky compression to a single-scene crescendo pays off: the story’s urgency mirrors the reef’s brief resurrection. Transformation test fails if any element is swapped—this could only be Aris, only this station, only this song.</comment>
