<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—longing to send love while erasing the love itself—plays out in embodied micro-choices (untie bead, pick up shuttle). The hollowing of her Self is dramatized beat by beat; final “utterly without context” line earns the renunciation cost. No second character on page keeps relationship crucible off-limits, but solitary plight still presses status against memory. Interior voice stays concrete, particular, avoids diagnostic shorthand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each golden thread woven → memory erased → options narrow to single final bead-locking act. Closure lands with visible cost—“she was peacefully, completely alone”—a decisive change that forecloses retrieval of love. Orientation anchored by word 70 (loom, orchard, bamboo); no teleporting props. The tapestry’s nova-flare vanish is taught early as magical loom price, paid off in final silent image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orchard/bamboo grove functions as micro-setting that isolates and quietens; loom grooves and amber bead are tactile tools that constrain every motion. Sensory economy favors hush, rustle, cool amber—selective, never catalog. Spatial choreography clean: bead travels from neck → palm → tapestry hollow. Setting mirror works via “raveling silence” without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—send message vs. lose love—tightens each warp; visible price (scent, cadence, warmth threads removed) escalates under causal lens. One meaningful deepening: last-night falter (memory of name vanishes) narrows option to recommence or surrender. Final bead act irrevocably forecloses restoration; cost is legible on-page. Coincidence absent; escalation driven solely by her agency to keep weaving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial love emerges from loom-eat-memory pattern, never stated. Subtext in silence—wall solidifies from metaphor to literal isolation. Final image reweights “stoically sparkling” fleck as now unreadable star, conceptually repricing love’s afterglow. Moral complexity intact: no verdict on whether message arrives, only that sender is erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person floats close to Elara’s perceptual filter—shuttle-throw, thread-gold, bead-cool—syntax lengthens then fragments under final loom flare. No head-hop; distance stable. Diction stays within rural-spinner lexicon; “warp,” “weft,” “shuttle” precise. Rhythm mirrors loom clacks, then breathless single sentence at nova. No dialogue to distort voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose propels: high density lines carry sensory, emotional, causal work. Mixed metaphors avoided; “hardened light,” “silent nova” stay consistent. One scaffold spot: “wistful ache” and “wistful longing” in open/close—minor loop but doesn’t dull final image. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts purposeful. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-consuming loom + jigsaw star-map + amber bead message creates inevitable magic logic. Risky premise—self-erasing love—fully committed; no retreat to easy reunion. Specificity in orchard swallowed by bamboo, loom grooved by thousand forgotten threads, gives tactile freshness. Conceptual repricing at end feels non-obvious yet earned.</comment>
