<comment>Elias’s claustrophobia is lived in the sinew of the piece: sweat-slick palm, hitched breath, the passage that “stretches into an infinite, dark throat.” The micro-choice to raise the compass point against collapsing stone fuses fear, ancestry, and agency in one embodied beat. Interior contradiction is active—not labeled—and the final earned stasis (he walks forward, lungs open) carries visible cost in the tremor that remains after silence locks the walls. Only the great-grandfather remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible and status dynamics are unavailable, capping the band just below 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because Elias fears enclosure he brings the compass; therefore the spatial mutiny escalates when sound activates it; therefore he transfixes the keystone to survive. The closure is a Decisive Change—new passage, new knowledge—paid for by the audible hush that replaces chaos. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the compass’s steel and his chest-pressure shape every tactical choice until the final hum locks reality. Closure cost is legible in the single sentence where “the oppressive weight on his chest vanished,” reconfiguring both architecture and breath.</comment>

<comment>The nexus is rendered through hostile specificity: “walls leaned without falling,” “sweating granite,” starlight that “barely penetrated the gloom.” Body-as-setting is equally precise—breath hitches, palm sweats—so environment and physiology together constrain every move. The compass point and keystone micro-settings literally charge the final image: their collision carves the only stable passage. All sensory detail is filtered through Elias’s explorer-proprioceptive bias; no tourist catalog appears.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim lost spatial truth—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when the organ’s chord turns the building predatory. One meaningful escalation: the spatial mutiny intensifies from disorientation to suffocation, forcing the transfix action that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: sanity frays, lungs compress, and the new passage is irreversible—he can never again claim ignorance of the Architect’s principles. Agency is continuous; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the counter-mapping of memory versus erasure: the fallow world, thinning veil, and blueprint folio form a silent argument that knowledge—not glory—justifies risk. No moral is stated; the final image of dust-sealed blueprints reweights “vital key” from metal to understanding. Subtext operates in the organ’s groan—heritage as both lure and trap—and in the compass, a tool of design turned weapon of survival. Wistful rebellion stays implicit: the quiet victory against forgetting is the refusal to leave the blueprints buried.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains a perceptual signature attuned to spatial betrayal: “corridors twisted into knots,” “passage … lengthen, stretching into an infinite, dark throat.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-clause bursts when walls close—and loosens during the chord sequence, echoing musical phrase lengths. No dialogue appears; therefore no voice-contamination or head-hopping risk. Diction stays within explorer-imagistic register; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive: one sentence delivers setting, stake, and sensory cue (“damp earth and ozone”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors (“skeletal ruin,” “silent sentinels”) are spare and coherent. Peak-beat clarity survives the sonic-betrayal paragraph because figurative language is anchored to tangible motion—floor buckles, walls breathe. Opening and final lines create a sonic bracket: “bone and shadow” vs. “storm of sound and stone,” recharging motif without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—haunted church, lost blueprint, sound-as-key—are re-forged through spatial-mutiny physics and claustrophobic explorer kink. The compass-point-as-keystone-pin is a fresh mechanical turn that feels inevitable once the organ’s vibration focalizes through steel. Risk is taken: architecture as antagonist, not backdrop, and the quiet victory trades spectacle for epistemic gain. Specificity of “fallow period” and “veil thinned” keeps cosmic horror local and lived.</comment>
