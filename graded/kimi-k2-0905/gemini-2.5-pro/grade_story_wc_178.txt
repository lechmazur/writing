<comment>Kavi’s hoarding of silence and starlight is embodied in lived ritual; his frugality underwrites every gesture and his final renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority remains particular—“empirically ironic” self-tagging is shown through action, not label. The single-scene crucible works because his trait becomes the instrument of revelation; no contradiction under pressure. Only the absence of a second on-page figure prevents full pressure from status/relationship dynamics.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the new star-cloud reweights the premise, making his solitude and secrecy priceless. The causal chain—tile → schematic → star-collision—lands with felt cost: he forfeits plundered gold and court power forever. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the sky itself is re-tuned. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor within 50 words and payoff justifies early compression.</comment>

<comment>Ziggurat as micro-setting constrains every motion—spiral brick, obsidian dust pot, chalked string—tools that double as cosmos. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kavi’s astronomer gaze: starlight thickens, dust grains become units of prayer. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects never drift. Final image recharges the obsidian pot and empty floor as sealed vault—setting directly shapes the closing cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—covenant with the unknown—tightens once when the tile is spent; the deepening is the sky’s answer, not a new external threat. Escalation is density-based under Accumulative lens; starlight literally bends, options reconfigure. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he can never trade this secret for worldly gold. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversal inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of encrypted devotion emerges silently: mathematics as prayer, thrift as sacrament. No thematic echo; final image of the star-cloud is non-literal answer to lifelong question. Subtext in chalked arcs and reclaimed dust carries more weight than exposition. Resonant reconfiguration revalues silence over gold without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is rigorous astronomer—star-catalog syntax, metallic consonants, refusal of metaphor until the sky provides one. Rhythm accelerates with chalk-lines, breathes during hum. Filter verbs absent; diction stays within Babylonian-tech lexicon. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Under stress, syntax compresses to single-clause observational bursts that mirror star-count precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—world-build, advance ritual, texture starlight. Zero loops; no scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“tomb awaiting a new corpse”—but it is voice-motivated palace irony and does not recur. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long spiral sentences to final staccato sweep. Closure image is uncluttered, crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magic-square astrolabe as devotional CPU, Babylonian interregnum as vacuum-chamber for star-birth. Risky compression of cosmic reveal accepted because pattern taught early and cost internalized. Not derivative; no template echo. Specificity of dust-grain accounting and iridescent gas cloud anchors universals in antique tech. Repriced solitude feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
