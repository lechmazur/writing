<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—‘frantic, delicate dance’ shows embodied tension—and the pen’s tactile recall anchors guilt. The contradictory impulse to edit vs. annotate is held in-scene, not summarized. Final renunciation is credible, but emotional cost is slightly under-cooked: we see him ‘slacken’ but don’t feel the visceral sting of letting the colony remain doomed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each edit triggers a visible new disaster, tightening until commentary becomes the only open path. Closure—footnoting grief into the fold—pays off the time-crease rule with conceptual cost: he forever carries knowledge of the unaltered tragedy. One micro-turn (editor → annotator) lands cleanly. Minor waiver: orientation clear by ~100 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly is more than wallpaper: its ‘gentle warping’ becomes the literal mechanism for accessing the past and the final ‘soothing embrace’, charging closure. Station and console are sketched sparely yet functionally; the pen micro-setting doubles as guilt totem. Sensory hierarchy follows professional filter—waveforms, frequencies—keeping detail purposeful. Lacks one environmental constraint that physically shapes the final keystroke, holding it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem or accept guilt—signals early and sharpens when every edit births a worse disaster, foreclosing revision. Escalation is causal and visible; options narrow from full rewrite to marginal footnote. Cost is felt conceptually rather than somatically, adequate at this length but not viscerally piercing. Meets quick test: agency drives tightening, price on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of erasing one’s formative failure versus the possibility of understanding it. Pen and anomaly serve as concrete correlatives without overt symbolic trumpets. Final footnote re-weights the past without moralizing—an earned, quiet resonance. Avoids explicit thesis statements; only final sentence flirts with abstraction, but image is strong enough to carry it.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is cool, analytic, matching a signal-interpreter’s mindset. Diction tightens under pressure—short declaratives during edits, then longer reflective cadence at release. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested; internal voice stays coherent. One template run (‘He… then he…’) mid-text barely audible; rhythm otherwise controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances premise or emotional calculus. Metaphors are spare and precise: ‘temporal crease’, ‘cascade of new, unpredictable consequences’. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; only minor simultaneity slip (‘as he nudged… showing him’). Clean punctuation and tense. Final paragraph could trim one adjective (‘profound stillness’) without loss, keeping it from top band.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Time-fold-edit trope is familiar, yet story’s pivot from ‘rewrite history’ to ‘annotate history’ feels fresh and specific to this character’s guilt. Pen-as-guilt-object and gravitational anomaly are synthesized into one coherent instrument of remembrance. Conceptual risk—quiet renunciation instead of heroic rescue—lands cleanly. Specific occupational detail (Proxima waveform) prevents generic overlay.</comment>
