<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent; the “technically gentle” trait is lived through tactile braiding of kelp threads, not merely asserted. The contradiction between his past failure and present precision is dramatized in every micro-choice, and the final act of sketching the sigil shows an earned hierarchy of values (memory over sound). Closure cost is felt: he accepts that light, not voice, is the best he can give, and we see that limitation on the page. Minor cap: no second character on page, so relationship/status bullets not tested; single-POV interiority alone is exemplary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sigil’s dissolution reweights the premise—memory can be honored even when retrieval is impossible. Causal lens holds: every re-braid is a because/therefore response to the punched card’s absence-of-paper code; the final silver sketch is therefore motivated. Cost is patent in the image “ghost of a ghost” and the quiet acceptance of partial victory. No orientation drift; ice/aurora anchors arrive within 60 words and serve the closing light effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment (ice dome, aurora light, kelp rope) directly constrains every action: the rope’s phosphorescence is the only power source, the ice wall is the only screen, sub-zero cold keeps the aurora visible as clock. Tool-as-setting qualifies: the rope’s dormant chorus energy is re-tuned by Elian’s fingers, charging both the sigil and the final silver cast plan. No static tour; each sensory detail is filtered through wax-caster expertise—temperature judged by aurora shift, texture by wax memory. Micro-setting gate satisfied; removal of any environmental factor would break the illumination mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve one forgotten name—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when the rope’s glow confirms the partial success; options narrow from “restore sound” to “honor light.” Agency is continuous: every unbraid is a reversible risk that could silence the rope forever. Cost is visible in the sigil’s flicker-out and the quiet acceptance that silver, not song, is the relic. One meaningful escalation is sufficient at this length; luck never intervenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and irreversible loss; no character ever states it. The final image—wax sheet bearing the sigil of a ghost-of-ghost—non-literally answers whether memory needs embodiment to matter. Subtext accrues in silence: the absence of Lyra’s voice is never lamented aloud, only illuminated. Light as proxy for sound reweights the concept of archive without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and wax-caster specific: “surgeon’s precision born from the memory of clumsy, grieving hands.” Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences during braiding, clipped fragments at the breath-holding moment before glow. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays cleanly inside Elian’s perceptual filter. Register never drifts into academic abstraction; even “conceptual repricing” is rendered as “ghost of a ghost.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet lucid; single sentences perform three jobs (e.g., “He connected the last re-plaited strand, the final note in the sequence. The sanctum held its breath.”—action, musical metaphor, environmental response). No synonym loops or template cadence; each verb is precise (“unbraid,” “re-plait,” “coalesce”). One near-mixed metaphor (“snowmelt ardor that defied frost”) but physical logic stays intact. Closure image (“ghost of a ghost”) is crisp, uncluttered, and rhythmically cadenced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of wax-casting, punched-card music, and bioluminescent kelp rope is fresh synthesis rather than checklist novelty. The premise—re-weaving a ceremonial rope to project a silent sigil of a name—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken: climax is a silent light projection, not a sounding voice, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails: swap any artifact and the mechanics collapse, confirming originality.</comment>
