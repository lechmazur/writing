<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—romantic longing vs. scientific rigor—are alive in every beat; the revelation that objects remember “brutally literal” physics rather than her smile is earned by years of ritualized communing and costs him his last poetic shield. Interiority stays embodied (glass “heavier than before” in his palm). The kneeling renunciation is the visible price. Minor slip: “attentive mystic” is asserted twice, never tested in dialogue; still, his perceptual signature stays sharp.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost density increases, prism pattern repeats, cadence snaps at the schematic bolt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—love is replaced by shear-physics on the page, felt cost in the ringing void. Orientation crystal by 60 words; no teleports. Single-scene default met. The final image reweights every prior “truthful lie,” satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Quartz arbor, frosted windshield, and prism micro-setting constrain every tactical angle of the light experiment; frost patterns literally dictate the final knowledge. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—cold glass, spectral splash, metallic snap—never tourist catalog. Environment evolves with causal event (ice thickens as night deepens). One minor drift: “pale, crystalline stone he had built” repeats quartz image; could trim.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—will the prism reveal her emotional trace?—tightens when frost magnifies optical resolution, foreclosing poetic interpretation. Agency is sustained attention/renunciation rather than external antagonist; cost is the irreversible swap of love-myth for bolt-diagram. Escalation is Accumulative: ice, light, and pattern density increase until only mechanical truth remains. No coincidence; the revelation is apparatus-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the cruelty of materialism vs. the human need for sentimental narrative. No overt thesis; final image is the schematic, not a moral. Subtextual irony—he “communes” with a witness that cares nothing for humans—lands through event, not assertion. Resists tidy binaries: the prism’s truth is both victory and devastation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s scientific-mystic perceptual filter; diction (“spectral essence,” “sheared bolt”) matches his hybrid lexicon. No head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for ritual, staccato for revelation. Free-indirect compression under stress (“a tiny vessel of a cold, mechanical truth”) is clean. Filter verbs are voice-motivated, not clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“canvas of impossible, feathery detail” condenses visual+texture in one stroke. Strong verbs (sheathing, splashed, screaming) carry load. No mixed metaphors. Grammar clean; tense stable. Final line’s colon delivers closure with snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “object imbued with memory” trope and flips it: memories are engineering diagrams, not hearts. Specificity—quartz arbor, sheared steering-column schematic—makes the concept inimitable. Risky refusal to gratify sentimental expectation pays off thematically. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
