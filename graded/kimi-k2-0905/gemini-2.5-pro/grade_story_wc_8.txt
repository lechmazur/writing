<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Thorne’s calm, historian-dialectic persona is sharply drawn via embodied micro-shifts (measured metronome voice; forward-lean on bench). Elara’s tension lives in tactile grip on the case and the visible millstone moment. Their status flip is cleanly legible and motivated. Voice diction converges only slightly under stress; interiority stays concrete, no label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: because/therefore chain (petal → task begun, parallels → Elara’s surrender) holds to closure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Ashworth precedent reframes her duty, felt cost in her millstone shift. Orientation locked by 80 words; no teleport of props. Ivy image recurs as coherent constraint, softening earlier metaphor without break. Persistent constraint: Thorne must now carry public revelation—price acknowledged in final clause.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Station rendered through selective decay: ivy-choked glass, cracked tiles, dust motes. Details funnel through Thorne’s curator eye, guiding bench distance, ticket grille, spatial anchoring. Ivy as living metaphor constrains the moral choice rather than ornamenting. Environment frames micro-movements and supplies the charged final image of suffocation, participating in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake – authenticity vs civic peace – signalled with petal beat. Ashworth parallel tightens the vice, turning “peace” into structural weakness; Elara’s option shrinks to surrender or societal fracture. Agency: Thorne’s rhetorical engineering forces her concession; cost legible in her resigned click. No coincidence; escalation is knowledge-driven narrowing of safe paths; price is transferred responsibility to Thorne.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—corrosive cost of foundational myths—emerges through analogy rather than thesis; Ashworth Collapse functions as historical mirror that reweights Elara’s loyalty. Subtext: ivy = slow strangulation, not growth. Final image answers the central question silently by handing over the gilded V. Avoids sermon; ambiguity rests in unspoken aftermath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Detached, precise diction suits historian POV; diction modulates subtly under pressure (e.g., “hungry thing” breaks academic reserve). Rhythm tightens during parallel examples; longer sentences breathe in reflection. No head-hops; distance remains stable. Dialogue minimal, but Aris’s comparative lecture and Elara’s compressed rebuttal carry distinct cadence and lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: single sentences deliver dual duties (ivy both décor and metaphor). No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (hollow story, rotten roots) cohere. Strong verbs, minimal modifiers. No filter-verb stacks in high-stress beats. Clean mechanics; pronouns unambiguous, tense stable. Only minor register elevation (“gilded cage”) that fits Thorne’s academic lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle: using comparative historiography as narrative weapon instead of heist or exposé. Ivy-enshrouded station as crucible for abstract debate grounds concept in sensory stakes. “Recapture via parallels” method feels non-obvious yet inevitable after set-up. Specifics (Founder’s Accord letter V) prevent generic anywhere setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Historian’s comparative method creates the decisive turn by weaponizing the Ashworth precedent; without the lecture, Elara would not yield.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Illuminated letter appears early as sacred burden, mid-scene as evidence under scrutiny, final beat as transferred cost; its physical hand-off closes the negotiation.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Noble lie concept steers every beat: sets stakes, powers Elara’s defense, is dismantled by historian’s parallel, charges the final surrender with moral cost.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Emotionally rational” trait constrains Thorne to dialectic persuasion rather than theft, directly shaping the parallel-lecture tactic that wins the sheet.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recapture action is the climax: Elara’s surrender of the vellum transfers custody and societal burden; story ends once physical document is secured.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drawing parallels method is dramatized in full paragraph, its mechanics shown step-by-step and proven decisive; no other tactic would breach her faith.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Disused station supplies isolation, liminal mood, ivy metaphor for suffocation; location choices (bench distance, ticket grille) shape negotiation geometry and imagery.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Final petal drop timestamps task start and acts as living countdown; petal’s arrival creates urgency and subtle pressure toward closure within single afternoon.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rescue-truth desire is dramatized in opening interior and sustained by refusal to seize relic by force; closure cost shows foreclosed anonymity once truth is loosed.</comment>
