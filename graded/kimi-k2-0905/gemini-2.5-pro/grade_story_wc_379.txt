<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet curator persona is credibly particularized through tactile locket-handling and patient sit-and-listen tactic; interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The final insertion of the locket is an earned micro-choice that visibly costs him social exposure and risks failure, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Secondary neighbors function as pressure-sources rather than relationship crucible, acceptable at this length. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc is linear rather than torn, keeping it just below the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: locket discovery → neighbor listening → pattern recognition → lock opened; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—Elias’s public gamble could have failed and now binds him to communal memory. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within first 80 words; no penalty. Lens stays causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Courtyard is sketched via coffee scent, damp earth, brick wall—selective, not touristy. The locket doubles as micro-setting and constraint, its filigree literally shaping the final act, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as neighbors orbit Elias. Weather mention (“dawn”) is brief but sufficient for timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community fabric vs. bureaucratic intrusion—is signaled early. Stakes tighten once: drill threat → possible irreversible damage to memory. Elias’s agency (listening, pattern-match) drives the reversal; no coincidence resolves. Cost is present but lightweight—social embarrassment rather than lasting loss—so escalation stops short of 8-band intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges organically from beats, never stated. Final image of neighbors swapping Eleanor stories reweights the locket from artifact to seed of communal renewal. Ambiguity is preserved—no moral is pronounced. The ribbon-bound letters reprise the “locked memory” motif with quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: worn silver, reedy hum, thumb-polished pattern. Syntax is clean, slightly antique cadence suits curator without drifting into purple. No head-hopping. Dialogue snippets carry subtext (Mrs. Petrov’s “key to her heart” is data and eulogy). Voice doesn’t modulate much under stress, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, scaffolding-free; sentences often double-duty (e.g., “silver worn smooth by a thumb long since turned to dust” sets object history and Elias’s reverence). No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Minor template echo: three consecutive “[Name] said” attributions mid-page, but not in closure beat. High information density throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The locket-as-key twist feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight; filigree pattern seeded early. “Leads by following” reverses typical sleuth trope without gimmickry. Community-garden payoff is specific to this courtyard, not generic altruism. Still, premise is essentially cozy-mystery miniature; risk level modest.</comment>
