<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet-versus-loud conviction is concrete and embodied; the vial cork acts as a tactile extension of his mother-memory, grounding interiority. The “gentle scream” contradiction is felt in body and image, not labels. His renunciation of Hemlock’s shouting path is visible and costs him the last of the scent, yet the moment of agency is slightly under-dramatized—held internally rather than staged as a micro-choice we watch him wrestle with aloud or in gesture. Still, flaws are character-specific and the endurance leaves a palpable residue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: because Elias believes the lens can filter intent, therefore he risks the vial; because he releases the scent, the freighter finds a path—earned, not coincidence. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the captain’s sensory echo re-prices the premise, proving whispers travel. Orientation is clean by line 10; the single transition (dawn arrival) is legible. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the captain’s garden-memory line. The beat could tighten further: the ship’s arrival drifts slightly toward fait-accompli rather than last visible beat of Elias’s will.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse, predawn bruise-colors, and porous cork create a tactile micro-setting that constrains action: only the lens offers a conduit, only the cork supplies ammo. The sea and fog are filtered through Elias’s selective attention—smell as navigation tool—mirroring internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds: vial-to-lens, lens-to-sea, ship-to-shoal track cleanly. Weather shift (heat wave → cool dawn) is causal, not backdrop, enabling the fog that tests Elias’s thesis. Detail is selective, never touristic; one more sensory anchor from the engine-room or deck could nudge it into 8+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove quiet can save—signals early and tightens once: the freighter’s bell tolls relief only if Elias’s whisper-thread succeeds. No external antagonist beyond fog; pressure is situational, forcing stance crystallization. Agency is renunciation/endurance: he spends the last of the garden scent, foreclosing retreat to Hemlock’s method. Cost is present but conceptual; a sharper visceral price (burned hand, lens glare migraine) would push higher. Still, the single meaningful tightening satisfies the length allowance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sensory proof: quiet intent outperforms brute force. No character lectures the reader; the captain’s “wife’s garden” line supplies the resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity is preserved—was it lens magic or psychology?—inviting reflection without moral tag. The jasmine motif re-weights from safety memory to public salvation, satisfying recurrence without checklist tokenism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perception is colored by his scent-memory bias and lighthouse intimacy. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“He didn’t think of a ship…”) then widens to lyrical long sentences post-resolution, mirroring emotional dilation. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids filter verbs and therapy-speak. Voice distinctiveness peaks in the oxymoron “gentle scream,” whose risk pays off because it is immediately embodied as action.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm flexes with scene breath; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent (held breath released = air; bruise = color) without mixed-vehicle collisions. Information density is high: one sentence often layers scent-memory, lens lore, and intent. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive; minor opportunity to trim adjectives “predawn bruise of purple and indigo” to shave one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “scent as invisible lighthouse beam” is a fresh synthesis of familiar magic-lens trope and aromatherapy folklore, not a retread. Elias’s stance—quiet as technology—flips standard heroic bellowing without framing it as moral superiority. Specificity of night-blooming jasmine versus generic “flower” keeps the concept rooted. Risk is moderate; a more dangerous social cost (Hemlock’s scorn made explicit) would deepen originality.</comment>
