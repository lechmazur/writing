<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s pacifist silence-curator is vivid—his synesthetic tasting of frequencies, his refusal to read the diary, the micro-choice to turn the dial “past the measured increments” all embody a coherent, idiosyncratic interiority. The only bar to 9-band is that the core contradiction (pacifist vs. celebratory fireworks) stays observational; he never actively risks or forfeits anything visible on the page once the clasp clicks. Still, the renunciation of reading supplies a credible, quiet cost and keeps him credibly flawed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each frequency-tuning pass layers density until the pattern breaks with the clasp’s click; the closing image reweights both diary and fireworks under a new “perfect piece of quiet.” Orientation, causality, and cost are cleanly legible. The clasp’s audible snap plus the shelf-label “Unwavering Devotion” give undeniable conceptual cost; the lens holds without wobble.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The workshop’s ozone-and-paper scent, velvet-cushion center, and calipers-on-brass micro-moves texture every beat; the pin-prick stars outside mirror the interior “velvet fabric” of night, converging in the final glass-rattle under fireworks. The diary-as-micro-setting constrains the climactic action and charges the final label. Only a hairline slip: fireworks’ physics (concussive blast) is noted once, not exploited for tactic change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the hush”—is signaled early; pressure ratchets through each rejected frequency until the lone viable void forecloses further search. The clasp’s click is the visible price, paid on-page. cost is unmistakable. One tightening suffices for this length; no extraneous reversals or coincidences dilute agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accrual of silences—grandmother’s, town’s, diary’s—culminating in the labeled shelf that reframes secrecy as devotion rather than suppression. No moral is stated; the final image of Elias watching explosions “from his window” reconfigures noise as counterpoint to conserved quiet, delivering Conceptual Repricing. The emotional aftertaste lingers without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias’s synesthetic register: “tasting of sharp, metallic anger,” hearing “lonely foghorn.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“With a surge of insight, he twisted…”—yet never loses clarity. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk; perceptual signature is consistent and idiosyncratic enough to be memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with tuning hums; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Metaphors stay physically coherent (foil-bite, sun-warmed stone). Information density high—“copper wires, thin as spun hair” does triple duty (visual, tactile, scale). Only micro-slip: “theatrical sincerity” is named, not shown, but it’s a single phrase and doesn’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “silence-collecting pacifist” premise is fresh; synesthetic frequency-dial as empathic tool transforms familiar grandma-diary trope into a non-obvious ritual. Risk—renouncing the actual words—pays off emotionally and conceptually. Specificity of ozone, brass calipers, and labeled shelf make the concept inseparable from this story; swap any detail and the resonance collapses.</comment>
