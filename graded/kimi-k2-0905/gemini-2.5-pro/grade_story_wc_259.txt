<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “tapestry of unconventional connections” is dramatized in the unrepeatable ritual sequence. The contradictory impulses (know vs. become the vessel) coexist in the same beats, not alternating summaries. The final micro-choice—soft sigh that is half-surrender, half-triumph—carries visible cost: her reflection is no longer solely hers. The only minor slip is “anguished joy” as label-speak mid-climax, but it is immediately enfleshed by the tear, so the moment survives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the pagoda calms, her composite reflection makes the conceptual cost undeniable, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Causality is tight: because she avoids patterns, therefore the Aethel purify and inhabit her. The archive orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. No teleporting props or retro-patches. The ending image reweights the whole premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda functions as micro-setting: its glow, scent, and projected histories constrain every ritual move and charge the final reflection. Archive is sketched with saffron veil, fissure light, ozone—selective, not catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: hand-panel-glyph sequences track without drift. Environment mirrors internal state (soft luminescence vs. her internal storm) without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“pursue forbidden knowledge”—tightens into “become the vessel.” One meaningful deepening: the purification succeeds but reveals the civilization’s sublimation, narrowing her future to eternal vesselhood. Escalation is textural: each unpredictable gesture intensifies the pagoda’s response and the density of foreign memories. Cost is legible: loss of singular identity, paid on the page in the composite reflection.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: nostalgia as narcotic perfection that erases future. The final image—scholar entombed inside resurrected memories—reweights the premise. No moralizing; the tear is concrete particular. Ambiguity is coherent: she wins knowledge but loses self, a counter-reading that resists tidy despair or triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: academic precision (“fine silk a flimsy barrier”) collides with lyric compression (“atoms of nostalgia”). Rhythm accelerates during ritual—fragments, em-dashes, percussive verbs—then exhales into the long last sentence. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Diction stays within scholar-lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Varied sentence lengths create ritual pulse. Metaphors (“tomb of wonders,” “sublimated into memory”) are precise and non-contradictory. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested: anchor voice and re-charge the veil/reflection motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>“Atoms of nostalgia” as literal plot device is fresh; purification-via-anti-pattern is non-obvious yet inevitable. Civilization that chooses eternal echo over messy present is a conceptual flip that reweights standard lost-world tropes. Specificity—discordant humming, vector-unique touches—makes the ritual unrepeatable. Risky second-person echo of An-Korin memories pays off in the composite reflection.</comment>
