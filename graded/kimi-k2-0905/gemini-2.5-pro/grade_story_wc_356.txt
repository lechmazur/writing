<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Interiority is concrete, sensory-anchored, and character-specific; the nose-as-tool trait is shown, not told, and drives the climax under wind-assault. The “still point” choice is earned by prior visceral beats and carries visible cost—she must endure migraine-level pain and forego escape. No stock therapy-speak; perceptions deteriorate credibly under sensory overload. The only minor slip: the shift from “ambitious herbalist” to Zen-like acceptance is almost frictionless—one extra contradiction on the page would have lifted this to 9 territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final wrapping-paper doodle reweights every prior scent-note into a crystallized new stance, cost paid in the “wildflower hush” that now frames her future. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of scent densities and doodled spirals tightens until the single still-image releases pressure. No teleporting props; the seed, wind, and paper are tracked without gaps. The only hairline nick: “the turning of the tide’s thought” is named late; the metaphoric rule-set could have been seeded one beat earlier to earn full 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The treetop village is not postcard scenery; swaying bridges and neighbor chimes become visceral obstacles during the wind assault, constraining her ability to shelter the seed. Micro-settings—terratta pot, moss cradle, wrapping-paper canvas—are handled in tactile, lived-in ways that alter tactics (she can’t flee the stench because escape means dropping the pot). Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: every odor is filtered through her hyper-nose and ranked by threat to the seed. Final image of “wildflower hush” is environment-as-emotional-state, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—grow the corpse flower without losing sensory sanity—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the wind storm threatens both seed and self. The meaningful deepening is the sensory barrage that forces her to choose: endure olfactory agony or abandon the quest; she pays in real pain, narrowing future options. Escalation is textural, not causal—density of smells increases until pattern breaks into stillness—perfectly aligned with inferred lens. Cost is on-page: “pain bloomed behind her eyes,” confirming price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through olfactory imagery and doodle patterns: knowledge is not harvested but received by still attention. No character ever moralizes; the closest we get is the final “quiet partnership,” which is image, not assertion. Ambiguity is preserved—she may still fail to bloom the flower, but her stance toward failure has repriced. The wrapping-paper motif reweights from childhood quirk to existential map, satisfying recurrence test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—every sentence smells, swirls, or spirals. Rhythmic control mirrors wind gusts: long perfumed clauses build, then fracture into short anchor-phrases (“still point”) under peak assault. No head-hopping; unreliability is impossible because knowledge is strictly nose-bound. Diction (“quiescent,” “malodorous”) sits inside a trained herbalist’s lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often carries scent-data, emotional valence, and world lore simultaneously. Mixed-metaphor watch passes—wind as both “riot” and “sighing exhalation” is earned by prior plant-personification. Zero paraphrase loops; each odor note adds new threat information. Minor scaffold: “the thought of the flower’s eventual…stench was a distant storm cloud” repeats the earlier storm-cloud conceit—−0.2, not fatal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower cultivation via hyperosmia in a swaying ironwood city is fresh synthesis; no genre template matches. The wrapping-paper journal sidesteps the leather-bound cliché and becomes structural—final doodle is climax, not ornament. Risk taken: climax is renunciation of control rather than bloom, avoiding expected triumph. Proximity check shows no echo of famous scenes; olfactory still-point is new myth.</comment>
