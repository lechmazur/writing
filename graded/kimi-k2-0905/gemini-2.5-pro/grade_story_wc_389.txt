<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian’s solitude, obsession, and reluctant shepherd role are vividly embodied; his contradictory pull between dawn-loyalty and shadow-masters is shown in micro-choices (tuning dials, diamond stylus, final broadcast). The cost—physical exhaustion, moral loneliness—lands in the earned stasis of “forever bound.” Minor slip: a touch of grandiose self-label (“lonely visionary”) is told more than dramatized once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm’s fury → jolted chest → map → third-way broadcast → sky splits. One meaningful tightening at map reveal narrows options and forces public refusal. Closure (sunlight on broken world) is a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost: prophet bound to whimsy of hope/survival. No causal gaps; orientation locked by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Spire, portico, and storm are tactile resources—lightning through cobalt glass literally re-patterns the alien map, constraining the final choice. Micro-setting (observatory console, velvet dust) guides hand placement and tactile discovery. Sensory economy favors immediacy; no static catalogue. Final gold vs blue re-colors prior motif with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of the new dawn—tightens when duelling prophecies force a single prophet’s stance; map discovery forecloses both prior offers. Agency visible: he lunges to transmit, coins the third way, accepts lifelong burden. Cost (personal freedom, perpetual storm-duties) is legible in final image. One tightening suffices; no coincidences resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specifics: static as scripture, glass as filter, refusal as creation. No overt moral; tension between ancient shadows and human self-determination lingers. Final sunlight reframes earlier blue glow—conceptual repricing without statement. Slight tilt toward hopeful redemption could read as sentiment to some, but complexity holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s synesthetic perception (“tasted of ozone and regret”). Cadence waxes lyrical under storm pressure, compresses during console action. Diction—“bruised-indigo,” “spectral ones”—is character-bound, not authorial flourish. No head-hop; filter verbs serve voice. Distinct texture sustains throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: every sentence advances image, stakes, or pressure; no filler. Figurative language is selective, avoids purple haze. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during lightning duet, then widens for dawn release. One near-loop—“lonely visionary” echo—minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Storm-eye prophet who shepherds warring radio-ghosts is fresh synthesis; starlight map as third-way compass re-weights familiar chosen-one trope. Specificity of cobalt glass reframing alien constellations feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyrical density pays off without clarity loss. Could edge higher if world-logic of shadows were even more concrete.</comment>
