<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete (chess-piece thumb-press, channel-digging calculus) and his micro-choices alter the environment, but the “why” never tightens beyond the abstract desire to “serenade monotony.” No visible cost or contradiction is dramatized; he exits unchanged, so the renunciation feels ornamental rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mural’s momentary star-gleam reweights the arcade’s mundane decay with undeniable aesthetic cost. Causal chain (bishop → water → coin-pusher → projector → mural) is tight and visible; each beat advances the domino. The lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural, held to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory (hissing tide, metallic sigh of tokens, star-chalk floor pools) and physically guides the payoff: puddle, floorboard flex, machine leg. The tidal arcade is more than backdrop—it supplies the hydraulic force that enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the wager that randomness can be bent into beauty; pressure deepens as each micro-intervention (channel, coin, bishop prism) tightens the probability field. The final illumination is the visible cost—monotony shattered, audience awed—so escalation coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: beauty as engineered accident, art without audience. No statement, only image-argument carried by the mural’s fleeting glow. The reconfiguration is felt—mundane arcade briefly transfigured—offering resonant ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s analytic sensorium; diction (“silver tongue licking foundations,” “polished mitre”) is precise, tactile, and consistent. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure, mirroring his calculus-to-wonder shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with tide cadence; sentences vary length to mirror water build-up. One mixed metaphor (“spear of light” after “wind chimes”) is minor; no loops or scaffold. Information density high—each sentence does scenic + atmospheric work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: street-magician engineer hijacks tidal physics to create guerrilla public art. Bishop-as-prism, coin-pusher as kinetic sculpture, mural as accidental canvas—each trope is repurposed rather than decorated. Risk heightens coherence, not gimmickry.</comment>
