<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—living ghost vs. bureaucratic death—but the “ghost in the world of the living” line drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting embodiment. Micro-choices (ink, shard, pulse-count) are concrete and character-specific; the final shift from curse to space is earned. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived. The heartbeat tic is dramatized, not merely announced, anchoring her unique temporal sovereignty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the darkness-between-stars map reweights her own bureaucratic void into livable space, with felt cost (the ink collapse = connection lost). Causal lens holds: each ink-gesture is a because/therefore attempt to summon Aris; the chart’s appearance is the tightening that narrows her life-meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by word 80; no penalty. One shard transition (ink pool → star chart) is taught early enough to be legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Opal observatory, snow burial, and slate-as-terminal are specific, integrated, and constrain her tools (no standard keyboard). The porcelain shard’s tactile edge recurs, charging the final image when laid down. Cold, silence, and ink viscosity filter through her heartbeat perception, satisfying micro-setting rule. Spatial choreography is tight: console → slate → lens-axis alignment tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract usable wisdom from Aris’s failure—signals early and escalates through each ink trial. The star-chart breakthrough is the meaningful tightening that reconfigures her life-option from curse to chosen void. Cost is visible: hours of cold, failed fractals, and the final severance of connection. Agency remains hers; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of absence as architecture: darkness > stars, error > possibility. Subtext resides in the shard’s journey—from dropped teacup to stylus to post-vision relic—without overt statement. No final-paragraph sermon; the last heartbeat count lets the reader reprice her life. The porcelain’s gleam against snow mirrors the internal reconfiguration, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s sensorium; no head-hop. Lexicon stays within her observatory-tech range (“data banks,” “defragment”) without academic drift. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“seventy-one, seventy-two” acts as internal metronome. Free indirect slips are clean: “She was a clerical error” carries her own sardonic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long fluid lines to staccato pulse-counts, matching scene temperature. No filter-verb clusters; ink, shard, and snow are shown through action. One mixed metaphor—“starless-night ink”—reads intentional and paid off by the void-star inversion. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines bureaucratic undeath with data-ghost séance via ink-fractal interface—fresh synthesis. The void-as-architecture insight flips standard star-cult trope. Porcelain shard retooled as stylus and relic feels inevitable, not quirky. Risk in method (liquid chaos as terminal) is fully committed to and paid off in closure image.</comment>
