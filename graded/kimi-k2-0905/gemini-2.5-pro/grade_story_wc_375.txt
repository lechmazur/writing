<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drives—photorealistic skill vs. creative starvation—are embodied in the charcoal under his nails and the safecracker delicacy at the lock; the final tear carries visible cost, earning the shift from replication to origination.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: failed forced lock → years of blockage → painting-as-diagram → color-sequence key → pigment gift; closure lands with conceptual cost (“paint the light by which he saw”) under a single lens, no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Crystal refraction sequence literally unlocks the box; cave light filters every beat, from shimmering floor to phosphorescent pigment, constraining the final choice and charging the tear’s glint—setting is agent, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—creative suffocation vs. release—tightens once: the lock’s internal pins become the physical test; success costs the safety of mere replication and forecloses portrait-for-hire identity, price legible in the star-like tear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “seeing vs. revealing” emerges through pigment, light, and lock; the final image reweights earlier portraits as mere tracings without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity about what original light Elias will now paint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—charcoal grit, crystal glint, tumbler clicks; syntax lengthens for awe, shortens for lock tension; no head-hopping, diction stays within his artistic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fine charcoal dust under his fingernails a gritty reminder” does triple duty (sensory, occupation, guilt); no scaffold loops, metaphors coherent (“auroral sorrow”), final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mnemonic portraitist forced to unpaint reality to free creativity is fresh; color-sequence key derived from refracted cave light transforms standard “mentor’s last gift” trope; specificity of phosphorescent pigments grounds invention.</comment>
