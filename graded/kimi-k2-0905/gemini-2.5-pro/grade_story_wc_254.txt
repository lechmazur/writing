<comment>Kael’s interiority is richly textured—“cloud-shadow poet” is shown through his sensorial, boundary-dissolving quest, not told. Micro-choices (softening self-edges, breathing the hum into verse) embody the aesthetic drive and carry visible cost: he trembles, shivers, is altered. The “tremor of certainty” climax is earned by prior causality and reframes his vocation with felt stakes. Interior contradiction could be sharper early on, but the arc lands credibly.</comment>

<comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: because the ban lifts ∴ Kael enters; because he surrenders self ∴ he decodes the colonnade; because he decodes it ∴ he gains a blueprint and loses prior certainty. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the hum is not madness but “measure,” authority’s fear exposed. Cost is legible in bodily tremor and the blank frozen lake now re-weighted as “blank page.” Minor waver: orientation could be anchored 20–30 words sooner; still legible by ~130.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt atrium, frozen lake, quartz pillars are not backdrop: the cold presses skin, the hum vibrates bone, the emptiness flips from threat to invitation. “Lantern-moth hush” and mineral cadence filter through Kael’s perceptual bias. The colonnade itself functions as tool and adversary, constraining his method (must dissolve boundaries to read it). Final image—lake as blank page—crystallizes setting into closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can he translate the forbidden frequency without losing himself? Escalation is steady: muffled steps → hum in teeth → identity fraying → crystalline certainty. One meaningful tightening: the moment self/colonnade boundary frays, foreclosing old interpretive safety. Cost is visible (shivering, foreboding silence re-cast) but could be sharper—no live external consequence or irreversible forfeiture beyond internal shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art’s power to dissolve authoritarian edicts through ungovernable perception. Subtext lives in images—quartz blueprint vs. regime’s “chaotic” label; silence re-cast from absence to presence. No explicit moral; final line offers charged poise rather than thesis. Could benefit from one earlier counter-image of regime fear to deepen irony, but resonance is intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s sensorium; perceptual signature (“fleeting and half-seen”) pervades syntax and metaphor. Rhythmic control heightens with pressure—short clauses mirror bone-hum, then elongate into crystalline verse cadence. No head-hopping; diction remains within poet-biased lexicon. Filter verbs minimal and justified. Final cadence “lantern-moth hush” reprises opening tone, now re-weighted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence layers sensation, metaphor, and information without scaffolding. Figurative language sustains mineral/music motif without mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts purposeful. Micro undercuts: one near-coincidence of “silence” thrice in 40 words; negligible. Read-aloud ear test passes; momentum breathes with Kael’s surrender rather than stalling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geologic-poetic vocabulary with forbidden-architecture SF trope feels fresh. “Paraphrase tectonics into line break” offers a non-obvious method; transformation test fails if relocated to generic fantasy. Risk—lyric interiority—heightens stakes without gimmick. Minor proximity to “forbidden zone” trope, but specificity of quartz grammar and aesthetic pilgrimage reframes it.</comment>
