<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stuntman’s adaptive core is dramatized in the moment he turns the decrypted failsafe on Julian; trembling-with-certainty is a credible embodied cost. Interiority is sharply particular (“a ghost he had programmed”) and the contradictory impulses—terror of height vs hunger for truth—coexist in the shelf climb. The plaster-cast cipher is a lovely vulnerability-made-tool, but the emotional leap from “phantom limb of a past” to “greatest source of power” is asserted rather than shown through micro-choice, keeping the arc just shy of the 8.5+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a crisp Decisive Change: the containment command triggers red lights and sirens, Julian’s smile flips to terror, and the shell falls silent—cost is visible and auditory. Causal chain holds: shell-whisper → library panel → cast cipher → pier sabotage; each beat tightens options. The “ten-meter drop” and “three days since” anchors arrive before the 120-word mark, orientation clean. One hairline slip: the emergency command is introduced as a forgotten failsafe only at the moment of use;虽然 earlier beats justify its existence, the reveal still feels slightly convenient rather than earned foreshadowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rusted girders, distant stars, and the cold metal shelf create an immediate tactile environment that doubles as acrophobia engine. The child-size plaster cast is handled, rotated, and decoded under starlight; its smudged surface literally rewrites the night’s possibilities, satisfying the 9+ object-as-setting gate. Spatial choreography is flawless—panel behind encyclopedias, ten-meter drop, headlights slicing the entrance—every prop stays tracked. Library-as-ruin is sketched with just three brushstrokes, yet each return to the stars (Orion’s belt = ‘A’) keeps the cosmos pressing on the cipher, welding atmosphere to plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—erasure vs self-proof—signals early and escalates through each shell-whisper and cipher line. The midpoint decryption of the cast is the meaningful tightening: it converts nostalgic pain into tactical agency and flips the escape route into a trap. Cost is legible in the final image—Julian’s terror and the protagonist’s trembling certainty—options have narrowed to a single red-flashing pier. Pressure stays causal under the Hero’s adaptive drive; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: strings cut by the very puppet who realizes he can rewire the stage. The conch half moves from luck charm to voice of erased childhood to silent witness, reweighting memory as weapon. Vulnerability-as-power is dramatized, not declared, when a cracked child’s cast becomes the key to an adult’s survival. Final image—trembling with certainty—avows ambiguity: power born of phantom pain still trembles, refusing a moral aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is razor-sharp: “the cold metal…bit into my palms,” “a spray of distant stars,” “the rusted floor fell away.” Syntax tightens under stress—fragments like “This was real.” punch against longer reflective coils. No filter-verb stacks; every verb is strong (“keyed,” “flashed,” “vanished”). Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: Julian’s actor-smile versus the hero’s inner script. Voice stays inside the stuntman’s lexicon—no academic register drift—even while decrypting a cipher, achieving rare lyric propulsion without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “spray of distant stars” marries visual scale to emotional vertigo. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors (“ghost he had programmed”) stay singular and coherent. One tiny overwriting puff—“a certainty that felt like an earthquake in my soul”—is forgiven because it’s immediately grounded in the tactile act of decoding. Mechanics clean; pronoun tracking immaculate even when “he” switches between Julian and memory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The memory-wiped stuntman trope is refreshed by making the trigger object a child’s hospital cast scrawled with a star-cipher invented by the erased self. Conch-whisper as breadcrumb tech feels new, yet the emotional core—orphaned self parenting the adult body—transcends gimmick. Risk is taken by staging the climax on a library shelf instead of a pier shoot-out, and it pays off: altitude phobia becomes the crucible where vulnerability flips to mastery. Synthesis feels inevitable only after the final silence of the shell.</comment>
