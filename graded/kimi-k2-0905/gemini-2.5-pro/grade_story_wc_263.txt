<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—craving silence yet addicted to the same cosmic static she transcribes—remains vivid and embodied; the final shift from erasing noise to drawing faces is earned because the instrument has already externalized her stance. Motivation stays character-specific: the “trapped creativity” is never abstract, it’s the brass-smudged fingers and smoked-glass etchings we watched. Cost is legible: she abandons the shielding machine and commits to witness, a renunciation that stings. Hairline slip: “ancestral echo from before she was human” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting the peak beat by a whisker.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valley’s static is re-valued from torment to hymn, and that reweighting is visible in the charcoal touching stone. Accumulative lens holds—each etched meteor tightens the pattern until the cadence breaks into silence-then-song; no causal cheats. Orientation is swift: basalt arch, aurora, fifth shower—all within 60 words. Persistent constraint survives: she will keep hearing every unspoken lament; the price shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The brass-and-lens “soul-scribe” operates as micro-setting: its geared resistance determines the speed of her meditation and the moment she pushes it aside. Aurora light is not wallpaper; it supplies the green-violet palette that reappears in the charcoal lines on stone, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, turning gears, setting stylus, then reaching for satchel—no ghost limbs. One hairline slip: “wind-hewn archway of black basalt” is generic tourist phrasing amid otherwise idiosyncratic detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence vs. creative witness—tightens through density, not reversals: each etched streak subtracts psychic mass until the pattern breaks and witness becomes the only remaining option. Pressure is accumulative; the “impossible brightness” meteor acts as pattern-break, not coincidence, forcing the re-cognition that collapses her binary. Cost is legible: she forfeits the protective ritual and embraces unshielded empathy. Could edge higher if a mid-scene micro-loss (smashed plate, bloodied finger) had materialized to foreshadow the final forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of noise into cosmic plainsong; no character sermonizes. The stardust motif is not decorative—it reweights the premise at closure, turning every villager’s ache into legitimate verse. Ambiguity lingers: she may be overwhelmed again, but now the burden reads as sacred rather than pathological. Final charcoal sketch offers non-literal answer: witness, not erasure, is her art.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: brass polish, grinding friction of resentment, brittle fear—diction is hers. Syntax lengthens under aurora rapture, then fractures into short clauses when the meteor hits, mirroring cardiac rhythm. No head-hopping; astronomical lexicon remains within the autodidact astronomer’s range. One minor echo: “shadowed rapture” is stated rather than rendered through cadence, a hairline timbre slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: long anaphoric sentences for cosmic drift, then staccato fragments at the reveal. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—static as smothering blanket, stardust as forgotten hymn; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: “brass-smudged fingers and starlight” does tactile-visual double duty. Only micro-loop: “unspoken words…silent hum…unspoken resentments” in paragraph one; adjacent restatement costs a tenth.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of psychic disability and meteor-shower transcription feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope catalog matches it. The “remembered stardust” concept reprises panspermia but is localized through smoked-glass etchings and charcoal faces, making the cosmic intimate. Risky second-person cosmic memory pays off because it is framed as sensory shock, not exposition. Transformation test: swap out any component (aurora, brass instrument, charcoal) and the final image collapses—proof of organic invention.</comment>
