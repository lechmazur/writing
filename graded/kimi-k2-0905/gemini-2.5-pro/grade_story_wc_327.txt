<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory interiority—“I knew they were wrong” vs. elders’ credo—grounds the arc; embodied copper-veined sensation replaces label-speak. Micro-choice to twist the diamond at the spiral is earned by years of texture-reading obsession. Cost is palpable: lifelong solitude, trembling hands, the canyon’s breath held. Voice stays individual; no stereotype or safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of texture→sound builds density until spiral rupture reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—silence then single tone—undeniable conceptual cost: language reborn but audience still zero. Orientation anchors by line 3; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint: diamond’s fracture must align or fails; this shapes every prior attempt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone-tower materiality constrains final alignment choice; chill shadow, grit sandstone act as micro-phrases. Spatial choreography clean: precipice, wind, hand-tremor track without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys copper-veined POV—world felt more than seen. Environment charges closure image: tower’s own texture becomes first word.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save language—tightens when starlings’ spiral offers one fleeting alignment; failure equals eternal noise. Escalation is density accrual: each texture read raises stakes for the final filter-act. Visible price: solitude, years of trial, trembling hands; cost legible on-page. Coincidence absent; spiral is legible grammar he trained to see.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: meaning inheres in matter, not breath. No moralizing; final image of bone-toned word is non-literal answer. Subtext of colonized language and cultural extinction is felt, not stated. Repricing clear: language reborn but community still extinct—complex irony lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—“mapped skin,” “world felt more than seen”—remains distinct under pressure. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses for echo-storm, then single-sentence silence. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Diction stays within plausible self-taught lexicon; no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances texture or sound. Metaphors organic—“river of black ink”—without muddle. High density: vertebra=word, grit=phrase. Final line recharges opening loneliness with earned reversal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: texture-to-phonics via starling syntax; no precedent clone. Risk—lyric stillness as climax—paid off by conceptual repricing. Irreversible specifics: copper-veins, iron-starlings, bone-tower tone. Premise fully committed; no retreat to safe trope.</comment>
