<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet resolve and unwavering interiority feel lived-in; the “strangely honest” trait is shown through the pavilion rebuke, not told. The lone micro-choice—descending the spiral—carries visible cost (the mental “staggering weight” of the offering), earning his Earned Stasis. No secondary character pressure on-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Internal contradiction is present but muted; still, the restraint fits the hermetic arc.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the sphere seals the undistorted echo, reweighting the world’s noise vs. preserved truth. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of hush, sand, and light deepens until the cadence shift at the sphere pulse. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no debt. One扣: the parapet’s “psychic frequency” rule is late-introduced, a micro-break that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Desert and machine are rendered through Kael’s bodily attention—sand drag, ceramic cool, lens glow—never catalogued. The parapet itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the finale; without its obsidian rings the sealing is impossible. Spatial choreography is flawless: spiral descent, center stance, sphere coalescence. Sensory hierarchy narrows to breath and light under pressure, matching the whisperfield calm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—purity of teaching vs. communal distortion—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each grain of sand, each lens glint, intensifies the cost of preserving truth. The tightening beat is the offering itself, foreclosing any future re-interpretation by freezing the echo. Price is the “staggering mental weight,” visible in the moment; no higher reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the parable of salt-in-water: interpretation dissolves clarity unless crystallized. The final sphere is the non-literal answer—truth preserved in vacuum, no moral stated. Subtext lives in Kael’s silence after his single reprimand; the quiet is the stance. Resists pat binaries—no verdict on the disciples—yet the cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual signature filtered through Kael’s “peripheral awareness” idiom. Syntax tightens under pressure—“sand began to shiver… a deep, resonant thrum”—without breaking whisperfield calm. No dialogue after the pavilion, so no voice convergence issue. The rhythmic control of long vowel echoes (“loom,” “cool,” “spheres”) mirrors the sonic theme.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and taught: “loom of sound” opens, paid off by the sealed vacuum. Information density high—“kinetic parapet beneath the dunes” delivers world, stakes, and mystery in six words. Register never drifts above Kael’s contemplative lexicon. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating closure via echo rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The conjured-clearing tech fused with desert mysticism feels fresh, not stitched. The prophet’s echo as salt-in-water parable reframes a familiar anxiety about doctrinal drift. Risk is taken in withholding all exposition of the order or the machine; payoff is the image of sealed stillness. Could tip higher if the parapet rules had earlier seed, but the synthesis is already memorable.</comment>
