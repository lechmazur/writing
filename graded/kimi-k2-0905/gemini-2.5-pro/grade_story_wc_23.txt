<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-anchored motives stay legible; the bronze censer foot as tactile talisman embodies his need. Micro-choice—slotting it into the cradle—crystallizes his values, paying the visible cost of accepting perpetual absence. Interiority is concrete yet leans on “geography of loss” abstraction once; still, the embodied tremor in his palm keeps therapy-speak at bay. Closure earns credible endurance: he broadcasts solace he will never receive, a stasis that forecloses self-rescue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each midnight call therefore tightens the build; the final placement of the bronze ignites the signal. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (starlit station, 00:00). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s tear-streaked face under the cold pulse shows conceptual cost: he becomes lighthouse, not rescued father. One soft spot: “frequency of solace is the weight of the bronze” is stated, not shown beforehand, a micro teleport, but it is paid off instantly and does not break chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signal station skeleton, wind moan, starlight solid enough to touch—details filter through Elias’s scavenger eye and grief-narrowed attention. Spatial choreography is clean: gantry climb, cradle center, rooftop dish all track. Micro-setting object—the bronze foot—constrains the climax choice and charges the final image with winter-dawn pulse. No occupational errors; post-fail world rules stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—broadcast a path home while remaining personally lost—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: midnight instruction → serpent/moon alignment → bronze placement, narrowing options to irrevocable activation. Cost is visible: he trades last relic for communal beacon, crystallizing irrevocable solitude. Agency remains proactive throughout; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of solace-through-self-sacrifice emerges via image chain: bronze relic becomes reverse-lighthouse, grief transmuted into navigation for others. Subtext in Elias’s tear-track grime offers mute irony—he guides return though he cannot return. Final image reweights “geography of loss” from personal map to collective compass, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the lost actually hear? Cost is undeniable either way.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—starlight felt as solid, bronze weight as warm hum—remains consistent. Diction favors sibilants and low vowels that mimic wind moan, creating rhythmic cohesion. One compressed phone line—“grinding stars” static—teaches textured elision early and pays off in dish hum. No head-hopping; psychic distance shortens under pressure without syntactic fracture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: scavenged parts, moon phase rule, and emotional stakes packed into single clauses. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for wind moan, short burst for click of bronze. One mixed metaphor “starlight felt solid” is allowed under lyric license and is immediately grounded. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb clutter; closing line “raw solace…enough” is spare yet resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshens post-apocalypse trope by making the survivor build not shelter but a homing signal for returnees who may never arrive. Bronze censer foot as tech-mystic interface fuses sacred relic with radio science, an unpredicted synthesis. Risky lyric compression taught early and justified by grief-heightened perception. Specificity—serpent-tooth peak, bakelite phone—prevents template drift; takeaway image feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
