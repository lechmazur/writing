<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s need to “sandpaper rough memories” is visceral and embodied; the fossil-tasting moment lets contradictory impulses (repulsion / compulsion) collide in real time. The final hand-on-arm beat proves a measurable change: grief transmission stops, showing cost and earned peace. Interiority stays concrete, though one line edges toward diagnostic self-label (“stored remorse”) without full embodiment. Still, the arc from porous sorrow to tempered calm is legible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion dissolves, Kaelen’s contagious touch is neutralized, and the cost is the obliteration of his own emotional ridges. Causal chain holds—fossil → memory-map → dig → subsuming act → nullified grief—each step tightening options. Orientation is anchored by word 70 with wet stone and Warlord entrance; no disorientation serves the ending, so no penalty. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and it lands with unmistakable price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desert fortress, rain-scoured flagstones, and the frigid coral spire are rendered through Kaelen’s chef-tactile lens: temperature, texture, scent drive every beat. The ephemeral puddle “language” and frost-rimed coral constrain his choices—he reads, then acts. Micro-setting (fossil, kitchen pin, frozen motes) functions as environment that alters tactics. Final image of white powder merging with sand recharges the opening bruised-creosote air with new, lighter dust.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Kaelen remain lacerated by others’ grief or achieve impermeable peace?—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as each memory he swallows narrows his physical stamina and spiritual latitude. The subsuming act is an irreversible tactical trade-off: he forfeits his own emotional texture to gain silence. Cost is visible (bones feel pulverized) and persists into the final hand-touch beat. One meaningful tightening is sufficient; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory is edible, sorrow sedimentary, and acceptance requires metabolizing, not erasing. Subtext resides in gesture—neutral hand on arm replaces grinding-stone grip—showing absolution without sermon. The coral pavilion as reliquary of collective regret reweights the earlier “tidal language” into a shared geologic record. No final moral is stated; the white powder drifting into dawn sand offers quiet conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance, filtering every image through Kaelen’s gustatory synesthesia: “tasted…a legion,” “single, clean note.” Syntax lengthens during subsuming blizzard, then shortens to steady calm, mirroring cardiac stress. No head-hopping; Warlord’s interior is accessed only via Kaelen’s touch, preserving POV integrity. One clause drifts toward editorial abstraction (“a people whose ocean had turned to dust”) but recovers with immediate bodily consequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyric: “dunes were weeping, their flanks carved into new shapes” compresses time and emotion without filler. Mixed metaphors are avoided; bruised creosote, grinding stones, sandpapered heart form a coherent tactile constellation. One paraphrase loop appears (“rough memories…smooth to cut” / “edges were too smooth to cut”) but occupies separate paragraphs and serves thematic reprise, so minimal deduction. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during avalanche of motes, then exhales cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of chef craft, paleontology, and emotional virology feels novel yet inevitable: taste becomes cartography, fossils become keys, regret becomes permafrost architecture. The coral ice pavilion subverts desert expectations without violating internal logic. Risk is taken—flash-frozen grotto in a sand-drowned world—but grounded by sensory specificity and causal necessity. Transformation is complete: remove any ingredient (fossil, tidal puddles, subsuming act) and the entire narrative collapses.</comment>
