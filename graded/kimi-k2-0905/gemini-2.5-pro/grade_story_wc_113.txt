<comment>Elias’s mania is vivid—cello case “dark, silent companion,” the program handled like a relic—yet his contradictory reverence/desecration of the score stays mostly asserted. Embodied emotion is strong (heart hammering, chill) but interiority slips into diagnostic labels (“strange creative fever”). Final renunciation earns its poise because the earlier obsession is tactile, even if the micro-choice that tips him is more impulse than layered contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: soaking the program rewrites the ghost’s silence into playable music, cost paid in the artifact’s destruction. Causal chain—stains incomplete → water completes → song revealed—holds. One transition (lanterns out, door open) is legible. Stakes could be sharper earlier; “unravel the code” is the only verbal stake, but the final image reweights it without cheat.</comment>

<comment>Flood-dark mirror, velvet darkness, flickering lanterns: every descriptor is filtered through Elias’s devotional gaze and guides the only possible action—touching water. The opera program itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains the climax; its fiber and ink dictate the method of revelation. Spatial choreography is flawless—lip of pit, glassy surface, door—no floats.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—decode ghost—tightens exactly once when passive reading fails and he risks destroying the text; that single escalation forecloses preservation and forces the coda. Cost is visible: the program dissolves, its linen body lost forever. No reversals needed; the deepening is the irreversible act. Pressure stays situational but coherent under the hush.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmission versus erotic destruction emerges implicitly: art needs ruin to speak. Subtext in the water’s “greed” and the ghost’s exhalation reframes decay as collaboration. No moral spoken; final “distant, living symphony” reweights the prior silence. Line about “wordless conversation” is the lone thematic echo, but it lands early enough to avoid sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at an ecstatic middle distance—precise musical lexicon, yet lyric cadence (“dark mirror,” “unshed tear”). Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens at the soak. No head-hop; perception stays Elias-bound. Filter verbs rare; metaphors organic to venue. Risky repetition of “hush” and “silence” is pattern-taught and paid off when the living city finally intrudes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses—varies sentence length, no template runs. High density: “capillary action was immediate, the water greedily climbing” does three jobs. One mixed metaphor (“ribs of balconies”) is minor. No scaffold, loops, or adverb clutter. Final paragraph’s ceremonial cadence matches solemnity without purple swell. Closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—flood-ruined opera house, score revealed by further soaking—is fresh synthesis of archive-horror and conservation paradox. Turn hinges on the counter-intuitive desecration that completes the work. Could perhaps transpose to another ruined arts venue, but the specificity of cello, Boheme, and water-logged paper keeps it from template. Risk taken with dissolution-as-creation pays off.</comment>
