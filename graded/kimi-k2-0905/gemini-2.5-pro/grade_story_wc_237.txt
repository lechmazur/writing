<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction— scholarly rationalism vs. folkloric surrender— is dramatized in a single, embodied beat: the crow-quill touch that names scars. The crystal-shedding moment feels earned because earlier academic failures were shown, not told. Cost is visible: the fragile clean skin revealed is literally new flesh, foreclosing the old identity. Micro-choices under pressure (“Hesitation,” “Pride,” whispered) keep voice particular; no diagnostic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because inks fail → therefore Elian tries naming; because naming proceeds → crystal softens. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost— the dust-cloud of pain literally leaves his body. Orientation anchored by line 3 (granite platform, suspended sky). No prop teleporting; crow quill purpose is re-weighted, not introduced late. Single transition (memory shard) is legible and pays off at climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating granite disc and abyssal air function as micro-setting that constrains choice: only silence and breath are possible, forcing inward action. Tea-ceremony object— cedar table— is tactile, lived-in. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: chill stone, moss-slick, crisp stillness mirror his internal lattice. Final image recharges the sky-platform: the blank skin is a new page adrift in the same silent blue, re-weighting the arena.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake— transform scars or remain imprisoned by them— is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: when fresh crystal prickles under stress, the clock of held breath becomes finite. Protagonist agency drives the turn— choosing folk naming over scholarly ink— with visible price: glittering dust carries away months of pain. Escalation is internal yet legible; no outside coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: failed inks, whispered names, dust lifting into light. No moralizing; final line offers Conceptual Repricing— “most powerful runes were… spoken from the heart” — re-weighting prior academic premise. Ambiguity remains: scars are gone but memory of their stories lingers. Emotional after-effect is earned via sensory image (flakes of light) rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Elian’s perceptual signature: veins “pulsed with faint, cold light,” diction scholarly yet vulnerable. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress (“captured air burning”). Rhythm mirrors breath cycle— long sentences in stillness, abrupt fragments at prickle. Free indirect style clean: “His scholarly mind raced…” stays within lexicon. Crow-quill handled in tactile, character-specific way.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; sentences vary opening and length. High density: “lattice of old pains and future fears” does triple descriptor duty. Metaphor vehicles logically consistent— storm breath, frost lattice— and payoff at closure. No filter-verb stacks; actions stay in strong verbs. Minor elevated diction (“receding thunderheads”) fits scholar POV and is consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tea ceremony + crystal stress-affliction + rune scholarship feels fresh, not checklist. Grandmother superstition twist is seeded early, paid off with physical consequence. Risk taken in quiet, internal climax yet coherence maintained. Specific detail— quill as stylus not pen— prevents trope recycling. Transformation would collapse if elements swapped, satisfying inevitability test.</comment>
