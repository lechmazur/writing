<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s root-bound stasis and sensory compensation are vivid; the ritual choice to forge a vector rather than find one crystallizes her obsession. Interiority stays embodied (“sap-slowed blood,” “rustle of leaves” voice). Cost is felt: she burns the relic, anchoring the straight path with personal loss. Missing only a sliver of contradiction under peak pressure to hit 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the straight thread reconfigures both dream-space and her tactical reality; cost is the consumed clipping and Kael’s deferred peril. Causal linkage holds—because she heeds Kael’s warning and sacrifices the clipping, the new vector forms. Lens stays situational-pressure; no teleporting rules or soft resets. One minor orientation waiver: “cobalt glade” anchor arrives ~140 words but disorientation serves the later permeability payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Weirwood throne, ozone + moonpetals, and the clipping’s waxy green against twilight blue are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain action—she can’t move, must use what’s within arm’s reach. Micro-setting (her fused bark-legs, the burning clipping) directly shapes the final image. Spatial choreography across psychic link remains coherent. Meets 9-band gate: environment and recurring object charge the closing vector.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“re-knit the frayed edges of existence”—is signaled early and narrows to the single decisive act of forging the straight path. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: from searching for a destination to creating a vector. Agency is clear; cost is the relic’s destruction and Kael’s still-imperiled state. Could edge higher if an additional tangible loss were foregrounded on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fractured time and human responsibility emerges through the clipping’s orderly geometry versus the Dissonance scars; no authorial thesis stated. Final image of the bisecting light offers conceptual repricing: salvation is not found but self-forged. Ambiguity lingers—covenant still broken, task only begun. Earned, not pronounced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is botanical and electric—“lightning frozen on skin,” “sap-slowed blood.” Syntax lengthens under ritual calm, compresses during the psychic storm. No head-hopping; Kael rendered only as sensed flare. Rhythm and diction cohere under pressure, teaching the elision pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and world data (“ozone and night-blooming moonpetals” sets both scent and alien ecology). Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she saw… she knew”) in the Kael link beat keeps it from 9+ band. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and read-aloud fluent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fused human-tree seer using topiary logic to triangulate a handmade timeline vector feels novel yet inevitable. Temporal trauma as shared scar-map links personal bodies to cosmic rupture—fresh synthesis. Risk of static entranced visionary is answered by active forging of the path. Specificity throughout prevents generic eco-fantasy drift.</comment>
