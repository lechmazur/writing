<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet, monastic drive is vividly embodied; every micro-choice (tilting the lens, listening for wind) is tuned to his muteness and vocation. The interior contradiction—creating beauty that must destroy itself—remains mostly implicit, not dramatized in a single beat, so the highest band is just missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each carved facet thickens the “density of wonder” until the final cadence shift liquefies the sculpture into mist. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3; closure is a Charged Poise where the cost—the iceberg’s vaporization—reverberates back through every prior image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bluff, cloud-sea, and ice lenses are not backdrop but instruments; the mobile’s spatial choreography is tracked to the millimeter. The sun catching the thinning shards at crescendo is the micro-setting beat that re-weights all earlier detail, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve color of wonder”—tightens as each shaving of ice literally removes future possibilities. The final updraft is not coincidence but the seasonal trigger Elian has awaited; its arrival forces the irrevocable trade: truth released, vessel lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between permanence (ice) and evanescence (sound); no sentence lectures us. The closing mist is a conceptual repricing: the “color” is now airborne, distributed, un-ownable—an answer that can only be felt, not told.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays exterior yet adopts Elian’s silent rhythm—syntax grows spare, tactile, wind-shaped. No head-hop; the focalization is consistent, the diction precise to a craftsman who feels rather than speaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences perform dual labor: “a low, foundational hum began as the largest lens of ice slowly turned” simultaneously gives sound, motion, scale. No loops, no mixed metaphors; the only scaffolding is the deliberate repetition of “glisten,” which accretes meaning each time.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “sound sculptor who must destroy his medium” is a fresh synthesis of eco-fantasy and performance art. Risk—letting the artwork literally evaporate—heightens stakes without gimmick; the payoff is inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
