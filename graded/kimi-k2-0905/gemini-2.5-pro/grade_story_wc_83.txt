<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amal’s grief is viscerally embodied; the geode as tactile memory anchor works. Interiority stays specific to her physicist lens, though the “raw, humming truth” line flirts with abstraction. The final beat—coordinates as trajectory—earns her turn from grief to weaponized purpose with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: missile → loss → perturbation hunt → reservoir found. The breaker-reset clock creates a tight because/therefore race; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—coordinates reweight her grief into a targeting vector. One minor causality slip: coolant stabilizes yet array cache still “threatens to vanish,” a timing fudge that nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orbital observatory is sketched with spare, sensorial strokes—ticking capacitor bank, viewport curve—each filtering through Amal’s urgency. The geode micro-setting constrains her final choice by literally reflecting the coordinates. No spatial drift; bodies and objects stay tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the stolen-potential reservoir—signaled early and tightened by the breaker countdown. One meaningful escalation: the spike in the quantum foam appears only when she risks the last seconds, narrowing options to “trace now or lose forever.” Cost is conceptual but legible: she binds her grief to a targeting vector, foreclosing ordinary mourning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—potential as divertible current—emerges through physics metaphor rather than statement. Final image of crystalline facets holding “terrible, beautiful coordinates” reweights the geode from keepsake to weapon sight without moralizing. Resonance lingers because the cosmic theft remains unpunished, inviting uneasy reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a physicist’s perceptual signature: tensors, quantum foam, cooling capacitors. Syntax tightens under pressure—fragment bursts mirror the breaker’s ticking. No head-hop; diction stays within Amal’s lexicon even at peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and physics-anchored—missile as perturbation—avoiding purple drift. One mixed metaphor: “festering heart” clashes with prior sterile imagery, a micro-slip that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing grief memoir with quantum-foam hunt for stolen life-potential feels inevitable yet fresh; no genre template matches it. The perturbation-theory-as-ritual idea is bold, fully committed to, and pays off in the final coordinate spike. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
