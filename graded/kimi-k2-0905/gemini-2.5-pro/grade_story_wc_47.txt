<comment>Elara’s watchful-quiet caretaking is shown through embodied gestures (tea, humidity checks) rather than labels; Kaelen’s fossilized shame is externalized in his fiber-optic stare. The pendant hand-off works as a micro-choice that rewrites their status: she relinquishes permanence, he accepts mutability. Interiority stays concrete—her thumb on amber, his fingers closing “not in acceptance of its grim prison” but of the choice. No therapy-speak; the only slip is “public failure” (summary label) in exposition.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: because she has tended the garden and decoded the drip-pattern, therefore she can offer him a living alternative to fossilization. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“old server farm”). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pendant’s meaning flips from stasis to choice, cost felt in her relinquishment and his first non-shattering breath. Minor slack: “confession went viral” is told not shown, but it is back-story that does not distort present causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The moss-covered racks, drip metronome, and sunlit slate form a micro-ecology that literally guides choice: the pattern she reads becomes the argument she proffers. Sensory triangulation—petrichor, velvet moss, amber warmth—keeps the body inside the machine. Spatial choreography is clean: aisle walk, pendant transfer, slate gesture track without drift. Final image (moss in crevices) recharges setting as living circuitry, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: can Kaelen exit fossilized shame? Pressure tightens once: the decoded drip-pattern gives Elara the tool to confront that stake head-on. Agency is hers—she proffers the pendant, narrowing his options to reject or accept metamorphosis. Cost is legible: she loses her talisman, he risks changing. No escalation beyond this single beat, but at 700 words one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: permanence vs. renewal, fossil vs. flow. Subtext operates in silence and object exchange; no character states the thesis. The pendant’s redefinition (amber as trap → amber as choice) offers resonant re-pricing without moralizing. Final hush “felt less like an ending and more like fertile ground” invites ambivalent reflection, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter: “honeyed hush,” “green velvet,” “small sun against her skin.” Syntax mirrors her caretaker rhythm—long soft clauses that breathe. Kaelen’s voice is never ventriloquized; his consent is shown physically, preserving POV modesty. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: short “drip, drip, drip” against luxuriant moss descriptors. Sentence starts diversify; no template cadence. Metaphors are disciplined (river delta / microprocessor) and internally consistent. One paraphrase loop: “soft weight in the air thick with… damp earth” could compress, but it does not touch the closure beat. High information density: one sentence often does scent + emotional tilt + setting work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Server farm as terrarium is fresh; the icicle-to-circuit visual argument feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Fossilized-insect trope is rescued from cliché by being physically handed over and re-valued. Risk lies in quietness—no external antagonist—but the piece commits fully to interior sci-fi botany. Transformation test: swap setting and the metaphoric logic collapses, so specificity holds.</comment>
