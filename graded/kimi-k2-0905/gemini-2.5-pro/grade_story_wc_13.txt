<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—he “adjusted his stool,” “poised” charcoal, and later “stepped to the edge”—each micro-choice under threat embodies the illustrator’s trained eye. The pendant inheritance is only mystery-label until it vibrates; that belated charge still lands because the prior sketching obsession established pattern-hunger. Flaw: no embodied contradiction during the crisis; he never doubts or hates the pendant that suddenly solves everything, so the change feels smooth rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: interrupted canal cadence → sighting → pendant resonance → single-beat drip → restored waltz; every step is legible, motivated by Elias’s pattern-seeking vocation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the echo’s birthplace was the brief…silence” reweights his life goal without a speech. Cost is present—the city almost wakes, crystals almost shred him—but felt more conceptually than bodily; a hair’s-breadth shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop canal-as-artery is tactile: “sloshed in a steady, metronomic rhythm,” “syrupy crawl,” “frothed into a violent torrent.” Infinity pendant becomes micro-setting that constrains the final act; its cool → vibrating → still arc mirrors the city’s arrhythmia/reset. The giant’s “profound” breathing supplies pressure but stays off-stage; enough for short form, yet keeps the 9-line just out of reach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is declared early: keep the giant napping by preserving cadence; each temporal distortion tightens that need. Middle beat—Elias realizes he must “use its own method”—narrows options from fight to mimicry, visible trade-off. Cost is civic: collapse avoided, but none is extracted from Elias personally; tension scales to the city, not the man, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogan: pattern vs. disruption, art as restoration. The infinity symbol’s final redefinition (tuning fork, not destination) re-weights obsession into stewardship. “True artistry was in restoring the pattern” drifts toward thesis-statement but is saved by its placement inside Elias’s earned realization after action, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elias’s illustrator perception: “faceted carapace,” “frost flowers,” precise visual metaphors. Prosody tightens under threat—“a pure, clean wave radiated outward”—syntax lengthens then snaps back to short clauses mirroring restored rhythm. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on perceptual signature, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does setting, metaphor, and causality—“Crystalline structures…humming with dissonant energy” shows cause of worsening arrhythmia. Occasional ornamental adjectives (“shimmering limbs”) but never in closure beats. Rhythm modulates: calm catalog gives way to staccato crisis clauses, then settling cadence. No loops or mixed metaphors; minor over-use of present participle openers keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Temporal-ecology city on a sleeping giant feels fresh; Chronovore as time-sculptor predator is vivid, not borrowed. Illustrator-protagonist reverses the expected warrior-hero, letting art beat entropy. Infinity pendant revelation risks trope but earns its turn by redefining the city’s pulse, not mere mystic MacGuffin. Synthesis specific enough to feel inevitable only to this tale.</comment>
