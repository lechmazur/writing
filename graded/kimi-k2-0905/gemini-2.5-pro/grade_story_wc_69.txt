<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete and character-specific: the “expectantly resigned sigh” and the tactile worry of the zither rosette embody his weariness. His micro-choice—dismissing the choir into tense silence, then abandoning sheet music—shows a visible pivot. The ending’s Charged Poise is earned: his choice to subtract rather than add reweights the stake, and the cost—two grudging years of failure—lingers in the room. Secondary pressure from the choir is diffuse, but Elias’s fatigue and gentle authority remain legible and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tension tightens through atmospheric density (autumn decay, failed hymn) rather than causal reversals. The turning beat—rosette as pedagogical pivot—lands on-page with Conceptual Repricing: the carved silence redefines harmony itself. Orientation is stable (velvet library, choir hall) by ~120 words. Cost is unmistakable: communal hatred is momentarily hollowed out, foreclosing the old additive method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The velvet library and autumn window are vivid but mostly backdrop; the zither rosette functions as micro-setting and is the only object that constrains a choice. Spatial choreography in the circle-breathing scene is clean and tactile. Sensory balance favors visual; more air-movement or bodily contact could elevate. Setting does not evolve with events, but the carved-air metaphor charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—vanishing community harmony—is signaled early and tightens when Elias abandons sheet music. The meaningful intensification is the subtraction exercise itself: one visible tactic that narrows options from singing to breathing. Agency is Elias’s throughout; the cost is the fragile calm that could shatter tomorrow. Pressure accumulates atmospherically rather than through reversals, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the rosette’s carved absence rather than assertion: harmony equals what is removed. The final hummed chord offers a non-literal answer—silence made audible—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shared breath and closed eyes; no character states the thesis. The lingering ambiguity—will the calm survive next week?—invites reflection while keeping complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is patient, autumnal, slightly elegiac (“slow, magnificent decay”). Syntax varies; no drumbeat patterns. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven (“We will not sing a single word”). Filter verbs are sparse; diction remains within Elias’s plausible lexicon. The only compression is the quick cut from library to rehearsal, but the transition is legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; no loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is restrained—“frayed rope,” “ghosts of old arguments”—and stays coherent. Sentence rhythm modulates between long reflective units and short imperative ones during the breathing exercise. Opening and final lines are anchored and resonant. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The subtraction pedagogy and carved-air metaphor feel fresh; the rosette’s re-purposing as social instrument is specific and memorable. The rival-town choir trope is familiar, but the method twist and autumnal micro-setting particularize it. Risk is modest—quiet lyric resolution rather than spectacle—but coherence is high. Transformation test passes: the ending would collapse without the exact rosette and subtractive method.</comment>
