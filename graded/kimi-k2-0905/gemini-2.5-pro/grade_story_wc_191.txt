<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her sonic hum vibrates “from her chest into the rock,” anchoring both ritual and personality. The peel-by-peel reveal of past failures shows her historian’s mind in action, each micro-choice (sonic chisel angle, flake pressure) calibrated to memory rather than conquest. The renunciation of the crown is earned: she has already paid in time-bled fingertips and the orchard’s ozone sting, so the final walk-away carries visible cost. Only the “wisely adventurous” tag feels slightly label-like mid-text, keeping this just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: because she remembers the Old-World resonance, the curtain tears; because she peels every palimpsest layer, the star-indent reveals; because she inserts the Heartstone shard, the throne acknowledges sovereignty without a body. Sunrise tracks the ticking clock, each violet sentence tightening the final option until the staircase dissolves—an Earned Stasis where refusal of rule saves culture. No teleporting props, no off-stage resolution; even the purge threat is tethered to the chronometer’s pulse. The closing image reweights sovereignty itself from corporeal to mnemonic, paying the conceptual cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall is not scenery; its liquid-light algorithms literally part under the sonic key, turning geography into interface. Likewise, the orchard’s crystalline trees double as data batteries whose “stored energy flowing in rivers of light” power the ascent signal—environment as circuitry. Spatial choreography is clean: she stands, hums, curtain parts, she enters, works pillar, energy staircase climbs above same monolith. One hairline slip—“metallophytes” is dropped once without tactile handling—keeps this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—cultural purge vs. memory restoration—tightens every beat; each peeled layer shortens daylight and widens consequence. The mural graveyard externalizes escalating cost: every prior claimant’s failure foreshadows her possible erasure. Agency stays hers: the sonic chisel speed, the decision to insert not claim, the stance that broadcasts sovereignty rather than seizes it. Sunrise forces the final trade-off; the staircase dissolves only after the signal is sent, price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: memory as sovereignty, sovereignty as stewardship not rulership. The throne’s vacancy is reframed from power vacuum to cultural amnesia; the ruby flake is literally the system’s capacity to remember. Subtext whispers in the orchard’s ozone scent—future blooming from past decay. Final image dissolves crown into light, offering a non-literal answer: legitimacy is restored narrative, not restored monarchy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays lashed to Elara’s perceptual bias—she “reads” paint as data-sealer, hears rock as resonant substrate. Syntax lengthens during sonic work, contracts at sunrise: “She pressed… It clicked…” mirroring pulse. No head-hop; even the AI’s ping is filtered through her wrist-unit. The diction—“kaleidoscopic,” “palimpsest,” “metallophytes”—feels native to a Lore Keeper’s lexicon, not thesaurus tourism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “Crystalline trees hummed with latent power, their branches heavy with glowing, data-rich fruit” fuses sensorium, world-rule, and stakes in one breath. No scaffold loops; each flake-peel advances both plot and texture. Rhythm climbs across paragraph breaks, mirroring staircase formation. Only one near-muddle—“memory-less depths” could be sharper—keps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “throne demands not a ruler but its missing heart” inversion flips a thousand chosen-one tropes into archival thriller. Sonic archaeology as开锁 method feels freshly diegetic, not borrowed. The orchard-as-server-farm image synthesizes eco and cyber without grafted gimmickry. Risk is taken—quiet ending, no coronation—and lands coherently, reweighting sovereignty as narrative custody.</comment>
