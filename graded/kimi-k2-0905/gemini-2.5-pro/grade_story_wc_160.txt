<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s grief-quest is credibly rooted in the envelope and chain, and the micro-choice to scrape glue launches the arc. His interiority—“pressure and release,” “encoded compassion”—stays inside his machinist idiom, though a trace of self-diagnosis slips in at “the truth settled over him.” The final stance crystallizes with cost: he inherits both regulator and father’s self-denial. One hairline slip keeps it from 8+: we are told rather than shown the moment he actively forgives or accepts the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The envelope→pollen/chain→cipher→letters chain is tight causal escalation; each step materially narrows options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelen sees love was present but encoded, and the price is the same self-sacrifice now required of him—“two parts of the same complex, vital machine.” Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible in the final image of him atop the tier, regulator gleaming, future loneliness legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s thermal breathing is not backdrop but clock and threat; the obsidian walls, azurite flecks, and orchid pollen are mined as clues. Micro-setting—the surveyor chain—constrains every measurement beat. Spatial choreography stays coherent as Kaelen climbs tiers while dawn light “filters through fissures.” One minus: the western-face orchid is named but never re-encountered to charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode parents’ silence—signaled by paragraph two. Escalation follows each discovery: glue → chain → letters progressively reweights meaning and narrows emotional options. Agency stays with Kaelen; the volcano’s groan complicates but does not resolve. The felt cost is the revelation that love = abandonment, a price already paid and now inherited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of cold machine = cold heart; the engine of duty is revealed to be an engine of tenderness. Encoded compassion is dramatized, not stated, through the pollen/azurite map and unsent letters. Final image reweights “pressure and release” as emotional, not geothermal. No moralizing lines—only the hush of dawn and the regulator’s gleam—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: sentences angle toward measurement, magnification, metal fatigue. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic alternation between short declaratives and longer, gas-filled clauses that mimic thermal expansion. No dialogue, so no register drift. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to tremble”) is forgiven as character-uncertainty, not narrator hedging.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence either advances clue-hunt or layers paternal ache. Figurative language stays mechanical-thermal (“geologic sighs,” “volcano took its morning breath”) without overwriting. Zero paraphrase loops; each detail (amber glue, etched links) returns with new work to do. Opening and closing lines are anchored to body and tool, satisfying ear-test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Father-love-as-cipher via geothermal metaphor is fresh; the pollen/azurite coordinate system feels inevitable in hindsight. Volcano-amphitheater as workshop and confession booth fuses landscape with psyche. Risk is moderate—quiet epistolary twist rather than eruption—but coherence is high. Not quite 8.5 because the emotional twist, while elegant, is classically filial-neglect reversed rather than genre-redefining.</comment>
