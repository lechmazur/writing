<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is scientist-cold yet grief-raw; the contradiction is embodied in his obsessive staring through the dust-pane. His micro-choice to wipe a clear circle is the visible hinge where detachment cracks and humility is admitted. Cost is present: the “chaos of unfiltered reality” he now agrees to join. Yet the shift is compressed into a single soft gesture; a harder-earned renunciation would lift this to 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wiped circle literalizes his decision to re-enter messy causality. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust pattern density re-weights stakes until the final image. Causal engine is intact: because the pane reveals transfer-of-life, therefore he abandons passive observation. Cost is unmistakable—“full of pain. And… full of purpose.” No orientation debt; transitions are clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse ruin is tactile: silt stink, sagging beam, pearlescent film. The polycarbonate sheet becomes micro-setting that literally refracts choice. Spatial choreography holds as Aris moves from doorway to stool to pane. Weathered environment dictates what he can see and therefore what he can bear to do. Meets 9-band gate: tool (pane) constrains final tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep observing life or rejoin it—tightens when the dust-lens reveals life-death transfer. Escalation is textural: each return visit adds grime-sightings that deepen the moral cost of detachment. Agency crystallizes in the wipe; options narrow to shovel or perpetual exile. Price is visible (grief acknowledged), but pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “detachment itself is a violence.” No explicit thesis; the insight is earned through the orchid-to-weed image. Subtext resides in silence: the absent butterflies still color his vision. Final image reweights premise—messiness becomes purpose, not failure. Resists moralizing; ambiguity remains whether humility can survive first contact with mud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aris’s scientific sensorium: neutron-star vocabulary, vector language, chitin optics. Perceptual signature is consistent—he sees “ugly equation” not “tragedy.” Rhythm accelerates under pressure: short declaratives during wipe, then a long breath to end. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Minor template cadence in “He would…” lines just below 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “dust from a butterfly wing, millions of microscopic scales” packs object, origin, and beauty into one clause. Metaphors stay physics-true (“cosmic clockwork”) without self-contradiction. One paraphrase loop—“decay…decay”—but it serves as intentional reverb. Peak beat is clean: no filter-verb stacks, no mixed vehicles. Final line earns its quiet uplift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: astrophysicist forced to read entropy through butterfly scales. Transforms familiar grief-into-growth arc via optics metaphor. Specificity of chitin diffraction is accurate yet emotionally charged. Risk in quiet ending pays off—no shovel swing, just agreement to begin. Would edge 9-band if one earlier beat had shown neutron-star work habits mapping directly onto greenhouse tactics.</comment>
