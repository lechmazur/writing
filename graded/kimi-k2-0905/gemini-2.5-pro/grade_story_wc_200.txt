<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silas’s vocation and gentle insistence on joy over pain drive every beat; the crocodile-tooth anchor and his tactile ritual with it embody his modest fearlessness and keep interiority embodied. The spirit’s shift from keening to laughter is credible because Silas first filters her anguish through the tooth’s “silent, solid presence,” a micro-choice that earns the later dissolution. No stock therapeutic labels—only concrete sensory memory (the sun-drenched tavern, pies, helpless laughter) performs the healing. The cost is quiet but legible: he climbs out alone, the tooth now warm, satisfaction edged with perpetual solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of the warped harp tightens the acoustic texture until a single remembered laugh snaps the pattern. Causality is atmospheric rather than plot-based—memory literally rewires the spectral instrument. Orientation is swift: precipice, mist river, hidden sunrise within 50 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gorge’s new silence is felt as loss and gift simultaneously, the price being Silas’s renewed solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is not backdrop but resonating chamber: its acoustics warp grief into literal sound, then reward the healed melody with light. Sensory hierarchy follows Silas’s vocation—sound first, mist second, stone last—keeping detail selective. The crocodile tooth acts as micro-setting/anchor, its cool-to-warm arc charting the scene’s emotional thermometer. Spatial choreography is clean: descent, huddle, re-ascent track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—spirit’s release—tightens once: discord → clear chord → dissolution. Silas’s agency is attention-based; his refusal to flinch at the shriek narrows options to laughter or failure. Cost is atmospheric: the gorge’s restored silence costs him the music he briefly re-conducted. No coincidence; pressure grows via sensory accumulation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic metaphor: grief is unfinished melody, healing is remembered laughter. No explicit thesis—idea lives in the harp’s restringing. Final image (sunlight = music) offers non-literal answer: joy and sorrow can share one waveform. Subtle counter-reading lingers: Silas’s own song remains unfinished, hinted by his solitary climb.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person poetic, steady cadence mirrors Silas’s calm; diction stays within his mystic-craftsman register. Perceptual signature—sound as shape, silence as texture—remains consistent. No dialogue, therefore no voice leakage; interiority is concrete. Filter verbs serve voice (“He let the vibrations guide him”) rather than dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; high information density—each clause adds sensory or emotional data. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (sound = river, light = music). Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image. Minor overworld tint in “luminous ache” and “music of luminous ache” appears twice but is pattern-taught early and pays off at closure; does not obscure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Midwife-of-souls trope is refreshed by sonic mechanics and laughter-as-medicine stance. Gorge-as-echo-chamber turns landscape into instrument—an inventive externalization. The dog-song memory and pie-spill snapshot provide specific comic spark that feels particular, not generic. Could edge higher if Silas’s own unfinished “inner song” were more foregrounded; as is, risk is moderate but effective.</comment>
