<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his “low hum inside his ribs,” the reed-bird dropped in a heartbeat—yet his contradictory pull between transience and permanence stays active in-scene. The micro-choice of pointing to the fissure, then weaving root-mats overnight, is causally tied to the need for belonging and carries visible cost (sleep, ego). Secondary pressure from Lyra is immediate and status shifts are cleanly staged. Final Earned Stasis—accepting the arbor-polishing cloth—pays off the earlier alienation; only the arbor’s symbolic heft feels slightly over-cued, trimming the last 0.1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore—lonely reed-sculptor → joins search → discovers vine-tag → offers mats → invited to tend arbor. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 20; no disorientation claimed. Closure is Earned Stasis with felt cost: he forfeits exclusive artist-identity to become “part of the weave,” legible in the polishing-cloth hand-off. One micro-turn—Echo as collaborator, not vandal—reconfigures community myth without breaking prior rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater-light are filtered through Kaelen’s artisan eye; sensory hierarchy favors texture (reed, vine, glassy arbor) over tourist vistas. The arbor acts as micro-setting/tool that constrains his final choice—he must touch the “unbending” surface he once feared. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from reed mat pile to arbor base; no floating rooms. Only missing gate for 9+ is that environment never actively threatens or limits physical possibility; it mirrors rather than shapes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—belonging—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when he drops the reed-bird to join the search. The vine-tag discovery reframes communal identity, forcing his tactical shift from spectacle to service. Cost is visible: overnight labor, public exposure, and the quiet forfeiture of outsider status. Pressure escalates once; no off-stage resolutions; coincidence complicates rather than saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connection emerges from the reed/obsidian duality rather than exposition; subtext lives in silent cloth exchange and phosphorescent vine knot. No character articulates “community = weave”; final image reweights prior motifs without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers—he gains belonging but loses solitary artistry—inviting reflection beyond the plot. Only the “luminescent ache” phrase edges toward thesis-statement, a hairlineEcho.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate POV sustains a perceptual signature attuned to texture and translucence; diction stays inside Kaelen’s artisan lexicon (“spiraling form,” “glassy framework”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses appropriately under night-time weaving fever. Rhythm modulates: long, reed-winding sentences yield to staccato discoveries. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Polishing-cloth dialogue is subtext-rich action rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable—one sentence often does double duty (e.g., “a monument to a resilience he felt he had no claim to” reveals world and wound). No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, taught early, and paid off. Register never drifts into academic diction. Final line’s “two halves of his world become one” risks slight template cadence but lands as earned closure image, so −0.1 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: street-artist as secret gardener who knots living vine into obsidian, flipping vandal stereotype into communion act. Reed-sculptor vs. eternal glass gives concrete, occupation-specific tension rather than generic loneliness. Transformation test fails if reeds/obsidian swapped—details are particular. Slight risk in “crystalline orchard” edging familiar SF-fant postcard, but artisan POV and phosphorescent vine keep it from cliché.</comment>
