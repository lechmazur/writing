<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s insomnia-painter identity is vivid and embodied; the “waking dream” mechanism gives concrete interior access. His micro-choice to risk public exposure by lighting the canvases crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The final beat of strangers echoing ‘witness’ back at him externalizes his internal arc with visible cost—his body trembling, lungs aching—so the change is legible and paid for. No contradictory impulses are shown mid-scene, so the 9+ quick test just misses; interior contradiction would have pushed it over.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the skyline’s scattered answering lights reweight Elias’s premise—kindness is not extinct—at undeniable social cost (he is now exposed, no longer anonymous). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each canvas adds density until the pattern breaks outward into the city. Orientation is secure by 70 words; no cap triggered. Cost is felt in the final image (“his breath catching,” “frantic counterpoint”). Lens holds; one hairline slip—brief summary of “six nights” instead of dramatized beats—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains every move: the clean air inside versus the smog canyon outside determines when Elias dares to open the glass and project outward. The moon’s filtered glow is not backdrop but catalyst—without it the visions and therefore the paintings do not occur. Spatial choreography is flawless: six canvases, ledge, spotlights, body stance tracked without drift. Final image of scattered lit windows reprises the moonlight motif at larger scale, charging closure. Meets 9+ gate; only a single generic “city hum” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias re-ignite communal empathy—signals early. Escalation is accumulative: each new canvas heightens personal exposure until the seventh-night gamble forces a public stance. Tightening beat is the moment he switches on the spotlights, foreclosing anonymity; price is immediate vulnerability to ridicule or indifference. Cost is visible (shuddering breath, racing heart). Under Accumulative lens one deepening is sufficient; the answer from the skyline reweights the stake. Lacks a second constraining loss (money, tool, injury) that would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the glyphs are never decoded for the reader; meaning accrues through repetition and final outward echo. Subtext operates in gesture—cardboard sign shakily copied—rather than exposition. Final image offers non-literal answer: the city itself becomes a mutable text of lights, repricing Elias’s belief without moralizing. No thematic echo articulates “kindness lives”; restraint keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “ochre and burnt sienna pooled” is painter-vision; “saffron quiet” is his chromatic lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally under stress—single participial phrase “breath catching” amid short sentences. Distinctive rhythmic cadence in “waxing moon fought its way through the chemical haze” teaches pattern early and holds. Minor over-adjectival drift (“soft, apologetic glow”) nicks the 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often paints, signals time, and mirrors emotional state. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—moon as apologizing, city as forgetting breath—without mixed vehicles. Final paragraph accelerates via paratactic “Some… others…” to echo scattered lights. One near-loop “silent, hopeful broadcast” is acceptably tautological for voice; no scaffold obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—insomniac paints lost language of kindness onto urban smog—feels fresh and specific; transformation test fails if Elias were merely a street artist with posters. Moonlit brush inherited from calligrapher grandfather fuses craft lineage with luminous catalyst, avoiding generic magic item. Risk is quiet: no villain, no disaster, yet stakes feel large because emotional truth is particular. Slight proximity to “balcony protest” tropes keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
