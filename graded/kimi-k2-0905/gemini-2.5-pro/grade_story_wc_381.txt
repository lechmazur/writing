<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich—her “tranquil blaze” and desire to absorb rather than destroy the prophecy give her a distinct moral texture—yet the absence of any second character or relationship crucible limits the category’s ceiling at this length. Motivation is clear and consistent; the final renunciation of noise carries visible cost in the drained origami wing. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the high-band 9+ test is not quite met, but she remains individuated and memorable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush is complete, the prophecy asleep, and the cost is felt in the emptied wing and her solitary vigil—an earned stasis. Causality is causal-lite but coherent: map silence → target gaps → flood with quiet; the lens holds. The piece teaches its elliptical pattern early and keeps it; orientation is clean by 60 words. A sharper micro-turn or persistent constraint would have nudged it into 9+ territory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brook, moonlight, and origami wing function as micro-setting: the wing anchors the magic, the water provides the baseline silence, and both constrain her posture and ritual. Detail is selective, sensuous, and filtered through her priorities; spatial choreography is immaculate. The environment never evolves or pushes back, so the 9+ gate (environment must constrain final tactics) is missed, but atmosphere is vivid and integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—mute the prophecy—is signaled in line 1 and tightened once when the hush is released; cost is legible in the spent wing and her continued solitude. No external antagonist or second reversal, but the internal pressure of “absorb rather than destroy” creates ethical tension. Escalation is a single smooth crescendo; sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the morality of silence over erasure, the solitude required to protect others from fear. Subtext resides in the origami wing—delicate yet anchoring—and in the choice to absorb rather than annihilate. No moralizing line spells it out; the final image of the unchanged paper reweights the premise with quiet cost. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush,” “placid inferno” are coinages that stay within Elara’s mystic register. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for the working, short staccato at the close—mirroring the tide of power. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature is sharp and sustained. A hairline slip into register drift at “architecture of fate” keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors are coherent (“cool and heavy like river stone”) and never mixed. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase churn; information often doubles (sound baseline + intent) without padding. Opening and final lines are image-driven and propulsive. A single over-ornate clause (“the focused calm of a star about to fold into itself”) is the lone artifact preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The synthesis of origami cartography + silence-as-substance feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight; the concept commits fully without late rule changes. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Minor docking for faint echoes of “quiet brook” pastoralism and soft-prophecies tropes, but the angle of mapping silence as cartography rescues originality.</comment>
