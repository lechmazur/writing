<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s calm, didactic interiority is consistent and embodied; the passenger’s arc from panic to poise is shown through micro-relaxation rather than labels. No contradictory impulses in scene—both remain archetypal vessels for the concept. Cost is present but light: he gives away a sliver of his solitude, she leaves lighter; the emotional ledger feels balanced yet not sharply priced. Still, the characterization cleanly serves the closure’s Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer thickens the hush until the passenger’s stance reconfigures. Orientation is immediate; causality is pattern-based rather than event-based, taught early and held. Closure lands as Charged Poise—her softened voice reweights the silence—cost is the shared exposure of interior states. No breaks or ambiguity; pattern is paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism terraces, Aether current, storm glass, and gondola hull all filter through Elian’s professional eye; details are selective, tactile, and mirrored in the passenger’s easing posture. Spatial choreography is clean: dock → glide → disembark. The storm glass constrains the beat of explanation and returns as a micro-talisman in closure. Environment is not backdrop but instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the passenger endure exposed silence? Pressure escalates via accretion of sensory reveals, not external threat. One meaningful tightening: her breathing syncs with the gondola’s rhythm—options narrow to acceptance. Cost is internal and credible yet gentle; stakes never spike past the intimate, keeping the escalation modest but coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: silence as architecture one can learn to inhabit. No explicit thesis; final soft “thank you” is the thematic pivot. Subtext rests in gesture—unclenching hands, deeper breath—rather than statement. Complexity is modest but intact: silence comforts yet remains indifferent, a counter-reading left in quiet tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s calm, precise register; perceptual signature is the catalog of faint vibrations. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the glide of the boat; no filter-verb clusters. Passenger’s brief dialogue is thin but sufficient contrast. Voice is the story’s engine and remains controlled under the final image.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphors (cathedral of peace, ghost of the train) are spare and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern. Opening and closing lines bookend the whistle-echo motif. Minor elevated diction (“vaulting hush”) is earned by context and does not obscure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ferrying souls through literalized silence is fresh; storm glass as teaching tool repurposes a Victorian curio. Concept leans on atmospheric inversion rather than plot surprise. Risk is moderate—quiet arc in a quiet world—but execution is committed. Could verge on cliché of “wise guide” yet avoids by keeping Elian’s interior minimal and service-oriented.</comment>
