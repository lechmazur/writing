<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—icy logician clutching a sentimental locket—ramifies in every beat, driving him to abandon alembics and seek starlings. The micro-choice to warm the leaf instead of the crystal fuses motive with theme, showing reverence as reagent. One minor slip: “he felt trapped” is diagnostic shorthand; an embodied image would clinch perfect interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sublimated crystal becomes silver vapor that re-weights the orchard’s logic into poetry, with cost legible in the phrase “rigid scaffolding of his logic dissolved.” Causal chain holds—starlings → apple tree → crystal → locket → flame → vapor—each link tightening options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor waver: starlings’ arrow is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying lens rule.</comment>

<comment>The orchard is not backdrop but crucible: moss-soft earth, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and gnarled apple tree constrain sightlines and reveal the crystal. Sensory hierarchy is alchemist-biased—notice of dew geometry over bird song. One nit: “kaleidoscopic” risks dazzle-overload, yet it pays off in refracted light that charges the vapor image, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“harmonize logic and intuition”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when mapping starlings fails, forcing relinquishment of calculation. The final vapor is the visible price: intuition literally sublimates logic. Escalation is single but meaningful; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: crystal symmetry vs. murmuration chaos resolve into unified vapor. No moralizing; the final image re-prices reverence as essential reagent. Subtext in locket reveal quietly reframes prior scientific pride without commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains alchemist’s perceptual signature: fractal leaves, phosphor-wood sliver, edelweiss as talisman. Syntax modulates from Latinate distillation vocabulary to limpid wonder—“a living arrow”—mirroring internal melt. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts precisely at vapor touch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyric, each sentence双层 duty (scent of ancient ice and new blossoms compresses time). Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor density spike in “thousand dancing rainbows” but pattern is taught early and paid off in vapor shimmer, so remains beneath artifact penalty threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Starling-grimoire link feels fresh; frozen dew crystal as non-reagent focal point is elegant inversion of alchemical trope. Sentimental locket hidden from mentors personalizes risk. Synthesis of logic-intuition via sublimation rather than explosion avoids expected epiphany template.</comment>
