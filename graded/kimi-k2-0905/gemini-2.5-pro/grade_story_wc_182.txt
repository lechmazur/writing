<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s shift from detached scholar to risk-taking negotiator is coherent and embodied; her tactile engagement with the diary and the silence wall shows interior conflict without label-speak. The micro-choice to confront the Curators is earned by weeks of obsessive gap-hunting and the future-man’s warning, so the cost (terrifying renegotiation) feels scaled to this length. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the internal contradiction bar for 9+ is missed, but the portrayal is still vivid and individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: Kael’s collapse → Elara’s diary hunt → silence wall → renegotiation → root stairway, each step narrowing options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mountain’s chord and living staircase reweight the entire Scriptorium’s hoarding rule-set with undeniable social cost—knowledge must be used, not caged. The silence wall earlier is the taught disorientation that pays off at closure, so orientation debt is waived. Cost is legible in the final image: she descends carrying the diary and the weight of all futures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is not postcard scenery; the silence wall and root-staircase are micro-settings that physically constrain her path and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: vellum rustle and decay-scent dominate, visual detail is selective. Spatial choreography is flawless—catalog gaps map to tunnels to seamless rock to staircase. No environment-only paragraphs stall momentum; every descriptor is braided to her goal-directed action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to the buried library—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when she realizes the gaps form a map. One meaningful turn: the silence wall dissolves only after she risks renegotiation, foreclosing the safe academic path. Cost is visible: she must brave beings “woven from ink and memory” and accept responsibility for tomorrow’s fire. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the wall.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge hoarded is knowledge dying. The unheard symphony motif starts as metaphor and ends as literal crescendo, reweighting the premise that silence equals preservation. Subtext in the diary—plant language as cipher for silenced history—integrates with the conflict. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: descent into glowing staircase = choosing to let the seed of history sprout, not petrify.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Focalization is tight third; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is linguist-scholar: “unheard symphony,” “syntax of petal and stem,” “equation of risk.” Rhythm accelerates with short clauses during confrontation, then widens into lyrical cadence at the staircase. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are N/A; narrative voice remains distinct and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high—each sentence advances motive, setting, or causality. One near-loop: “silence wall” is repeated twice in adjacent sentences, but it serves as sonic echo of the motif, not scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (symphony, root-text) and do not breach physical logic. No artifact touches closure; final line is crisp image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fusing extinct-plant cryptography with a living mountain-library is a fresh synthesis; the floral Rosetta Stone feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken: entire plot hinges on botanical silences, yet causality never breaks. Specific detail—Whispering Moss grows where knowledge is silenced—transforms familiar “hidden archive” trope into visceral organism. Concept commits fully; no retreat to generic fantasy furniture.</comment>
