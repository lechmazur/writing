<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific—his cataloguing of silence, the “steady hum” he inhabits—and his micro-choice to warp space with the scarf is embodied and costly (tremoring hands). The contradiction between obsessive calculation and raw nostalgia is dramatized, not told. No secondary character pressure, so relationship crucible unused; still, the lone eccentricity is credibly flawed and drives the beat. Motive sustains to the final image, earning the quiet smile of renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each book placement thickens the manifold until the scarf-window ruptures the library’s air. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vision dissolves, options re-weighted, cost felt in his tremor and the reek of ozone left behind. Persistent constraint—shift must wait for “next right time”—shapes the final image, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Scientific-poetry library is more postcard than crucible—no shelf, aisle, or patron obstructs or aids the warp. Micro-setting scarf fares better: its geodesic tension literally bends the scene. Sensory triad (visual shimmer, ozone stink, sub-audible thrum) is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography clean; bodies track. Environment does not actively constrain choice, capping at 7.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the place where stories live”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the scarf-window opens, foreclosing abstract theory and forcing visceral memory. Cost is visceral (tremor, ozone), but agency is intellectual not confrontational; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Sufficient for 600-word frame but not urgent enough for 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: equations-as-poetry, memories-as-topology—no explicit thesis. Final image of “next right time” reweights the search from conquest to patience, a resonant non-moral answer. Subtext in the scarf’s lingering perfume and the woman’s off-page laugh implies loss without stating it. Avoids Echo; no final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “catalogue of shelved paradoxes,” “mathematics of infinite saddle-shaped space”—diction precise yet lyrical. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for catalogues, clipped fragments at rupture (“He saw it.”). No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Filter verbs few and voice-motivated. Distinct texture sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or causality. No scaffold loops; metaphors (scarf as window, library as manifold) stay coherent. One mixed metaphor—“color of a drying wound” beside “memories worn thin”—minor, does not touch closure. Sentence variety supports propulsion; no drumbeat cadence. Clean grammar and tense. Minor overwrite in “quiet cathedral of shelved paradoxes” but within tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—librarian warps library via hyperbolic geometry to mine analog memories—feels fresh, not trope. Synthesis of science and lyric is particular to this voice. Risk in abstract concept is fully committed to, not hedged. Could swap scarf for another memento, but the topological method is irreplaceable. Transformation test passed: emotional arc depends on non-Euclidean metaphor. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
