<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from passive observer to active composer is credibly driven by the vanishing and the glass flake; the “never”-to-possibility arc is embodied in his bow-stroke micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete—resin, ozone, fractured glass—without diagnostic speak. The cost (his old repertoire foreclosed) is visible when he abandons the familiar bridge-song for the glitch-melody. Flaw: Lyra remains a lyrical device, not a relationship crucible, so secondary-pressure bullet is N/A and slight under-earning of final courage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Lyra vanishes → therefore Elias rewrites reality-rule; glass flake is persistent constraint; scaffold-wrap code is taught early and paid off in the final note. Closure is Charged Poise: the first glitch-note hangs as undeniable conceptual cost—he has crossed into her ontology. No teleporting props; every object tracks. Orientation anchor (who/where) inside 120 words; waiver not triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mountain pullout, resin scent, updraft rippling green mesh—each detail is filtered through Elias’s musician-perception and constrains his decoding of the flutter rhythm. The glass flake functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. No static cataloging; environment evolves with action. Meets 9+ gate: tool/object (flake) directly shapes the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the “never”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when scaffold-wrap code becomes legible, foreclosing the safe option of walking away. One meaningful turn: he chooses to play the secret rather than tell it, paying with permanent exile from his old repertoire. Cost is visible on-page: “didn’t play one of his familiar bridge-songs.” Under causal lens, agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of authored reality emerges concretely through scaffold-code and glass flake rather than abstract assertion. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing: the glitch-note answers the vanishing’s question. Ambiguity lingers—will he dissolve too?—inviting reflection. Slight deduction for echo of “pixelated amnesty” tag-line in dialogue; still subtext-dominant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: musical metaphors, synesthetic color grid on glass, resin/ozone olfactory layering. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences for awe, staccato fragments for code-reading. No head-hopping; distance stays tight interior. Experimental compression (“flickered”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Read-aloud cadence mirrors bow strokes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors setting, characterizes, advances). No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Peak-beat clarity: “first note hung…question mark of impossible hope” is clean, not overwrought. Minor scaffolding: “the” used three times in successive sentence openers once—does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Premise—19th-c photograph shard as jailbreak key—is genuinely fresh. Scaffold-wrap as living QR code transforms mundane construction site into portal grammar. Risk taken: lyric glitch-music ending could have felt gimmick but is earned by causal setup. Specific detail (collodion chemistry, resin scent) prevents generic transplant.</comment>
