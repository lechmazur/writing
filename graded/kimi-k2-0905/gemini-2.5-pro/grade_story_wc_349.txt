<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet obsession is rendered through concrete micro-choices—measuring silence, tracing negative space—so the final cut feels earned; the interior contradiction between selling beginnings and not knowing their source stays live in every beat. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The only drag is a brief dip into diagnostic self-awareness (“a profound dissatisfaction hummed beneath his calm”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the incision pours moonlight into the void, reconfiguring the entire library and Elian’s stance toward his wares; the cost is the irreversible scar in perfect clarity. Causal linkage holds throughout—each measurement beat tightens the vector toward the silent tree—so the lens stays causal without ambiguity. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the shop was a quiet island…”) and never slips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The crystalline floor, glass trees, and bottled moonlight are not ornamental: the smooth unbroken tree materially constrains the final act—only its flawless surface can receive the inaugural wound. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elian’s priorities—soundless bells, refracted absence—so description never stalls momentum. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track his path from shop to orchard to heart-tree without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the place where stories begin”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when quantifying absence becomes the only viable tactic. The final incision forecloses the option of eternal search, replacing it with the responsibility to originate; the price is the tree’s perfect surface and, by extension, Elian’s own innocence. One meaningful escalation suffices under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of origin as discovery → origin as violent creation; no character states the moral. The scar filled with moonlight reweights every prior absence into potential, delivering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext resides in the hush between glass leaves—silence as fertile, not empty—without abstract exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elian’s perceptual signature—cold silver weight, prism-dripped branches—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then snaps to short strokes at the incision, mirroring pressure. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. The diction never exceeds the character’s plausible lexicon of artisan-mystic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid—each sentence advances image or causality without scaffold. Figurative language is selective: “sea of clouds churned in an endless, silent ballet” teaches the orchard’s floating rules early, then recedes. No loops, filter-verb stacks, or mixed metaphors appear; the final incision beat is uncluttered, letting the moonlight pool carry the moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit of quantifying absence to locate narrative origin is fresh, and the glass orchard’s physics is followed to its logical conclusion: creation demands a flaw. Risk—cutting perfection—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The transformation feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at onset, satisfying the originality test.</comment>
