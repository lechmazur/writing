<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s quietly obsessive devotion to “distill the essence of what they had been” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (slotting the slide, stabbing the rune) that embody the “gently meticulous” trait while foreclosing any future except continued cataloguing. The interior contradiction—accepting impossibility of saving the world yet persisting in naming its vanished bonds—stays alive in scene, not summary. Emotions are rendered through bodily detail (breath fogging, white vapor plume) rather than labels. The only bar to 9+ is that the cost, while felt, is single-note; we glimpse no crack in his resolve that might complicate tomorrow’s repetition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the captured frequency equation becomes both “tombstone and seed,” re-weighting the entire enterprise under an Accumulating/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven—each artifact’s extinction tightens the density of loss until the final crystallized note. The Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is established by line 5 and never drifts. Cost is incontrovertible: the vow’s light dies, the city below is already “just strangers,” and the archive’s silence is now “more absolute than before.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen library is not backdrop but active constraint: the hoarfrost floor forces quiet footfalls, the casket marked “Extinguished” literalizes failure, and the cloud-sea below provides the visual proof that memory has already fallen away. Micro-setting objects—the resonator’s spun-silver cradle, the dead slide now “simple glass”—track state change precisely. Spatial choreography is clean: vault → apparatus → window → ledger. Atmosphere modulates from “quartz hush” to “more absolute” silence, mirroring the vow’s fade without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Dominant stake—rescue meaning before total erasure—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens exactly once: the vow’s light becomes “a guttering candle,” forcing the frantic tuning beat. Agency is microscopic but decisive: Kaelen’s finger stab captures the tone, trading the last flare for data. Cost is visible—the lantern dies, the city bond is gone—but the price is external rather than personal; he remains emotionally untouched, slightly capping escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image and action: the transmutation of communal promise into a single frequency equation argues that meaning survives only as replicable code, not lived memory. No character moralizes; the reader must confront whether archival rescue equals salvation or nihilism. The final “lexicon of essences” re-prices all earlier artifacts: they are no longer relics but abstract entries, a conceptual loss heavier than physical extinction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: noticing lens-gleam, breath-fog, ledger-glyphs—never external judgments. Syntax lengthens during methodical cataloguing, then fragments into staccato clauses (“Hold.” / “He stabbed…”) under pulse-urgency, teaching the rhythm early and paying it off at the screamed tone. Diction (“hoarfrost,” “aethelburg,” “luminous vow”) invents a cold-lexicon without slipping into purple excess. No dialogue = no voice-contamination risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelled by strong verbs (“piercing,” “slotted,” “stabbed”). Information is layered: the slide’s thinness, shimmer, and historical burden arrive in one tactile stroke. Metaphors are sparse, consistent (ice/light/sound), and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances either apparatus state or emotional pressure. Final line “another piece of their soul was saved” achieves closure-image concision without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “cartographer of a collapsing reality” vocation and the resonator-that-captures-morality-as-frequency feel fresh yet inevitable. Risky second-person-address of extinct civilization is avoided; instead, loss is staged through procedural description. Conceptual twist: the archive preserves meaning yet guarantees amnesia for the living—an ethical inversion not signaled in advance but earned by the final ledger line.</comment>
