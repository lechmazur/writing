<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris’s shift from statistical safety to intuitive pilgrimage is embodied in micro-choices (brushing pollen, lighting the lantern) and internal contradiction (“beautiful certainty of numbers” vs “raw, untethered beauty”). The cost—accepting her father’s chaos—lands as Earned Stasis. One slip: the phrase “clover melancholy” is used twice as label, not embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical CR: the lit lantern reweights the premise—risk is now beautiful, zero is the real gamble. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each subway glyph thickens pattern until the rail-yard balcony image crystallizes cost. Causal chain holds; no teleportation of props. Persistent constraint: the mica pane’s etched key literally shapes every ride she takes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rain-washed library, pollen-dusted mica, and rust-rail balcony are filtered through Aris’s probabilistic eye, constraining her choices (she boards because the environment “speaks”). Micro-setting—the lantern—charges the final image. One minor drift: “urban squalor” is tourist-catalog; the rest is tactile lived-in specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether she will embrace her father’s risk-beauty creed. Escalation is dense pattern-accumulation; each new glyph narrows her option to stay detached. Visible price: weeks of night rides, bodily fatigue implied. Final balcony moment forces stance crystallization—she lights the lantern, foreclosing pure rational safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: lantern-glow reprises “start with the light,” reframing risk as aesthetic necessity. No moralizing—wisdom is the lantern’s shadow on her hand. Subtext in subway scars: city’s soul is written by the bored, the lost, the fleetingly connected. Final image is Conceptual Repricing of “sure thing.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice carries mathematician precision (“beautiful certainty of numbers”) yet loosens into lyrical cadence under pressure. Perceptual signature: she sees probability distributions in rust patterns. No dialogue; prose rhythm accelerates with glyph-hunt, slows at balcony. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “dog-eared racing forms, pawn shop receipts, and a single, strange inheritance” packs backstory, character, and prop in one line. No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. “Clover pollen” and “clover melancholy” risk thematic echo but are sparse enough to avoid artifact. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar trope—inheritance scavenger hunt—turns fresh via subway cryptography mapped by a probabilist. City-as-text premise is non-obvious; lantern-mica as Rosetta Stone feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk distinction applies: the stochastic pilgrimage heightens stakes without gimmickry. Could swap “clover melancholy” for another mood, so slight discount.</comment>
