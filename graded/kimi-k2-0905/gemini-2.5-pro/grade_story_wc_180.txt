<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is concrete—his quartz-eye perception steers every beat—and his contradictory impulses (cling vs. let go) play out in embodied gestures on the branch. The final renunciation (leaving ribbon, embracing change) is earned by the remembered quarrel and the seed epiphany, so the cost is felt. Lyra remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is not tested on the page; the score reflects single-POV depth only. Minor −0.2 for one “wave of accidental wisdom” that edges toward label-speak, though it is immediately dramatized by the seed insertion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the council fires him → he trespasses; because ribbon/seed memory strikes → he abandons sealing and instead sponsors growth. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is nailed by line 3, well before 120 words. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the silk becomes a splint, not a seal, and the cost is the public forfeiture of his old mender identity (ribbon left behind). One micro-softening: “accidental wisdom” moment is slightly abstract, but the next sentence re-grounds it in the seed act, so no cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is not postcard backdrop—it supplies the literal rafter-path Elian climbs and the crystal fissure he must treat; spatial choreography stays crisp (“twisting through the rafters like a second, living architecture”). Apple-blossom scent and damp stone are filtered through his quartz-eye bias, guiding selective attention. The ribbon and seed function as micro-setting/objects that constrain the final choice; ribbon becomes physical splint, seed becomes future matrix, satisfying the 9+ gate. One tiny over-adjective stretch (“immense branch…lush orchard…living architecture”) but density remains high and momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the Heartwood crystal—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when traditional tools fail. One meaningful deepening: the crack reframes from wound to germination space, forcing him to abandon mender identity; cost is the public betrayal of his own ethos (leaving ribbon = surrendering past vow). Agency resides entirely in Elian’s decision to insert seed and wrap, not seal; coincidence plays no role. Pressure grows causally under Causal lens; no secondary reversal needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “deciduous vows” starts as daughter’s argument, ends as father’s lived practice—shown by ribbon-to-splint transformation, not told. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image of ribbon left fluttering reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in gesture (thumb tracing frayed edge) and object silence (ribbon abandoned). Insight is earned through seed epiphany that fuses memory, tool, and crystal; no pseudo-profundity or sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s quartz-eye perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax grows shorter under branch-top stress: “He took the tiny seed…pushed.” Distinct perceptual signature—milky quartz vision filters every sensory note. Dialogue is absent, so voice evaluation collapses to interior texture, which remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with escalation: longer reflective sentences on memory, staccato clauses during seed insertion. Information density high—single lines do setting + emotion + tool state. No scaffold loops; only one near-repeat (“lush orchard” echoed) but serves as motif hinge. Metaphors stay coherent (crystal as living bough) and do not invade clarity; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope—last-of-his-kind mender—gets fresh pressure via arboreal cathedral and biologic而非 mechanical repair. Seed-inside-crystal solution is non-obvious yet inevitable given orchard setting and generational theme. Lyric risk (off-stage daughter, symbolic ribbon) pays off through final image that reconfigures meaning. Specific detail (quartz-eye hum, moss nave) prevents generic transplantation; could not swap in any wizard-with-wand plot.</comment>
