<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—duty to preserve wonder vs. fear that only he sees the grey—is dramatized in embodied beats: palm-heat from the seed, trembling earth-pulse, the net-mind casting for hues. The lineage obligation is shown, not told, through the pouch and orchard parapet; the creative impulse drives the decisive tactic (essence-capture), not decoration. No second character, so status/relationship bullets waived; micro-choice hierarchy is legible when he renounces normal planting for soul-weaving, cost felt in the hush that follows. The final hand-over-heart beat crystallizes earned stasis; flaw-risk is the near-perfect calibration—slight safety-hedging in “reverence bordering on prayer.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the escalating greyness → seed-infusion → color-return is a single, coherent intensification rather than causal chain; the final image reweights the world’s palette with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“verdant parapet… cliffside”), no drift. Closure is Charged Poise: the tender shoot’s inner light makes future stakes legible and forecloses retreat. One micro-turn—seed dark → seed galaxy—satisfies the tightening rule; no ellipsis or teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Waterfall-mist, obsidian seed, and cliff-orchard are filtered through Elian’s synesthetic bias; each detail either enables the essence-capture (mist = veil) or mirrors internal shift (emerald deepness returned). Spatial choreography is clean: parapet → waterfall spray → clay pot in contiguous breath. The setting constrains the final tactic—only here can mist be woven—so 9+ gate met. Minor slip: “world exhaled a constant, shimmering mist” edges toward postcard, but immediacy returns with tactile drift-weed of color-threads.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens once when grey leaching becomes visible loss of vibrancy, forcing the essence-capture gamble. Agency is Elian’s refusal of standard planting; cost is the silent ravenous thirst of the seed drinking his gathered aurora. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is the density of hues restored, felt in sweetened air and melodic clarity; no coincidence resolves. Persistent constraint: the orchard now hostage to a single galaxy-seed whose failure is unthinkable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from color-as-wonder vs. spiritual decay; no character moralizes the thesis. The seed’s micro-galaxy reprises earlier “obsidian” shell, reweighting meaning from heirloom to living cosmos. Subtext resides in gesture: hand into veil = acceptance of permeable reality. Final image offers non-literal answer—wonder is not guarded but re-souled. One hairline risk: “color of wonder” flirts with abstraction, yet context particularizes it into nameless hues.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual signature: mist = textile, emotions = hues, world = exhalation. Syntax swells and contracts with breath and water-roar; no filter-verb stack. The lyric register is consistent and taught early (“verdant parapet… world exhaled”), paid off in “radiant hush.” No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a mythic orchard guardian; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with waterfall cadence; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Information dense: single sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and mythic work (“dark as polished obsidian but humming with a latent energy”). One paraphrase loop detected: “slow leaching of vibrancy” echoes “creeping greyness” within two sentences—minor −0.2. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay liquid/light-consistent. Final line lands with image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of spiritual ecology with color-as-matter feels fresh; seed-as-anchor and mist-as-veil avoid generic portal tropes by tight specificity. The “insatiably creative” trait motivates the non-obvious cure—soul infusion rather than irrigation—so premise isn’t derivative garden-variety. Risk: orchard-on-cliff edge nudges familiar sublime, but detail of exhaled mist and nameless hues pushes it past postcard. Synthesis earns +0.2 risk bonus.</comment>
