<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Jealousy of past selves is a sharp, idiosyncratic motive; the embodied nausea of “phantom ache of a future headstone” makes envy visceral. Interior contradiction plays live—dream-flight memory vs. grave-knowledge—driving the micro-choice to attempt the trance. The recorded shift from triage to artistry is visible in the final charcoal stroke, paying the cost of lost innocence. Voice stays particular, though one stock phrase (“profound jealousy”) slightly flattens peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: accumulating images of time-fragments tighten until altitude re-orders them. Orientation anchored by word 60; no disorientation penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the aerial vantage reprices all selves as one map, felt cost in the hush after wing-beat. Persistent constraint—the undated grave—remains, shaping future chronicle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Birch scroll, charcoal crumbs, and cabin knots are tactile tools that constrain medium and metaphor; they literally mark the page that is rewritten at the end. Pine-scent updraft is filtered through a ranger’s trained nose, grounding flight in occupational specificity. Spatial choreography cleanly lifts reader from table to sky without geographic gaps. Final image of “single sprawling map” charges setting with conceptual cost—no 9+ gate missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reclaim narrative coherence from temporal chaos. Escalation is the tightening of envy until it snaps into flight; altitude reframes stakes rather than raises them, a valid Accumulative turn. Cost is paid: the jealous nausea is replaced by awe, foreclosing the safety of hatred. Could edge higher if a second, more concrete forfeiture (lost scroll? injured hand?) had materialized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete return: flight first as dream, then as lived vantage that dissolves envy—no moralizing. “Map” motif re-weights from chaos to artistry without explicit statement. Feral nostalgia’s savage hunger is answered by inclusive overhead gaze, giving lingering ambiguity about whether map-making is acceptance or new delusion. Resonance is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric texture is sustained: crumbling charcoal “dry whisper,” “thick with dust motes,” rhythmic compression under trance. Perceptual signature—time-slippage, ranger’s geologic eye—remains consistent; no head-hop. Internal syntax frays slightly under stress (“yesterday and next week are bleeding”) yet stays legible. Final sentence cadence mirrors glide-path descent, reinforcing closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “charcoal stick crumbled against the fragile grain” does three jobs—sound, texture, metaphor. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentences vary length with breath of flight. One mixed metaphor (“triage… artistry”) is minor. Clean copy beyond one comma splice. Read-aloud rhythm lifts during ascent then steadies, mirroring content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Jealousy of one’s own past selves as propulsive engine is fresh; flight-as-method-of-editing-timeline is non-obvious synthesis. Risk in non-linear chronology is embraced and paid off. Slight proximity to “flying over life’s map” trope is transformed through ranger’s occupational gaze. Conceptual integrity intact—no late rule change.</comment>
