<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mentor’s calm competence and Kaelen’s trembling apprenticeship are cleanly embodied; the ceramic-mask parallel gives interior irony. The final hand-off of the needle crystallizes a hierarchy shift with felt cost—Kaelen’s “trembling hand” shows the mantle passing. No internal contradiction is dramatized on-page, so the arc is linear rather than knotted, but within length this is acceptable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the net still holds thousands, the needle changes hands, the night is “just begun,” re-weighting silence from refuge to burden. Causal chain intact: sailor-knot → unravel → hush restored → apprentice burdened. Orientation locked by line 8; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in mentor’s exhaustion and Kaelen’s tremor—both on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Crystalline chamber, star-shard floor, salt-dark net—details are filtered through restorer’s professional eye for texture and fracture. Spatial choreography holds: apex net, adjacent knot, shared breath, needle passed. The prism sanctuary literally focuses the “interlaced hush,” so setting constrains the ritual and charges the ending image of starlight “less frantic.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent cosmic unraveling—signaled early; micro-escalation occurs as one knot’s resistance sharpens the “angry sorrow” before release. Agency rests in the mentor’s steady un-weaving; price is immediate cold and exhaustion. No reversal, but the tightening inside the single knot suffices for this length. Cost is legible in mentor’s fatigue and Kaelen’s widened eyes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: repair is endless, silence costs. Mask/restorer metaphor quietly reweights when the same hands that mend gods now mend dead sailors. Final image of apprentice holding the needle reframes ritual from sanctuary to inherited burden—resonant, unsentimental. No articulated moral; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person mentor voice maintains a hushed, lapidary rhythm; diction—“starlight…shattered into a thousand trembling shards”—is atmospheric yet precise. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens during knot-work when breath is held. Dialogue sparse, natural, carries status: mentor explains, apprentice whispers. Filter verbs avoided; sensory hierarchy obeys professional gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathy sentences for starlight, clipped fragments during knot tension. No synonym loops; “knot,” “rope,” “strand” are necessary technical repeats. Metaphor density high but patterned—sea, ceramic, starlight—paid off in final cold wash. Opening and closing lines bookend with light imagery, achieving cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fisherman-net-as-purgatory is fresh; tapestry needle as soul-pick is precise, not gimmicky. Mentor-as-mask-restorer gives occupational specificity that generic “medium” would lack. Risk taken in lyric stillness rather than action, and coherence holds. Slight deduction for echo of “starlight-on-crystal” trope without full inversion.</comment>
