<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—idealism versus the spongey dread—are embodied in the thumb-nail ritual and the trembling press into the rock; the final broadcast choice is earned by these micro-moves. Interiority stays concrete: “spongey dread” is felt on skin, not labeled. The copper nail as false-death fragment cleanly externalizes the ancestral flaw and charges the reversal. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; headcount stays within limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he finds verse → decodes vortex → uses nail → unlocks true log → transmits, each step foreclosing the last. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the Guild’s century of erasure is publicly challenged, air itself “begins to dry”—a felt environmental shift. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Far North Experimental Weather Station”). No teleporting props; nail and rock indentation planted and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Weather station’s “grey water” air and the weeping basalt monolith are tactile, selective, and directly constrain the drone launch and the hand-press beat. Micro-setting (copper nail, rock cavity) functions as setting and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: map librarian notices pressure logs, lichen streaks, pitch-sealed leather. Spatial choreography clean: 5 km drone range, head-lamp beam on page 1 of the true logbook.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore ancestor’s erased discovery—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the vortex coordinates prove reachable. One meaningful escalation: the nail shifts from memento to key, foreclosing the option to stay a passive curator. Cost is the instant exposure to Guild retaliation once he opens the secure channel. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of cartographic truth versus institutional lies emerges through the concrete chain: coded stanza → micro-vortex → hidden continent. Subtext lives in objects: copper nail = false death vs. true logbook = living land. Final image of air “beginning to dry” reweights the opening dread without moralizing. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: salt-tongue, sky-river’s child, spongey dread. Syntax mirrors pressure: longer reflective sentences in station, clipped fragments during cavity reveal. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under stress. Diction (“spongey,” “pitch-sealed”) is character-specific, not generic literary register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful: “sky-river’s child” teaches micro-vortex concept early. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Copy-clean: tense stable, pronouns unambiguous, no scaffold hedges.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-shifted jet stream + cartographic curse + reversible exile via coffin nail key. The “map as liar” inversion and the continent erased for resource control feel specific to this world. Risk in embedding a scavenger-hunt inside weather data pays off without gimmickry. Removing the copper nail or the coded stanzas collapses the entire plot.</comment>
