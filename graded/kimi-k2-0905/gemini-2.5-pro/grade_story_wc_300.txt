<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—duty to certify bunkers vs. urge to tear walls down—are voiced early and embodied in the pearl act; the “warmth of a thousand abandoned hopes” vs. “fear that built this place” crystallizes the split under pressure. Micro-choice to lift the pearl is earned by prior interior weighting, not an epiphany. Cost is legible: his inspector oath is forfeit, the cave becomes antenna, irreversible. The arc stays single-POV tight; no second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change + Conceptual Repricing: the pearl-crystal fusion turns the bunker inside-out, broadcasting stored hope—before/after is legible and irreversible. Causal lens holds throughout: because he reads shell confessions → realizes pearl’s function → chooses reversal, each beat tightening options. Cost is on-page—“his oath…screamed at him to stop” vs. pearl’s warmth—delivered in final gesture. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Torlan crystal cave is not backdrop but instrument: facets refract light during climax, conch fossil supplies mechanics, quartz pillars act as transmission rods. Sensory triage narrows to touch (pearl warmth) and sound (resonant hush) under crisis. Spatial choreography clean: conch → obsidian plate → central pillar gap tracked without drift. Environment constrains final act—only the crystal tips can receive the pearl—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—isolate vs. connect—declared in paragraph two and tightened once: the pearl-crystal contact forecloses isolation forever. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence required. Single meaningful turn suffices for 700-word piece; cost (loss of inspector authority, bunker breached) is visible. Could edge higher if a second on-page consequence (e.g., personal physical price) were dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection vs. isolation emerges through shell etchings and pearl accumulation; never sermonized. Final image reweights earlier silence into “unified, silent song of connection”—a non-literal answer with undeniable conceptual cost. No thematic Echo; ambiguity lingers—will surface dwellers even hear the broadcast? Subtext in the fossilized conch: extinct organism now conduit for new life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited keeps strict psychic distance; perceptual signature lyrical, geologist-poetic—“frozen note of the planet’s long, slow song”—without register drift. Compression taught early (“silence…a resonant hush”) and paid off in final cadence. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior monologue; no head-hopping. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentary hesitation beat—“During the heartbeat of a hesitation…”—then releases, mirroring stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud variation; sentences lengthen/desugar under awe, then fracture during hesitation. Figurative control: only two metaphors in climax, both coherent (light “thick as honey,” crystal “heart”). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Minor over-modification in opening (“colossal quartz formations…frozen note”) but cleared before peak beat. Information density high—each sentence advances motive, setting, or object state.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bunker inspection protocol + emotional accumulator pearl + cave-as-antenna. Fossil conch confession system feels newly minted yet inevitable. Risk reversal of shelter into transmitter pays off; not a twist but logical extension of premise. Specificity over trope recycling—no generic apocalypse tableau; crystalline resonance used as literal technology.</comment>
