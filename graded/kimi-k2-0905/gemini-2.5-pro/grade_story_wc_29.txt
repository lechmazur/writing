<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers on “cool bakelite,” the “knot of dread” in her stomach—yet the final beat slides into a summarized rather than dramatized shift; the hoped-for “quiet hum” never quite pierces her contradictory impulses on the page. The cautious hope is declared, not tested in a visible micro-choice that costs her something right here. Still, her competence is balanced by palpable fatigue, and her isolation feels character-specific rather than a stock trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: reverse-engineered counter-frequency → subsonic piggyback → observable de-escalation on the quad. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “fever” breaks in others, not via heroic speech but through her stolen carrier wave, and the cost—her continuing lonely vigil—is felt in the final sentence. The only drag is a brief explanatory lull (“Her weapon would not be a shout but a hum…”) that outlines the plan instead of letting us discover it in action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The radio station as micro-setting is tactile—dust, ozone, bakelite, VU meters—and every tool (charts, waveform generator) is handled, not catalogued. Spatial choreography stays clean: desk → corkboard wall → monitor feed of the quad. The “ethereal grit” tone is anchored in specific sensory grit (dust, ozone) rather than adjective fog, and the final image of the low thrum charging the air is inseparable from the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes—preventing communal fracture via cosmic psy-op—are signaled early and tighten when tonight’s virulent pulse correlates with the town-hall collapse. The single meaningful escalation is her decision to flip the switch; the cost is the risk of exposure and the ongoing arms race with adaptable tricksters, both legible on-page. No false reversals or coincidences; pressure coheres under the Situational lens: one woman vs. unseen nudgers, stance crystallized in the final “exhausted ache.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: manipulation vs. subtle resistance, arrogance of distant players vs. grassroots ingenuity. The returned image of the “dying stars” reweights from loneliness to tactical map, giving conceptual repricing—cosmic scale reframed as hackable interface. No tidy moral; the story ends on endurance, not victory, inviting reflection on quiet civic acts. The only tick is a near-articulation of thesis (“They never imagined their pawns might learn the rules”), dampening subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—radio jargon, stellar coordinates, synesthetic “taste of ozone and dust.” Syntax mirrors her methodical mind: longer analytical sentences that fracture into staccato pulses as she flips the switch. No head-hop; diction stays within a physics-savvy student lexicon. The only micro-slip is one elevated phrase—“conceptual repricing of cosmic power”—that drifts toward editorial rather than lived voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is lean and propulsive; figurative language is rationed, each image (airlock finality, jagged edge sanded smooth) earns its place. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; information density remains high—every paragraph advances stake, tool, or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, bookending the piece with tactile radio metaphors. A single fused participle (“Spending a new chart…”) is a negligible seam.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cosmic-horror mind-control with campus radio activism feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; the trope of “alien signals” is retooled as neuro-acoustic phishing. Specific details—Cygnus Rift coordinates, bakelite knobs, subsonic piggyback—create freshness unattainable by mere label swap. Risk-taking (quiet hum vs. blockbuster EMP) pays off thematically and emotionally. No close echoes of famous scenes; the final image of a lone engineer listening to a hush of eased hatred is memorable.</comment>
