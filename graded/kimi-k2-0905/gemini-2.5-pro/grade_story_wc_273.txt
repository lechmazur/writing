<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s serene anger and refusal to help rescue efforts crystallize his outsider ethos; the ink-step is a believable extrapolation of his tracker training. Interiority stays concrete (“blade’s sharp edge” light felt as “remembered pain”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized on page—only single-minded pursuit—so the internal conflict bullet is missed. Still, the disappearance carries visible cost: he writes himself out of kinship and physical reality, earning his stoic isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s vanishing reweights the premise—he becomes the hunted trace, not the hunter, literalizing “disappearing ink.” Causal chain: eclipse → drone → rockslide → ink map → step-through; each beat is a therefore link. The ink mechanic is introduced and paid off within the scene, satisfying experimental legibility. Cost is legible in the final image: the empty rock patch where a man stood, the drone spinning over its own failure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Wind-carved sandstone basin doubles as canvas and portal; its tactile wear guides Kael’s fractal reading. Light after eclipse is rendered as “remembered pain,” fusing setting with albino physiology. Spatial choreography holds: drone distance, ink spread, foot landing are trackable. The environment constrains the final choice—the basin’s smoothness invites the ink map that alone permits disappearance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hunt the drone to solve time-dilation mystery—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when Kael chooses tracking over rescue. Escalation is causal: each rockslide shard foreshadows temporal distortion; drone’s whine heightens intrusion. The ink doorway is the single decisive turn that forecloses normal pursuit. Cost is conceptual: he forfeits corporeal world and kinship, legible in empty rock image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wild consciousness refuses mechanical observation—Kael out-wilds the machine by becoming unobservable. Subtextual equation of time-dilation with human perception under crisis remains implicit, never lectured. Final image of evaporating ink reprises the fractal map, reweighting “wild” as ephemerality itself. No moral is stated; the reader carries the after-image of erased presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person locked to Kael maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is cold, predator-patient, stone-smooth. Syntax mirrors fractal logic: long noun phrases (“viscous midnight that spread in defiance of gravity”) compress to stark verbals (“he stepped”). No dialogue, so voice evaluation is pure narrative texture—controlled, mythic, yet precise. Register never drifts into academic or corporate diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limber: each sentence layers image, motion, and concept without paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“syrupy stretching of time”) extend consistently from rock-and-ink physics. Rhythm accelerates into the disappearance beat, then snaps to white-space silence. Only hairline slip: “internal light” is vague amid otherwise razor-sharp sensory catalog.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of quantum-ink portal with stone-age tracker feels inevitable, not gimmicky; trope of “vanishing hero” is re-cast as epistemic insurgency against surveillance. The eclipse timing and rockslide coincidence serve theme—wild irruption—not plot convenience. Risk taken: entire mechanics explained in one paragraph yet paid off through sensory enactment. Specificity of “consciously wild” world rules anchors freshness.</comment>
