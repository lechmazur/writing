<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s preemptive nostalgia is more label than lived contradiction; still, his final choice to record the choice-to-forget is a credible renunciation that costs him the comfort of inherited innocence. Interiority is vivid (“a string pulled too tight”) and his embodied dread under lightning flashes tracks. The flaw: the micro-choice chain is thin—one measurement sprint—so the turn feels slightly under-cooked for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the fog shifts from prison to monument, re-weighting the entire premise with undeniable social cost. Causal lens holds: storm → crystal resonance → shadow measurement → memory reveal → archival decision, each step shrinking options. The persistent constraint—he must now guard the silence he once wanted to break—locks the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and lightning-as-clock are not backdrop; they supply the only light source that makes the shadow-reading possible, directly shaping tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: ozone, glass tremor, wet stone under boots. Micro-setting (the calibrated rod, the glyph) constrains the final keystroke. One hairline slip: “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” is repeated verbatim, slightly diluting freshness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to expose or honor the engineered amnesia—tightens once: the perfect shadow alignment forces the reveal and immediately forecloses the option to remain ignorant. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; storm energy escalates crystal resonance, narrowing his choices to “key the coordinates or not.” Cost is legible: he forfeits moral simplicity and inherits guardianship of silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of archival duty: identity sculpted not from memory but from curated forgetting. Subtext lives in the hush that moves from menace to reverence. Final image of the dimmed, “finally at peace” crystals re-weights the opening dread without moralizing. One echo of thematic label (“impossible choice”) in last paragraph keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter—lightning after-images, rod tremor in damp fingers. Syntax lengthens under storm tension, then contracts to short declaratives at the console. No head-hopping; diction stays within his antiquarian lexicon. A single filter-verb cluster (“he saw… he felt…”) during the white-out is acceptable stress compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm mirrors storm cadence: long rolling sentences build, then fracture into staccato keystrokes. Metaphors are spare and precise—“lightning spiderwebbed,” “discordant note”—never stacked. One paraphrase loop (“the hush that remained was no longer one of absence, but of profound understanding”) could lose half its clause, but it lands outside the closure beat so penalty is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired “collective amnesia” trope and makes it literal meteorology, then re-casts the archivist as conservator of engineered ignorance—fresh without gimmickry. Shadow-length archaeology as forensic method is new to short SFF and is organically necessitated by stormlight scarcity. Risk pays off: the quiet ending refuses cathartic revelation, choosing elegiac stewardship instead.</comment>
