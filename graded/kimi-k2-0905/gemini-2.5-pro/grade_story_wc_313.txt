<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—duty to the levee versus compulsion to excavate the past—plays out in embodied beats: the boots sucked by mud, the steady hand on archival ink. The micro-choice to strike a single line rather than erase embodies “precisely humane” and costs him the safety of inherited legend. Great-uncle’s restored sacrifice rewrites Elias’s own identity, the visible price being the community’s murmured re-evaluation in the hall. No therapy-speak; even the attic epiphany is filtered through tactile photograph and dust.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: wind-chime silence → reservoir recession → label find → photograph trail → ledger correction → public exhibit. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the town ledger’s new marginalia shifts communal memory, undeniable social cost felt when descendants read the appended page. Orientation anchored by word 50 (Midnight Ridgeway, twilight, porch). Persistent constraint: the drought-exposed ruins keep choice binary—let libel stand or risk civic shame.</comment>

<comment>Setting is weaponised: each drop of water lost exposes more bone of Aethelburg, tightening Elias’s ethical vise. The sapphire label’s return on the corkboard finale recharges the drowned tavern as communal relic. Spatial clarity maintained—mud suck, attic dim, archive dust—without tourist catalog. Micro-setting rule met: the ledger as physical object receives the decisive ink stroke that reconfigures history.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—clearing family name versus preserving communal myth—tightens when the last photograph identifies great-uncle. One meaningful reversal: the scratched-face mystery flips from coward to hero, forcing the ledger edit. Cost is legible: Elias trades personal certainty for public vulnerability, visible when townsfolk confront the corkboard. Pressure stays causal under selected lens; no coincidence rescues him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific triangulation: drought reveals bones, photographs reveal truth, ink reveals courage. No explicit moral; final image of quiet murmurs around corkboard lets community rewire its own myth. Subtext carried by objects—label equals lost culture, ledger equals communal soul. Final resonance: “mirrored hush” is refilled not with noise but with shared understanding, a CR that reweights silence itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s perceptual filter: “cracked mud…sucking at his boots,” “archival ink” scent. Diction—“sick man’s gums,” “skeletal grin”—is character-consistent, not writerly flourish. No head-hopping; even community’s reaction is filtered through his watching their faces. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for archive nights, staccato for ledger edit moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “reservoir’s water had receded like a sick man’s gums” performs simile, world rule, and stakes in one. No filler loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Final line—“mirrored hush…filled…with understanding”—reuses opening image with recharged meaning, satisfying pattern payoff. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drought-as-exhumation couples ecological and mnemonic archaeology. Photograph trail converting civic legend into private restitution is non-obvious. Risk in quiet ending paid off by Conceptual Repricing rather than spectacle. Details particular: Seraph’s Kiss liqueur, corkboard exhibit—could not swap names without breaking logic.</comment>
