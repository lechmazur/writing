<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—self-punishing guilt clashing with stubborn hope—is dramatized in embodied beats: fingers in soil, the stone, the tarot card. Every micro-choice (feeding the shadow his own sun-drenched memory) is a renunciation that costs him the last private piece of his traded future, making the Earned Stasis believable and painful.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the burned Sun card planted as guard-stone reweights the bargain from despair to vigilance. Causal linkage holds—each beat grows from the prior (trade → void → root attack → memory offering → card re-purposed) and the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop: the femur Elara’s root finally touches is the literal marrow that lets the sapling live, and the card stuck in that soil becomes a talismanic constraint. Spatial choreography stays crisp—moss, ribs, tendril, card—so environment shapes the win condition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore Elara’s joy—tightens when the void manifests as shadow strangulating her tree. The single tightening is decisive: Aris must surrender his last private destiny shard; refusal equals her death. Cost is visible the instant the leaf brightens and his own chest feels hollower.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning is not retrieved but reinscribed—stone, card, memory become grafts in a living palimpsest. The final image re-answers the opening question (can a torn soul be patched?) with a non-verbal “only by carving new meaning into the wound.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps psychic distance steady; perception filters through Aris’s soil-stained fingers and guilt-lit synapses. No head-hop; diction stays within his lexicon (“damp earth and old promises”). The lyric cadence of “fiercely gentle focus” is pattern-taught and paid off in the kneeling offer to the shadow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Density is high—“phosphorescent moss on the ceiling casting long, skeletal shadows” does three jobs in nine words. No loops, no mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates during the shadow attack, then exhales with the scraping root. Final line lands on a resonant monosyllabic beat: “one piece at a time.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “destiny-for-marrow” barter is a fresh graft of Orphean underworld onto arboreal necromancy; tarot-as-talisman rather than prophecy. The risk of quiet, interior climax is embraced and paid off by the conceptual repricing of the burned Sun, making the synthesis feel inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
