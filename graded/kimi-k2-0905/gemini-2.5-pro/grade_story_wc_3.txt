<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in tactile micro-moves (dirt under nails, seed’s heft) that escalate into a single, credible renunciation of mourning-as-stasis. Contradictory impulses—clinging to Kael’s waveform vs. surrendering to translation—coexist in-scene, not exposition. The final act of planting is earned by prior pattern; the cost is visible in the “still, deep well of sorrow” that remains. No diagnostic self-talk; every label (“haunted ambitions”) is paid for with physical ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “distance” becomes measurable space between connected points rather than erasure. Causal linkage (because/therefore) holds: seed → waveform → filament → re-encoded Kael. Orientation anchor arrives by line 5; no drift. Cost is legible in the arbor’s hum climbing a semitone and the filament’s first pulse—physics, not sentiment, reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arbor’s magnetic field lines act as both environment and tool, constraining seed placement and tuning the final filament. Cloud-top world rules remain consistent; no exposition dump. Setting is filtered through translator’s bias (cuneiform syntax, waveform vocabulary), never tourist gaze. Micro-setting qualifies: the seedbed becomes the entire cosmos in miniature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove information is never lost—tightens once when the semitone shift confirms phase-transition hypothesis. No outside antagonist; pressure is internal/epistemic, sufficient for 600-word frame. Cost is the irreversibility of Kael’s new encoding; she forfeits resurrection in favor of legibility. Agency is intellectual (planting as experiment) yet emotionally costly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurrence of “translation” applied first to tablets, then to death itself; no authorial thesis stated. Final image answers the thematic question—what remains after loss?—by reframing absence as encoded presence. Subtext in the seed’s luminescent filament: knowledge literally illuminates the void. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual engine—cuneiform, waveforms, magnetic syntax. No head-hops; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“her hands…methodical grace”). Diction remains within translator’s lexicon; no academic register drift. Rhythm accelerates at planting beat, then breathes with filament reveal—intentional cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances image, physics, or stakes. Mixed metaphors forbidden—magnetic field and waveform language stay coherent. High information density: “collapsed star” seed packs mass, death, and potential in two words. Final line cadence mirrors arbor hum, achieving sonic closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief memoir meets quantum information theory via cuneiform translator. Premise is not template-SFF; world rules are taught through action, not infodump. Risk in quiet ending succeeds because filament image reweights prior motifs. Could not swap setting or occupation without breaking logic; specificity is irreversible.</comment>
