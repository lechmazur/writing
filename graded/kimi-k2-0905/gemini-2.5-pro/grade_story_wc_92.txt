<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s calmly inventive trait is dramatized through the tactile quill-key sequence; the contradiction between obedient mask and revolutionary intent is held in-scene. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible as he weighs exposure risk vs. network ignition. Final smile carries cost—irreversible betrayal of the old guard—earned by prior causality. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak intrudes on the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates: each angle-click tightens options and triggers the light-network, producing a decisive change of control before the old guard notices. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; no disorientation serves closure. Closure unit is a CR: the fort’s light-pattern reweights authority with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint—Kael’s lone access to the sundial—shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phosphorescent algae-walls and moss-slick stone are filtered through Kael’s sentry priorities; sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound under blackout. Sundial as micro-setting constrains the key angles and charges the final image when its bare stone face becomes the fulcrum of revolution. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from gate to courtyard to tower windows. Environment actively guides the clandestine action rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent seizure of the fort—signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each click that forecloses retreat. One meaningful escalation: the chime shifts possibility space from secrecy to distributed insurrection. Cost is legible: Kael’s exposure risk crystallizes in the smile that acknowledges irreversible treason. No coincidence resolves; all pressure stems from his engineered causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of invisible revolution emerges through light-pattern and silence rather than assertion. Subtext resides in the half-painted sundial—beautification stalled, now weaponized—its unfinished face mirroring the unfinished polity. Final image of winking windows reweights prior “useless” blackout into collective agency. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is carried by the reconfigured light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael with perceptual signature of measured hush and geometric precision. Syntax tightens under pressure—“knuckles white around the bronze”—mirroring keyed turns. No head-hopping; distance remains consistent. Voice modulation aligns with blackout tension without register drift.</comment>

<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. High density: “coded angles of the painted roman numerals” fuses world-rule, tool, and action. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“island of soft, pearlescent light”—never clutters the high-pressure beat. Final line lands with rhythmic snap and no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Revolution via algae-embedded secondary network is a fresh inflection on siege fiction. The sundial-as-cipher repurposes civic waste into tactical key, transforming stalled monument into narrative engine. Specificity of phosphorescent masonry and nutrient flows prevents generic swap. Risk-taking structure—no battle, only light—pays off in conceptual reprice.</comment>
