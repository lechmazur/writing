<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“salvage something pure”—is dramatized through the trance dives and the final exposure choice; her interiority stays concrete, never explanatory. The contradictory pull between mourning and forensic detachment is felt in body-level beats (polishing ice, candle breath). No secondary relationship on page, so crucible test waived. The renunciation—letting both spirits fade—carries visible cost in the shifted weight of the melted globe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet but decisive RR: the boy’s smile and intact snowfall reprice the artifact from prison to memorial under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each dream-cameo builds density until the final shared dream crystallizes meaning. The melted globe’s state change on-page (still broken, no longer a prison) is the legible cost. No orientation drift; glacier shrine and dream-ocean anchors taught by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice shrine, candle flicker, million-year cold—each detail is filtered through Elara’s salvage urgency, not tourism. The melted snow globe constrains her tactics: its distortion dictates the dream-route she must map. Spatial choreography is immaculate: globe shelf, control panel heat source, final shake inside dream. Setting charges the final image: the globe’s new stillness mirrors the released souls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the boy’s witness—tightens as cameos accumulate; the man’s eclipse appearances escalate obstruction under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: when Elora projects the man’s prior sabotage dreams, the stake widens from rescue to exposure. Cost is legible: the trance depletes candlelight and bodily breath; the final fade leaves her holding a relic emptied of haunting. Agency is attention-based exposure, not fist-fight, fitting situational pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as salvageable wreckage—emerges through recurrent snow-globe states rather than statement. Subtext lives in the man’s shadow eclipsing the boy; no moral sermon required. The final intact skier inside a broken globe reweights “pure” as preserved memory, not perfection. Ambiguity lingers: is the man evil or cowardly? Complexity retained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: “breath-hollowed space,” “blue, million-year-old cold.” Rhythm modulates: long hypnotic sentences for trance, staccato clauses when dream-cameos burst. No dialogue to distort voice. Poetic diction (“borrowed starlight”) is internally consistent with her vocation. Filter verbs serve trance logic, not timidity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “walls weep history” compresses time and mood. No loops or synonym churn; each snow-globe return adds new informational layer. Figurative language stays coherent—glacier breath, human eclipse—without mixed-metaphor collisions. Final paragraph lands with crisp image-propulsion: “still broken…no longer a prison.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—dream-diving arctic soul-salvager—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (ghost child, evil adult) are re-cast through forensic trance and artifact mis-en-scene. Risky lyric accumulation paid off by conceptual repricing of broken/whole. Without the melted globe exactly slumped, the closure image collapses; irreplaceable core.</comment>
