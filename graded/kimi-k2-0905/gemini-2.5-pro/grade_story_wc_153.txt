<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s exhaustion and single-minded resolve are viscerally embodied; the shard’s cold weight and her whispered name-choice show micro-decisions under pressure. Kael’s silent weep lands as credible renunciation, not epiphany—his fear is shown, not labeled. The “fierce tenderness” is demonstrated when she risks collapse to give him the unsent truth. Only the off-stage “moon will knit her back” keeps the change from being fully paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mist-written “sorry” evaporates, leaving Kael with the unalterable knowledge of why he stayed. The causal chain—shard pressed to glass → breath + name → condensation text → song → Kael’s recognition—tightens once and forecloses denial. Cost is legible in Elara’s sway and the moon she must now wait for. Lens is causal; every beat is “because/therefore,” no reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mangrove roots drinking saltwater, the single windowpane, and the shard’s jagged edge constrain every motion: no wide shots, only tidal breath and fogged glass. Humidity vs. stone cold creates the tactile arena where memory condenses. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies stay tracked in the stilt-hut, no drift. The setting literally supplies the writing surface that delivers the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Kael face the instant he chose fear over love? Pressure escalates once: spirits’ murmur → hymn → keening as text appears, forcing recognition. No reversals needed; the single deepening is enough. Cost is Elara’s spent energy and Kael’s irrevocable sight of his own cowardice—options narrow to live with the truth, no fix offered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: unsent words still shape lives; silence can be read, not erased. Subtext lives in the shard (a gargoyle’s spout once drained rain, now drains memory) and in the evaporating “sorry” that can’t be pocketed. No moral is stated; the final image of moonlight on stone reweights the premise: truth is cold, but visible. Ambiguity remains—Kael’s next choice is unwritten—yet resonance is complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptions: “stones rubbing together underwater,” “low tide” skin. Syntax lengthens and softens under exhaustion, then snaps short when the shard meets glass. No head-hop; Kael’s interior is shown only through external gasp and tears. The lyric register is consistent, taught by the first clause and held through the final moonlit shard.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from humid coils to shard-sharp fragments; no two openings repeat. Figurative layering is dense yet precise—“air thick as unsent letter’s ink” fuses setting and theme in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause adds new pressure or sensory angle. A single hairline slip: “temporal stillness heavy with the ghosts of words” edges toward abstraction, but the next line re-anchors to the shard.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The condensation-autograph is a fresh twist on ghost-messages; coupling it with a gargoyle shard repurposed as psychic stylus feels inevitable yet new. Mangrove-as-memory-labyrinth avoids swamp-gothic cliché by shrinking the arena to one windowpane. The story’s risk is its quiet, anti-redemptive ending—no forgiveness offered, only sight—and the risk pays off. Specificity of the unsent love-letter transforms a familiar regret plot into something irreplaceable.</comment>
