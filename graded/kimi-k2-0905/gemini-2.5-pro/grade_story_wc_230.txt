<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s compulsive honesty and the glass-eye gambit are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (the storm-press, the temple-touch, the first withheld sentence). The final “It is peaceful here” crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost: he forfeits total candor to keep Lena’s memory private. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes. The neighbor is thin but functions only as pressure trigger, so cast limit is met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he is truth-compelled, therefore he seeks the relic; because the storm supplies turmoil, therefore the attunement works; because the eye absorbs the memory-stream, he can now answer partially. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—his first voluntary silence—landed on the page in the final line. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (hanging orchard, storm, solitary house). No teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The ravine orchard is not backdrop: wind threatens the grafted trees, rain hammers glass walls, and the storm’s peak provides the required “environmental turmoil” that powers the relic ritual. Sensory triage—cold glass eye against temple, salt-sting of rain—filters through Elias’s mycologist gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: box → palm → temple → mantelpiece. The damaged canopy at dawn mirrors his truncated honesty without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—privacy for Lena’s memory—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the neighbor’s casual question. The storm beat tightens stakes: failure means permanent exposure. The occlusion act forecloses the old compulsion; the price is the lifelong burden of guarded speech. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 750-word scope; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme— the right to an inner life—emerges through the truffle-forager’s rational attempt to engineer silence, not through sermon. The glass eye’s cerulean gaze reframes “witness” from surveillance to protection; the final quiet sentence reweights every prior spill of truth. Subtext resides in what he does not say. No moralizing tagline; the image of the eye on the mantel carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: mycological diction (“symbiotic,” “Tuber melanosporum”), storm-light seen through apple blossoms, the eye’s “tiny radial lines.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short clauses during the ritual, mirroring stress. No head-hopping; neighbor’s dialogue is spare, utilitarian, distinct from lyrical interior. Register never drifts into academic filler.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: one-sentence micro-paragraphs (“The storm broke at dawn”) act as valve releases. No synonym loops or scaffold; “truth” appears only when dramatized. Metaphors are controlled—eye as “guardian,” orchard as “fractured grace”—and do not clot the climax. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo (storm / quiet). Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus aftermath and meteorite glass eye feel fresh, yet the emotional engine—grief demanding privacy—is timeless, avoiding gimmick. Truffle hunting as rationalist anchor for a mystic rite is an unexpected synthesis that deepens character logic. The relic’s rule-set is taught early and obeyed; no late cheat. Risk in merging hard-SF MacGuffin with lyric grief pays off in the hushed final image.</comment>
