<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—healing others through touch while living in a scentless void—drives every micro-choice; the screw-reading beat embodies her new vocation with tactile precision. The old man’s grief is sketched more as label than contradiction, but his trembling still supplies external pressure that forces Elara to act, not merely reminisce. The ending renunciation—she breathes empty air and feels weight, not absence—earns its poise via prior causal chain of sensory substitution. Character competence is balanced by visible fragility (hand tremor, cloth-polishing ritual), satisfying the flaw/struggle test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the clean, empty breath reconfigures her loss as gain with undeniable conceptual cost—she now measures life in liquid heartbeats she cannot smell. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each droplet, gear, and worn thread adds density until the screw’s history tips the emotional scale. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (fog, shop, father, clepsydra). No meaningful escalation beyond the single deepening, but that is sufficient under the 800-word default; cost is legible in the final image and ties back to the persistent constraint of scentlessness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The water-clock shop functions as micro-setting: every droplet and brass gear constrains Elara’s new identity, replacing essential-oil jars with liquid time. The screw’s worn threads serve as portable setting-as-body; its tactile geography dictates the final emotional map. Fog and morning light evolve from muffled grey to hazy shafts, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean—workbench, box, calipers, velvet bed—tracking the screw’s journey and the old man’s retreat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elara still heal without scent? The single meaningful tightening occurs when the screw demands she translate metal into emotion—success forecloses return to aromatherapy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist, but internal want (to feel useful) clashes with permanent loss. Cost is visible: she accepts the weight of scentless air, a conceptual price that alters her stance toward her own disability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile metaphor: healing is not aroma but attention to ordinary miracles hidden in worn threads. Subtext lives in gesture—silent tears, trembling calm—never sermon. The ending’s empty-air breath answers the thematic question without moralizing: meaning is re-priced by choosing to inhabit loss rather than fill it. No motif checklist; the screw’s return carries prior weight, not symbolic graft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s tactile bias; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“liquid heartbeats,” “sterile gleam”). Perceptual signature is scentless—every observation is filtered through touch, sound, light, never smell. Rhythm flexes: long sentences for drip-time, staccato for screw revelations. Dialogue is sparse but voice-distinct—old man’s “spun-glass” thinness versus father’s brisk brass tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Clean, high-density lines; figurative language is selective and paid off (“liquid heartbeats” echoes in final breath). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Strong verbs—“scuttled,” “scuttling,” “recalibrated”—replace modifiers. Paragraph cuts are surgical; removing any would delete knowledge or charge. Minor scaffold: “trembling calm” is repeated verbatim in prompt echo; does not touch closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—aromatherapist turned scentless clock-mender who reads emotion from screws—is non-obvious and specific. Transformation test: swap scent/touch and the entire emotional arc collapses. Risky compression of midwife life into one screw succeeds because wear pattern becomes music score. No familiar pop-culture echoes. Fresh inflection: “humanize” as tactile translation, not sentimentality.</comment>
