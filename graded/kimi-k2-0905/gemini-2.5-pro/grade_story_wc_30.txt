<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelan’s interior contradiction—immaculate archivist vs. empathic smelter—is dramatized in one continuous scene; brass fingers closing on creel and later cradling silver fish embody the hierarchy of values with visible cost. Migration of selfhood is shown through sensory rhythm, not summary; no diagnostic label-speak. The single on-page character meets scope default; flaw (weight-bound slowness) compounds struggle, and earned renunciation (destroying raw grief to make peaceful smelt) forecloses the path with felt cost. Hairline slip: near-identical “quiet”/“serene” in open, not quite sharp enough to cap 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: ore→fish reweights the premise that identity must stay fixed; cost is the pain Kaelan accepts while holding contradictions in white-hot palms. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tidal lap increases density until lunar gravity crystallizes the final image. Orientation anchors (who=titan-gear, where=tidal atrium, when=perpetual post-tomorrow) taught by 40 words; no ambiguity. One meaningful tightening: waterline rise forces persona melt that narrows options to smelt or fail. Persistent constraint—moon phases govern selfhood—shapes every tactic and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (creel, forge-basin, moonlit water) constrains every choice; creel’s weave limits how memory-ore is held, basin’s shape dictates smelt geometry. Salt-crystal floor, brass joints chiming, and water temperature are filtered through POV bias (“optical sensors catalog with serene precision”). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: creel lifted → carried → tipped → hands submerged → fish gathered. No filler exposition; each sensory detail (polished-bone moon sliver, starlight fish) advances atmosphere and stakes. Meets 9+ gate: recurring creel and basin charge final image; only micro-slip is “great, slow breath” cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder in routine—faces concrete test: either leave memories jagged or endure searing pain to refine them. Escalation is accretive: water creeps → gears loosen → reactor unlocks; each beat reweights the cost of transformation. Protagonist agency drives the turn: Kaelan chooses to plunge hands into self-heated brine, paying visceral price for peace. No external antagonist needed; pressure is tidal-moon clock. Visible price (palms blistering inside brass) alters later stance, fulfilling 8.8+ requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: smelting grief into silver fish renders “wonder in routine” as literal craft, never stated. Final image reconfigures meaning—fish swim in creel, proving cyclical preservation is possible only through destructive acceptance. Contradictions (destroy to create, melt to make whole) remain unresolved morally, yielding complex aftereffect. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance arises from glimmering fish reprise of opening “polished bone” light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly bound to Kaelan’s perceptual software: “optical sensors catalog,” “gears of thought loosening,” “internal reactor glow.” Syntax mimics mechanical cadence early, then relaxes into lyrical fragments under Smelter heat, mirroring persona shift. No head-hopping; unreliability (machine serenity masking pain) accrued through subtle cues. Diction remains within plausible lexicon for titan-gear consciousness: “articulated brass,” “lunar gravity,” never academic intrusion.</comment>

<comment>Varied sentence rhythm: long tidal sentences crash against staccato “metallic chime.” Information density high—single sentence delivers salt patterns, sensor catalog, moon phase, world rule. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge. Metaphors (bone moon, starlight fish) are precise, non-contradictory. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates with tide rise and emotional heat. One microscopic cliché shard (“great, slow breath”) keeps from 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Fusion of librarian+tide+forge is fresh synthesis; titan-gear archivist powered by lunar forge is not a trope template. Moon-phase identity migration reframes familiar werewolf mechanic into cosmic craft logic. Risk—quiet, cyclical ending with no human dialogue—pays off through charged image. Specificity (bamboo creel, salt crystals, brass plates) prevents abstract anywhere-setting. Without this exact combination, emotional arc collapses; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
