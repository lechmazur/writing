<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—Elara’s “wide, soft net” perceptual stance is vivid, and the contradiction between needing certainty and needing ambiguity is dramatized through the thumb-smudge beat. The final renunciation (leaving the word blurred) is a credible, costed stance. Minor slip: “fault-tolerant oracle” is asserted twice but never activated—no system crash or bypass is shown—so the trait feels label-only rather than lived.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each station sound (barograph click, ozone scent) layers density until the illustration reveal acts as pattern break that reweights the stake. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the decision *not* to read the word crystallizes options and carries felt cost (“she could not bear it”). Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—the smudge she created—shapes the final tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Weather-station micro-setting is tactile and selective: wool blanket against skin, barograph needle, anemometer whine—all filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The alpine light on the windowsill charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility stumbles. Only minor gap: “west-facing window” appears late, so early spatial footprint could be sharper.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—need to know Liam’s fate—tightens once: smudge → ambiguity → renunciation. Escalation is textural, not causal: each sensory detail increases emotional density until the illustration flip supplies the single deepening. Cost is legible—she forfeits certainty forever. Could wish for one earlier micro-choice that foreshadows the final renunciation, but the pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: ambiguity as survival mechanism. The blurred ink reprices the rule-set—truth is no longer binary but atmospheric. No moralizing; the final image lets the reader feel the cost. One minor echo: “auroral sorrow” edges toward label-speak, but it’s rescued by alpine light payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is sinewy and climate-specific: “raw wool,” “ozone from the storm two nights ago,” “hygrometer by feel.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s data-filtered mind without ever sounding report-like. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she was peripherally aware”). Rhythm clusters in short, cold clauses that breathe with altitude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (sensor data + emotional charge). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “auroral sorrow” and “indigestible stone,” but figurative layer is sparse enough to stay coherent. Final line lands with imagistic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: using data-nerd perceptual stance to explore grief avoidance. Smudge-as-schrödinger’s-word is a sharp, non-obvious pivot. Alpine botany + meteorology mash-up feels specific rather than quirky. Risk is modest—quiet lyric rather than structural experiment—but coherence justifies it.</comment>
