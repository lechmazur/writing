<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Silas’s guarded solitude and wordless stone-code intimacy are rendered through bodily routine and withheld glances; the pocketed cobalt shard embodies the bond without expositional nudging. His mechanical competence and reflexive sprint into the storm feel lived-in, yet the final beat—circle of stones as farewell—arrives more as symbol than as irreversible loss foreshadowed by prior choices. The keeper’s absence is handled as echo rather than relationship crucible, so the relationship bullet stays inert. Still, interior contradiction (stoic routine vs. sudden protective imperative) is dramatized in action and qualifies for 9− quick test; the slight under-cooking of cost visibility caps at 8.7.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: lamp fails → dread spikes → Silas braves squall → finds log → repairs beam → builds circle. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are nailed within 60 words; no disorientation. Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: he cannot save the man but commits to the light, with the sea-glass held against the beam re-pricing their silent contract. Cost is visible in the ache of the final image; lens holds as Causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>Spray-choked skiff, iron stair cut into cliff, and the hulking Fresnel receive only the sensory detail the crisis warrants—no tourist catalogue. The oilskins, cobalt shard, and stone stacks function as micro-setting that literally guide choices and encode meaning. Weather is not backdrop but antagonist, forcing mooring in cove and slick ascent. Environment charges the final image: circle of stones on the same shore where earlier pyramids spoke.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the keeper and the light—is signaled the instant the beam dies. Escalation is singular but sufficient: storm + darkness = no safe passage. Agency is visible in each tactical step (skiff launch, climb, fuel-line purge). Cost is the emotional forfeiture of ever meeting the keeper; the circle encodes that loss on-page. No secondary reversal, but one meaningful tightening fits this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of wordless communion and custodial duty emerges solely through ritual (letters unread, stones unreadable to anyone else). Subtext lives in what is not exchanged: names, faces, good-bye. The glass shard’s blue recurs as both hope and bruise; final image reweights it as relic of an intimacy that can outlive death. No explicit thesis—only the circle’s silent period.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Silas’s perceptual filter: storm spray tastes metallic, lens facets “absorb rather than refract.” Syntax tightens under duress—fragments mimic gasping climb. No head-hop; keeper’s vantage is only inferred. Diction is sailor-lean, never venturing beyond Silas’s plausible lexis. Rhythm modulates: calm opening cadence, staccato during repair, then quiet close-out that mirrors lamp’s renewed sweep.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear shows varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. Figurative language is sparse; when it appears (“lighthouse heartbeat”) it is anchored in Silas’s sensory panic. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; “supply skiff, the Tern” is the only proper-noun echo, justified. Information density high—each line layers weather, body, and task. Closure image is uncluttered, letting glass + beam do final lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Anonymous stone-code courtship feels fresh against familiar lighthouse rescue frame; trope is inverted so the keeper is already gone. Cobalt shard re-weights from keepsake to relic without narrative declaration. Risk is taken in leaving keeper unseen yet emotionally central; success shows intimacy can be pure protocol. Specificity of stone syntax and skiff mechanics resists swap-test with generic sea tale.</comment>
