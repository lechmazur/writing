<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coachman’s quiet atonement is embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling, pinching loam, selecting a seed—so motive stays visceral. Interiority is sparse but particular: “a library of potential futures” compresses guilt and hope without label-speak. No contradiction pulses inside him, so the arc is steady endurance rather than change; the cost is the emptied satchel, felt on the last line. Still, the absence of a live opposing will keeps the crucible one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the planted jetty reconfigures the dead sea’s meaning while the lighter satchel makes the cost tactile. Causality is lyric-accumulative—each seed placed because a gull’s cry translated a ghost-current—so the lens holds. Orientation is swift: “stone finger pointing into the corpse of the sea” anchors us by line 3. One soft spot: the war guilt is told once (“a war he hadn’t fought”) yet never refracts back into present-tense doubt; the beat still lands but could bite deeper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The jetty’s chemiluminescent blossoms, weathered fissures, and salt-slick stone are filtered through the coachman’s priestly care; every tactile detail guides where soil and seed go. The reef’s bleached bones beneath sterile water act as mirrored antagonist, tightening stakes without exposition. The final image—“a narrow line of hope against the vast and silent dark”—re-uses the jetty’s geometry to re-weight the whole scene. Environment literally constrains the planting pattern, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: can a living line be scratched across a dead ocean? Pressure tightens when each gull-cry shrinks planting options to one crack of silt; refusal means empty satchel and failed penance. No reversal occurs—escalation is accumulative density, not causal turn—but under the lyric lens that suffices. The price is the emptied satchel and the aching back, both on-page; options narrow from “library of futures” to seeds spent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: restoration not of the world but of the human place within its ruins. The submerged concord is never sermonized; it materializes as seed pressed into stone. Final image re-prices hope from abundance to a single disciplined line, letting ambiguity linger. The refusal to resurrect the reef keeps the moral complex—garden as elegy, not fix.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a liturgical distance, mirroring the coachman’s ceremonial precision; diction (“tabernacle,” “velvet pockets”) stays inside his lexicon of reverence. Rhythm lengthens during planting, then shortens to a quiet coda, echoing physical fatigue. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on narrative texture—controlled, consistent, and pressure-responsive. The lyric pattern is taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric charge, and causal push (“He took a pinch of dark loam... and began to fertilize the crack”). Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Micro-loop check clean: no paraphrase redundancies or template cadences. One hairline slip: “sterile water” appears twice; the repetition is minor but keeps the category from perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic planter who translates extinct ocean dialects from gull throats is a fresh synthesis; no trope checklist here. The jetty garden converts ecological grief into tactile ritual, avoiding eco-cliché or messianic redemption. Specificity of seed choice (Cliff-Thistle vs. Ghost-Lily) grounds the concept in botanic reality, making the fantastical believable. Risk is quiet—no twist—but coherence and compressed image-making feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
