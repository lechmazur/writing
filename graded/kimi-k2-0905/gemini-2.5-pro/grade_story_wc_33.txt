<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior ache is vivid and embodied (“quiet ache in his chest”), his method-of-absences is a believable, character-specific competence, and his final pedal away carries a palpable cost (“impossibly light” bottle, “weight of duty fulfilled”). The flaw: the family on the far side is never rendered as individuals, so the relational crucible is theoretical; the emotional risk is mostly prospective rather than witnessed, capping full 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is watertight: mapped absences → static bomb → upload → bluebird ping. Closure lands as a CR (“he had learned how to build it, one absence at a time”) with undeniable conceptual cost; the border rule-set is permanently repriced. One hairline slip: the arcade’s panel is introduced only at the moment it is used, a micro-convenience that prevents a perfect 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted postbox, pulsing cobalt sign, and brittle hush are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s tactical gaze; the bottle itself acts as micro-setting that constrains choice. The setting charges the final image: the arcade lights recede into darkness just as the promise is re-lit in the ether, meeting the 9-band gate. Geography is crystal-clear across the 30-second corridor, no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the ghost-daughter’s passage—is signaled at “a family waited for a ghost”; pressure tightens as the countdown hits zero and the bottle uncorks, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: the bottle is spent, the corridor collapses, and Elias’s future risk is implied (“another delivery tomorrow”). Escalation is single but sufficient; the absence of an on-page antagonist is a deliberate negative space that fits the concept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: promises can be mended not by brute-force smuggling but by carving negative space inside a surveillance state. The final image of Elias pedaling into darkness reweights every prior beat of absence-mapping, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo line mars the ending; the insight is left humming like static.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person close voice carries a disciplined lyric cadence—“dust…a second skin of grit and compromise,” “fading bruise” sky—yet stays inside Elias’s tactical perception. Rhythm accelerates into clipped fragments at climax (“Three. Two. One.”) then exhales, mirroring the manufactured hush. No head-hop, no register drift; the diction never exceeds a courier-poet’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty (“The dust…clung…a second skin of grit and compromise” simultaneously sets scene and character). Metaphors are coherent and necessary; no mixed vehicles, no paraphrase loops. One clause of overwriting—“impossible silver lightning” could be sharper—but it occurs pre-climax and does not touch the final image, so the 9-band gate remains viable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “thunderstorm in a bottle as EMP-negative” is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the story commits fully to the logic of absence-as-corridor, a conceptual risk that pays off. The near-future ghost-upload premise is familiar, but the negative-space tactics and the moral calculus (no physical crossing, only data) reconfigure genre expectations. Transformation is present; remove the bottle or the arcade and the plot collapses.</comment>
