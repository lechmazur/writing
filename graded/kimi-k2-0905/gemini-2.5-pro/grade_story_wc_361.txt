<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s tremor and longing for routine are concrete; the pendant’s hum and crystalline bloom externalize his shift from courier to witness. Elara’s memory is vivid but passive—no contradictory impulse in her ghost. The final beat of “light steps” renounces the old jittery identity, earned by the aurora garden’s cost. Interiority avoids label-speak and stays embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene causality: because the pendant vibrates, therefore time stretches, therefore Kael sees Elara and the garden, therefore he renounces courier anxiety. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystalline plants remain, reconfiguring his stance with visible cost. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Aurora rule-change is cued early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ridgeway shale, breath-plume, aurora river—selective, cold, tactile. The pendant itself becomes micro-setting when its vibration alters time and space. Crystalline garden is the final environmental charge that crystallizes choice. Weather and altitude remain consistent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: deliver relic safely → witness wonder. One tightening: pendant activation traps him inside the aurora moment, foreclosing escape to routine. Cost: the garden of light stays behind, an irreversible proof he can’t unknow. Escalation is situational-pressure, not antagonistic, sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete arc: routine vs. wonder. Pendant’s ability literalizes Elara’s creed “path is purpose.” Final image reweights cargo from relic to revelation without moralizing. Subtext in “chapped knuckles” vs. “light steps” carries the cost of transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s cold-nerve perception: “shale shifted under worn boots,” “breath plumed.” Rhythm accelerates with pendant hum, then slows for crystalline growth. No head-hopping; Elara’s ghost is filtered through his awe. Syntax mirrors bodily tension—short clauses under aurora flare, longer ones as garden unfolds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs: “plumed,” “shimmered,” “germinate.” No filter stacks; metaphors stay physical (“river of light”). One scaffold risk: “the sound unnervingly loud in the vast silence” could trim to “the sound cracked the vast silence,” but it’s minor. Final sentence cadence lands cleanly. Zero paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: aurora + time-stretch relic + mentor memory garden. Relic courier is a novel occupation; pendant mechanic isn’t generic telepathy. Concept commits fully—no retreat to “it was all a dream.” Risk taken in lyric stillness pays off in crystalline image rather than action set-piece.</comment>
