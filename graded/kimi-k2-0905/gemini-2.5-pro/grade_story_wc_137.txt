<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—rational disdain versus tender obligation—grounds every beat; the micro-choice to keep the tile rather than hurl it is the pivot where skepticism cracks under love’s cost. Emotion is embodied (wind-bitten hands, trembling charcoal) rather than labeled. The only soft spot is the late label “courageously kind,” which briefly abstracts a trait already shown through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the unheard symphony re-weights the premise, making whale-song and star-memory interchangeable. Causal chain holds—grandmother’s notes → storm-sharpened whale pattern → tile transcription → vision—each step narrows Elias’s options. Cost is palpable in the final sentence: “enduring rhythm of a love that spanned more than one lifetime,” a Charged Poise that forecloses his former rationalist stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tower’s salt-laced wind, unglazed archways, and storm-slapped stone floor act as tactile antagonists, forcing Elias to brace, squint, and finally kneel to etch. The whales’ sonic architecture replaces visual astronomy, turning acoustics into geography. The tile itself evolves from inert black square to ledger of cosmic echo, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor grandmother vs. protect empirical self—tightens when the whale sequence during the squall offers a single irreversible path: transcribe or betray her. One meaningful deepening suffices; the storm’s acoustics crystallize the pattern, forcing agency. Cost is the permanent loss of his prior epistemic safety, legible in the silence that follows the final etch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not private but oceanic, a shared waveform between species and generations. The final image of “distant whale songs” re-prices every earlier star-chart as merely one frequency in a larger chord. No moral is declared; the reader is left inside the same vibration Elias now feels.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s sensory filter; diction tilts from skeptical Latinate (“bedrock facts”) to lyric maritime (“lung of a whale”) as his stance dissolves. Rhythm mirrors wind gusts and whale cadences. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on narrative texture, which remains character-specific and un-contaminated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary from staccato bursts under storm pressure to long tidal clauses during revelation; zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“skeletal remains of the stargazer’s open tower” marries architecture to corpse without purple drift. Final line offers a rhythmic echo of the opening, closing the acoustic circuit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The whale-call/celestial-navigation synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable; the magic square functions as astrolabe and sheet-music simultaneously. Risk is taken in merging hard-science acoustics with visionary memory, yet causality never breaks. Slight dip because the “unheard symphony” phrase verges on prompt-echo, though it is salvaged by sensory grounding.</comment>
