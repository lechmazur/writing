<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “perfect, crystalline prison of grief” is embodied, not labeled—but her final pivot from frozen heart to thawed hope leans on a compressed, slightly epiphanic beat rather than a fully dramatized micro-choice; the bookmark triggers memory but does not force a visible tactical shift under pressure, so the renunciation cost is felt more as lyric echo than causal stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: abandoning the sphere and catching sunlight on the bookmark reweights the premise (Earned Stasis with felt cost). Causal chain is tight—thaw destabilizes station → forces flight → collapse of art → bookmark as lever of thawed heart—though the “melting world” pressure is external rather than tactic-shaping; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with a single decisive intensification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The control room’s metallic tomb and dripping pipe constrain every move; furnace placement, tilting floor, and red warning light supply immediate tactical limits. Micro-setting (bookmark in palm vs. sun on skin) recharges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (sound of drip, scent of wet earth) tracks Elara’s glassblower attention to texture, charging closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish one lens vs. survive collapse—tightens once when STRUCTURAL FAILURE light flicks; abandonment forecloses art path with visible cost (sphere melts). Thaw as external pressure complicates but does not escalate through protagonist agency; price is legible but not persistent—no constraint shapes later steps once she flees.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art as fragile refuge vs. life as messier thaw. Bookmark’s migration from tomb to pocket reweights love from “destroyed her” to “carry forward,” a resonant reconfiguration. Final image of “quiet, steady trickle” answers the frozen-heart concept non-literally, avoiding moralizing; ambiguity between grief and renewal stays charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice carries glassblower precision—molten silica, starlight, crucible—yet modulates from theatrical boom to tremor under threat. Syntax mirrors pressure: lush clauses collapse into clipped “And with a final bow.” Perceptual signature (noticing rust showers, pipe drip as metronome) stays consistent; no head-hop, no filter clutter; dramatic narration device is taught early and paid off in choked exit line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene heat—long sentences for furnace ritual, fragments as floor tilts. Metaphors stay physical (crystalline prison, fiery belly) without overwriting; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “steady drip… melancholic beat” repeats conceptually but serves cadence. Information density high; each line advances state or temperature. Closure sentence clean, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glassblower in dead ice-control room is fresh mash-up; thawing-heart metaphor literalized through climate and chest is non-obvious. Risk—abandoning art mid-creation—carries real cost. Bookmark as memory relic avoids twee symbolism by staying tactile (cracked leather, map-lines). Could swap names without breaking arc, but sensory specifics and occupational lens give enough singularity.</comment>
