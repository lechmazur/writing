<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (cold sweat, shrinking entrance) and drives the mid-story paralysis that forces the phase-shift choice; the filial duty motive is concrete via the gold fleck and Grandma shimmer, giving the final insertion credible emotional cost. Interior contradiction is present—fear vs loyalty—but the “unremembered” refrain edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blurring the beat where motive tips into irreversible action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the gold fleck’s return collapses the ghost static, leaving “true, clean emptiness” whose felt cost is the irreversible loss of the lingering voices. Causal lens holds: phase-transition escape → console activation → spectral release, each step because/therefore linked; no orientation debt; the collapsing ceiling is foreshadowed by dripping seams, so the solution is earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wet-concrete tomb, fossil-cable snakes, and luminous chronometer are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain movement and time; the gold fleck micro-setting charges the final image when it clicks into the star-shaped slot. Spatial choreography is clean—Elias’s body tracks through the jagged mouth, floods, and hub without drift; environment actively tightens options as tide and rock close.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grant Grandma’s fragment peace—tightens once: the blocked collapse forces either retreat (fail duty) or phase-shift (risk obliteration). The visible price is the permanent loss of the voices; agency drives escalation under causal lens; coincidence is absent. One deepening is sufficient for length, but the external clock (tide) is more ornamental than tactical, keeping score just below high-band edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme of post-mortem memory emerges from the concrete return of the gold fleft and the extinguished shimmers, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing the fleck home is silence, not speech. Final image of “only the hush” reweights earlier “crashing hush” without preaching; slight reserve because the “unremembered” refrain verges on thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—salt taste, ozone after the phase jump, chronometer’s green dial—remains character-specific and biased toward tech-tactile detail. Rhythm compresses under stress (“drip-drip-drip” / “He could not squeeze through”) then elongates for the spectral release; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon except “codex margin illuminant” which reads slightly curator-expository.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense without scaffold: “concrete wound,” “fossilized leviathans,” “probability wave” each carry double duty. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no loops or synonym churn. Final clause “only the hush” is a deliberate cadence shift that recharges motif; minor −0.1 for two successive participle openers mid-paragraph that could imply simultaneity, but clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: claustrophobic medium hacks a drowned undersea server to free trapped ghost-data with a medieval gold flake—specific, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Risk of phase-transition teleport accepted because pattern is taught early via childhood memory and paid off at the collapse. Could edge higher if the tide-clock constraint had shaped tactics rather than merely timing exit.</comment>
