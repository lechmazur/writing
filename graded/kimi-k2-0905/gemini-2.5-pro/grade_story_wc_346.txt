<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s bruised awe and renunciation are palpable, but interiority dips into abstract self-diagnosis (“breathtaking, impossible arrogance”) rather than embodied contradiction. The puppet’s cracked eye and the mother-fragment anchor him, yet we never see a micro-choice that risks anything in the present—only translation and surrender. Still, the endurance costs his life-essence, satisfying Earned Stasis under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby re-stitches history and dissolves the crystal pane, costing Elias his last breath. Causality holds on the Accumulative/Textural track—each filament of light is a beat of density, not cause-and-effect reversal. Orientation is immediate; only the “pane of hush” physics is taught, never explained, and pays off in the white silence.</comment>

<comment>The lighthouse lens functions as both environment and tool, constraining the only possible action—light-embroidery—while dusk star-loss externalizes Elias’s internal fading. Micro-setting inside the lantern room keeps bodies and objects spatially coherent; the crystal’s hum and dusting into motes evolve with the plot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: the hush is felt between atoms, not heard. The missing star-field is never described generically; its absence is the final atmospheric cost.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes are singular—grant an un-knowable peace before white silence arrives—and tighten through density, not reversal. Each nested pattern is a measurable loss of Elias’s stamina; the filament-drain is the visible price. No live option is foreclosed for him except living, but that is enough under the Accumulative lens. The escalation is steady, lyrical, and proportioned to 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the counter-intuitive generosity of ending-time: kindness woven backward becomes the only immortality. Subtext resides in the cracked puppet eye—beauty in fracture, not repair. No moral is stated; the final image of dust and held wood reweights the premise that doom must be ugly. The lullaby’s billionfold echo avoids sentimentality because it is paid for with Elias’s extinction.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Elias; perceptual signature is archaic-scientific (“space between atoms,” “filigrees of luminescence”) yet lullaby-tender. Syntax lengthens during pattern-weaving, then fractures into short sighs—rhythmic mirroring of energy drain. No dialogue, so voice convergence is N/A. Filter verbs are intentional (“he began to translate”) and signal the shift from flesh to light.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is densely figurative but pattern-taught early (“pane of hush,” “filigree”) and paid off. No mixed metaphors; light-surgery sustains medical precision. One scaffold pair—“He was not a herald… but a purveyor”—is earned thesis, not loop. Final sentence cadence slows to three breaths, mirroring death-momentum; no artifacts touch the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The doomsday-clock trope is inverted: no ticking, no reversal, only witness-Grace. The puppet head’s cracked eye re-weights beauty as flaw, not nostalgia. Nested pattern-translation as mercy is fresh; no genre template supplies this mechanics. Risk is quiet—lyric dissolution rather than bang—but coherence never wavers.</comment>
