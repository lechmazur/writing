<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—public colorist vs. private nocturnal seeker—remains embodied and active, driving every return to the cathedral; the final recognition of inherited identity is earned by the layered glass ritual, not stated. Micro-choices (night visits, filter angles) externalize her hierarchy of values; cost is the solitary labor and the surrender of daylight certainties. No stock therapeutic labels; the “umbral tenderness” is shown through tactile glass work. The only minor slack: no secondary pressure from another on-page character, but the single-POV crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each glass layer adds density and reweights the central stake—night-blooming as strength, not secrecy. Closure is a CR: the portrait reframes the entire quest as ancestral summons, undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; causality intact—each filter revelation is because/therefore linked to her escalating obsession. One clean transition (pavilion → cathedral) taught by postcard cue; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The cathedral window functions as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move—angle, filter, pane depth decide what can be seen. Amber pavilion recurs as charged memory, reconfigured in the final silver image, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory economy is exact: violet light dissects dust, white light makes the portrait bloom—visual hierarchy mirrors thematic shift. Spatial choreography flawless: body, lantern, glass, eaves drip all tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens with each melting drip. One decisive deepening: the etched portrait forecloses the option that the quest is random; the price is the solitude of nocturnal vigil and the irreversible ancestral burden she now carries. Agency is observational but active—every filter choice is a renunciation of daylight answers. Cost is legible in the final image: she walks toward murals that will broadcast this dark lineage, surrendering the privacy she cherished.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: night-blooming as reclamation of ignored strength, not shy retreat. Subtext carried in silence—nocturnal visits, lantern angles—never sermonized. Final image reframes “dark” from absence to fertile source; resonance is imagistic, not moral. No thematic echo lines; the grandmother’s postcard phrase is object, not thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly—light temperature, pane opacity, pigment memory—never generic. Syntax lengthens under contemplative beats, fragments under discoveries (“a second layer emerged”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Register stays within Elara’s artist lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer time, color, ancestry (“autumn pavilion now connected to the silvery revelation”). No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are painter-precise—“petals like captured moonlight”—and internally consistent. Rhythm breathes with discovery, accelerates toward final portrait reveal; opening and closing lines bookend with color/light motif.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses botany, glass-craft, and ancestral memory in a configuration not overtly templated. Risk: quiet accumulative structure rather than dramatic confrontation; success lies in making etched glass a cosmic root system—fresh symbolic mechanics. Transformation test passed—swap muralist medium or flower species and the emotional calculus collapses. Specificity of violet/blue/white filter sequence teaches reader how to see, rewarding risk.</comment>
