<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Xylos’ ennui-to-purpose arc is vivid: “his boredom had calcified into something… stronger than memory or pain” shows interior contradiction under pressure. The amulet as leash is handled twice—stasis bubble then embraced—so the object alters his stance. Final step across the rift is earned; cost is the erasure of immortality itself. Voice drift into cosmic grandiosity in last paragraph keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: solar storm → magnetic manipulation → spatial mutiny → amulet silence → rift. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: “a hole in the concept of ‘somewhere’” reweights existence. Orientation is taught by word 60 (“prismatic escondite pocketed away in the folds of reality”). No causal breaks; only micro-slip is one adverb cluster (“slow, deliberate step”) that slightly dulls final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting: its crystalline walls refract storm-light into “agitated ghosts,” actively mirroring Xylos’ inner storm. The sanctuary’s dimensional fold constrains access and supplies the only place he can perform the mutiny. Spatial choreography is clean—body, shard, rift track logically. Sensory hierarchy biased to visual, but narrowed perception fits immortal ennui; still, earns 9-band gate by charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the rift becomes the sole option. Escalation is causal: each magnetic twist narrows possibility until the rift negates “somewhere.” Felt price is the amulet’s silence and the not-knowing thrill; cost is legible. Slight deduction because the storm-clock (solar tantrum) is more ambience than ticking constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: immortality as curse, curiosity as redemption. Motif of “goodbye” reweights from abstract wish to literal void without moralizing. Final image—“a hole in the concept of ‘somewhere’” —offers resonant, non-literal answer. Almost no abstract exposition; only micro-slip is “celestial flowers” cliché in open, forgiven by closure power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: long Latinate cadences mirror immortal mindset; compression in storm sentences accelerates tension. Perceptual signature acute—“star-crushing boredom,” “spatial mutiny”—avoids generic cosmic diction. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Filter verbs minimal; one register drift (“architect of his ennui”) barely dings.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: rolling anaphora under star-storm, then clipped final step. High density—“cosmic vandalism,” “negation of somewhere”—do double duty. One metaphor mix: “star-crushing boredom” is physical but works. No loops, no scaffold; only micro-flaw is three adjectives in “prismatic, shimmering, agitated ghosts” that could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: immortal ennui + solar storm as forge + spatial mutiny as suicide method. Cursed amulet repurposed from cliché to self-owned key. Risk of conceptual void pays off—reader feels the before/after of existence rules. Not derivative; could not swap names without gutting concept.</comment>
