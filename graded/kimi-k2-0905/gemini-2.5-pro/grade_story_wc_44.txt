<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is precise—‘obsessive precision’ is dramatized in the ring-clicking micro-moves. Motivation remains singular and intensifies: the phantom of the noon-shadow keeps tightening until the final click. No contradictory emotional layer is shown; she is all calm resolve, so the arc is linear rather than conflicted inside her skin. Still, the price is visible: she accepts the automaton’s dark projection as the new local law, a quiet renunciation of older certainties.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: bent-spoon reality → broken lexicon → re-learning inversion → topological key push → shadow-turn reveal. Each beat narrows her toolkit and raises epistemic cost; the final image literally projects the cost on the wall. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the universe’s grammar is now inside-out and she must write in it. No orientation debt; ‘star-dusted velvet’ situates time/space by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory rock, brass automaton, and key-rings function as micro-setting triad that every tactical decision rubs against. Light vs. folded-darkness is not backdrop but apparatus that enables the final projection; environment dictates method. Sensory economy obeys POV bias—only optic and tactile details that bear on rune topology survive. This is textbook “tool-as-setting” that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—where shadows go—stays foregrounded; each micro-beat tests her lexicon against that void. Escalation is epistemic: every failed old sigil tightens the noose until only the inversion knot remains. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—her world-model permanently pinched into a Möbius strip—so pressure feels abstract next to life-and-death stakes, keeping it just under the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of epistemic humility: to see the world truly you must let its grammar invert your own. The spoon-bending is never moralized; it simply re-prices what counts as knowledge. Final image of “tangible darkness” offers a non-literal answer—shadow is not absence but topology—leaving residual ambiguity that invites re-reads. No thematic echo; insight is delivered by the projected diagram, not narrator commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction is scholarly-lyric (“star-dusted velvet,” “topological knot”) yet remains within a rune-scholar’s lexicon. Rhythm tightens into staccato clauses during key-manipulation, mirroring her deliberate hand. No head-hop or filter-verb bloat; even the automaton’s perception is inferred through her hypothesis. Voice distinction is not tested (no dialogue), but internal signature is vivid and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence either advances causal chain or delivers sensory detail that feeds the next move. Metaphors are controlled—two extended images (velvet void, sugar dissolution) spaced widely enough to avoid clutter. High information density: “rune for inversion...no longer meant upside-down but inside-out” simultaneously world-builds, foreshadows method, and escalates stakes. No mixed registers or artifact cadences; final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing runic linguistics with topological shadow physics feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Automaton-as-perceptual-instrument rather than walking trope flips steampunk expectation. The spoon-bending reality fracture is referenced but never explained, keeping focus on epistemic consequence rather than gimmick. Risk is high—entire plot hinges on a grammatical redefinition—yet coherence is never sacrificed, earning the extra +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
