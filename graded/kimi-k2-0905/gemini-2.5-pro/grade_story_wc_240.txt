<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s spatial gift and grief-physics obsession are concrete and embodied; the micro-choice to aim the resonator crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays character-specific—“phantom weight of her hand”—without therapy-speak. The earned renunciation lands with visible exhaustion, though the backstory block (≈18% of text) is a single dense slab rather than interleaved beats, slightly flattening pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore from sensing imbalance → building device → pressing button → release. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the air reverts to haze but the emotional rule-set is permanently altered—“he had finally let her go”—with cost legible in “profound exhaustion.” Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; one meaningful tightening at the button press that forecloses reunion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent farm is not backdrop: the Fae Caps generate the literal containment field Kael weaponizes, and their glow pulses like a “slow heartbeat,” charging the final image when haze returns. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—ozone, damp earth, then lattice-forces—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is immaculate: distance from workstation to far cavern wall, button in pocket, field sector targeted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates through one decisive tightening: the button press makes permeability irreversible, narrowing options from ‘maybe reunion’ to ‘release only.’ Cost is visible exhaustion and permanent absence of the strangers. No false cliffhangers; coincidence merely enables, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from permeability metaphor: security as compassion, not exclusion. Subtext resides in the smile of release—not reunion—reweighting prior motifs (lattice, field, laser button) toward renunciation. No final-paragraph moralizing; the finch echo offers quiet CR instead of thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is passage death or elsewhere?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“a lattice of forces, a symphony of pressures and vacuums”—maintained throughout; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors spatial mind: long Latinate clauses for lattice perception, then staccato “soft, definitive click” under stress. Diction stays within POV lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Compression taught early (“ghosts of a loss”) pays off in final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: clauses lengthen during contemplation, shorten at button press. High information density—each sentence advances motive, tool, or atmosphere. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“its faint echo finally reached the cavern’s depths”) that recharges earlier birdsong cue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-counseling via mycelial network security engineering. Transformation test fails—core arc could survive with different tech—but specificity of Fae Cap dimensional friction and repurposed office laser pointer keeps it from template drift. Risk in quiet, interior sci-fi pays off without gimmickry. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
