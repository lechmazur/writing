<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’ obsession is vivid, but the story withholds the concrete micro-choices that show how each night’s labour alters his tactical path; we are told “weeks” of work rather than shown a single beat where a new thread forces him to recalibrate. The final gesture—placing the case on the new shelf—reads as gentle catharsis rather than Earned Stasis because no prior scene established that this reunion would exact a visible forfeiture. Interiority is atmospheric, yet the emotional contradiction between caretaker-duty and grave-robber guilt is never let into the present tense to complicate his fingers’ next move.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frayed thread adds density until the celestial map “snaps into focus,” a clean cadence shift that reweights the stake from mystery to reunion. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shelf enshrines both path and postponed future—whose conceptual cost (the lovers’ death) is legible in the final image. The mild orientation debt (time-of-night inferred not stated) is taught early and pays off, so no penalty applies. Causality is intact: the case’s pulse is the only overt coincidence and it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<comment>The silo’s “velveteen gloom,” the tapestry’s “language of knots,” and the lantern’s silver spill are selectively deployed so that every sensory detail either impedes or enables the deciphering action. The cobalt curve and star charts literally guide the final placement of the shelf, so the micro-setting charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Proper-noun economy is flawless: only “Whisperwind Ridge” is named and it is the promised destination. Spatial choreography is invisible but irrelevant—Elias never moves more than an arm’s length—so no deduction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—the wish to overhear intentions instead of ghosts—is signalled in paragraph two and tightens when the silver thread proves the map is real. The price is conceptual (the lovers’ absence) rather than tactical; Elias loses no tool or option, so the cost is felt but not visible on him. Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for this length and lens. Because the tightening does not foreclose a live option for Elias, the score stops just shy of the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: caretaking extends to narratives themselves, and “some roots simply need to be untangled” is an earned summation tied to the gardener’s hands. The tapestry border as private love-letter is a fresh inflection that resists moral binaries. Final image reweights the cobalt silo from crypt to cradle, a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection without sermon. Minor deduction for the abstract conceptual cost rather than a visceral one.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style remains tightly close to Elias: “the air inside was cool and still, thick with…dry earth and old cloth” is perception filtered through his occupational nose. Syntax modulates—long cadences for calm, staccato fragments (“A pulled crimson strand here…”) under surgical focus—without drum-beat repetition. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Psychic distance is clean: we are never told more than his tools and fingers can know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet economical: “cobalt silo under the first stars” fuses colour, architecture, and celestial cue in five words. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and coherent. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves by image (“the cobalt dome…held the stars…with tenderness”) that recharges prior motifs. One tiny register lift—“conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not Elias’s—stops the piece at 8.8 rather than 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The graft of astronomical cartography onto tapestry-cipher feels inevitable yet non-obvious; the lovers’ private star-map hidden in frayed warp is a fresh angle on the “message in textile” trope. Gardener-as-cryptographer is a memorable vocational twist that germinates the closing metaphor. Risk-taking is present but modest—lyric accumulation rather than structural gamble—so no bonus bump. Could edge higher if the case or tapestry had surprised us a second time.</comment>
