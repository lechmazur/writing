<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—scholar vs. failed revolutionary—drives every beat; the shard-touch micro-choice that re-weights the thesis is embodied, costly, and irreversible. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Burnished-sorrow voice risks self-mythologizing but stays anchored to tactile ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s absorbed visions re-price the republic-of-reason war as a quieter war of interpretation; cost is the reopened wound of irrelevance. Causal lens holds: because he covers mirrors, therefore the shard stays exposed; because it drinks the storm, therefore the new evidence exists. Orientation clean by 60 words; single-scene default met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid is not postcard backdrop—mirrored surfaces actively threaten sanity, forcing the mirror-covering ritual that enables the shard’s absorption. Micro-setting (aging fingers on gilded filigree) constrains the moment of discovery. Temporal squall supplies lived-in physics learned through action. Final image of crystal glowing then fading re-uses the object-as-setting to re-anchor dignity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the First Ones’ dignity versus Valerius’s tyrant narrative—tightens when the shard’s visions foreclose the “decadent tyrant” option. Escalation is causal: storm → exposure → absorption → new thesis. Cost is legible: he must re-enter public combat he thought he’d forfeited. One meaningful turn suffices at 740 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—art as dam against oblivion—emerges through the shard’s silent poetry rather than assertion. Final reconfiguration reframes baroque excess from vanity to desperate conservation. Subtext in “burnished sorrow” modulates into determined smile without moralizing. Ambiguity persists: maybe still projection, but now a weaponized one.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“chiseled spires,” “caesura in a line of forgotten verse”) is poet-scholar specific. Rhythm swells and subsides with storm intensity; no head-hopping. Velvet-over-mirror repetition is patterned, taught early, and paid off. Filter verbs serve voice: “he watched moments flicker” keeps reflective distance appropriate to aging observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density peaks during storm yet remains coherent: “waves of pearlescent light” is anchored to physical action. No synonym loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“temporal squall,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by POV’s academic bent and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Combines failed-revolutionary memoir with time-storm archaeology on a baroque asteroid—specific synthesis, not checklist. Temporal squall as visible history is familiar SF trope, but mirror-covering folk-practice and shard-as-poem are fresh inflections. Emotional core—restoring dignity to the dead—grounds novelty in human stakes. Would break if relocated to generic planet.</comment>
