<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—archivist of others’ intimacy yet starved of her own—are dramatized in the single micro-choice of releasing the spiral; the cost is palpable when her “hands felt empty” and she accepts that severance as the price of reconnection. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “a deep, quiet ache” is shown through the ritual of cradling and surrendering the twig knot. The beat progression from clutched secret to public weaving earns her final “gentle, invisible tug” without epiphanic overstatement. Only the faintest hedge—“she suddenly understood”—keeps this from a 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral’s placement reweights her archive of secrets into threads radiating outward, with conceptual cost legible in the image of being “part of one, a shared, public story.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of offerings charges meaning until the cadence shifts under the prismatic light. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is vivid by line 3; no ambiguity. The lens holds, cost is on the page, yet the beat count is thin for a 9+ ladder; one more causal micro-turn mid-scene would have sealed it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The wet marble temple and lotus pond constrain physical access and supply the prismatic light that recharges the final image; spatial choreography is immaculate as Elara “walked forward, her footsteps silent on the wet stone.” Sensory hierarchy obeys her profession—she notices “tiny, clear jewels” of droplets and the “single silver baby shoe” as emotional artifacts. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the spiral functions as portable architecture whose final placement alters the entire lattice. Weather is not backdrop but reflective surface that fractures into the decisive rainbow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she surrender her last private relic?—tightens once when the spiral’s absence is risked against permanent separateness. Agency is the act of weaving it into the lattice; that forecloses hoarding and costs her the safety of detachment. Escalation is accretive rather than causal: each offering she witnesses raises the social pressure until the prismatic light crystallizes the shift. Cost is visible in the final image of belonging, but the tightening beat is single; a second intermediate complication would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of archive-as-prison: the woman who scripts intimacy for strangers must surrender her own relic to feel connection. No moral is stated; the final image of “invisible tug” reweights the premise that secrets must be hoarded. Subtext operates in the spiral’s shift from private talisman to public ligature. The prismatic quiet motif modulates from damp stillness to fractured rainbow, charging the closure without symbolic overkill.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual signature—architect of affections who catalogs others’ tokens yet fears exposure. Diction is precise and writerly (“world spun from damp silk”) without drifting into purple; syntax breathes with sentence-length variation that mirrors her tentative advance. No dialogue appears; omission is apt for a ghostwriter who lives in others’ words. Voice never leaks omniscience; every metaphor is filtered through her profession’s gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, no mixed metaphors. Each sentence advances image or stake—“droplets clung…like tiny, clear jewels” compresses setting, symbolism, and her jeweler-like attention. Rhythm accelerates into the final release without scaffold. One microscopic filter verb cluster (“she felt”) is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Read-aloud ear test passes at literary tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The love-letter ghostwriter who must relinquish her own love-token to rejoin the world is a fresh synthesis of familiar archetypes. Public-art ritual as secular communion transforms the trope of found-object story without gimmickry. Risk lies in the quiet, near-lyric surface sustained for 750 words; the gamble pays off when the prismatic light reconfigures meaning. Specificity of the twig spiral’s “wild architecture” prevents swappability.</comment>
