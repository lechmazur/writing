<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Finn’s “ardent” optimism is shown through immediate, tactile action—tuning the radio to starlight rhythms—so the trait earns its keep. Yet interiority stays surface-level: no contradictory impulse undercuts his grin, so the final beat feels inevitable rather than costly. The hourglass reprise supplies some cost, but it’s externalized; we don’t feel him doubt. Still, his perceptual signature (pattern-seeking deckhand) remains consistent and particular, lifting the portrait above stock.</comment>

<comment>The vanishing is legible as a Causal rupture inside a single scene; each beat therefore tightens Finn’s options until he transmits the chord. Orientation is clean by line 7; no caps triggered. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hourglass restored but Finn stranded between timelines—cost is felt in the final image. One minor softness: the merge mechanism is inferred, not shown to fail or foreclose an alternative, so the Decisive Change is slightly under-registered.</comment>

<comment>Environment is not backdrop but tool: crystalline walls reflect the starlight sequences Finn must match on the radio dial. The ferry wheelhouse shrinks to console, frost patterns, and the hourglass—objects that literally guide his fingers. Sensory economy is strict: no tourist catalog of the grotto, only the data Finn needs to survive. The restored harbor fog at the end is the precise negative space that proves the spectral grotto was real and now gone, recharging the motif.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—"seam between two possibilities"—is declared early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: only Finn awake, only one dial that can weave the chord. Agency is pure: every frequency twist is his decision, no outside rescue. Cost is visible—empty hourglass vibrates, reality shudders—but the price to Finn himself (memory, identity) is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of the 8.8 band. Still, the sequence cleanly narrows options under a causal lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of noticing: patterns are lifelines, not curiosities. No character states this; the insight is encoded in Finn’s radio choreography and the restored sand. Subtext stays tacit—Captain Eva’s papered-over memory is a chilling social cost left for the reader to weigh. The ending avoids moralizing; the transient life sentence is an image, not a thesis, letting complexity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Finn’s salt-stiff jacket lexicon: “chugging engine,” “salt-stiffened jacket,” “stubborn generator.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments when the static swells, longer coils when he decodes geometry—teaching the reader the pattern logic without exposition. No head-hops; Captain Eva’s interior is only surface guesswork. The voice accrues a nautical, lightly superstitious cadence that sells the uncanny as seafarer folklore.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “slide out of reality, like a bead of water skittering off a waxed leaf” compresses transition and sensory analogy in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances choice or texture. Figurative language is sparse but precise—moonlight-walled grotto, spectral starlight—no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested; final “sailor forever caught between shores” lands as a rhythmic, thematic chime without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The parallel-timeline ferry slip feels fresh because it is rendered through deckhand procedure: radio static as sheet music, frost patterns as cipher. Familiar tropes (lost ship, time glitch) are retooled via maritime tool-kit and pattern-language rather than techno-babble. The “permanent transient” sailor fate offers a non-obvious, melancholic repricing of everyday labor. Risk is moderate—lyric elliptical structure—but coherence holds, so novelty earns its place without gimmickry.</comment>
