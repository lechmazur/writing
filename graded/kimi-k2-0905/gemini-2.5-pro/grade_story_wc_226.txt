<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet mastering the canyon’s hush—grounds every micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned because her playful poetics have already bled real fear into Kael. The “innocently mischievous” mask never slips into label-speak; instead it surfaces as tactile behavior (whispered rhymes timed to echo cadence). Cost is visible: Kael’s panic and her own arrested breath foreshadow the closing capture. Only the single-POV default keeps this from 9+ territory—no relational crucible beyond brief Kael spike.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Ossuary’s monolith-truth is publicly devalued by splintered echoes; the canyon’s new rule—“questions never die”—carries undeniable social cost as guards seize her. Accumulative lens declared at line 5 (“woven from silence and fear”) holds: each poem seed layers density until the pattern break (shattered echo) re-weights stakes without causal leap. Orientation complete by 78 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost crystallized in final image: Elara smiles while footsteps “found her,” a Charged Poise that forecloses silence forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone towers aren’t backdrop; their acoustic geometry literally enables her tactic—whisper → multi-angled return—so setting constrains and weaponizes choice. Mist, marrow-paths, and spire act as tools, charging the climax when the Ossuary horn annuls prior hush. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s artist ear: sound first, touch second, visuals last. No geography drift; spatial tracking clean across perch → hollow → precipice. Meets 9+ gate: canyon “instrument” directly shapes final image and tactics; only micro-gap is absence of lived-in props beyond body & echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“truth must fracture or souls remain caged”—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure tightens via each poem seed that risks capture. One meaningful intensification: the horn note collapses theoretical risk into imminent arrest, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: density of forbidden whispers increases until acoustic shatter reweights Absolution’s currency. Cost legible: Kael’s terror and Elara’s solitary last breath show price on-page. Agency drives entire arc; no coincidence rescues her—capture is the earned cost of art.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sonic diversity vs monolithic silence. Subtext carried by acoustic metaphor—echo mutation = ideological pluralism—never sermonized. Final question reprises “price of forgiveness” but reconfigures it from moral axiom to contested currency, fulfilling CR. No tidy moral; canyon will endlessly debate. Image-based resonance (“a universe of contemplation”) lands after concrete acoustic demonstration, satisfying 9+ test. Minor deduction for slightly overt seed/sin pun earlier (−0.2).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at cinematic distance yet filters every detail through Elara’s sound-shaping sensibility; perceptual signature consistent. Syntax warps with pressure—fragments mimic echo decay (“…a soul from death?…”)—teaching pattern early. Diction stays within plausible artist-poet lexicon; no register drift. Dialogue minimal but differentiated: Kael’s rasp vs Elara’s lilt. No head-hop. Rhythm controlled: nursery-rhyme cadence under threat heightens tension without obscuring causality. Meets 9+ hairline: one clause (“cosmic stakes”) momentarily over-asserts meta frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can plant seed, reveal status threat, and foreshadow acoustic payoff (“Sound is a seed… a sin… a need”). No scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors consistent—bone/spire/cage motif clusters around ossification vs growth. Read-aloud rhythm varied; enjambed echoes create musical refrain without template cadence. Copy clean; pronoun “it” always antecedents to spire or hush. No mixed metaphors. Closure line (“her questions would never truly die”) delivers crisp, inevitable cadence that re-energizes opening image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: weaponized acoustics as protest inside a bone cathedral. Not a stock dystopian rebellion—poetry uses physics of place rather than volume. Conceptual risk—quiet voice as revolution—pays off: shattered echo literally devalues state currency of silence. Specific detail (vertebra hollow as classroom) prevents transferability; story dies if setting swapped. Transforms familiar “art vs oppression” trope via sonic science. +0.3 risk bonus for betting entire climax on echo mechanics rather than physical escape.</comment>
