<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to order while yearning to surrender—are embodied in raw knuckles and pocketed leaf; the final micro-choice (saw, not hammer) is earned. Interiority stays concrete, but the “circuitously sincere” trait is asserted more than dramatized in speech. Cost is felt in the ruined trellis and the sigh that releases months of tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the linden leaf reweights the premise, cost is visible in the shift from hammer to saw. Causal chain (storm → snapped trellis → leaf → insight → tool choice) holds; no plot amnesia. One smooth scene, orientation anchored by breath on glass within 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse pane, fogged breath, and moss-slick trellis constrain every move; the heart-shaped leaf charges the final image. Selective sensory triage—smell of damp earth, wind-roar outside—mirrors Elias’s narrowing attention. Micro-setting (leaf in palm) functions as pivot; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve identity vs. allow metamorphosis—tightens when the leaf reveals surrender as survival. Single meaningful turn: pick up saw instead of hammer; option foreclosed, cost legible. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from vegetal surrender vs. human rigidity; final image of “light that remained” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext resides in tool choice and pocketed leaf, not exposition. Ambiguity lingers: what the “network of wires” will be remains open, but the stance shift is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—water droplet, raw knuckles, leaf cool against thumb. Rhythm modulates from long storm sentences to clipped tool choice. No head-hopping; free indirect style clean. “Circuitously sincere” is the only abstract phrase that momentarily lifts out of voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-driven; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer (trellis as beast skeleton) is sparse and purposeful. High information density: breath-fog anchors scene, leaf-pocketing advances plot and metaphor simultaneously. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction appears only in meta phrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Storm-forced horticultural epiphany is familiar, but specificity of linden vine’s heart-shaped survivor leaf and the saw-not-hammer choice freshens the template. Risk is moderate—quiet botanic lens rather than melodrama—but execution is precise. Could transplant to another nursery owner with minor edits, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
