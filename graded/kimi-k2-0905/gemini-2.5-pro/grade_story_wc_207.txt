<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s collector-identity drives every beat: vials in pack, compass as divining rod, refusal to bottle the impossible scent. Interiority is concrete—“petrichor unlike any she had ever known: less of earth and more of starlight and stone.” Psychometry costs her stamina and changes her path; the final renunciation leaves the compass behind with felt, scaled cost. The only slack is absence of contradictory impulse mid-crisis; she glides from curiosity to reverence without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each sensory fragment layers until the lagoon reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks away carrying “the resonant hush within her,” a crystallized re-weighting of her life’s taxonomy. The price is the forfeiture of capture itself, made legible in the final sentence. No causality breaks; the hinge-door and compass stillness are cleanly prepared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment acts as third antagonist: limestone breath guides her turn, lagoon glow forbids bottling. Micro-setting—the brass compass on damp ledge—charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is collector-biased: scent > sight > touch, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; the pivoting wall’s geologic hinge is tactile and plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quest for the inexplicable—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the compass forsakes magnetic north. The psychometry beat narrows options to one hidden wall, paying visible fatigue cost. Final forfeiture of the compass and vial is agency-driven; coincidence never rescues. One meaningful escalation suffices; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: taxonomy vs. reverence. The lagoon’s starlight-scent re-prices her life’s work without a stated moral. Subtext lives in gesture—placing the compass on the ledge is a wordless ceding of control. Final image invites counter-reading: is she enlarged or emptied? Complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person selective stays tight to Elara’s collector-perception; no head-hop. Diction—“petrichor,” “geologic hinge,” “aurora captured”—is within her lexicon. Rhythmic control: long sentences in cavern vastness, clipped fragments during psychometry strain. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy remains. Voice scales with pressure without breaking pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances scent, stone, or stake. Metaphors are coherent—“silence so profound it felt like a physical presence.” Information density high: “vials she knew she would likely never fill” does double duty—object and foreshadowing. Final line is propulsive, recharging “resonant hush” as internalized aurora.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—aroma cartographer following post-industrial scent—is non-obvious. Psychometry-as-hinge reframes standard quest. Compass relinquishment converts trope into sacrament. Specificity: “rusted remains of a climbing pick” keeps lost expedition from mythic abstraction. Risky quiet ending pays off under Accumulative lens.</comment>
