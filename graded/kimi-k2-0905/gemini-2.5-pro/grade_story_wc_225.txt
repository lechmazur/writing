<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is embodied in the tactile manipulation of the sphere; the “simple, defensive move” epiphany is earned because we have watched the labyrinth click through prior beats. Interior contradiction is present—pride vs duty—yet the prince remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is only remembered, not live. The final “truce” is credible renunciation with felt cost. Hairline slip: “forgive oneself” verges on label-speak, but the next sentence grounds it in the chess metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the solved sphere and un-woven hush reweight the premise—absolution is not erasure but the wisdom to play again. Causal lens holds: each thread isolated → labyrinth alignment → spell broken. Cost is legible in the rain breaking over him while he keeps his eyes closed. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fountain stone, petrified townsfolk, and tapestry border function as micro-settings that constrain decoding choices. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: tactile cool metal > visual fray > distant thunder. Spatial choreography is stable; no floating bodies. The tapestry’s fray is not decorative—it is the literal cipher that must be manipulated, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when each decoded thread forecloses the “brilliant countermove” fantasy. One meaningful deepening: recognizing the dismissed defensive move narrows options from perfectionism to acceptance. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the spell. Visible price: the town’s years of silence are lifted, but Elias’s ache remains, felt in the rain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of chess, weaving, and labyrinth: the drive for elegant narratives can kill. Subtext resides in the border fringe—messy, unheroic, yet lifesaving. Final image of “begin the next game” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the town awakens, but the prince is still dead.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—“fidget productively” is idiosyncratic and precise. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: long sentences for rumble of guilt, staccato “click” for breakthrough. No head-hopping; thunder and rain are external correlates, not POV slips. Register remains in character—no academic jargon intrudes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet musical: “frozen a laughing milkmaid mid-step” packs visual, emotional, and symbolic data. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—chess, weaving, storm—without mixed vehicles. One hairline slip: “physical weight” is slightly redundant, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fantasy stasis-village is familiar, but the fusion of chess notation with tapestry cipher feels fresh and specific. The platinum labyrinth evolves from comfort to diagnostic tool to absolution artifact—an organic transformation. Risk is taken in quiet, internal climax rather than spectacle, and it pays off. Could edge higher if the prince’s voice had one line of remembered dialogue to sharpen the personal loss.</comment>
