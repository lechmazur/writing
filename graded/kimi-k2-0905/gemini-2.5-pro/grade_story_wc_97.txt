<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elian’s grief-to-resolve arc is vivid—his body listens to the piano, the reel, the compasses—but the “strategically creative” trait is asserted more than dramatized; we watch him execute a pre-memorized plan rather than invent under duress. The interior contradiction (grief vs. blade-sharp hope) is present yet static until the final step; a mid-scene micro-choice that visibly risks failure would have raised the score. Still, the embodied emotion and the cost of leaving the piano behind carry credible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: flickering compasses → discovery of reel map → sonic brute-force → doorway. The clock’s frozen hands act as a visual promise that time can restart, giving the ending its Decisive Change. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. Cost is felt—he forfeits the arbor and the piano—though the beat where he commits to that loss is compressed into a glance rather than a full beat of hesitation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is rendered through motion—bobbing lightwood, flowering vines brushing the keyboard—so the setting actively constrains posture and sound. The monochrome film strip against twilight clouds provides a sharp sensory contrast that charges the portal’s final white rectangle. Micro-setting (the piano lid as workbench, the pocket compass jittering) keeps geography intimate and tactile. No external reference is wasted; every detail either limits movement or supplies the next beat’s tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and time-boxed: until nightfall the pathways collapse. Each escalation is driven by Elian’s agency—testing the compasses, decoding the reel, translating glitches into chords—so pressure tightens causally rather than through external shocks. The cost (abandoning the arbor) is visible, yet the beat where the option to stay is foregone is only a glance; a sharper moment of temptation would have lifted the score into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “composition as insurrection against fate”; no character utters a thesis line. The broken clock and flickering compasses re-weight from symbols of loss to tools of re-authoring, culminating in the silent-film-white doorway that re-prices time itself. Subtext stays in gesture: the final glance at the clock is the only farewell, letting the image argue that love stories can be re-cut. Complexity is preserved—no guarantee she waits on that shore—so ambiguity feels earned rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet piano-precise: phrases like “silvered sorrow” and “sonic key” extend metaphor but remain rooted in Elian’s perceptual world. Rhythm mirrors musical cadence—crescendo syntax, arpeggio sentence crest—without drowning clarity. No filter-verb clusters; every perception is an action (“let his fingers drift,” “studied the sequence”). Distinctive idiom holds under pressure; even the single abstract noun “longing” is alloyed to “steely,” keeping it specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-loop-free; only tiny echo (“each note a drop…each staccato note”) is forgivable because the repetition is thematic. Metaphors stay coherent within film/music registers; no mixed vehicles. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. The single line where “blade” substitutes for resolve is the closest to register drift, but the metaphor is prepared and paid off. High information density—every clause either advances the portal build or textures the arbor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of silent-film glitch and chordal portal is a genuine synthesis rather than a quirk; the story could not survive swapping the reel for any other MacGuffin. Risk is taken—lyric escalation instead of antagonist confrontation—and the payoff lands. Tropes (lost love, literalized compass) are rotated 90° into fresh compositional logic. The conceptual re-weighting of time via celluloid feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
