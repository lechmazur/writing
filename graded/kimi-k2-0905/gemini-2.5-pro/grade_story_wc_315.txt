<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete—his tremor is soothed by the tactile ritual with the buckle, a bodily contradiction that externalizes his debt. The parachute-buckle beat materializes his value hierarchy (trust > self-preservation) and steadies the hand that turns the crystal dial, so the final choice carries visible muscle-memory cost. Flaws (isolation, near-martyrdom) are not hedged; they are the very filter that makes the warning silent. Voice stays individual: “midnight pattern seeker” is never glossed as job title, it is lived through obsessive star-reading and ozone-tasting breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: static-storm → silence → pattern anomaly → recalibration → silent warning, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Closure is Earned Stasis: Kael elects the quiet defense, foregoing public alarm; the cost is the hollow ache that “settles in his gut like a stone,” a felt weight that forecloses the path of disclosure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and again at the arbor re-establishment; no penalty. No因果 breaks; even the crystal’s fragility is pre-seeded by console description.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arbor’s lattice-branch walls, thin air, and ozone-tasting moss are not backdrop: the thin air justifies the console’s crystal calibration sensitivity, and the lattice supports the magnetic-lens array Kael must retune. Parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture; its cold bite steadies the tremor, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean—console, dial, buckle, screen form one reachable arc. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kael’s profession: radio hum, lens whine, star-vector graphics dominate perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent unnoticed invasion while preserving public trust—is signaled in paragraph 2 (“promises made to those who slept soundly”). Escalation tightens once: anomaly vector shifts inward, forcing a covert recalibration that risks shattering the crystal. Cost is tangible: the stone-in-gut ache and the perpetual silence he must now bear alone. No coincidence; pressure is causal under the lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between vigilance and secrecy; the story refuses to declare which is morally superior. Subtext lives in the buckle: safety device turned secret-keeping talisman, implying every life saved exacts an invisible toll. Final image—world asleep, Kael hollow—invites reflection on the unpriced cost of silent guardians. No moralizing sentence; meaning is charged through object and bodily sensation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual signature: “tasting of ozone and wet soil,” “ghost in the glass,” “hollow ache.” Syntax mirrors his pattern-seeking mind—parallel phrases echo star-arrays, then collapse into short beats under tremor stress. No head-hop; psychic distance narrows to fingertip-level during dial turn. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries all subtext without flattening.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure: longer sensory sentences in calm, then staccato clauses (“Click, pull, check.”) as tremor calms. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and technical data without scaffold. No mixed metaphors; “stone in gut” stays geological, “weight of silence” stays acoustic. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; each image appears once and recedes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—“lone watcher in orbital arbor retunes defense net in secret”—feels fresh against typical space-battle tropes. Parachute buckle as PTSD totem repurposes a mundane object into thematic pivot, avoiding generic hero talisman. Risk is taken: climax is a quiet dial turn, not explosive heroics; coherence holds. Could tip toward over-familiar “burdened guardian” arc, but specificity of moss-lattice arbor and radio-static silence differentiates it.</comment>
