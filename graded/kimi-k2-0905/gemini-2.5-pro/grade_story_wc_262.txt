<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s lonely quest is vivid, but her interiority drifts toward label-speak (“unused love is never lost”) at the exact beat where embodied cost should explode; the earned stasis is legible yet under-felt because her contradictory impulses are told rather than enacted in the final moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the theater itself becomes the vessel, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an accumulative lens; each beat deposits love into the building’s fabric, and the final image crystallizes the pattern. The Orientation Test is met by line 3; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The projection booth, velvet seats, and dust motes are not mere backdrop—they absorb and radiate Arthur’s love, directly charging the final image. Micro-setting triumph: the celluloid strip itself functions as environment that constrains Elara’s psychometry. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias; every detail is filtered through gazer or projectionist urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—where unused love goes—tightens through pattern accumulation: each letter-film beat thickens the texture until the theater’s transformation becomes inevitable. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is legible as the palace ingests the emotion forever. Agency rests in Elara’s decision to listen, renouncing further search; the option to keep hunting is foreclosed with solemn reverence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: love’s residue becomes architecture. The final line reprises “hushed thunder,” reweighting silence as custody rather than absence. No thematic echo penalty—no character utters the thesis aloud. Ambiguity lingers: is the palace a mausoleum or a womb? Complexity holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, filmic, precise: “dust tasted of rust and regret” fuses senses into one strike. Compression taught early (“specific frequency of absence”) licenses later lyric leaps without disorientation. Rhythm modulates from languid incubation to staccato revelation, mirroring Elara’s narrowing attention. Zero head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variation is orchestral; no scaffold or loop detected. Information density high—single lines deliver scent, emotion, and world-rule. Metaphors stay physically coherent; “love seeped into the plush red velvet” keeps vehicle and tenor congruent. Final cadence slows to match solemn reverence, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the ghost-hunter trope: the hunter discovers the house itself is the reliquary. Psychometry via film-strip is fresh; letter-into-light transmutation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot—pays off when the theater’s transubstantiation lands. Specificity of 35mm, klieg light, and velvet cushion anchors novelty.</comment>
