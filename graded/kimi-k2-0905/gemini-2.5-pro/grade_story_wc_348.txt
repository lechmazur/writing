<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s grief and self-reproach stay embodied (knot in chest, raw taste of pollen) and drive every micro-choice; the final shift from “broken chain” to “braided river” is earned through the foam insight. Only flaw: one moment of near-therapy-speak (“divergence wasn’t failure”) slightly over-names the epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: foam observation → polymer analogy → re-pricing of father–daughter bond. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing delivered in the light-touch final image of the cathedral nave; cost is the irrevocable acceptance of separate channels. No orientation or continuity stumbles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ravine, milkweed stalk, chrysalis, and granite slab are all tactile, POV-filtered, and physically interacted with; the braided channels literally constrain where Aris can walk and think. Final image of canyon-as-cathedral is charged by the prior “Lena’s cathedral” cue, re-weighting the setting from tomb to nave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—tightens once via the foam insight that forecloses the old “fix-her” path. Cost is legible: he abandons the fantasy of reunion and embraces permanent divergence. A second reversal or external antagonist would over-crank this scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: chrysalis husk → empty form; braided channels → parallel lives; foam → impermanent linkage. No abstract sermon; the reader finishes re-weighting “divergence as beauty” without a spelled moral. Image of loosened knot offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Aris’s polymer lens: “enzymatic breakdown,” “monomers of air and water.” Syntax lengthens and softens as grief loosens; no filter-verb clusters or register drift. Voice is distinct, internally coherent, and modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong sentence variety, no loops or scaffold; metaphors stay within physical logic of foam and polymer science. One minor purple patch (“symphonically minded”) is justified by character vernacular. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the river’s pulse; final paragraph lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Father–daughter rift is familiar territory, but the polymer/foam conceit and the inversion of chrysalis from absence to promise feel fresh. Synthesis of scientific and lyric perception is specific to this voice; risk is moderate, coherence high. Could edge higher with a sharper external obstacle.</comment>
