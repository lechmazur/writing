<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s curiosity-driven motive is crisp and consistent, and the embodied ritual of conjecture shows micro-choices under pressure. Missing is any interior contradiction or felt personal cost: the victory is pure epiphany, not a renunciation that hurts. Interiority stays concrete—“hummed a buoyant, three-note tune,” “cool to the touch”—but never turns against itself. Earned, but not yet haunted; the recollectionist remains a charming profession more than a flawed person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the shard becomes the traveler, reweighting “missing” into “chosen union” with visible cosmic cost (obsidian = meteor). Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each seed-sprout beat thickens the pattern until pattern-break = reveal. The -0.4 hesitation owes to a mild soft-reset: lines like “cheerful certainty” dissipate rather than pay the emotional price of knowing the traveler died. Still, the final image reconfigures stakes satisfyingly on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The iridescent geode is not postcard décor; its refractive walls literally perform the emotional transliteration that solves the mystery. Micro-setting triumph: the flat-topped amethyst cluster is the workbench where conjecture occurs, crystalline vines grow and visibly fail, and final fusion happens. Spatial choreography stays crisp—seeds in basin, water from stalactite, shard pressed to vine-dead end. One elbow short of 8+ only because environment never puts Kael in bodily jeopardy or resource lack.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“complete before memory fades”—is signaled early and tightened when vine-tips grey and shard warms. Escalation is textural: each color flare intensifies density until pattern-break redefines loss as chosen fusion. Agency stays intellectual rather than visceral; Kael risks no skin, only interpretive error. Cost is conceptual (cosmic union) not personal, capping tension just below 8-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of incompleteness-as-transformation emerges through the shard’s color inversion rather than authorial lecture. Subtext lives in gesture: the obsidian slash is silently reread as meteor, letting reader feel reconfiguration without moral. Final image reframes “disappeared path” as compressed destiny, resisting tidy profundity. Almost 9-level but one beat short of character-level ethical cost to Kael.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, rhythmically buoyant—“cheerful gloom” diction sustained without lapse. Perceptual signature is distinct: Kael sees emotion as color spectra, filters every noun through light. Syntax stays clean, no filter-verb fog; metaphor is internally coherent (geode, vines, transliteration). Minor 0.3 deduction for occasional poet-template cadence (“Then, abruptly…”) but never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances plot, e.g., “glowing turquoise” simultaneously signals memory and foreshadows meteor. Only light scaffold: two adjacent “Then…” openers; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is disciplined, avoids mixed metaphors, density peaks only at climactic flare without clutter. Could trim 2–3 adjectives (“impossibly smooth”) for 9-band, but line craft is solid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “recollectionist” profession and memory-as-crystal botany feel genuinely fresh, not quirky overlay. Synthesis of bird-seed cartography + emotion-transliteration is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric ellipsis instead of death stakes—pays off through conceptual reweighting. A hair under 9 only because premise could tilt sentimental; here it maintains disciplined restraint.</comment>
