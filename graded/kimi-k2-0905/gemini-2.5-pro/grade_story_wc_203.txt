<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s childlike curiosity is concrete and embodied—dust on the rungs, face tilted up, fingers reading brass. The ghost’s calm dissolution charges the final image with visible cost; Leo’s choice to ascend is a micro-choice that re-weights his “weightless burden.” Interior voice stays in his lexicon of mechanisms and angles; no diagnostic jargon. The only minor drag is the late, summary-rich vision flash that tells us the stakes instead of dramatizing them under the rafters.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: power-cut → ghost materializes → dust asymmetry → ladder → brass → release. One continuous scene anchored by ~70 words; no orientation debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s thinning silhouette makes the before/after legible and charges Leo’s quiet life with new, unspoken weight. Cost is visible in the final fist-clench around the barrel and the hush that follows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not postcard décor but a toolbox: the ladder’s screech, the tile’s puff of dry-rot air, the brass catching the headlamp beam all constrain the next move. The circus ticket office is filtered through Leo’s technician gaze—he catalogs hoist cables, not clown kitsch. Spatial choreography is clean: ladder placed, tile pushed, ghost stationary in corner. Environment charges the final image when the rafter’s dark rectangle becomes the source of release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the ghost’s gaze locks upward. One meaningful escalation: the dust pattern turns a casual inspection into a last, irreversible climb. Agency is Leo’s alone; no coincidence rescues. Cost is the chill he accepts and the new, wordless custodianship of the barrel; price is legible in the ghost’s vanishing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the literal crack in a ceiling tile and the metaphorical crack between worlds; no character names the metaphor. The brass cylinder re-weights the concept of repair—from machines to souls—without a moral. Subtext lives in gesture: the ghost’s upward glance is the entire plea. Final image reconfigures meaning: the ceiling now holds a secret Leo carries instead of hides.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Leo’s perceptual signature: “greasy guts of the lift mechanism,” “faint shimmering outlines,” “weightless burden.” Syntax tightens under pressure—“Silence crashed down”—then exhales with longer cadence after the find. No head-hop; ghost remains externality. Diction stays within a technician’s lexicon; no register drift into lyric purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or causation. Metaphors are spare and precise: “memory in the silent air.” Information density high—“county supervisor, true to his word, cut the main power” contains time, authority, and cause in nine words. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: staccato ladder climb, then soft release. Closure sentence is clean, unadorned, letting the brass glint do the work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elevator tech + ghost whisperer is fresh synthesis; the mainspring barrel as soul-key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in making a ghost story quiet; the piece refuses jump-scare tropes and earns its hush. Specificity of the circus ticket office and the clockmaker’s hideout roots the tale in a place, not “any haunted attic.” Transformation test passed: swap barrel for generic locket and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
