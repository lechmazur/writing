<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and contradiction-laden (“furiously tranquil” is enacted, not labeled). The micro-choice to invite rather than pull threads shows values hierarchy with cost. Closure is earned: her stance crystallizes and the lineage chorus is felt, not declared. Minor slip: “texture of borrowed time” is named twice—once as motive, once as payoff—slightly abstract on first mention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vortex’s re-song is legible, cost is the surrender of solitary identity to chorus. Causal chain is tight—acorn cap draws chaos because it is the first pattern—no teleporting props. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: density increases via remembered fragments until cadence flips to quiet thrum. Orientation clean by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains method—brittle surfaces mirror fragility, cleared panes enable final reflection. Micro-setting (acorn cap) functions as tool and seed-bed, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy tight: frost-bite cold, starlight captive, then warm water over stone—each filters through Elara’s gardener perception. Spatial choreography flawless: shards spiral outward, then reverse flow inward with cap as axis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve lineage memory—signaled in opening sentence. One meaningful tightening: chaos accelerates until cap is raised, foreclosing passive observation. Cost visible: she accepts eternal custodianship, loses sole selfhood (chorus humming inside). Agency is invitation, not domination—renunciation of control escalates under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reversal of entropy as love, not conquest. Subtext in gesture: open palm with acorn cap vs. clenched fist. Final reweighting: borrowed time becomes shared timelessness—no moral stated. Slight echo risk: “wild serenity” is named in prompt and text; resonance survives because image of storm-in-drop is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at psychic distance that can dip into synesthetic perception (“scent of ozone from a grandfather’s strange experiment”). Syntax elongates during gathering beat, then shortens to single drop image—rhythmic mirror of inhale/exhale. Diction stays within gardener-caretaker lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Patterned repetition (“threads…threads”) is taught early and pays off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: one sentence = seed-image, ancestral memory, and causal rule. No paraphrase loops; metaphors (snowflake on tongue, storm in drop) are precise and internally consistent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure—no template cadence. Minor hedge “began to” appears twice; not in closure beat so −0.1 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cosmic-egg + pocket-reality is familiar, but inversion—salvation by welcoming entropy—feels fresh. Gardener-entropy trope synthesized through tactile seed ritual rather than technobabble. Risk taken: lyric stillness instead of battle; coherence maintained. Could edge higher if lineage chorus had one sharp, unexpected voice.</comment>
