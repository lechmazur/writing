<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied: the “brittle awakenings” are felt as physical shards, the hum “through his bones.” The micro-choice to place the sundial and surrender to the floor’s images is credible and costly—he risks sanity. The arc from caged solitude to “reservoir” is earned, though the moment of irrevocable cost could be sharper. Flaw: slight emotional summary (“realization settled…”) slightly glides over the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s new weight as “symbol of his singular now” reconfigures isolation into preservation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—images layer until the final cadence shift. Causality holds: hum → floor → surrender → new stance. Cost is felt: he accepts eternal stewardship of ghosts. Minor waiver: orientation anchors arrive ~130 words, but disorientation is functional at closure, so −0.2 not applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “atomically reflective floor” is not scenery; it literally supplies the creatures that force the reconfiguration. The tidal library’s mist-starlight-sea triad is filtered through Kael’s curator gaze, never touristy. Spatial choreography is immaculate: circle → central stone → floor mirrors → creatures. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch (hum in bones) under pressure. The setting’s rule—reflections are benign, not resurrections—charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: convert isolation into survivable independence. Pressure escalates imagistically: each mirrored creature is a tightening of memory’s grip. The decisive turn is the surrender to coexistence—options narrow from escape → endure. Cost is legible: he forfeits the hope of forgetting. Agency is interior yet visible on the page; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete returns: sundial’s shadowlessness = time abolished, floor’s perfect mirror = memory as habitat. Final image answers the implicit question: “What is a contemporary of ghosts?”—a living archive. No moralizing; the reweighting is conceptual and felt. Subtext of stewardship versus erasure is threaded through the handling of extinct reflections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-philosophic yet sensorially grounded: “tasting salt on a primeval wind.” Perceptual signature is curator-poet: nebulae as “codex,” creatures as “silent parade.” Rhythm modulates—long breaths vs. staccato shards—mirroring memory surges. No head-hop; distance stays deep inside Kael. Diction never exceeds his plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense and musical: “a place woven from mist and starlight above a sea of forgotten clouds.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds image or pressure. Figurative control holds—mirrors do not shatter under extended metaphor. Opening and final lines are anchor and echo. One near-purple phrase (“cataclysm of the soul”) but forgiven by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise—“last man tending extinct memories in orbital library”—is fresh yet feels inevitable in hindsight. Six-legged grazers and feathered serpents are specific, not cantina filler. Risk: quiet lyric ending could slide into cliché, but the sundial’s shadowlessness rescues it. Transformation test passes: swap library for generic archive and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
