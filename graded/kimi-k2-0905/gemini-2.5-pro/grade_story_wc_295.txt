<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s generational obsession and tactile ritual with the telegram root every beat; the embodied “cold copper” and trembling hand show contradictory calm/terror under pressure. His micro-choice to dream-witness rather than intervene crystallizes his hierarchy of values—clarity over heroic action—and the final calm is earned by prior causality. No stock interiority; even the “shared cosmic loneliness” is filtered through star-ideograms, not label-speak. The only hairline slip: the grandfather remains off-page, so the family “crucible” is asserted rather than staged, capping Q1 at 8.9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the glyphs re-weight from puzzle to communal lament, cost paid in the physical tremor and the sunrise image that forecloses further decoding. Lyric causal chain holds—telegram → star chart → dream-witness → translation of sorrow—without teleport or amnesia. Orientation anchored by word 34 (“cold copper of the eyepiece”) and spatially tracked across dome, gears, desk. One smooth time-jump (night vigil → dawn) taught by color gradient. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern (density of star pulses → ideogram sentence) is set up early and reconfigured at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory is not backdrop but active crucible: the dome slit literally narrows options to a single star, the refractor’s gears echo the “rhythmic pulsing” that becomes grammar. Micro-setting objects—telegram, eyepiece, brittle box—are handled in every beat; their texture (dust, dried petals, copper chill) constrains the dream transition. Sensory hierarchy skews visual → haptic → olfactory, matching astronomer’s trained gaze. Spatial choreography is flawless: body at telescope, slide of box, fingers on journal track across 360° without drift. Only minus: no sonic detail undercuts the “profound silence” claim, minor at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or surrender to generational failure—signaled in para 1 and tightens when conventional decryption fails, forcing the stellar “last resort.” One meaningful deepening: glyphs shift from historical text to grief-code, foreclosing further academic deciphering and forcing the stance of witness. Cost is conceptual (puzzle-tool becomes funeral-offering) and embodied (tremor, gasp, sunrise resignation). Agency is interior—attention not intervention—yet it reconfigures meaning under Accumulative lens; no coincidence required. Could edge higher if a tangible external loss (time, tenure, family relic) were visibly forfeited, but interior cost is credibly felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative image of pulsing stars = syllables of sorrow; no overt thesis statement. The telegram’s phrase “The sorrow is not yours alone” is reweighted from curse to communal benediction via the star-inscription realization, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: the choice to witness rather than solve is dramatized, never explained. Final sunrise image re-prices prior motifs (daylily bloom, copper eyepiece, stellar pulse) into a single consoling cadence. Hairline deduction for a faint echo of “message in a bottle” trope, insufficiently transformed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays strictly inside Elian’s perceptual signature: astronomical diction (“shimmering motes,” “stellar heartbeat”) colors every noun. Syntax lengthens/contract with breath: long anaphoric clauses for dream descent, clipped fragments at awakening (“He awoke with a gasp”). No head-hop; grandfather’s voice arrives only via artifact. Free indirect style is immaculate: “He hoped that by chronicling...” narrates thought without filter verbs. One micro drift—”ideograms” may exceed Elian’s lexicon, but context teaches it as dream-gift, waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from iambic astronomic cadence to heartbeat monosyllables; paragraph cuts land on image-turns, never redundant. Density high: copper/solace, dust/petals, telegram/curse each do double duty. Zero loops; no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“cold copper...solace” is tactile, not thermal; “ideograms” literal in dream frame. Only hairline artifact: two successive sentences open “He...” mid-dream; pattern taught by stress, so forgiven. Copy clean; no typos, tense drift, or buried lead.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomer-lucid-dreamer meets paleographical grief-encoding—specific, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Star-pulse-as-grammar reverses the usual “stars = destiny” trope into “stars = elegy.” Transformation test passes: replace Elian with generic scholar and the whole lyric edifice collapses. Risky lyric-accumulative structure paid off by sunrise reprise. Minor proximity to Calvino’s cosmic ideograms, but voice and familial stakes render it distinct.</comment>
