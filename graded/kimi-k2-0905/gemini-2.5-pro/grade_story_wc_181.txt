<comment>Kaelen’s curiosity is vivid early, but the interiority never complicates; he never doubts, fears, or chooses—he simply “has to know.” The breakthrough is a pure cognition drop, not an earned renunciation or costly crystallization, so no visible price attaches to his stance shift. Without contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure, the arc is observational rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each poetic graft of orchard imagery thickens the same temporal paradox until the blank cameo reweights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—emptiness reframed as reverse inheritance—legible in the final sentence. Cost is oblique but undeniable: Kaelen’s bewilderment is “polished to a gleam,” a felt erosion of self. The piece meets 9- gate but lacks persistent constraint that shapes tactics, capping high-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Orchard, asteroid, bathroom—three shards, but transitions are legible and pattern taught early (“recurring joke with himself”). Micro-setting rule met: the pistachio shell on the basin charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“droplets like miniature nebulae”) and guides the breakthrough. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—curiosity vs. prohibition—signals early and tightens once when the blank cameo reframes his role from carver to conduit. Escalation is purely conceptual; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Under Accumulative lens, deepening suffices, but without tactic-altering cost the threshold into 8-band is not cleared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the inversion of artistic creation: the future gifts the past. Subtext lives in the mirrored “blank” and “blossoming” motifs; no overt thesis stated. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—legacy as gift or burden—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent perceptual signature: astronomical metaphors, botanical lexicon, recursive time-speak. Syntax flexes with pressure (“frantic, beautiful chaos”). No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he saw the pale, confused face”). Rhythm accelerates into the breakthrough, then settles into grave cadence—effective modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density (“void of potential in a place teeming with impossible realities”). Occasional poetic overwrite (“achingly empty”) but never clouds causality. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Reverse-genetic cameo is a fresh inflection on time-paravel narratives; orchard that blooms starlight and bears nuts simultaneously is memorable image. Conceptual risk—lyric essay tone in speculative frame—pays off without obscuring closure. Transformation test passed: swap shell for locket and asteroid for space station, the emotional reweighting collapses. Specificity anchors abstraction.</comment>
