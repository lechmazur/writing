<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sensor-rich and profession-specific; the “gentle thoroughness” trait is enacted in the chemical baptism scene. Yet the leap from “I must save this photo” to “I must walk to the jetty tonight” is externally authored—no visible cost or contradiction inside her forces the move, so the final choice feels plot-engineered rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: damaged photo → chemical restoration → ancestral revelation → joint epiphany. Closure is a CR-repricing: the jetty blooms, re-weighting a century of enmity; cost is conceptual (a culture built on a lie) and is legible in the final image. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only mild ellipsis links lab to jetty, acceptable under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archive, workshop, and salt-bleached jetty are economically seeded; smells of gallnuts and sea-lavender recur, anchoring theme. The locket-as-micro-setting constrains the final beat, its tarnished surface mirrored by the phosphorescent boards—object and environment charge one another. Sensory triangulation is biased through Elara’s conservator eye; no world-rule violations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake = “truth of the feud.” Pressure tightens once: the restored image flips the origin story from resource war to broken love, foreclosing the inherited enmity. Cost is felt socially rather than personally; the towns’ mythos is devalued in the blooming light. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: decay vs. regeneration (photograph emulsion, sea-lavender, bioluminescent buds). No explicit thesis—meaning stays implicit, re-weighted in the final glow. Complex moral stance: love story is beautiful, yet uncounted dead lived for a mistake—ambiguity lingers. Avoids overt allegory; “covenant” stays concrete in clasped hands and locket.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close to Elara; perceptual signature spot-on—“fingers stained the deep, rich brown of walnut husks.” Syntax breathes with scene tempo, compressing during chemical bath, lengthening at twilight reveal. No head-hop; Tomas kept at observational distance. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within conservator lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “chemical covenant between her craft and the lost memory” marries process + stakes. Figurative layer is rich but patterned—tea-dark bath, bruised evening—each returns with payoff, avoiding purple drift. No scaffold loops; pronouns clean. Minor cadence echo: “the weight of… / the weight of…” in open/close, but it functions as resonant bookend, not monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Familiar “archivist restores past to heal present” frame, yet specificity of walnut-ink chemistry and phosphorescent botany lends local freshness. Love-across-enmity trope is inverted by making the feud’s origin the misreading of a love token. Conceptual repricing of ancestral myth via photochemical process feels inevitable in hindsight—risk is moderate, payoff clean.</comment>
