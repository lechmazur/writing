<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s reticence is embodied in gesture and silence; the crystal-as-memory-talisman externalizes her interior contradiction between faith in language and fear of speaking. The leap from “listen to glass” to “testify tomorrow” is credible because the long vigil has already cost her youth and voice. The final smile lands as earned renunciation: she will trade isolation for witness, pocketing the crystal instead of brandishing it—visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Mira pockets the crystal, ready to speak, reweighting the entire premise that language is dead. The “suspended hush” motif taught early pays off when the library itself seems to inhale at her decision—conceptual cost legible without exposition. Causal chain holds: crystal → discovery → pattern → testimony, no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation anchored by 120-word mark; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dust-choked dawn light and the single crystal shard function as micro-setting; their refraction literally guides her final choice to “press it to the window.” Spatial choreography is tight—footsteps swallowed, east-window dawn tracked across tables. Aldren Library is sketched with three sensory strokes, then left to reverberate as vault of unprinted words—economy that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove language still grows—signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Council summons tomorrow; option to stay silent is foreclosed. Pressure stays situational: external summons plus internal dread of speaking. Cost is conceptual but felt: seventeen silent years crystallize into one public utterance. No coincidence; escalation is knowledge-driven, agency intact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the crystal’s fractured playback: language as living wilderness, not pinned specimen. The final image of “words that had never been printed” reframes prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in “weathered innocence” line lets bittersweet charge do the lecturing. Irony of mute scholar forced to testify is implicit, not underlined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction skews scholarly-ascetic (“sonically reflective,” “conceptual repricing”) yet remains within her lexicon. Rhythm lengthens in reflective paragraphs, then clips into single-sentence beats at decision—intentional modulation. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. Crystal’s “hum” is sensory compression, not anthropomorphism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “gray light seep through dust-choked windows” does three jobs in eight words. Occasional elevated register (“holiness of words”) is justified by scholar-POV. Two near-loops—“seventeen years” repeated—function as mantra, not scaffolding. No mixed metaphors; final crystal-in-pocket image is clean, tactile, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise flips the familiar “death of print” into acoustic archaeology; chandelier-as-recorder is fresh yet believable. Risk is quiet—no dystopian violence—but stakes feel large because testimony could resurrect language itself. Specific detail (child saying “liberry”) keeps concept grounded. Not quite 9 because core beat—scholar learns language lives—verges on expected arc.</comment>
