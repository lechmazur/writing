<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam’s motive is lucid—truth at any social cost—and her micro-choice to pocket the letter is irreversible. Interiority is precise (“emotionally rational”) yet embodied in the trembling petal. The cost is palpable: she forfeits communal comfort. She earns her stance, but we never feel her stomach lurch; the prose keeps her a cool exhibit rather than a torn woman.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: petal falls → Gerald yields → Miriam decides. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she carries the letter away, foreclosing silence, cost felt in Gerald’s haggard silence. Orientation anchored by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Only nit: the Prester-John paragraph momentarily pauses causality for a lecture beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivy-strangled platform and dying rose filter through Miriam’s historian gaze, constraining her to wait and then to act. Sensory triage is tight—visual, kinesthetic, temporal. Micro-setting (fallen petal) literally triggers the transfer of the letter. No object or environmental detail re-enters to recharge the final image, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose saint as fraud—tightens once: petal drop forces the binary (expose or bury). Miriam’s agency drives the turn; Gerald’s charities supply external pressure. Price is legible: orphanages may hemorrhage support. No further escalation beat, so pressure plateaus rather than deepens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “noble lies metastasize.” Final image of Miriam walking toward a “world that would…gain something more valuable” reweights the premise without sermon. Prester-John parallel enriches subtext. Avoids tidy moral; complexity acknowledged yet not deeply probed within scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Miriam; perceptual signature—“historian of fictions”—colors every noticed detail. Syntax remains controlled, lightly Latinate, matching her vocation. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (Gerald’s “You’ll publish this”). No head-hopping or register drift; rhythm breathes with beat shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lines are clean, rhythmic, high-density (“ivy had swallowed the ticket booth…”) with zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. One scaffold echo—“noble lie” stated twice in closing grafs—barely audible. No artifact touches closure; prose propels rather than stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing medieval forgery with a crumbling railway platform feels fresh; parallels to Prester John deepen rather than decorate. Premise transformation: saint hoax becomes lived ethical crucible. Specificity of the illuminated “D” prevents genericness. Risk is moderate; no formal experiment, but concept’s implications fully faced.</comment>
