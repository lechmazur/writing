<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s calm inventiveness is shown, not told, through the sundial adjustment and silent key-work; her interior contradiction between duty and revolt is vivid. The final “Only darkness, sir” line crystallizes earned endurance with visible moral cost. Yet the story keeps her too architecturally perfect—no heartbeat of fear, no tremor in the fingers that might betray flaw under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: blackout → sundial signal → sequential unlock → return before relight; each “therefore” narrows clock and risk. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fort reignites while the reader feels the irreversible social cost—seventeen minds now at large. One minor slack: the 20-minute estimate is declared but never pressed against on-page; tension survives because the relight is shown rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Thousand lanterns, half-painted sundial, bronze quill holder, cliff stairs—each object is handled, not catalogued, and the quill’s hollow reprise at the end recharges meaning. Micro-setting (arrow-slit alcove) constrains the clandestine adjustment. Sensory hierarchy stays tuned to Mira’s skin-level priorities: stone under fingertips, weight of keys, hush when lamps die.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“get seventeen out before the lamps return”—is signaled inside 120 words and tightens with each unlocked cell. One visible price: the emptied quill holder now risks discovery on her next shift. Could edge higher if a single unlocked door had threatened to jam or alert, sharpening the trade-off under the clock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silent intellectual contagion emerges from action (key-turns, diagrams on bread) rather than statement. The half-painted sundial’s “unfinished” metaphor reweights at closure: the fort’s light is restored yet its ideological completeness is permanently broken. Final line offers resonant non-literal answer—darkness and time have already eroded authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perceptual filter: angles of bronze, hush of uncertain guards, pressure of metal against thigh. Syntax tightens with risk—“Cell by cell, she worked…”—then exhales into lyrical final beat. No head-hop; diction stays inside her plausible lexicon. Voice distinctiveness could push higher with one idiosyncratic metaphor or occupational slang, but restraint suits the spy temperament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“keys hung like sleeping secrets”—and never floods high-pressure beats. One tiny loop: “darkness” repeated in first and last sentence; because the reprise is purposeful echo, only a hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Revolution-through-sundial-gears feels fresh; the half-painted dial as cipher device particularizes the premise. Transformation test passes: swap setting or object and the entire escape logic collapses. Risk is present but decorous—could have pushed further with one failed unlock or moral scrape yet chooses immaculate execution.</comment>
