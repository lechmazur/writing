<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—corporate guilt against sentimental obsession—remains concrete, embodied (“egg in her palm,” “songs at 3 a.m.”). Every external move (buying egg, planting speaker, kneeling in salt) directly externalizes that split. The final refusal to seek forgiveness shows earned endurance with cost (“It would never be enough”). Holding the thematic weight alone caps her at 8.6; no other character supplies relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: placing the egg/speaker crystallizes her stance without absolution, cost legible in “tasted like salt.” Causal chain (drought→extinction→guilt→ritual) holds; no gaps. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3. One riskless micro-turn (thunder approaches) is decorative, not structural, so caps shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salt flat and egg-as-micro-setting constrain every move; cracks literally pilot her walk. Sensory hierarchy favors salt, mineral residue, distant thunder—each filtered through Vera’s corporate-enviro guilt. Final salt-tasting raindrop re-codes setting as self-punishment. Constraints meaningfully shape tactics and final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she perform an adequate penance?—tightens once: ritual enacted, option to “pay later” foreclosed. Pressure is situational but coherent; no outside antagonist needed. Cost visible in kneeling, exposed to salt-rain, publicly owning absence. Only single deepening prevents 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fractured grace emerges entirely through salt, egg, speaker—no editorial commentary. Final “grace…cut your hands” reweights prior material without moral. Ambiguity persists: ritual is inadequate yet irreversible. Image-based resonance meets 9+ requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains Vera’s perceptual signature—corporate diction (“controlled resource reallocation”) slamming into lyric grief (“constellations…of a god who stopped paying attention”). Rhythm modulates: long ache-like sentences broken by staccato ritual moment. No head-hop; elisions taught early (“She knew better words…”). Distinct texture under pressure earns 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse, high-yield (“veins drained of blood”). Density high: each sentence layers guilt, setting, mythic echo. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she had learned…she had purchased…”) in reflective block keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Corporate eco-villain performs private sound-installation elegy—fresh synthesis. Dried-river “map” and egg relic convert standard guilt tale into accumulative fable. Final salt-taste twist feels inevitable yet un-gimmicked. Risk heightens meaning without clarity loss; transformation evident.</comment>
