<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“grief carved into every line of his face” seen through her musician’s eye). Her micro-choice to call Daniel before Eduardo asks shows agency and stakes. The decisive kindness trait is dramatized when she sings the room into a cathedral, paying with aching fingers. Minor slack: the father-son rupture is sketched more than felt through her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reunified vinyl shard on the nightstand reweights the whole narrative with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—Maya’s early phone call → Daniel’s arrival → symbolic repair → Eduardo’s “Perfect.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: hymning the mundane intensifies texture until the final image crystallizes. Cost is legible in the aching fingers and the father’s last breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating hospice above the clouds is more than backdrop; its radiant haven light supplies the final image and constrains the goodbye to a single sacred room. Micro-setting of the curtain swaying with mountain air is tethered to breath and song. Object-as-setting: the two vinyl shards evolve from memento to sacrament, charging the closing beat. Spatial choreography stays clean across bedside, doorway, and nightstand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—execute a flawless goodbye—tightens when blood-work shrinks time to “days now, not weeks.” Escalation is textural: each hymn about steam or dust motes accrues sacred weight until silence itself pulses. One meaningful deepening: the second shard’s appearance. Cost is visible in Maya’s raw fingertips and Eduardo’s final exhale. No reversal, but narrowing of options fits Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of love transcending failure emerges through concrete particulars—two broken pieces fitting—never abstract sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: Daniel wordlessly producing the matching shard. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: wholeness is possible only at the edge of loss. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the unsaid decades. “Scent of hope” edges toward explicit but is saved by sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Maya’s musician perception; perceptual signature is consistent—she sees light as sound, silence as music. Syntax flexes with emotional cadence without drumbeat monotony. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she recognized”) they serve voice. Dialogue is sparse but natural; father-son diction distinct—Eduardo’s formal “It was never about the vinyl” versus Daniel’s whispered “Mom gave me this.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical; sentences vary in length and rhythm, never clogging momentum. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, each paid off (vinyl shards = broken hearts). No scaffold or paraphrase loops; information density high. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image. Minor slip: “pulsing stillness” and “radiant haven” verge on lyric overload but stay within POV’s lyric ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—hospice reconciliation—made fresh through music-therapy lens and hymning method. Vinyl shard splice is specific and memorable. Risk taken in quiet, non-dramatic death pays off. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not predictable. Loses top fraction because premise itself isn’t startling, only execution.</comment>
