<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Meren’s refusal to wish and her decision to remember are anchored in concrete, embodied beats; the climactic “blueprint” moment crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays specific—no stock epiphanies—and the cost of solitude is felt. Minor: the “memory vessel” beat repeats summary rather than new contradiction. Still, her endurance earns the restored town without magic shortcuts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the amber bottle re-seeds the town via memory-made-matter, costing Meren her isolation. Causal lens holds: because she refuses false comfort, therefore she must reconstruct the cove beat-by-beat; the bottle’s transformation is earned, not wished. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One micro-drag: the “months of failed alchemy” is told, not shown, but it doesn’t rupture causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is rendered through selective sensory triage—rotting pier posts, torn lanterns, amber light on water—each filtering Meren’s grief. The bottle operates as micro-setting that ultimately constrains the final choice: its sealed nature forces her to internalize the town first. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the square-to-pier moves. One missed beat: no weather or tide shift to pressure the reconstruction moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the cove without wishing—tightens once: the bottle’s glow demands she pay with working-memory overload, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each remembered house adds weight until the amber pulses. Cost is visible in her strained thoughts and the final empty streets. No false coincidence; the depleted Wishing Stone stays spent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory > magic, reconstruction > escape. The lanterns shift from festive to faded to re-lit, reweighting the meaning of “home” without moralizing. Final image of her writing letters crystallizes the cost—she can rebuild walls but must recruit souls. No thesis statements; the bottle’s heartbeat is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Meren’s perceptual signature—alchemical metaphors, measured syntax, quiet grief. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under memory load, mirroring strain. Diction stays within her trained lexicon; no register drift. One lyrical lift: “amber light spread like honey” reads intentional, not purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; each sentence advances memory-construction or setting decay. No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk—“heartbeat” for a bottle—but the image is brief and closure-clear. Filter verbs nearly zero; strong verbs carry motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired “last wish” trope and flips it into anti-wish reconstruction; the memory-vessel-as-seed feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of alchemical meditation training grounds the working-memory feat. Risky quiet ending lands because the empty streets keep cost visible. No derivative echoes; the lanterns’ triple function (light, lineage, legacy) is original to this piece.</comment>
