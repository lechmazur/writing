<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s spatial gift and grief are embodied in concrete micro-choices—mapping distances, pocketing the button, finally setting it down—showing interior contradiction under pressure. The renunciation of the button is earned, visible, and carries felt cost, anchoring the arc. The “familiar strangers” motif risks diagnostic label-speak (“grief had transformed those memories”) but stays tolerably grounded. Minor hedging keeps this just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical density builds through repeated light/barrier imagery until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—button set down, permeability accepted—conceptual cost legible. Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One soft loop: “quiet wildfire” appears twice without new charge; keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mushroom farm is more than postcard: shelves, membranes, pulsing mycelia constrain movement and supply the closing metaphor of permeability. Light as both tool and emotional mirror is woven through action rather than paused description. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions. The laser pointer button serves as micro-setting/object that charges the final image—just shy of 9 because no environmental detail actively forces a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to let go—is signaled early and tightens through each luminous pulse. Escalation is textural: density of light/barrier imagery intensifies until the button’s release reweights cost. No external antagonist needed; pressure remains coherent. Cost is conceptual, felt in the final image; meets 8.8 gate for accumulative designs but lacks persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: permeability as physics of grief, not lecture. The mushroom network’s million-year patience reframes Elena’s loss without moralizing. Final image—“quiet wildfire glow”—offers resonant non-literal answer. One phrase drifts toward thesis (“the physics of letting go”) but is embedded early enough to avoid sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elena’s spatial perception; no head-hop. Diction—“negative space between objects,” “quiet wildfire”—is character-specific and rhythmically controlled. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors consistent with scientific vocation. Voice modulation under grief pressure is subtle but audible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No paraphrase loops; “quiet wildfire” repetition is purposeful motif. One mixed metaphor risk—“wildfire without consuming”—but mycelial light justifies it. Minor scaffold: “she would retrieve it tomorrow, she told herself” is tell-ish; still, propulsion never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing intrusion-detection expertise with fungal bioluminescence and grief-counseling via membrane physics is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyrical structure paid off: accumulative imagery replaces plot reversals. Transformation test fails if Marcus or farm is swapped—specificity is high. Quiet ending avoids sentimentality, achieving charged poise rather than melodrama.</comment>
