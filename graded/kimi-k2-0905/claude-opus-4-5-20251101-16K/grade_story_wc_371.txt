<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven penance vs. need for absolution—manifest in the micro-choice to hand Emil the bread; trembling hands, crumb sharing, and candle-lighting embody earned, embodied stakes. Interiority is concrete (“bread, tea, company, the simple refusal to forget”) and avoids label-speak; her “tenuous” absolution is re-earned each dawn, charging the final image. The bread fragment micro-choice crystallizes her hierarchy of values: memory over safety, witness over erasure. Cost is visible: she risks exposure every time she uncloaks, yet the ritual persists, sealing credible endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory breadcrumb (vanished bakery, 300-yr starter, winter jasmine seed) layers density until the candle-lit bread-sharing crystallizes a Charged Poise—options reweighted, cost felt. Causality is intact: because Vera once stamped disappearances, therefore she preserves relics; because Emil arrives, therefore the loaf is broken and absolution is re-earned. Closure lands on-page: “the tenuous thread of absolution strengthen—never solid… but present,” a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable social cost. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The guerrilla-gardened courtyard constrains Vera’s tactics: climbing roses deter palace guards, hedgerows swallow sound, rosemary masks scent—environment actively shapes risk calculus. The salvaged tea-house room under a collapsed colonnade supplies both refuge and symbolic stage for testimony, charging the final candle image. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance sequence, floorboard lift, bread placement, candle lighting all track without drift. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and urgent; the bread’s “aroma that seemed to belong to another century” fuses mineral water, yeast, and erased time, recharging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Vera’s daily re-earning of absolution—signaled in paragraph 5; pressure tightens when Emil requests the bakery truth, forcing her to uncloak complicity and risk exposure. The bread hand-off is the decisive beat that narrows options: once shared, the relic can’t be hidden again; the candle lighting extends the stake to collective witness. Cost is visible—physical crumbs, emotional tremor, social peril—under the accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves; escalation arises from Vera’s voluntary ritual endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as resistance to creeping normality, absolution as iterative practice rather than state. The sourdough loaf reweights from evidence to Eucharist without thematic statement; final image of planting winter jasmine re-prices the premise—erosion can be reversed seed by seed. Subtext dwells in silence around the bread, in candle flames travelers “might glimpse… if they knew to look.” No moralizing; complexity lingers—some visitors forgive, some don’t, both correct.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature: “she kept a ledger in her mind,” “she found the sacred there too.” Syntax mirrors her patient caretaking—long rhythmic sentences for garden growth, crisp fragments for risk (“Nothing absolves me.”). No head-hopping; Emil’s interior accessed only through observable tremor and whisper. Distinct idiom sustained under pressure; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes (“bread from a bakery that had been erased not just physically but from memory”). Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught (“guerrilla gardening” introduced early, paid off in rosemary and thorns). Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate; no filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence slows to match planting pause, reinforcing closure breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic complicity + guerrilla gardening + sourdough Eucharist feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risk-taking in quiet refusal of grand heroics—small illicit seeds, tea candles, shared crumbs—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; the 300-year starter and palace courtyard are irreplaceable. No trope recycling; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
