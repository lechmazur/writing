<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s pilot-trained gaze and tactile handling of the matrix chip give a concrete, profession-specific interiority; the final relinquishment of the chip shows a micro-choice that costs her certainty and completes the arc. The “perpetually surprised” trait is named but never enacted or embodied, so it stays label-flat. No contradictory impulses are dramatized mid-scene—she moves from puzzlement to recognition without friction—so the beat-level tension stays intellectual, not visceral. Still, the closure is earned by prior causal logic and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9− threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—layered star trails, repeated flower offerings, chip re-uses—then crystallizes into a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira sees the invisible overlay and chooses to leave the key behind. Causality is internal but coherent: each object-repetition deepens pattern recognition until the armillary click re-maps her identity. Time, place, and POV anchor within the first 120 words; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final image—she walks away carrying coordinates that exile her from normal life—so closure lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The crumbling observatory, bronze armillary, and dying light are filtered through a drone-pilot’s spatial eye; every detail is tactile and purpose-driven (metal against palm, sphere’s surprising ease). The setting literally reconfigures to expose hidden stars, so environment constrains and then enables the final discovery. Micro-setting—the matrix chip against bronze—functions as the pivotal tool. One hairline slip: “brilliant dimness” is used twice without tonal modulation, a faint echo rather than a charged reprise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph 7 and tightens when star-trail gaps force a cognitive leap; the armillary click narrows her identity to exile-origin rather than earth-origin. No antagonist is needed; pressure is epistemic and accumulative. The single meaningful turn (sphere re-alignment) is driven by her prior pattern recognition, not luck. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she can never again feel merely human.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—displacement as cosmic ancestry—emerges through star-map specifics and the final re-pricing of “home.” No character verbalizes the thesis; the flowers’ return re-weights earlier offerings as generational relay rather than superstition. Ambiguity lingers: is the pull toward stars salvation or further exile? The emotional aftereffect is migratory ache made literal, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly clipped to Mira’s perceptual gear—grids, alignments, interference zones—creating a distinct pilot-logic idiom. Rhythm accelerates into short declaratives during the sphere shift, then exhales into longer lyrical cadence at the exit, mirroring signal-lock. No dialogue appears; therefore no voice contamination. The occasional elevated phrase (“celestial fire”) is sanctioned by the mythic register the climax demands.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, varied, and double-tasking: “Brilliant dimness suffused everything” simultaneously sets light-level and thematic oxymoron. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each mention of flowers or chip adds new informational layer. Metaphors stay coherent (star-trails as map, frequency as coordinate). A single participle opener—“Reaching up to pull the sphere’s central ring...”—is sequential, not simultaneous, so clarity holds. Closure image is uncluttered and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “alien ancestry via antique print chip” synthesis feels fresh and inevitable once star-trails curve impossible paths; the premise commits fully without late rule cheats. Genre nods (ancient observatory, pilgrim offerings) are subverted into a secular, cumulative epistemology. Risk is taken with quiet, conceptual ending rather than spectacle, and coherence survives. Minor proximity: vague similarity to “cosmic diaspora” trope, but specificity of bronze-hole star alignment rescues it.</comment>
