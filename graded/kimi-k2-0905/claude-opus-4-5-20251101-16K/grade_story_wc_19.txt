<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s claustrophobia versus need for altitude is embodied (breath imagery, “clawed at reinforced doors”) and drives every beat; the doll-as-silence-vessel gives her a concrete, evolving micro-choice sequence. The final recognition that her mother became a silence is credible because the text has let Mira collect absences all along. Cost is felt: the doll lightens, her chest “stretching for the first time,” signalling a path she can’t share with her father. Interior contradiction could be sharper during the climb—one moment of vertigo or second-thought would have nudged this into 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing where the gilded hush reweights Mira’s prior collections; the luminous vine that “seeks connection” externalizes the trade-off, making cost visible. Causal chain holds—daily breath-corrosion enables escape, each silence collected literally masses the doll, the vine sprouts from that mass—tight under Accumulative lens. Orientation is taught by ~100 words; shards (bunker → ascent → apex) are legible with one soft transition signaled by “Above, impossibly far…”. No beat is summarized; every turn appears in image or action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory triangulation—“pressed against her skin like a held breath,” “tasted of honey and forgotten things”—keeps air-pressure motif coherent. Xenial trellis functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: the lattice she grips and the vacuum-edge she tastes constrain how close she can lean. Environmental logic stays consistent (gravity inversion clock, thinning air). One gap: we never feel temperature drop at altitude; a single chill cue would have locked body-setting interaction for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collect gilded hush or lose her only freedom—gets a single decisive tightening at the apex where leaning farther risks permanent drift. Each silence adds weight, raising tactical stakes without extra word-count; the vine sprout converts accrued mass into new possibility, foreclosing return to anonymity. Agency is all hers: corrosion, climb, release, pour. Cost is legible: doll lightens = part of mother released, obligation to “let it climb” born. One more mid-ascent obstacle—say, a trembling rung—would have pushed 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as preservation-through-openness versus preservation-through-burial, never sermonized; the vine image gives the reader a non-literal answer. Silences as tangible commodities literalize grief-storage without allegorical overkill. Mother’s dispersal into “one of the silences” reconfigures Mira’s prior belief of abandonment, reweighting the collection quest. Ambiguity lingers: will planting silences heal or unleash storms? Complexity stays intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance steady, yet diction (“xenial trellis,” “vacuum-silence… delicious to sample”) reflects Mira’s precise, inventor-like taxonomy of absences. Prose rhythm ascends with breath-short sentences in bunker, lengthens into open clauses at trellis apex, matching altitude. No head-hop; father stays external as pressure source. Voice avoids poetic inflation by anchoring metaphors in tactile action (vine wrapping lattice).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Syntax varies from frag-like urgency (“Objects lifted. Dust rose.”) to flowing, vine-like enjambment at apex, supporting momentum. Figurative language is selective (~1 per 4 sentences), never clustering during high-risk beat, preventing muddle. Only micro-loop: “silence made visible, quiet made solid” restates same axis; trim of second half would earn 8.5+. Otherwise no scaffolding, no filter-verb stacking, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Inversion hospitality lattice and collectible silences splice fantasy with fresh emotional physics; nothing in speculative canon directly maps. Core transformation—weighted doll becomes vine—feels inevitable yet un-telegraphed. Father bunker-builder vs daughter seed-planter flips survivalist trope into open-air archive. Risky lyric compression paid off by legible closure. A hair more sensory specificity exclusive to this world (scent of copper vines?) could have tipped 9.0.</comment>
