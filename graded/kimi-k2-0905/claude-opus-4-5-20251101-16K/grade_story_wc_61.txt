<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vael’s obsession with the gear and the spore-dispatch beat give concrete interior contradiction; the final “exhale” enacts visible cost, earning the Earned Stasis closure. Motive remains steady—break the burn cycle—but the story never risks a real-time choice that could fail, so agency feels observational rather than crucible-level. Still, within the lyric-accumulative frame, the sentimentalist trait drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—petal-fall as cadence clock—and lands a Charged Poise: spores released, race still on, grief acknowledged. Orientation is swift; nebula garden and sonar pings anchor who/where by line 4. One soft spot: the causal link between spore release and species uptake is asserted, not tested, so the closure carries conceptual rather than proven cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The brass gear’s shadow-cast graph, the cooling plasma petal, and the bioluminescent spores are not scenery—they meter time, embody pattern, and arm Vael’s tactic; the gear’s reflection on the pulsar light directly charges the final image. Sensory triage is POV-true: Vael notices temperature-density data, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography remains stable across the single continuous transit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will any species skip fire?”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the ping returns “no fire yet,” forcing the spore dispatch. Escalation is accumulative: each ping layers another civilization nearing ignition, narrowing Vael’s window. The cost is conceptual (eternal repetition risk) rather than a concrete forfeiture on this page, capping intensity just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—“light without fire”—emerges through iterative imagery of cooling petals and bioluminescent seeds, never named outright. The final plasma petal reframes prior petals as both beauty and countdown, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity is preserved: the spores may still fail. No moralizing capstone; resonance lingers in the exhale of particulate light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline-solemn, syntax slowed to nebular time—“across the quiet sigh of falling petals”—yet stays readable. Diction stays inside an ageless gardener’s lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. The free-indirect pulse (“Always the patterns”) keeps psychic distance consistent. Under peak pressure (final spore release) rhythm contracts to single-line beats, then widens, mirroring hope and resignation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description plus data ping—achieving high density without scaffold. Metaphors (“fire devours its students”) are controlled, not stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; each mention of petals or gears adds new informational layer. Clause rhythm varies from long nebular spirals to clipped pings, propelling the transit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Merging cosmic gardener, worn gear-tooth abacus, and sonar navigation creates a fresh mythic science-fiction hybrid. The cooling-petal temporal unit feels invented yet inevitable. Risk is taken with lyric repetition, but pattern pays off in the final reprise. Conceptual payload—bioluminescence as civilizational vaccine—reframes standard “watchers” trope.</comment>
