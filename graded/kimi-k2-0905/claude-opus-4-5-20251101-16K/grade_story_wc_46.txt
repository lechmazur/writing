<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—yearning to give light while refusing fire—stays embodied in every tactile micro-choice of polishing and placement; the renunciation of fire carries visible nightly cost as she sets out each cold shard. Her grief is never labeled, only revealed through rhythm of wheel and water and the final image of her “still” vigil. The arc earns its quiet stasis: she forecloses the fire path forever, and the reader feels the weight in the last sentence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each polished fragment adds density until the final blue shard reweights the pattern. Orientation is secured by word 50 with grotto, tide, and solitary watcher; no causality break. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the new shard on the ledge extends the constellation of beacons, crystallizing her lifelong refusal with undeniable forfeit of warmth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto walls, mist, and tidal offerings are filtered through Maren’s gem-cutter eye; every sensory note services the light-memory stakes. The “pearl of stillness” shelf and the crack that admits starlight are micro-settings that literally guide final placement, satisfying 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography stays clean as she walks shore→bench→chamber→ledge. Weather and stone constrain her method—no fire possible—so environment shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens once: the blue piece must be finished tonight to join the others; each successful shard simultaneously proves the method and prolongs her exile from warmth. No reversals needed under accumulative design; the deepening occurs when starlight “falls” and the glass drinks it, converting aesthetic labor into living beacon. Cost is visible: perpetual cold labor, memories pressing “close,” and the implicit lifelong solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: broken refuse transmuted into guidance, light passed forward without consumption. Final sentence reweights all prior shards into an expanding constellation of anonymous rescue, offering non-literal answer to grief’s isolation. No moralizing; the image of ancient starlight touching strangers carries conceptual cost. Subtext of renunciation remains in gesture—she never says “I atone,” she simply keeps polishing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Maren’s perceptual bias: weight, curve, willingness of glass; star-watcher lexicon without academic drift. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for mist, staccato “wheel and water” for work. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on diction and cadence, which stay consistent. Compression (“fire was forbidden to her now. Not by law, but by memory”) teaches the lyric pattern early and pays off in the final quiet.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“mist…patient as grief”) are sparse, deliberate, and coherent. Information density high—each sentence advances stakes, image, or atmosphere. Line breaks and paragraph lengths serve breath control. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold; final image is uncluttered, letting starlight land.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sea-glass lighthouse is fresh synthesis of familiar maritime grief tropes; the fireless light premise reframes ecological and emotional salvage. Specificity of gem-polishing craft grounds invention. Risk—the entire plot is interior labor—pays off because the accumulative structure makes each shard a visible stakes increment. Could not swap glass for shells or metal; curvature and starlight memory are integral.</comment>
