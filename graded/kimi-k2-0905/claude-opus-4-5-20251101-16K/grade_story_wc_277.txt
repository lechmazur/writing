<comment>Viola’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. filial duty—collide in the micro-choice to press the pen groove, a beat that pays off fifteen years of avoidance. The interiority is concrete (“something like solemn playfulness in her voice”) and her flaw of obsessive sky-watching actually disables her until the object re-weights the stake. Cost is felt: she trades the safety of “orbits of regret” for the mortal risk of publishing. Only nit: the adverb “devotedly observant” is author-label; it works because she instantly proves it, but still a hair short of full dramatization.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds from the 3:47 a.m. call → pen press → decisive phone call to Marcus; each beat tightens because/therefore links. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the same sky she used to hide in now frames her announcement—“I think it’s time we published it”—with undeniable social cost. The scroll’s appearance is seeded by the nib groove, satisfying the persistent-constraint test. No orientation debt, no telegraphing; the final image crystallizes options under the dome she once used as refuge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The observatory is not backdrop; its dome echo and cloud-sea literally externalize her isolation and later amplify her declaration. Micro-setting of the pen-as-planetarium (groove = hidden orbit) constrains the single decisive gesture. Sensory hierarchy is biased to the astronomical—starlight on wood, sharp stars—mirroring her narrowing perception under pressure. Weather isn’t mentioned, but the altitude’s thin-air stakes feel implicit in every echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—tightens once: proof by contradiction collapses her safe “natural death” stance, forcing publication. The cost is visible: from private stargazer to public target in one phone call. No antagonist on page, but the off-stage network’s lethal reach is made legible by the forged nib and vanished coroner. Escalation is causal and sufficient for 750-word frame; no mechanical reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the orbital metaphor: some orbits decay, some escape—her fifteen-year ellipse ends in retro-fire. Subtext lives in the nib: editorial ink literally hidden inside the instrument of sky-charting, fusing her two inheritances. The final image reweights the stars from refuge to witness, achieving Conceptual Repricing without sermon. Ambiguity remains: we feel both liberation and incoming assassin orbit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect texture carries an astronomer’s diction—“celestial bodies,” “second sky”—yet stays terse under pressure. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on perceptual signature: starlight as forensic tool, timestamps as orbital elements. Rhythm accelerates across the final paragraph without syntactic monotony. The solemn-playful tonal alloy lands in the last clause, fully earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “rosewood separated along an invisible seam” performs plot, object history, and emotional shock in one clause. No filter-verb clusters, no mixed metaphors; “orbits of regret” is singular and maintained. Paragraph cuts are surgical; removing any line breaks the reveal chain. Only micro-loop: “devotedly observant” appears twice—minor, non-closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Trope inversion—amateur astronomer inherits murder evidence via celestial metaphor—is fresh, not gimmick. Pen-as-micro-planetarium feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Risk of proof-by-narrative in flash fiction is embraced and paid off. Specificity (newsprint empire, coroner's timestamps) grounds the concept; remove the astronomical lens and the story collapses.</comment>
