<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interior contradiction—needing to “collect” others’ hopes to justify her own art—drives every beat; the shell’s evolving grip and the final notebook opening are embodied micro-choices that cost her the illusion of arrival. The young-self cameo supplies a clean before/after hinge, making the renunciation legible. What keeps it sub-9 is that the wartime nurse and other cameos register as external exhibits rather than relationship crucibles that force new tactics; pressure is largely atmospheric, not interpersonal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second sentence and held: each apparition adds density to the hope-collection pattern until the younger self reprises the shell image, reweighting the premise (“the searching was everything”) with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate, the single transition out of the nexus is legible, and the closure beat crystallizes options without explanatory filler. One hairline slip: the “she too dissolved” beat is fractionally less charged than the shell-fracture that follows, but the cost is still felt on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mist-bound nexus functions as micro-setting whose one-way current physically opposes Eleanor’s逆行, turning atmosphere into tactical constraint. Visceral anchors—shell warmth, fracturing calcite—track cleanly across beats and charge the final image. Sensory economy is tight (no tourist catalog), though the spatial edges of the crossroads remain deliberately liminal; this serves the concept but caps entry to the 9-band where environment must foreclose an option outright.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Eleanor rekindle purpose by scavenging hope-shapes?—is signaled early and tightens when her younger self confronts her; that micro-turn forces the notebook choice. Pressure is accumulative: each cameo adds ontological drag rather than escalating danger, fitting the lyric/accumulative mode. Cost is visible in the new fracture line, though the price feels conceptual more than visceral, keeping it just shy of the 8.5+ band where bodily or social forfeiture is sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: incompleteness as lifeblood of art. The spiral shell revises from curse to gift via concrete handling, and the final sentence offers resonant reconfiguration rather than moral. Ambiguity lingers—will the new story matter?—but the image of endless deepening is earned. One minor echo: “the searching was everything” skirts slogan, yet placement in the ultimate clause allows cadence to trump preachiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a novelist’s perceptual signature—metaphors of narrative architecture, reader-sympathy calculus—without losing embodiment. Rhythm swells and contracts with misty suspension, then snaps tight in the final clause. No head-hopping; cameos remain surface projections, preserving POV discipline. Voice stays distinct under pressure; only a single near-purple phrase—“sky that existed only as suggestion”—keeps it fractionally off 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty: advance image, deepen theme, maintain music. Figurative layering is dense but patterned (spiral, tide, fracture) and pays off in the closing line; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One filter-verb cluster (“she sensed”) is marginal and does not dull the final image, so 9-band is narrowly missed rather than capped.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “liminal space inside a book’s final breath” frame is fresh, yet the pilgrimage through dissolving characters recalls well-trod meta-fiction; specificity of hope-extraction and shell fracturing rescues it from template territory. Risk in structural lyricism heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Transformation is present: the same spiral that once signified failure becomes license to continue. Not quite a 9 because the core conceit still echoes Atkinson & Mitchell-style meta-fantasy, albeit re-voiced.</comment>
