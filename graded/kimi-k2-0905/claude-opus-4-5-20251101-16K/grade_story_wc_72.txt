<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory yearning—for innocence, then for condemning clarity—drives every beat; her final decision to wear the ampoule crystallizes a costed stance. Interiority stays concrete (“diving mask fogged with the heat of her exhaled disbelief”) and her hierarchy of values is visible in the micro-choice. Caelum’s telepathy compresses status pressure into one clean vector, keeping choreography legible despite inhuman agent. Grandmother remains off-page, so crucible criterion defaults to Mira’s self-confrontation, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ampoule against her heart reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost—poison & antidote both—under Accumulative lens. Causality is intact: statue’s telepathy → cascade of revelations → threaded chain → deliberate donning. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint (inherited moral taint) shapes final image, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Foxglove-stained ampoule and corroded silver chain act as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; underwater garden’s phosphorescent algae and marble bench underwrite every beat without drifting into tour. Sensory hierarchy follows Mira’s urgency—no checklist. Spatial choreography is clean across single continuous scene. Meets 9+ gate: object charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mira absolve or indict her grandmother?—is signaled early; tightening occurs when each revelation forecloses a simpler moral stance. Agency sits with Mira’s decision to wear the ampoule, not with statue. Cost is visible on-page: she shoulders literal poison/antidote inheritance. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-turn heavy, fitting lens; suffices for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—love without illusion—emerges through image chain of poisoned garden, drowned yet thriving city, and final ampoule resting on skin. No moralizing line; complexity lingers. Subtext pulses in impossible stone motion threading chain through crack: mercy finds fracture. Grandmother’s lullaby memory reframes without expository thesis, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV stays tight third on Mira; psychic distance compresses under pressure. Prose texture is lyrical yet controlled—“stone smiled, though stone cannot smile”—without purple drift. Telepathic italics distinguish Caelum’s voice; no head-hop. Perceptual signature centers on filtered light, violet tint, regulator bubbles—idiosyncratic and consistent. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density; sentences layer sensory, emotional, symbolic work without scaffold. Rhythm modulates with revelation beats—longer cadence for garden history, clipped fragments for regulator bubbles. Only micro-loop: “Everything here had been forgotten, yet everything persisted” / “Everything had drowned, yet everything survived” adjacent restatement; does not touch closure. Metaphors (foxglove-stained glass) stay coherent; no register drift. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of living statue, underwater ruin, and familial toxin legacy feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Mythic tropes (drowned city, guardian statue) are re-embodied through Mira’s micro-choices rather than ornament. Fresh inflection: poison & antidote cohabiting one ampoule as moral metaphor. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
