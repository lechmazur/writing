<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s transition from cosmic architect to exiled librarian is compellingly embodied—her “measured grace” and ink-rationing micro-choice show hierarchy of values. The single contradiction—once-shaping heavens, now shelving books—drives every beat. Final renunciation (“let go”) is earned by the slow drip of messages; cost is felt as library—and self—dissolve. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: drifting-book pattern is taught by 25% mark and tightens through repeated seedings until cosmic pressure collapses the library. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira’s dissolution reweights all prior ink pellets into an unstoppable constellation of doubt. Cost is legible in the line “she felt herself becoming nothing.” One clean shard sequence (library→window) keeps causality intact under drifting logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library environment constrains every tactic: ink pellets rationed because shelves are infinite, rune carved on spine because books drift. Pearl-grey void outside window acts as looming countdown clock; dust “risen like incense” mirrors ritual finality. Spatial choreography clean—columns, desk, window tracked without drift. Micro-setting (ink dish, rune tool) directly enables message weaponization and thus ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose false god—signaled in first third. Pressure deepens via accumulative pattern: each pellet spent tightens resource scarcity and narrows Valdris’s future options off-stage. No reversal needed; deepening of scholar/priest questions across centuries suffices. Library’s dissolution is visible price paid for victory, fulfilling cost requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “small, slow truths outlast grand false thrones.” Ink, dust, and drifting books accrue meaning without overt statement. Final image of diminutive titan dissolving into void reweights earlier “magnitude” label into quiet triumph. No moralizing; resonance resides in the unsaid space after last period.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—she notices shelf heights, ink bloom, constellation pressure. Syntax lengthens and compresses with emotional tide; fragments (“The last constellation shifted.”) land as heartbeat pauses. No head-hopping; diction remains archaic-tinged yet precise. Dialogue absent by design; voice carries subtext through action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Metaphors (“river learning to fly”) are sparse, taught early, payoff at closure. Information density high—each sentence layers action, image, stakes. Zero loops, zero scaffold; only micro-slips (“regally unpretentious” could trim one modifier) keep it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exiled titan using corrosive ink pellets to seed genealogical bombs across drifting books is a fresh synthesis of cosmic and bibliophilic tropes. Conceptual risk—entire climax happens off-stage via accumulated marginalia—pays off because pattern is taught and closure reweights. Specificity of iron-gall chemistry and obsolete star-maps anchors invention. Transformation test fails if Mira is generic librarian; here she is irreplaceable.</comment>
