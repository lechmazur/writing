<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Meris’s quiet, stubborn devotion is credibly embodied (“fingers numb…worked carefully”) and her final renunciation—leaving the keystone—carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The only limitation is that her contradictory impulses (longing vs. futility) are named more than enacted in-scene, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density until the memory-release reweights the stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—keystone given up, spire permanently charged—cost is legible in the empty pack. One micro-turn at the altar is sufficient. Orientation is clear by line 6; nocausal or teleport errors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Body, tool, and micro-setting (numb fingers, keystone weight, hollow ice cathedral) constrain every move; the brilliant dimness returns in the final image, charging closure. Selective sensory filters (“scent of rain-wet roses”) reflect Meris’s priorities, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is spotless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving small sacredness irreplaceable—tightens once: the altar test. The luminous spread forecloses retrieval; option narrows, price is permanent loss of the stone and the garden it encoded. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete layering—automated wonder vs. absorbed joy—never sermonizing. Final image of “thirty years of morning light” reweights prior material without moral. Sacred simplicity resists tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is character-specific (“neither day nor night, but brilliant dimness”). Syntax modulates with ascent/descent rhythm. No head-hop or register drift; purposeful compression in “everything did” line is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances image or emotional charge—without metaphor pile-up. Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create natural rhythm. Only minor paraphrase loop on “generate…automated” verbs costs 0.2. Closure line is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of automation critique with folk-magic memorial stones feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Core trope (misfit mage) is refreshed through small-scale, anti-spectacular victory. Specific sensory memory replaces generic “power of love” cliché. Risk in quiet ending heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
