<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s emotional engine—grief, filial loyalty, and synesthetic pattern-seeing—remains vivid and body-anchored. The interior contradiction between obedience and sabotage is dramatized through micro-gestures rather than told. Missing a second on-page character denies relational crucible, so status pressure is only implied; the Directors stay off-stage. Final stance crystallizes in the dice throw, yet the cost to her own survival is only gestured, not tangibly tasted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ventilation cycle becomes the decisive clock, and “L-I-V” reweights every prior dance into actionable liberation; cost is felt as imminent exposure. Causal chain holds—because she decodes, therefore she can time the escape; each roll tightens risk. Orientation is complete by line 6; no debt. Single-scene, single-POV default met; one meaningful tightening suffices and is delivered at the dice final.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken lab’s crushing quiet is not backdrop but pressure suit: silence is “tangible,” walls dictate gait, dice click replaces absent human voices. Body-as-setting functions likewise—Marina’s calibrated breath and spider-movement constrain every choice and charge the final dance. Bioluminescent drift reprises as mysterious familiarity, mirroring encoded light signals she sends. Setting details are filtered through her coder-perception, never touristic; micro-tools (dice, console, vents) track cleanly across space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the prisoners before the cycle ends—is signaled early and tightens exactly once at the dice climax when the word “LIV” makes silence lethal if she delays. Agency is continuous: every pirouette smuggles map data; final roll commits irrevocable go-time. Cost is visible conceptually (she will be caught), yet not dramatized as bodily price or forfeited future. Escalation is linear, not multi-turn, but fits lens; coincidence absent; luck complicates nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of encoded resistance emerges through pattern (dance = cipher, dice = alphabet) rather than assertion; no final sermon. Spider metaphor grows from survival strategy to liberation tactic, reweighting maternal web as escape route. Subtextual irony: directors exploit her “lyrical” label, yet that lyricism becomes weapon—readers grasp without exposition. Mysterious familiarity motif (bioluminescence, unseen prisoners) invites reader to decode alongside Marina, leaving after-image of集体agency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Marina’s synesthetic lens: “heard rhythm,” “soft click of bone against bone.” Syntax grows sinuous under pressure—parallel clauses mimic dance phrases; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within underwater technician lexicon; no academic drift. Voice peaks in final paragraph’s lyrical crescendo yet remains legible, charging closure image with earned poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Paragraph variation breathes with emotional tempo; short sentences under dice climax accelerate heartbeat. Metaphors (spindle, web, tide) stay coherent—biological, tensile, aquatic. No synonym loops; each sensory detail recurs only to reweight meaning. Opening and closing lines bookend with consonant music (“breathed…web” / “dice…ready”), creating circular ear-hook.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of choreographic cryptography with submerged prison-break feels fresh; trope of maternal diary decoded via dance is non-obvious synthesis. Risk—lyric essayish structure in thriller slot—pays off through taught pattern early and causal payoff at end. Slight familiarity of “hidden journal reveals atrocity” frame caps originality below 9. Specificity of hangman’s-dice cipher rather than generic decoder key elevates voice above template.</comment>
