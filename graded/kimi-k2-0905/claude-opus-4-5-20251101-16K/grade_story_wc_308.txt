<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The skimmer’s interior contradiction—yearning to move yet condemned to stillness—is embodied in every beat; the refusal to lift the arrowhead crystallizes a costly hierarchy of values. Centuries of watching birds translate into a single, credible micro-choice that forecloses physical pilgrimage in favor of resonant guardianship. No stock phrases; the ache is rendered through dust and harmonic vibration, not labels. The only limit: no second character on stage, so relationship/status crucible bullets are moot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece teaches early that stillness is the only lawful stance; each paragraph thickens the pattern until the arrowhead reweights the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “even the motionless could journey far” revalues stillness itself with undeniable opportunity cost. Persistent constraint (bone-bound essence) shapes every tactic; no temporal or spatial anchor debt past 120 words. One hairline slip: the final line re-states the already-earned equation, trimming the highest band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon is not backdrop but law: bone towers forbid movement, dust layers meter centuries, bird currents supply the only avenue of travel. Arrowhead and femur-tower are micro-settings that literally constrain the skimmer’s choice to leave the artifact untouched. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—“frequencies that made dust dance” priorities vibration over sight. Enough specificity to satisfy the 9+ gate: the arrowhead’s volcanic obsidian sources a lethal past that charges the final ethic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve sacred stillness versus hunger to explore—tightens when the skimmer appraises the arrowhead and elects non-interference, losing the option of physical pilgrimage forever. Escalation is textural: each bird pattern adds reach without lifting the root constraint, deepening the cost of any future violation. No coincidence; the arrowhead’s discovery is the logical culmination of centuries of avian cartography. Price is legible: the skimmer accepts eternal stationary witness in exchange for cosmic mobility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the skimmer’s refusal: memory’s integrity sometimes demands paralysis. The birds’ shifting glyphs and the unlifted arrowhead reconfigure stillness from curse to consecration without moralizing. Subtext resides in harmonic vibration—an intimacy that speech would profane. Final image lets the canyon itself hum the answer, achieving Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains locked to the skimmer’s perceptual filter—“frequencies that made dust dance” could issue from no other consciousness. Rhythmic escalation mirrors growing reach: long sentences for eons, clipped fragments at the arrowhead reveal. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Compression like “memory ached like a phantom limb” is taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic variation supports the emotional arc—cyclical bird imagery builds mantra-like momentum without monotony. Figurative language is sparse, never piled in high-pressure beats; mixed metaphors absent. One near-loop: “weathered resolve” appears twice; distance and context shift enough to escape penalty. Final line lands clean, recharging “endless echoes” with newfound benediction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bone-temple jailer who maps by birdsong feels unprecedented; the inversion of pilgrimage into stationary resonance freshens familiar immortality tropes. Conceptual commitment never blinks—no late rule changes, no safety hedge. Specificity of volcanic obsidian from erased mountains anchors the invention in geologic time. Risk is moderate; reward is a new parable about motionless voyage, meriting the high band.</comment>
