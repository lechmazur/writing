<comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied shiver at the cylinder click, palm-warm crank, “weight she had not always known”—and her renunciation is earned by the cascade of family micro-choices she re-interprets. The single-scene isolation keeps relational pressure off-page, so the dynasty-ender identity is asserted rather than crucible-tested; still, her micro-choice to set the crank on the desk crystallizes values with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test within the word limit.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the signed papers wait, the crank glows, the name will fall—cost is legible in the image. Causal chain (chest → cylinder → confession → transfer → journalists) tightens once without loopholes; the 1923 fire is the motivated pivot that reweights all prior wealth. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; lens holds accumulative/textural to the final golden-dark shift.</comment>

<comment>Sepia reading room functions as micro-setting: the gramophone’s brass throat, leather spines, and grandfather’s desk constrain every move; the crank catches dying light to charge the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy—dust motes, amber light, “golden shadows”—mirrors moral discoloration without catalogue bloat. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from chair to desk; no drift or impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or annihilate the dynasty—signals in paragraph two and tightens once when she sets the warm crank beside unsigned papers, foreclosing denial. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each recalled charity-as-penance increases density until silence itself becomes the decisive act. Cost is felt (loss of name, wealth, ancestral protection) and visible on the page without external antagonist or reversal loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silk fortunes literally woven through thirteen coffins; “golden shadows” shift from opulence to moral stain without authorial commentary. Final image of crank glowing in true dark reweights prior gilded portraits into indictments. Subtext in what the recording omits—no remorse—speaks louder than stated guilt, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature favors acoustic and chromatic detail—standing waves, sepia, amber—true to a listener’s POV. Syntax lengthens during reflection then tightens to fragment (“Some dynasties deserved ending”) under decision pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; prose rhythm alone carries the emotional crescendo convincingly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening spondaic crunch of crank, later liquid “golden shadows lengthen,” final clipped “lay it down.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or stakes. High information density—one sentence often layers sensory, historical, and moral data—without purple overload; closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “wealth built on bones” premise is refreshed through acoustic confession cylinder and the notion that standing waves physically transmit ancestral guilt; specificity of textile fires and thirteen unrecovered workers grounds the trope. Risk taken by making climax an act of silence rather than exposé earns +0.3. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, because crank, gramophone, and acoustic logic are irreplaceable.</comment>
