<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yara’s crystallization affliction and her choice to inscribe a childhood rune into her own scar give a vivid, embodied cost; her micro-choice to “believe” in superstition under academic stress is particular and charged. The arc—scar → chosen mark—lands with visible price. Only the grandmother voice feels slightly convenient, not fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal sheds, new skin bears her chosen silver rune, fragments rain away—cost is legible, irreversible. Causal lens holds: because she violates scholarly rules and reclaims the crow-feather symbol, the crystal releases. One shard, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Floating rock, amber clouds, obsidian inkwell, and her own forearm as micro-setting constrain every move; weather shifts actively scatter the crystal payoff. Selective sensory filtering (petrichor, warm rain, high crystal note) anchors POV without catalogue. Spatial choreography remains consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into authored stories—tightens when stress triggers fresh crystallization, forcing the illegal inscription. One meaningful escalation: quill touches crystal → song → shed → permanent rune; option to remain passive is foreclosed with visible skin cost. Agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image chain: scars as locked text → crow quill as authorship → chosen silver mark. No explicit moral; final rain-soaked image reweights “shedding” as creative act. Superstition vs scholarship tension lingers unresolved, adding useful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person interior stays close to Yara’s perceptual filter—crow-feather lore, quartz pain, ink scent—without head-hop. Syntax breathes with ceremony pacing, then tightens during the cut. Distinct idiom in “the crystal sang” and “amber clouds” feels voice-true, not generic fantasy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; paragraph breaks pace the breath-hold. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“time seemed to steep like tea leaves”) is sparse, purposeful, and paid off in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystallization-as-stress-response and crow-quill authorship combine into fresh metaphor for self-inscription of trauma. Superstition reclaimed inside academic framework gives non-obvious angle on “writing the body.” Risk stays calibrated to character stakes rather than world-scale gimmick.</comment>
