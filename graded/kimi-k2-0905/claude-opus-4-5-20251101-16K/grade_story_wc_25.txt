<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vera’s competence is vivid—her map-folding, gait-recognition, whisper-test all individuate her—but interior contradiction is muted; the only micro-choice under pressure is whispering Elena’s name. The key’s re-use registers but never costs her anything, so the final “return to shadows” feels like habit, not renunciation with visible price. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to meet the 9- gate for voice even if emotional cost stays shallow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is lean and intact: lost girl → coin clue → whisper tactic → ascent → exit, each beat because/therefore. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Vera slips back into the maze, pocketing the still-lockless key—cost is the perpetual guardianship she chooses again. The lens stays causal throughout; no teleports or plot amnesia. Minor nip: storm-surge ticking clock is declared but never tightens tactics on-page, keeping it just under 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Container acoustics, rust gradients, aurora shimmer, and corrugated gaps are filtered through Vera’s professional eye and become tactical—she probes hollows with the key, whispers along steel channels. The labyrinth itself forces every decision: which crease to fold, where to listen, how to climb. Micro-setting (the key, the coin, the rat+candy-wrapper sign) constrains choice; environment literally charges the final image as aurora fades over steel. Spatial choreography is flawless—footfalls, ridges, descents all tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clean—one child, one exit window, one whisper-method tested in real time. Pressure tightens when the key finds the hollow, converting map theory into audible contact; that single escalation satisfies the length requirement. Storm surge stays atmospheric rather than physical threat, so cost is mostly time/mental load, not tangible loss. Sufficient for 8-band, but to crest 8.8 we’d need a visible price extracted from Vera on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: knowledge systems (maps, coins, star-signs) versus lived, sensory attention—Vera’s whisper outperforms the girl’s luck. Final image of her “planning tomorrow’s routes” reweights all prior folds as perpetual, self-chosen servitude; no moral is stated. Subtext in dialogue (“Scorpios trust too much in fate”) glances at belief without sermon. The resonance is specific, not abstract, earning its lift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><answer>Third-person hovers at Vera’s shoulder, perceptual idiom steady—“stacked steel boxes breathed,” “sound bounced strangely,” syntax flexes with motion but never drifts. Filter verbs are minimal; when they appear (“she heard shuffling”) they serve auroral hush rather than dilute. Whisper cadence and auroral color recur as patterned diction without drumbeat monotony. Distinctive, taught early, paid off in the fading-aurora exit.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, high-density; every clause adds map, body, or acoustic data. Metaphors (“ribbons of green and violet,” “accordion-pleated”) are few, precise, and never layered into clutter. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings modulate. One nip—“breathing containers” and “groaned in conversation” share anthropomorphic airway, but the echo is brief and doesn’t muddy causality, so only a hairline slip keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Shipping-container rescue is familiar turf, yet the acoustic-whisper thesis, foldable probability-maps, and gait-cataloguing feel fresh and specific to Vera. The key-without-lock stays unresolved, a dangling invitation that avoids neat payoff. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric exit instead of heroic applause—but coherence holds. Transformation is evident: swap Vera’s sensorium and the whole rescue route collapses.</comment>
