<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“ash on her tongue and tears on her cheeks”—and her contradictory impulses (saving those who once condemned her) are active in scene. The micro-choice to press the tessera to her forehead is character-specific and forecloses rest. However, the “gentle radical” descriptor is asserted more than dramatized in this single beat; we see mercy, but the radical softness is mostly recalled. Cost is present (prosthetic arm, retrocognitive drowning) and scales to length.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment adds density until the naming of Safiya crystallizes the reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the plaza remained”) and the sky image teaches the shattered pattern early. Closure is a Charged Poise: Vera’s whispered “I see you” reweights the premise—memory as infrastructure—while the persistent constraint of retrocognitive cost remains. The cost is legible in the physical toll (“gasped back… ash on her tongue”) and the lifetime pledge.</comment>

<comment>The shattered sky and ash-stained stones are not backdrop; they narrow Vera’s choices—she must walk barefoot, risk each touch. The tessera functions as micro-setting: its retained blue amid scorch constrains her hope and becomes the conduit for Safiya’s retrieval. Spatial choreography is clean—kneels at minaret heart, rises, walks on—with sensory hierarchy filtered through Vera’s punitive empathy. One minor slip: “central minaret had stood before it collapsed” is tell-ish, not felt through her soles.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve erased names—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation is textural: each fragment adds moral density until the single deepening—“Safiya”—reweights the task from salvage to resurrection. Agency is Vera’s decision to endure the retrocognitive plunge; the price (tears, gasp) is on-page. No false intensifiers; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via concrete particulars: tessera, steel arm, barefoot tread. The central question—what survives annihilation?—is answered by the act of naming, not exposition. Final image (“mercy took its aberrant forms”) offers resonant non-literal reweighting: memory as infrastructure. Avoids sermon; the insight is earned through the sensory toll of the vision.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet restrained: rhythmic variation from short declaratives to water-light similes. Perceptual signature is Vera’s—history beneath her heels, blue tile against brow. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under retrocognitive pull. Syntax mirrors pressure: clauses fragment during vision release. “Warmth bloomed in the coldness” risks overt symbolism but is saved by the immediate physical context post-vision.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver prosthetic origin, moral paradox, and world rule. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in climax—preventing density penalty. One near-miss: “consensus reality” phrase in penultimate paragraph drifts toward editorial; cut would sharpen.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic setting yoked to archival mysticism via retrocognitive archaeology. Tessera-as-key and “aberrant mercy” refract standard revenge tropes into a quiet anti-vengeance stance. Risk of shattered-sky grandiosity is offset by barefoot intimacy. Final inflection—“warmth not heat”—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No derivative template; stakes hinge on naming, not weaponry.</comment>
