<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veluna’s calm competence feels lived-in; her barefoot stance and inherited mallet anchor belief. Motivation—cross the storm to refill barrels—is primal yet coherent. Interiority stays sensory (“waves crashing…wind tearing blossoms”) rather than analytic. No visible contradiction under pressure, but no micro-choice that surprises; the outcome feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the raft emerges “battered but whole,” barrels full—an Earned Stasis with visible cost (exhaustion, fallen apples). Fractal rhythm builds a causal chain: each tap → tree response → sound cocoon that tames the storm; coincidence is excluded. Orientation is taught early (“platform’s edge…decades of salt”). One minor causality bump: the orchard’s clay pots survive the boundary current without a wobble, a physics amnesia that doesn’t break but nicks credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Driftwood platform, clay-potted trees, and salvaged telephone-pole mast are tactile, specific, and immediately spatial. Weather is not backdrop but antagonist; the blue hour’s indigo and violet hues filter every beat. Micro-setting (the frayed mallet) literally charges the climax when its final strike harmonizes the storm. Sensory hierarchy holds: salt on lips, rope thrumming under knuckles, never tourist-catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freshwater survival—signaled in paragraph four and revisited only via the rain barrels at the end; the tightening is single but sufficient. The storm escalates from visual threat to body-blow antagonist; Veluna’s agency is continuous (every tap) so pressure grows because/therefore, not coincidence. No secondary loss beyond exhaustion/fallen fruit, so cost is modest. Still, options narrow to “play or die,” and the musical tactic is inventive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: chaos as unheard music awaiting a partner. No character sermonizes; the final line’s “endless, essential song of survival” is image, not thesis. Subtext sketched via resonance—trees, ropes, storm—accumulates without abstraction. Could use one sharper counter-reading (why must some storms stay unplayed?) but stays admirably unsimple.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Veluna’s body and ear; perceptual signature is wind, salt, vibration. Syntax lengthens and compresses with tempo—“tapping branches, striking…knocking”—mirroring fractal build. No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat; “felt the raft shudder” is earned tactility. Diction stays within her seafarer lexicon; elevated terms (“euphony,” “conceptual repricing”) are narrator-only and brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm arrows through sentence-length variation; percussion sentences mimic the xylophone. Information density is high: “apple trees and pear trees swayed in their clay pots” does triple scene-work. No mixed metaphors, but “feathered cirrus sketched a deeper message” edges toward anthropomorphism. Minor template echo: multiple “She…she…she…” openers mid-storm; not fatal but keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard-prophecy via mallet-storm is conceptually fresh; synthesis of music theory and seastead survival feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: swap “orchard” for “village” and the whole logic collapses. One late-breaking rule—sound cocoon pacifies gale—works because fractal mechanics are fore-shadowed. Risk is bold yet coherent; no market clichés in sight.</comment>
