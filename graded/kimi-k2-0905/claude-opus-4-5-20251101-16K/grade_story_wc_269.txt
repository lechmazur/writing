<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—grief-rooted vigilance versus the need to act—stay alive in the present-tense beats: the inherited tapping, the refusal to discard the atlas, the choice to keep vigil rather than publish data. The “white silence” memory and the micro-choice to palm the atlas under pressure embody loss without slipping into label-speak. Interiority is specific and biased toward maritime detail; the only cap is that the final renunciation (“she would keep tapping”) is more quiet stasis than visible cost, nudging it under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rhythmic tap + atlas re-coupled with the image of unseen coral recruiting on her father’s erased routes reweights meaning and forecloses easy hope. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each echo of tap/white/atlas tightens the stake of “what disappears/what might return.” Cost is legible in the final sentence—she accepts a lifetime of witness without promise of recovery. Lens holds without ambiguity; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sea-level station’s aluminum desk, the fogged window, and the softened atlas edges are returned to in tactile ways that guide gesture and constrain choice. The "periodically eternal" ocean is filtered through professional gauges and父女 memory, never touristic. Geography is stable; the parking-garage origin is a concise, specific anchor. Micro-setting (atlas as handled object) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep witnessing or surrender to despair—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery that her father too kept futile records. One meaningful turn: the manifest revelation re-prices her vigil from private grief to inherited duty. Cost is lyrical but felt: she forfeits the possibility of quick answers, accepting perpetual tapping. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-oppositional, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the tension between human timetables and oceanic time; no editorial statement intrudes. The white/atlas/tap motifs accrue rather than symbolize, re-weighted by the final image of coral secretly regrowing. Ambiguity is purposeful: redemption is possible yet unwitnessed. No moralizing closure; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is maritime, metallic, patiently rhythmic—mirrored in the three-quick / two-slow tap pattern that becomes the prose’s heartbeat. Perceptual signature is strong: Maren notices rust, hum levels, map paper fibers—never generic “beauty.” Compression is lyrical but taught by first paragraph and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; distance remains steady close-third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “periodically eternal,” “white as bone,” “something trying to remember its own name” compress multiple layers. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional swell without algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is sparse and precise; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Final line earns cadence echo of opening tap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “climate-fiction grief memoir” sub-genre is refreshed by focusing on post-ban chronic rise rather than disaster spectacle, and by making the evidence object an analog atlas rather than data console. Father’s covert reef-monitoring network is a specific, non-obvious back-story that reframes maritime nostalgia as activist archaeology. Risky lyric stasis ending (no rescue, no witness) is committed to fully. Synthesis feels inevitable yet surprising in hindsight.</comment>
