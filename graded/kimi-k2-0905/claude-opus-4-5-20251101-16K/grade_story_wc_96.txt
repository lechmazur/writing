<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sable’s monthly personality “molt” is announced, not dramatized; we never see a contradictory impulse in-scene, so the trait feels decorative. The coffee-tin concealment is a single micro-choice that works, but the climactic “same time tomorrow” endurance is a credible renunciation that costs her sleep and safety, earning the bump.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the refusal to stop rebuilding, paid for with perpetual itinerancy and exposure. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each poetic deposit and nightly labor accrues into a crystallized stance—though the “moon clears the skyline” opening is a half-beat late on spatial anchoring, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The rusted, open-roof library is not backdrop; its very decay dictates the nightly labor (tarps, candle logistics) and the final star-touched image reweights the ruin as sanctuary. The coffee tin’s micro-setting as clandestine archive is equally indispensable—remove it and the witness-poems vanish, collapsing stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—continued creation of unsanctioned witness-art under threat of erasure—tightens once: the poems are now physically present in a shelf anyone can raid. The price (sleep lost, exposure) is visible, but the escalation is more cadence-deepening than option-narrowing; authority remains off-stage, so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the iterative act of witness-in-ruin rather than declaration; the final “fractured light” image re-prices the library as living testament, avoiding moralism. Subtext in Marcus’s dust-covered hands and Sable’s candlelit sorting lets silence carry the weight of incarceration’s afterlife.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third lyrical-observant distance is held flawlessly; diction (“rusted cathedral of books,” “smoke retreating up a chimney”) is poetic yet character-bound, never purple. Rhythm modulates—long breath for ruins, staccato for dialogue—without template cadence; no head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries double duty (image + motive or setting + stake); no filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent; only one tiny scaffold (“Together they rebuild…again tomorrow”) but it cadences the litany of resistance, forgiven at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The post-collapse open-air library as living archive feels fresh, and the penny-poet who sheds personalities monthly is a startling lens on identity-as-protest. The synthesis—witness-poems hidden in a false-bottom tin—makes the concept indivisible from this story; swap the object and the fractal light goes out.</comment>
