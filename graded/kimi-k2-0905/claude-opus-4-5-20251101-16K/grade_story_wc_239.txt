<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but the “end of history witness” role is asserted more than dramatized; she never makes a micro-choice that risks anything tangible until the final sentence, so the renunciation feels lightly earned. Dictionary-handling beats show bodily engagement, yet the contradiction she claims is talked through rather than embodied under escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a legitimate CR: the dictionary writes new definitions in her future hand, repricing “end” as “seed.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—spiral density and recursive definitions tighten the stake toward that reweighting. Orientation is waived; deliberate disorientation (temple outside time) pays off in the closing hush-note. One soft patch: the voice’s external verdict “You remain because you have not completed yours” momentarily seizes agency from her, slightly dulling cost ownership.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library is built from perceptual micro-detail—dust as sediment of forgotten thoughts, shelves as neural paths—so setting doubles as mental topology, directly constraining her inward/outward method. Spiral carved floor guides her footfalls, charging the final image. While physical laws remain dreamlike, the world rules stay internally consistent and are learned through walked discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why did my history end while I remain?”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accretion of recursive textual rings, each asking a stripped-down ontological question, narrowing possibility space toward the seed-realization. Cost is present but conceptual (she must inhabit illusion differently); a more visceral forfeiture would push this into the 8.8+ band.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without declaration: meaning survives its context by re-inhabitation, not exposure of illusion. Dictionary’s re-writing hand is the concrete image that reweights prior material. Final hush-note answers the opening question non-literally. Only lack of an on-page counter-argument keeps it from 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled syntactic elongation that mirrors spiral recursion. Perceptual signature—“pages soft as moth wings”—remains character-bound. Compression like “universe’s hiccup” is taught early and paid off in the sustained note. No head-hopping or register drift; rhythmic modulation underpins the silence motif without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“wanderingly exact,” “patient unification”) is voice-motivated and patterned, not intrusive. One clause—“silence with presence, quiet with weight”—borders on self-paraphrase but is forgiven as thematic reiteration at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Concept of a library that arbitrates paradoxes by walking inward while moving outward is fresh, executed through lived geography rather than allegory. Risky recursive structure is held together by sustained sonic motif (hush). Transformation is specific: her dictionary rewrites itself in her own unlived handwriting—an image that could not be transplanted into another tale without dismantling the whole.</comment>
