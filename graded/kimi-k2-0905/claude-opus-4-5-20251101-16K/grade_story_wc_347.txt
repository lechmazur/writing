<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s reluctant-caretaker interiority is vivid—her cost calculus (“time she needed…warmth she couldn’t spare”) drives every micro-choice. The contradictory pull between orchard hunger and stranger-compassion acts simultaneously in-scene. The final renunciation lands with felt cost: she loses still more warmth yet gains only the nut’s “peculiar hope,” a price scaled perfectly to 750 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Maren forecloses personal rescue to save three strangers, cost rendered in the lingering nut scent on her hands. Causal chain—blueprint memory → nut placement → path illumination → safe exit—holds without gaps. Lens is causal throughout; every beat tightens because/therefore toward the frost deadline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mechanical birds’ brass wings, copper-scented fruit, and the nut’s seed-memory are tactile, selective, and filter through Maren’s orchard-keeper bias. The cliffside labyrinth constrains movement and supplies the only safe exit she can imprint. Final image—the nut’s warmth against her skin—recharges the setting as micro-object and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save strangers vs. preserve self—tightens once when the frost clock reaches six hours; nut placement narrows options to a single safe path. Cost is legible: she irrevocably spends scarce warmth, foreshadowing tomorrow’s greater orchard toll. One meaningful tightening satisfies 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited burden versus anonymous mercy emerges from action, not assertion. The nut’s “peculiar hope” reweights the curse without moralizing; graceless beauty of indifferent birds mirrors Maren’s quiet sacrifice. Resonance lingers in the olfactory afterimage of hope tainted by copper regret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is precise, weathered, orchard-specific: “smelled of copper and regret,” “graceless beauty.” Perceptual signature—measured distances, brass mathematics—never slips POV. Rhythm modulates from curt observations to the hushed final line, sustaining atmospheric control without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; high density without scaffold. Metaphors (“rot through stone,” “clicking, turning heads”) are coherent, never mixed. Zero loops or paraphrase stacks; each line advances image, motive, or pressure. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The inherited-orchard-curse trope is refreshed by Maren’s non-contact rescue mechanics and the nut-as-seed-memory device. Risky choice to keep travelers off-stage pays off: focalization stays solitary, heightening sacrifice. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not derivative.</comment>
