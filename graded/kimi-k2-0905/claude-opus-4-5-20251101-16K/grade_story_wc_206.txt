<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s grief-propelled vocation and the embodied cost of pouring his own “wonder” into the box are vivid, but the interior contradiction—why he risks everything now rather than at any earlier midnight—remains asserted, not dramatized; the daughter’s hollowness is referenced, not re-felt in a present micro-choice, so the final sacrifice feels inevitable rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: wilting stone detects hidden lie → Midnight materializes → tether ritual rewrites covenant with visible drain on Silas. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the stolen light returns city-wide, Silas is “diminished… yet more whole,” cost is legible. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber’s brass gears and crystalline cylinders double as both repair-shop and ritual space, guiding the tether gesture; the wilting stone’s amber glow provides mutable lighting that tracks honesty. Specificity is selective and POV-filtered; the city beyond remains a blur, acceptable at this length. The chamber’s acoustic properties are hinted but not leveraged to constrain choice, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—is signaled early and escalates once: the stone’s wilting proves the covenant is being breached from inside, forcing Silas to pay with personal radiance. The tightening narrows options to sacrifice or surrender, cost is on-page (stone curls, Silas diminished), but no secondary loss or tactic shift occurs, so escalation is single-note yet sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of voluntary generosity as antidote to entropy emerges through the tether act and the rewritten covenant, never sermonized. The music box’s returning “sunrise” melody reweights earlier silence without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: who lied, what price the city still owes, keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited voice carries a tinkerer’s tactile diction—“brass gears,” “crystalline cylinders,” “tiny mechanical hearts”—and rhythmic variation that accelerates during the tether. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent. Midnight’s dialogue is suitably indistinct, preserving otherness. No register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences do multiple jobs: “The stone chip against his chest trembled, then began to wilt—curling at its edges like a dying petal” advances plot, embodies cost, and maintains metaphoric coherence. One mixed image—“midnight unfolded like smoke given form”—is borderline, but does not obstruct causality. No loops or scaffold; momentum breathes appropriately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing entropy-covenant philosophy with music-box restoration feels fresh; the “covenant of rust” re-weights familiar entropy as negotiated rather than inevitable. The wilting truth-detector stone is a lovely inversion of standard philosopher’s-stone tropes. While “personified shadow feeding on wonder” edges toward archetype, the specificity of the repair craft and the communal tether keep it individualized.</comment>
