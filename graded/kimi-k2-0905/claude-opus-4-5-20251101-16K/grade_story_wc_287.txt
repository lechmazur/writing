<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is concrete—gardening as witness, the gauge tooth as tactile memory—and her micro-choice to reposition mirrors crystallizes her father-derived ethic. Yet the contradiction between “wistful” and “pragmatic” is asserted, not dramatized in a single beat where they collide; the emotional cost is diffuse rather than attached to a forfeited alternative. Still, her stance at the end is credibly earned: she accepts the ache of tending fragile things and the reader feels the price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the rose petal drop → mirror adjustment → moon-scatter pattern tightens once, reweighting the stake of “holding light.” Closure is a Charged Poise: Marta pockets the gauge, planning spring planting—path foreclosed to resignation, cost legible in skeletal rose and winter coming. Orientation clean by line 5; no causal break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fire-escape micro-setting constrains every move: railing, pots, mirrors angled off brick. Harbor moonlight is not postcard but resource—its shifting arcs dictate mirror tilt and thus which neighbor rooms receive shards. Gauge tooth on railing catches and throws that same light, charging final image. Specificity is selective, POV-filtered, and causally active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reflect light into dark corners”—is signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: petal drop triggers annual mirror re-calibration, narrowing options from tending plants to tending light itself. Cost is present (bare rose, winter, ache confessed) but diffuse; no concrete forfeiture beyond seasonal cycle. Sufficient for length, not yet piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of custodial attention emerges through mirrored light fragments rather than thesis: “locks weren’t about keeping people out—they were about choosing who to let in” reconfigured as letting light in. Final image of unexplained brightness on children’s walls offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—gauge tooth, oar rhythm—carries lineage and vocation quietly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is lockmaster’s daughter—metal tooth, key-bitting metaphors, oar-rhythm syntax. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom alone and does: “wistfully pragmatic,” “language of keys,” “collector of something precious.” Rhythm modulates with emotional rise; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“wake catching moonlight in a V-shaped trail that reminded her of the rosebush’s thorns”—one image doing two jobs. High information density: sensory, emotional, and causal data packed without scaffolding. Clean mechanics; no artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar urban-garden uplift is refreshed through lockmaster lineage and mirror-engineered moon-theft; the gauge tooth repurposed as talismanic bit of father’s craft feels specific rather than quirky. Risk is modest—quiet lyric arc, no structural gamble—but execution is precise and the synthesis of locksmith ethic with light-keeping is non-obvious.</comment>
