<comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—duty to the clock vs. hunger to reach Celeste—co-exist in every beat; the cracked puppet head exteriorizes her grief and forces the climactic choice. The renunciation (leaving the head on the sill) costs her the last tactile relic and is earned by the prior causal chain. Interiority stays embodied: “air tastes like endings,” palm against hush feels “like a small hand pressing back,” avoiding label-speak. Single-POV isolation strengthens the mother-wound; no status dynamics needed.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby crosses the pane, time deepens rather than ends, and the price is the irreversible surrender of the puppet remnant. Causal linkage holds: because she adjusts via nested patterns, therefore she can vouchsafe song; because she yields the head, the silence carries the lullaby. Orientation is swift—lighthouse, dusk, clock named by word 45; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (nested folds, ripple, hush) escalates until the final cadence shift reweights stakes.</comment>

<comment>The pane of hush functions as micro-setting that literally constrains action—only through it can the song pass. Lighthouse spatial choreography is stable: spiral ascent, lantern room, window ledge; sea and stars react causally to the adjustment. Sensory hierarchy is grief-narrowed: copper light, purple bruise of dusk, taste of endings. The broken puppet head’s crack catches specific dying light, charging the final image when left on the sill.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she transmit love across annihilation—is signaled in paragraph four. Pressure tightens once: from routine adjustment to irreversible offering of the last relic. The tightening forecloses possession of the puppet; cost is visible in the relinquishment. Under Accumulative lens, the density of nested patterns and the final cadence shift reweight the stake without requiring causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular loss: tenderness as the only victory available at apocalypse. Subtext operates in gesture—pressing cracked temple to impossible surface implies maternal kiss across death. Final image of atoms vibrating with lullaby reweights prior physics-of-sorrow metaphors without stating thesis. No thematic echo or moralizing; bruised awe stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains Mira’s perceptual signature: maps “forget,” air “bleeds copper,” silence has “creases.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, fragments under shock (“Not glass. Not liquid. Not light.”), mirroring emotional curve. No dialogue, so voice purity remains. Free-indirect compression—“time moves strangely here”—stays within her lexicon of bereaved caretaker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent: time as origami, silence as membrane, lighthouse beam as promise—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “lighthouse doesn’t warn ships. It marks the distance between now and never” performs three jobs in twelve words. Rhythm modulates from declarative to lyric surge during lullaby without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cosmic-clock trope with maternal grief feels inevitable yet unexampled; the hidden lighthouse that measures existential distance rather than coastline is a fresh angle. Nested patterns as adjustment mechanics transform abstract multiverse into tactile maternal act. Risk—using lyric compression instead of plot reversals—heightens coherence. Removing puppet head or pane of hush collapses emotional logic, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
