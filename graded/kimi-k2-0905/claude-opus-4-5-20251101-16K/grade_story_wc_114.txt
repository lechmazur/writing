<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s fault-tolerant oracle identity is shown through her calibrated micro-choice to smudge the illustration, not just told. The embodied tremor and seventeen-year endurance give visible cost to her swallowed truth. Interior contradiction—love vs vanishing—remains active in the final palm-press to the gentian. The descent is earned because the marginal method and fever-clearing have forced a stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Mira’s descent reweights every prior margin-living second with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of “peripheral awareness” and yellowed paper pattern breaks into the single visible “Forgive.” No orientation drift; station, village, and seventeen-year gap are anchored by word 120. Persistent constraint—swallowed truth—shapes every tactical hesitation until the final footstep downslope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frost-laced window and auroral dawn are not postcard garnish; they filter Mira’s narrowed post-fever perception and mirror the pink-gold bleed of revealed feeling. Micro-setting inside the yellowed paper margin literally constrains the smudge action that triggers the descent. Spatial coherence holds: desk → window → village below tracks cleanly. Weather instruments’ indifferent hum charges the final image by remaining unmoved while she leaves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the weight of a swallowed truth”—tightens once when the graphite lifts “Forgive,” collapsing seventeen years of static into a single irrevocable cost. No reversals needed; the deepening of peripheral vision to central knowledge is sufficient escalation under Accumulative lens. Agency is the deliberate smudge that forecloses continued isolation. Cost is legible in the palm-press and the final descent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific gentian image shifting from secret holder to absolution token; no abstract moral is stated. Subtext of unnamed love and parental refusal is carried in the single pressed word rather than exposition. The auroral sorrow final image reweights all prior marginal living without sermon. Ambiguity persists: forgiveness is offered, not confirmed received—complexity retained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric compression is taught early—“weather was not truth but probability wearing a mask”—and sustained without head-hop. Perceptual signature is Mira’s meteorological filter: barometers, wind gauge, auroral light color her emotional parses. Syntax modulates from long fever-haze sentences to the final short descent clause, mirroring clarified vision. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior diction staying within her scientific lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative anaphora of “the edge” builds texture, then fractures into the stark final line. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed metaphors avoided—“pink and gold bleeding across the peaks” keeps color logic consistent. Only minor filter-verb stack in “she was peripherally aware” costs −0.2; closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Alpine weather station as confessional engine feels fresh; the botanical watermark as encryption device is specific to these sisters. Seventeen-year silent endurance encoded in margin-notes transforms familiar sibling-estrangement trope. Risk of lyric stasis is averted by the decisive descent. Synthesis of meteorological uncertainty with emotional fault-tolerance is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
