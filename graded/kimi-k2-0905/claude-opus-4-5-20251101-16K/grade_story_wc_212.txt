<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-laden patience and centuries of stewardship are credibly embodied; the acorn cap as tactile heirloom anchors her inherited burden. The climactic apology and release pay the emotional cost cleanly. No contradictory interior beats disturb her “furiously tranquil” stance—every micro-choice obeys that single register, so while rich, the portrait is monochrome; a second impulse would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crystal-clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the vortex re-opens, creature departs, borrowed time’s fragility is re-weighted on-page (“felt like watching something beautiful leave”). Causal chain—creature’s entropy reversal → time unravel → must reopen portal—holds without gaps or convenient amnesia. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by paragraph 2; no penalty. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural: imagery density tightens until the cadence shift at the fountain. One soft spot: the millennia-sealed vortex accepts the acorn cap instantly; a sentence of resistance or cost there would have locked 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Icebound atrium is not mere postcard; its frost walls, frozen fountain, and starlight constrain every breath and choreograph the final ritual. Micro-setting triumphs: the acorn cap’s texture and temperature tether memory to flesh. Spatial tracking stays clean as Mira moves from vortex to fountain to pocket. Only the “thousands of seeds” shelf is sketched, not felt—minor gap keeping it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve borrowed centuries versus free the creature—surfaces early and tightens once: reopening the vortex forecloses the safety of endless time. The price is legible in the final image (she now faces mortal span). No secondary reversal, but for 700 words one meaningful tightening suffices. Mid-band because the external pressure (time unraveling) is declared more than dramatized; we’re told particles gather, not shown a personal symptom until the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: stewardship of forgotten life, the cost of borrowed time, beauty as transience. No explicit thesis; final equivalence “borrowed time … was exactly like hope” lands as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting prior motifs. Complexity intact—reader can’t tell whether immortality’s loss is tragedy or release. Achieves resonance through recurrent frost/seed imagery without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within Mira’s contemplative lexicon (“rough-textured,” “wild serenity”). Lyric repetitions (“felt like…”) are patterned early and payoff in closure, not monotonous. No dialogue, so no register drift. Internal monologue avoids therapy-speak; metaphor (“eyes that contained galaxies”) risks cliché but is singularized by immediate photon-snowflake physics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the accumulative spiral toward release. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—each frost image reinforces entropy theme; no mixed metaphors. Tight information economy: one sentence often performs scene, mood, world-rule. Only minor scaffold: “felt like” thrice in closing paragraph; doesn’t dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise fuses cosmic entropy-being with heirloom seed-keeping—fresh synthesis, not 2024 trope recycle. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens awe without obscuring stakes. Transformation test passes: swap seeds or setting and emotional arc collapses. Loses top sliver because entropy-reversal bird faintly echoes planetary-fiction archetype; still, specifics (photon-wings → snowflakes) personalize it.</comment>
