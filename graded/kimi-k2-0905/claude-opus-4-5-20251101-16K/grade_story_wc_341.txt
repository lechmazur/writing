<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s filial grief is vivid and embodied (brass telescope warmth, whispered promise), but interiority toggles between lyric paraphrase and diagnostic tag (“she believed,” “she understood”) without letting contradictory impulses collide in real time; the climactic “Classification: loved” is affectively right yet causally un-earned because no micro-choice in the scene risks or forfeits anything. The arc is pure endurance/observation, so renunciation stays abstract—no cost is extracted on-page, capping earnestness below excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cloud entry layers density toward the closing assertion that the sky remembers. Orientation is swift and spatial cues remain coherent; the brass telescope reappears to anchor continuity. Closure achieves Charged Poise—“loved” re-classifies prior data—but the cost is only conceptual (no live option foreclosed), keeping the beat just shy of decisive. One paraphrase loop (“empty spaces remember” echoed three times) slightly dulls the final cadence.</comment>

<comment>Seventeen-thousand-foot gondola is sensuously evoked through brass chill, cable creak, starlight diffraction; selective meteorological detail mirrors emotional stakes without tourist clutter. The telescope functions as micro-setting, constraining Mira’s posture and attention, and recurs in the last line to refract starlight—an earned image that reweights the premise. Sparse tactile grounding of balloon systems still reads plausible for length.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove sky-memory at Flight 2847 coordinates—remains coherent; pressure escalates only via descriptive accretion (each cloud logged) rather than narrowing options or threatening failure. No visible price (fuel, funding, oxygen, credibility) is risked or lost, so the tightening is tonal, not tactical. Sufficient for short-form lyric arc but short of the felt cost required for top band.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of atmospheric grief emerges imagistically, never sermonized; “melancholic” cumulus and “loved” cirrus let meteorological language carry emotional subtext. Final re-categorization crystallizes the memorial idea without moralizing. Some abstraction around “empty spaces remember” edges toward thesis-statement, blunting full resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skews scientific-affective (“ice crystals scattering…his passage”). Syntax modulates from long atmospheric cadences to staccato log entries, mirroring observational rhythm. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom stays anchored in Mira’s hybrid lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variety, high information density; most figurative language is purposeful. Three near-repetitions of “spooled wholeness” and “empty spaces remember” create minor loop drag; one mixed vehicle (“quietly explosive truth”) momentarily jars. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive prose.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Cloud taxonomy by emotion feels fresh and is followed to its implication; coupling bereavement with meteorological data creates a singular memorial concept. Brass telescope inheritance provides intimate, non-generic anchor. Risk lies in the lyric-static structure, but coherence justifies the gamble. Avoids cliché tropes of aviation-loss narratives.</comment>
