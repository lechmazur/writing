<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s guarded stance is dramatized through the seed she keeps “starved” against her heart and the micro-choice to unclench her fist around it; the contradictory impulses—weapon vs. healer—coexist in-scene and drive the decisive release that costs her the armor she thought she needed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: failed mirror → circles → unbinding → confession → unbend → vortex calm; the on-page Decisive Change (planting the seed as guardian, not weapon) carries visible cost—she forecloses her last lethal defense and accepts vulnerability, satisfying closure under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vortex-choreography stays coherent—spiral trees, inward water, groaning reality—and the seed’s transition from corsage to planted guardian re-weights the final image; spatial tracking never drifts, and the lake’s physics constrain every step she takes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure tightens exactly once: when Mira refuses to harden, the curse loses purchase; the price is immediate—she surrenders her ultimate shield while still inside the lethal vortex—making the escalation legible and irreversible under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the mirror that shows only surfaces vs. the druid who finds what’s lost beneath; the final image of the seed guarding the lake, not the wearer, re-prices the premise—returning, not possessing, is wholeness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is rhythmic, compressed, lyric—“warlike serenity,” “branches like desperate arms”—yet stays inside a druid’s lexicon; no head-hop, no filter overload; final sentence cadence mirrors the spiral’s quietus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes; metaphor stack is purposeful (mirror, seed, vortex) and paid off; no register drift, no mixed vehicles; the unbend moment is rendered in a single clean clause that lands like a blade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar fantasy trappings—cursed lake, druid, magic seed—are re-wired through internal alchemy: the seed flips from weapon to guardian, the vortex quiets when met with softness; the inversion feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
