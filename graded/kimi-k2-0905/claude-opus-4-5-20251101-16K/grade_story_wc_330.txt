<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s hush-to-song shift is embodied through sawdust breath and pocketed brass, but the interior contradiction between silence as refuge and silence as cage is only asserted, never dramatized in-scene; the moment she “began to sing” lands as gentle uplift rather than costly renunciation because no prior beat shows silence protecting her from a specific vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens immediately (mist, chimes, dust motes) and lands a Charged Poise closure: the promise to return carries conceptual cost—once song has entered her silence, the old sanctuary is irrevocably changed. Causality is interior but coherent; halo fragment → song → foreclosed silence reads as inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Circus-train micro-setting is tactile—peeling gold leaf, velvet rot, brass warmth in pocket—and the body-as-setting (throat unused for seventeen years) literally constrains the final action. Wind-bell acoustics meter the scene, tightening choices; mist modulates visibility and risk. One decorative flourish (“forgotten prayer”) keeps it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence as safe possibility-space—is signaled early and pressured once: the carousel’s beauty demands she risk that safety with song. The tightening is singular but sufficient for 800 words; cost is implied (she can never reclaim pure silence) yet not viscerally felt on the page, capping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulated texture rather than declaration: silence≠absence, art needs both hush and breath. Final image of “whispering gleam” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the broken halo—once a circle of worship, now a fragment of calling—charges the ending with earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: selective attention to wood grain, brass temperature, throat muscles. Syntax lengthens during discovery, shortens at the sung release, mirroring inhale/exhale. No head-hop; diction remains within plausible carpenter vocabulary. One register wobble—“conceptual repricing” territory in “silence as possibility”—is brief enough to waive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: “ghost-scent of sawdust and greasepaint” does three jobs in five words. Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern; no filter-verb clusters. One mixed metaphor—“mist hung differently”—is forgivable in an otherwise clean, read-aloud texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Abandoned circus train plus mute artisan risks nostalgia cliché, but specificity of carousel-carpenter craft, halo fragment as sacred shard, and the hush-to-song pivot transform the trope into a fresh meditation on art’s necessary rupture. Stakes remain intimate, not grandiose, preserving credibility.</comment>
