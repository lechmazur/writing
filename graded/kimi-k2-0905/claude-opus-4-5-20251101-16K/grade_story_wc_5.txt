<question>1</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interiority is richly embodied—patience “settle into her muscles,” heart-rhythm as compass—but we never glimpse a contradictory impulse that could rupture her stoic calm; the sole micro-choice (pressing palm to plate) merely consummates what she already rehearsed for three years, so the cost feels pre-paid rather than freshly forged under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: starlight, orchard detritus, and heartbeat cohere into a final map image that reweights meaning; closure is a Charged Poise—Maren stands at the mouth of the path, options crystallized, cost legible in the matched pulse—causality intact, no orientation debt, pattern taught by 25 % and paid off in the final scatter of seeds.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment and body function as one instrument: frost-blackened bark dictates the ritual’s geometry, crater rim frames the sky as liquid mirror, copper plate becomes micro-setting that charges the final image; sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s alchemist eye—she notices refraction before temperature, seed-spiral before horizon—so setting constrains every gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover grandmother’s resting pulse—tightens once when starlight pooled on the princess-path reveals the subterranean X; the price is three years of wintered solitude already spent, but the live choice is the forward step onto a map she cannot unread, foreclosing retreat to surface stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as cartography of devotion: love is not declaration but patient transcription of another’s beat onto terrain; the orchard’s trash becomes constellation, the princess-path becomes ventricle, so the final image re-prices abandonment as aperture—no moral, only the cost of knowing where the heart continues without you.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice owns a compressed, glacial rhythm—long noun clauses, brittle consonants, sparse finite verbs—that mirrors permafrost temporality; diction stays within Maren’s alchemical lexicon (“flash-paper,” “filtered starlight”) without slipping into textbook tone; no head-hop, no filter-verb clusters; final sentence exhales into elegiac cadence that recharges “withered orchard” from opening.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free: one paraphrase loop (“waited three years” vs “three years of work”) is minor; figurative layering is sparse and coherent—bone-white limbs, bruised twilight, starlight as liquid silver—no mixed metaphors; high information density; paragraph cuts clean; opening and closing lines book-end with mirror-image scatter.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy as cardiac telemetry, starlight as solvent for grief, orchard detritus as Ouija board; no prior tale fuses these; risk in quiet climax—map appears, not dragon—pays off because the accreted texture makes stillness feel violent; specificity of “flash-paper alchemist” and “subarctic crater” locks premise beyond generic swap.</comment>
