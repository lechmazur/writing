<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet, pattern-seeking nature is consistently embodied through her photographic “arc” practice; the final self-shot image of townspeople raising hands shows her agency crystallized. Yet the interior contradiction promised by “subtle puzzle archivist” never surfaces as an on-page dilemma—she never misreads an arc or pays a visible cost for her calm, so the arc feels observed rather than struggled through. The trait “perceptively calm” is repeatedly labeled but never tested by error or emotional spillover, keeping motivation static. Closure still lands with communal cost felt, so characterization stays strong if not quite 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: photograph juxtapositions build toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal reversals. Closure is cleanly earned—the matching 1952 / present raised-hand photographs reweight grief into shared survival under visible lavender sky, satisfying Charged Poise. Transitions stay legible across two time-shards (archive afternoon + Sunday crowd memory). Orientation is clear by line 5; no caps triggered. Persistent constraint visible: factory ruin and archive shed literalize that pain memory is inescapable yet workable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lavender field and rusting factory operate as one charged micro-setting whose evolution (seeds → purple bloom → vines threading beams) directly mirrors communal healing, constraining Sunday ritual space. Sensory specifics—“orange skeleton,” “purple blooms bend like witnesses”—are selective, POV-filtered, and woven through action. Spatial choreography holds: shed at field edge, townspeople walk ruins then gather inside, camera positioned for final shot. Environment neither stalls nor repeats; every reference advances the arc motif or communal gesture. Tool-as-setting (dove-gray case) handled twice, recharged in final closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute collective pain into visible connection—announced early and escalates via accumulating photograph pairings that foreclose anonymity: each new arc match tightens the communal proof. No external antagonist; pressure is cognitive/emotional intensification. Visible price: ruined factory remains, grief unpaid but reconfigured; townspeople must keep returning to keep meaning alive, which is felt as ongoing labor. One meaningful tightening at the self-shot crowd image that rhymes with 1952 opener, crystallizing shared endurance. Agency sits with Mira’s curatorial choices; escalation sufficient for 600-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of communal healing emerges through iterated gesture recognition rather than assertion; final matched photographs supply resonant non-verbal answer. Subtext lives in silent arm angles—same shape across decades—implying grief is both unique and inherited. No moralizing line tells reader what to feel; instead the lavender sway and child’s laugh invite contemplation. Arc motif recurs with shifting emotional charge, satisfying requirement without checklist feel. Complexity acknowledged: factory still crumbles, pain not erased but re-inscribed as shared art.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Close-third voice maintains consistent calm, slightly lyrical distance matching Mira’s temperament; perceptual filter notices curves, smoke loops, rope parabolas—character-specific. Syntax is controlled, rhythm modulates between long contemplative sentences and tight image pings (“Seeds from an old garden, perhaps”). No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect thought clean; no filter-verb clutter. Psychic distance stable; no head-hop. Final “she smiled at the symmetry” is brief internal access, well-placed. Voice distinct enough for 8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose shows high information density: each sentence layers external observation with thematic echo (“threads of smoke… threads of vines”). Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Clause variety strong; scant repetition. Minor scaffold in repeated “arcs” but motif justifies pattern. No grammar lapses, clean paragraphing. Opening anchors stakes; closing line recharges lavender + laughter image. Ear test passes—read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional crests. Could trim two adjectives (“impossibly, beautifully”) but artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of post-industrial ruin converted to communal photo-therapy feels fresh; lavender erupting behind rust is evocative yet grounded. Arc-gesture linkage across black-and-white photos offers non-obvious structural spine. Transformation test: names/places swapped but identical gesture thesis would remain, so freshness partial. Risk evident in lyric accumulation pattern, but closure keeps payoff legible. Avoids sentimentality through concrete specifics (cold shed table, red thread). Slight echo of “memento as healing” trope keeps score just below 8.5.</comment>
