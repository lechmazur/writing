<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s “grim optimist” tag is shown, not told, through the climb and dice ritual; the interior contradiction is dramatized in her notebooks vs. the kiss pressed to the flawed die. The Marcus memory is embodied (warm palm, kitchen light) and her final step re-opens that specific door, so renunciation is earned with visible cost. Micro-choices—counting steps, rolling, pushing the wall—track a clear hierarchy of values. Only slight hedge: “balancedly daring” is named once without fresh embodiment in the rupture beat itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the staircase keeps spinning, but Vera’s step-through crystallizes a before/after with undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral micro-variations → notebook pattern → 847,293-step heartbeat → rupture, each layer tightening without causal turns. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“time here was meaningless”) so disorientation serves, not harms, the ending. Cost is legible in the final image: she chooses the rain-wet kitchen over eternal ascent, the dice pressed to lips as toll.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is never described in bulk; instead, the chipped die and marble step #847,293 function as micro-setting that literally shapes the rupture. Spatial choreography is flawless—hand on wall, step count, spiral curvature measured—so environment constrains tactics. Sourceless light and motion without decay create credible otherworld rules learned through observation, not exposition. Final image reuses the kitchen light through the rupture, recharging the setting’s built-in metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape versus acceptance—signals early (“she sought the rupture”). Escalation is the accumulative discovery of the 847,293-step heartbeat; each measurement tightens the same stake rather than introducing new external threats. Protagonist agency drives every beat: count, roll, calculate, push. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: abandoning immortality for one mortal chance to speak unsaid words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: dice flaw = irreversible past; staircase = self-inflicted repetition; rupture = choice to accept imperfection. No moral statement—final image is silence and light, not sermon. The question “What would you choose?” is dramatized, not articulated, until the instant she steps through. Counter-readings linger: is the staircase punishment or gift? Complexity stays intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual bias—mathematical exactitude, light quality on marble, the specific warmth of remembered palms. Syntax mirrors her mind: clauses accumulate like equations (“curvature…frequency…heartbeat”). Chipped die returns as tactile prayer, not symbol. No head-hopping; unreliability is impossible since world rules are external to her. Voice modulates under stress—“her heart—that still worked”—without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no paraphrase clusters. Sentence rhythm accelerates during proof discovery, then fragments at rupture: “She pushed.” Information density high—one line slips in backstory, stakes, and sensory cue (“dice, nervous habit, chip happened”). Metaphors are sparse, integral: “rupture opened like a wound in fabric” fits textile logic of infinite staircase. Final line lands with image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Infinite-staircase afterlife is familiar trope, but mathematical proof as crucible and chipped die as literal key are fresh inflections. Synthesis: Escher topology + grief equation = conceptual repricing. Risk taken: no antagonist, no clock, yet pressure accrues via pattern; payoff justifies gamble. Specificity prevents generic template—847,293 steps, counter-edge chip, kitchen light quality—so transformation test passes.</comment>
