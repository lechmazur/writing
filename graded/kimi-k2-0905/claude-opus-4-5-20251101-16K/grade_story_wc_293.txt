<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her father’s silence, the dust on the fiddle—and her decision to “sculpt possibility” is embodied in the final bridge-song. Yet the contradictory impulse (grief vs. re-opening) is asserted more than dramatized mid-scene; the photograph triggers recognition but no micro-choice that costs her anything on the spot. The earned shift is present, but the emotional risk is stated (“hands shook”) rather than enacted. Still, the occupation and perceptual signature individuate her above the lyrical average.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shard-mosaic (hitchhiker vanish → photograph → bridge song) lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Margaret’s survival reweights Mira’s “never,” crystallized in the trestle’s answering hum. Accumulative lens holds: each fragment intensifies the stake of what-can-be-crossed. Causality stays coherent because the photograph is offered and accepted, not explained. Cost is legible—“shared” weight lighter, music now carrying the secret—meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mountain pullout, disused trestle, and glass flake micro-settings all filter through Mira’s sensorium (half-inch boot prints, emulsion gleam). The trestle’s harmonic response turns setting into active witness, constraining her final action and charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean: crouch, pocket, bow on strings, all tracked. Weather and scale remain sketch-level but sufficient for the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving “never” is a lie—tightens when the photograph’s secret reweights Mira’s vocation. One meaningful deepening: the flake moves from relic to mandate, forcing the bridge song that externalizes the stake. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-oppositional, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. Felt cost is the inheritance of Margaret’s fragility, now borne in Mira’s music.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via image pattern (bridges, fragments, pixelation) rather than statement: healing is partial, transmissible, never whole. Subtext of “luminous disbelief” is recharged when the trestle itself vibrates with unengineered harmonics—possibility exceeding design. No moralizing; the ending image leaves the secret alive in wind. Ambiguity is purposeful: we never learn Margaret’s fate, only that someone once saw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: bridge-song fiddler notices cable hum, gravel give, emulsion gleam—details another POV couldn’t weight. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing (cadenced repetition, breath-length paragraphs). No head-hopping; unreliability never claimed, so knowledge bounds hold. Voice modulates from hush of vanish to bowed crescendo without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lines carry double duty (description + emotional calculus) and rhythm breathes with the bow strokes. One paraphrase loop: “not walked away…not fled…vanished” is purposeful intensification, not artifact. Occasional lyrical uplift (“pixelated amnesty”) risks purple but stays anchored to the speculative premise. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors cohere around light/sound/void.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing Victorian glass fragment with digital metaphor of pixelation feels fresh; the ghost-hitchhiker as courier of partial forgiveness reframes familiar roadside-encounter trope. Conceptual risk (lyric ghost story inside musician portrait) is taken without losing clarity. Could swap names, but the specific synthesis of bridge music + archival photo + glitch-vanish would collapse. Slight echo of “message from vanished stranger” trope keeps it just under 9.</comment>
