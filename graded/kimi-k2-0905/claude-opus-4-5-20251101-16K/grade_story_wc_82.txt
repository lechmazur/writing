<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s grief is embodied in tactile craft; every micro-choice—polishing a gem, releasing a crane—carries a visible cost. The interior contradiction between illegal dream-theft and maternal love keeps her decisions sharp. Closure lands in earned stasis: she accepts the luminous torment because it is the only remaining communion with Lia. No competence overload; struggle is felt in trembling hands and failed first crane.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each polished gem and folded crane deepens the pattern of substitution—dreams for memory, paper for flesh—until the final image crystallizes the trade-off. Orientation is taught immediately through the inverted gravity of “descending while ascending.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the basilica above, garden below, Mira suspended in a grief she refuses to relinquish; cost is the inexhaustible labor of sustaining a ghost. No causal plot holes; every loop of ritual tightens the stake.</comment>

<comment>The glass basilica’s shadow detaching is not backdrop but timepiece; it triggers archive access and constrains Mira’s nightly trespass. Tea plants, lantern frame, and core-mined sapphires are handled, not catalogued. Spatial physics of the isle govern her literal descent into memory as she climbs. Final image re-uses the floating crucible of “ascend to sink” to charge the closing stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep Lia perceptible—tightens through each illegal harvest: every gem reduces the archive supply and risks priestly detection. No external antagonist appears, but the internal pressure of “perhaps enough dreams=complete child” escalates the impossible calculus. Coincidence is absent; risk accrues by her own hand. Cost is cumulative: each lantern increases the weight of memory she must carry up the hill while already sinking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as substitution as salvation: paper birds for a body, captured dreams for a future. Luminous torment is never moralized; the story lets the reader feel the unethical beauty of her refusal to let grief finish. Final line reweights “ascending” as emotional permanence rather than physical motion. No thesis statement; meaning is borne by the image of cranes circling a crystal spire.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person clings to Mira’s tool-centric perception: “her fingers knew the work,” “gem pulsed with interior dawn.” Syntax lengthens during polishing, contracts during theft, mirroring her vigilance. No head-hop; priests and Lia remain externally seen. The elevated register is earned by the basilica’s liturgical atmosphere and sustained without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned: every gem-as-water, shadow-as-twin serves the substitution motif. No mixed metaphors; “frozen prayer” and “luminous torment” coexist in the same metaphysical register. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for ascent, clipped releases for cranes. One paraphrase loop detected (“descending while ascending” restated) yet it functions as incantatory rather than slack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines grief-horizon with dream-craft liturgy in a configuration that feels inevitable yet unseen before. Inverting altitude as burial depth turns a conceit into lived physics. Risk is taken in real-time ritual pacing rather than event plot, and coherence is maintained. Could not transplant to another world without collapsing the emotional engine.</comment>
