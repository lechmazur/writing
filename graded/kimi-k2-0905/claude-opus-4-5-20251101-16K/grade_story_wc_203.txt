<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Marcus’s ghost-seeing is a quiet given, never tested or complicated; his decision to lift Victor’s guilt is soft, not wrung through contradiction. The “weightless burden” line is clean, but interiority stays at a calm remove—no moment where seeing ghosts costs him anything visible. Earned stasis is credible, yet the cost is conceptual rather than embodied. Characterization is strong for the length, but lacks a micro-choice that cuts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: ghost clue → ladder → mainspring → Victor freed. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus pockets the barrel, the ceiling’s secret leaves with him, weight lifts. Cost is conceptual but legible: he becomes the ferryman of evidence. One causal tightening is sufficient; no loopholes or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Ticket-office dust, clown-face cracks, and “panel seventeen” give tactile anchors that guide the final reach. The mainspring itself becomes micro-setting—its brass gleam charges the last image. Spatial choreography is clean: ladder, tile, elevator shaft tracked without drift. Environment constrains the choice to reach, not just observe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the dead by removing evidence—tightens once when Marcus decides to take the barrel. Pressure is situational: ghosts watch, guilt thickens, but no new obstacle escalates. Cost is conceptual rather than tactical; options narrow only in the moral ledger. Sufficient for length, but a second turn or tangible risk would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: ceilings hide evidence of human failure; removing the object reweights guilt. The cracked-paint image threads through without overt symbol-speak. Ending reprises “weightless” as earned stasis—no moralizing, just a lighter walk out. Subtext stays in gesture and object, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is steady, technician-calibrated, with quiet metaphor (“steel coffin in the wall”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Marcus notices dust, lath, spring teeth. No head-hop; ghost speech is external, framed as dialogue. Rhythm breathes with the fluorescents’ buzz, then tightens on the ladder climb.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Clean, varied sentence rhythms; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Information density high—“the skeleton that held up the smile” compresses facade theme in one stroke. Technical terms (lath, joist, mainspring) are accurate and motivated. Opening and final lines anchor and release with image, not summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of elevator tech and ghost ferrying feels fresh; horologist strongman arsonist is a skewed, specific past. Cracks-in-faade concept literalized as ceiling tile is elegant, not gimmicky. Risk is quiet rather than bold, keeping score sub-9. Transformation test passes—swap Marcus’s job and the story collapses.</comment>
