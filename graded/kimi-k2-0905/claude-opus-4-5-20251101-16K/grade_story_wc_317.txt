<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is textured—her tactile turning of the seed, the way exile “pooled like water”—and her decision to plant-and-sketch lands as a renunciation with cost. Yet the “notably receptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; we never see her fail or be surprised by her own openness. The micro-choice to slip the sketch under her own door crystallizes values, but the absence of live opposition keeps the crucible cooler than high-band requires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean CR: the corpse-flower seed and riddle re-weight exile from damage to collaboration, with conceptual cost—she abandons reactive hiding and commits to a years-long, possibly futile cultivation. Causal chain holds: each envelope escalates mystery → corporate sabotage supplies rot → riddle reframes rot as compost → sketch = answer. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; single-scene default met. No meaningful setback or visible price is felt on the page beyond “years to bloom,” keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Brook, mist, and cabin are filtered through Maren’s puzzle-designer eye (“lamplight turned the paper amber”), and the damp threshold cues the seed’s viability. Weather-storm silence modulates from menace to invitation, mirroring her shift. The brook’s continual flow supplies the final Charged Poise image but never constrains a tactical choice; it decorates more than it governs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—innovation space vs. corporate erasure—is clear early. Pressure tightens once: riddle re-weights reputation-rot into creative soil, narrowing her options from flight to collaboration. Cost is conceptual (years, possible failure) rather than viscerally felt. No live antagonist means escalation is intellectual, adequate for this length but not high-band intense.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—destruction as generative medium—emerges through seed, riddle, and her sketch without sermon. The corpse-flower’s decay-to-bloom motif reconfigures exile from loss to incubator, resonating in the final image of the brook that “keeps its own counsel.” Ambiguity remains: correspondent may still be corporate bait, preserving complexity.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Maren’s puzzle-solving perception; syntax is deliberate, clauses fitting together like locks (“orthogonality,” “spectacular and temporary flowering”). No dialogue to test, but free-indirect rhythm holds. Compression in the storm-born silence paragraph is taught early and paid off in cadence shift at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“silence pooled like water”). One scaffold loop: “she had felt hunted / she had not felt obsolete” restates without new pressure. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph could trim two adjectives without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The escape-room artist receiving an inverse puzzle via impossible seeds is fresh; corporate sabotage reframed as horticulture collaboration feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific botanical constraints (decades to bloom, carrion scent) charge the metaphor. Risk—making a static exile story hinge on patience rather than confrontation—pays off through conceptual repricing.</comment>
