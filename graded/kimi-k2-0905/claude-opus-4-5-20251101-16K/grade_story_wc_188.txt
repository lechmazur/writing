<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is anchored to embodied ritual—chanting, handling fuses, the rag knot against her heart—so contradictions feel lived, not declared. The final turn from grief to stubborn creation is prefigured by every tactile beat; cost is palpable as she sacrifices the keepsake rag to ignite the first rocket. Minor slip: “understand” is asserted twice without dramatized failure. Still, motivation scales cleanly to the 750-word frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rocket bloom reconfigures night’s meaning and the rag’s sacrifice makes cost visible. Causal chain—note → rocket → light → memory etched—holds without gaps; even the starless sky is recruited as constraint, not backdrop. Orientation is secure by line 6; no lens drift. Accumulation cap does not apply; ending is untouched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fortress flora and dripping fountain tesserae are filtered through Mira’s pyrotechnician eye—strontium-red, copper-blue—so setting constrains tool choice and final palette. Micro-setting (kerosene rag) charges the closure image when it becomes fuse tinder. Spatial track is clean; no white-room moments. One decorative clause (“roses conquered siege towers”) barely risks overwrite.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“make light anyway” against starless grief—tightens once via the mosaic command; options narrow to ignite or retreat. Protagonist agency drives every beat: she walks, kneels, unpacks, sacrifices rag, fires. Cost is materially burned up; pressure coherent under causal lens. No reversal needed; single deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of fortress-to-garden and war-to-creation; no character moralizes. Final gold bloom reframes earlier chant fragments into collaborative hymn with the dead. Ambiguity is conserved: victory is not healing but iterative defiance. Echo of “make light anyway” in last paragraph is earned by mosaic inscription and sacrifice, not tacked on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Mira’s sensory orbit—chemical salts, kerosene ghost, gravel rhythm—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens during ambient filter, then tightens into staccato match-strikes, mirroring rocket fuse. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Register stays within artisanal diction; lyric elevation is justified by ritual stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long inhale (“wisteria cascaded…”) to clipped sparks (“She struck another match…”), propelling without scaffold. Figurative load is high but patterned early, paid off in golden cascade. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. A single adverbial flag (“beautifully”) could prune, yet does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Pyrotechnic grief ritual inside a flower-choked siege ruin synthesizes fresh imagery while honoring archetype of art versus despair. Note-in-mosaic device flirts with trope but gains new charge as instruction manual for living. Rag-as-fuse repurposes memento into accelerant—inevitable yet surprising. Risk is present but coherence intact; no gimmickry.</comment>
