<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction is vivid—duty to silence vs hunger for release—and every bell-pull is a micro-choice that visibly drains her. The inherited amber sheet externalizes ancestry-pressure, and the final tearful collapse shows earned cost. Still, the beat sequence is slightly front-loaded; mid-scene her agency plateaus until the synchronicity with the far-off chisel re-energizes the arc. A hair more middle friction would push this to 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure is unmistakable: the “different silence” is an Earned Stasis that costs the faded sheet and Elara’s exhaustion. Accumulative lens holds—each bell layers color/wonder until the cavern’s architecture of hush inverts. Causality is clean: grandmother → sheet → bells → aurora conduit → world-release. No teleporting props; the chisel synchronicity is set up by the notation itself, paid off on-page.</comment>

<comment>Ice cavern functions as both crucible and resonator: frost ropes, crystalline walls, translucent ceiling refract aurora into choice-forcing color. The body-as-setting is equally precise—sheet pressed to sternum, fingers numbing, final lullaby of cold settling “into her bones.” Spatial choreography never drifts; each bell rope is located and tracked. Environment constrains every action; remove the cavern and the synesthetic mechanics collapse.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—liberate wonder without destroying the cavern—signals early and tightens with each bell: the hush literally fractures, narrowing options to continue or abort. Escalation is textural (density of color-sound) rather than causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. Visible price: sheet bleeds to blank, aurora rips upward, Elara’s knees give. A second reversal mid-line would secure 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through sensory parabolas—wonder as oxygen, not luxury—never sermonized. The final image of anonymous strangers blindsided by color reframes prior “efficient gray world” without moral tag. Marginalia annotations act as buried thematic seeds that bloom once the ink vanishes. Ambiguity lingers: will wonder be hoarded again? Complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains synesthetic perceptual signature throughout—every hue carries timbre only Elara hears. Rhythm swells and ebbs with bell-strokes; syntax grows longer as color stacks, then fractures into fragments at release. No head-hop; aurora and distant chisel stay externally filtered through her body. Compression (“oscillating repose”) is taught early and repaid in the final lullaby line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence mirrors bell resonance—sentences lengthen, contract, pause. Figurative language is dense but patterned (color = sound) and pays off in closure. No mixed metaphors; “wonder peeled away...like insects in amber” is precise. Occasional elevated diction (“geometries,” “conceptual”) fits the elevated ritual tone; no loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of synesthesia + bell-ringing + aurora conduit feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist. The “sculpted hush” reframed as load-bearing architecture gives familiar ice-cavern a new structural rule. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens awe without obscuring stakes. Could push 9+ with a sharper mid-scene pivot.</comment>
