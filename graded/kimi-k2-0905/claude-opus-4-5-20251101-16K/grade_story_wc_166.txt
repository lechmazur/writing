<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vesna’s longing and practiced exile ground every micro-choice; her refusal to hollow herself compels the defiant tattooing. Cael’s submitted body crystallizes the stakes of remembrance. The moment she names his next act “fledge,” the bond shifts from service to mutual insurgency, costing her solitude and risking his life—cost is felt on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“muscle and bone and breath”) without label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: exile → client → tattoo → fledge → renewed dance. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses personal safety, accepting perpetual risk “one puncture at a time” while the garden remains outside time’s jurisdiction—cost and constraint explicit in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Garden pulses with phosphorescent blooms keyed to heartbeat, embedding setting inside Vesna’s perception. Moonstone dust and bone needle micro-settings constrain technique and cost. Spatial choreography clean: moss, gate, knee-morton order track steadily. Final sway under stars recharges the place as sanctuary and trap, feeding the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory against state erasure—announced early and tightened when Vesna decides to tattoo a living “library.” Agency evident in every puncture; no outside rescue. One meaningful deepening: communion returns, rooting her into earth while expanding skyward, narrowing option of anonymity. Cost legible: garden now magnet for future rebels, perpetual exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of unkillable memory emerges through bodily inscription rather than statement. Subtext in garden’s “perpetual dusk” mirrors outlawed nostalgia. Final image of outlaw dance reweights ban as farce, achieved without sermon. Particulars (tide, moonstone, obsidian mortar) accrue into cosmic defiance, inviting reflection on body-as-archive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains twilight cadence; diction (“obsidian mortar,” “ancestral water”) stays within Vesna’s artisan-mystic lexicon. Compression taught early—“gaps... where darkness held its breath”—and paid off in final sway. Dialogue minimal, natural, goal-driven. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during communion without rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; strong verbs propel. Some metaphor density in garden description but patterned and justified. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Tiny copy glitch: “dust speck caught” could imply unattached participle, yet context saves clarity. Clause sequencing clear; final line lands with resonant brevity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Memory-smuggling via tattooed stardust feels fresh and inseparable from this world. State prohibition on nostalgia is simple yet escalated through dancer physiology, avoiding abstraction. “Fledge” as transitive verb for human weaponization is inventive. Transformation test: remove tide heritage or moonstone and plot collapses, confirming synthesis.</comment>
