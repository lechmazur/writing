<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured through stained fingers, the whisk’s curved tines, the patient decoding of fireflies—concrete, vocational, earned. Dao’s “demure audacity” is shown once (gentle questioning) but never put under pressure; he remains a receptive mirror rather than a crucible. The transfer of stewardship lands as quiet renunciation, cost felt in the empty space she will leave, yet the apprentice’s own contradiction is never activated. Still, the protagonist’s lifetime of invisible labor is dramatized in body and tool, satisfying the 9- quick test for embodied contradiction and earned pass-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: firefly lesson → recognition → succession, each beat because/therefore. Orientation anchored by word 80 with parapet, rain, tar-stained fingers. Closure is Earned Stasis: Mira forecloses the path of public recognition, bequeathing the hidden labor to Dao; cost visible in “when I am gone” and the silent whisk-circle over empty space. No causal break, no lens drift; persistent constraint (invisibility) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Parapet, wet stone, moonlit rice paddies, and the bamboo whisk form a micro-setting that actively filters sound and light—whispers travel, moon paths guide, fireflies answer. Rain-slick stone constrains Dao’s climb and amplifies voices, charging the final silence. The whisk’s worn tines and glistening parapet return in the last image, re-weighted from tool to torch of inheritance. Environment and object together constrain every beat; 9- gate cleared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Dao see the hidden pattern and accept the invisible vocation? Pressure tightens once when Mira directs his gaze to the oak-firefly exchange—recognition becomes the decisive narrowing. No external antagonist; conflict is attention versus habitual beauty. Cost is legible: Mira surrenders centrality, Dao accepts perpetual anonymity. One meaningful turn suffices under causal lens; could have used a sharper tactical price on Dao to reach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the value of labor that holds the world together without applause. Subtext lives in the whispered mother-child voices below, the unseen net-knots, the fireflies’ wordless choreography. Final image of circular whisk in humid air reweights “hidden effort” without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; no character states the thesis aloud. Complexity acknowledged in Mira’s simultaneous pride and erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual signature—selective attention to mesh, moon, insect pulses. Diction is maritime-philosophical yet grounded: “tar-stained fingers,” “scintillatingly somber,” never drifting into textbook abstraction. Rhythm mirrors tea whisk: circular, patient, then a quick lift at firefly recognition. No head-hop; Dao’s interior accessed only through observable shift in face. Voice distinct and sustained under the final quiet image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean and musical; sentences vary, no template cadence. Figurative layer is spare—foam from stillness, moon as ribbon—each image tied to tool or motion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed register moment: “conceptual repricing” caliber phrase absent; instead “simply are what they are” borders platitude but is saved by context of firefly dance. Otherwise high density, zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: vocational net-mending as epistemology, firefly Morse code as pedagogy, moonlit stones as syllabus. Stakes are inverted—recognition is refused, not sought—avoiding guru cliché. Whisk-handoff reprises orbit/net/spiral pattern, making device feel inevitable. Risk is quietness rather than spectacle; transformation resides in attention itself. Not earth-shattering but particular and memorable.</comment>
