<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—clinical observer vs. jealous survivor—remains vivid and embodied; the envy toward past selves is dramatized in the cabin beats, not labeled. Micro-choice (deciding to hike back to the grave) crystallizes values and costs. The “jaded wonder” refrain edges toward diagnostic shorthand but is saved by the final image of reciprocal watching. Earned Stasis qualifies: she accepts perpetual fracture with visible fatigue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the simultaneous selves watching each other reweight the premise with undeniable ontological cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of scroll-writing → fire-gaze → dream-soar tightens the nostalgia stake without causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 4; no debt. One shard, single POV, one deepening—sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cabin, stove, frost window, and birch scroll function as micro-setting that constrains action: the scroll must be rolled, the fire must be fed, the window triggers the dream-pull. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—pine resin, star salt—never tourist list. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Object-states (rolled scroll beside cot) persist. Final star image recharges earlier “spilled salt” with conceptual cost, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether narrative can tame feral nostalgia—tightens once: clinical writing fails, dream-soar becomes inevitable. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens: each return to scroll/fire increases density until jealousy is irreversible. No false escalation; coincidence absent. Cost legible in the exhausted acceptance of eternal self-fragmentation. Could use one more tactile forfeiture (ink runs out, etc.) to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the impossibility of narrativizing simultaneity. No thesis statements; final image of mutual watching offers resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity remains fertile—reader must decide which Mira pays the cost. Avoids moralizing; complexity honored. One hairline slip: “jaded wonder” tagged twice, nearly echoing thesis, but context keeps it character-bound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: scientific timestamps vs. salt-scatter stars, “feral nostalgia” as lived ache. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences contract to staccato “She soared into sleep.” No head-hopping; distance stable. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Final lyric lift taught by earlier dream vocabulary. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer dense but patterned—fire, salt, flight—each returns with shifted weight, avoiding purple drift. One mixed metaphor hazard (“narrative writing itself through her dreaming mind”) but meaning survives. Information density high; every paragraph advances stance or atmosphere. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lucid-dream trope refreshed by chronicler who envies her own past iterations; stakes internal yet globally felt. Birch-scroll method and grave-date paradox integrate into emotional engine rather than garnish. Risky second-person glimpse at end pays off via earlier pattern. Specific detail (birch bark timestamps) prevents swapability. Not quite 9+ because concept’s scifi bones remain recognizable beneath lyrical skin.</comment>
