<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—protect Lila from her damage vs. admit shared fear—are dramatized in the tactile handling of cast and coral; the final embrace is earned because the decrypted notes force the choice to stop hiding. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the brief “shared anxieties” phrase flirts with diagnosis, but it is immediately re-embodied in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to “trace the scars together” crystallizes with the felt cost of relinquishing the lone-bearer identity. Causal chain holds—coral carried, cast decrypted, stance shifted—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image of loosened knot and spoken “brave one.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: vapor softens sound so the mother can hear her own pulse, glass ceiling bruises light to mirror internal contusion, and the cast-as-object becomes the terrain she navigates. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through translator’s eye for detail. Environment constrains the final choice—privacy in public space allows the whispered admission. Meets 9+ gate: setting charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Maya keep hiding her trauma or risk mutual vulnerability—tightens once when the smudged notes foreclose the option of secrecy. Pressure grows accumulatively: each sensory detail adds density until the decrypted words force the stance shift. Cost is visible in the loosened knot and the spoken endearment that stakes the new contract. Sufficient for 600-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: intergenerational fear can become intergenerational scaffolding if the wound is shared rather than concealed. Subtext resides in the coral fragment—first a solitary talisman, finally a shared relic pressed into two palms. No explicit moral; resonance is carried by the image of mother and daughter breathing together in mist. Final whisper reweights all prior hiding without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Maya’s perceptual signature—translator’s habit of decrypting, tactile recall of palm-frond baskets, synesthetic bruise-light. Syntax lengthens under emotion, then fractures into short beats at the reveal. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully. Dialogue is minimal but voice-distinct: “Hey, brave one” carries subtextual contract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: metaphoric bruise-light and lotus-hearted ache are fresh, not purple, and tied to POV’s sensory world. No loops, scaffold, or filter stacks. Sentence rhythm accelerates into the decryption beat, then exhales with the embrace. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge coral image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trauma-transmission plot is retooled through translator’s decryption skill and the child’s hidden cast-notes—an inversion that grants agency to the child’s gaze. Coral fragment as reversible relic (wound/heirloom) offers fresh inflection. Risk taken in quiet lyric closure pays off. Not revolutionary, but specificity makes the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
