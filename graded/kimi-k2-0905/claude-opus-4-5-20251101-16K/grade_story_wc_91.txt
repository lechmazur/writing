<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clutching the jars yet intuiting they must be released—stay active in scene. The final renunciation is earned: every prior coincidence links to her identity as conduit, so emptying the jars costs the only proof she mattered. Embodied detail (“weathered hands,” “soft green-gold light”) grounds interiority without therapy-speak. Only the child-interlocutor remains a functional cipher, keeping relational pressure one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each jar, moon-alignment, and lava thread layers density until the release reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara sits “empty-handed at last,” cost legible in the erased glow that once defined her. Causality is interior but coherent: because she believes nothing is accidental, therefore she gives the light away. Orientation anchor (“black sand beach,” two moons) arrives by line 6; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Volcano, twin moons, and warm black sand are tactile and specific; the beach’s heat against skin later cools with the lava-gentled flow, mirroring internal relinquishment. Jars function as micro-setting, constraining choice until the moment of unscrewing. Spatial track stays clean: fisherman departs, child appears/vanishes, Mara walks a single axis toward the slope. Environment never stalls action; each descriptor either reflects or enables the offering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she keep or surrender her last proof of purpose?”—tightens once when the child names the mountain’s hunger, forcing an either/or. Micro-turn: spiral of freed bugs visibly softens lava, proving the offering works and foreclosing retreat. Cost is the emptied satchel, felt immediately. Accumulative lens accepts the child as situational pressure rather than causal antagonist; escalation is a single deepening rather than a chain of reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transformation-through-relinquishment emerges organically from the jar motif and lava metamorphosis; no editorial sermonizing. Final image (“single lightning bug…in farewell”) reweights the premise: letting go is itself a new form of holding. Subtext in child’s gnomic lines carries mythic resonance without explication. Theme stays implicit, inviting counter-readings—miracle, self-delusion, or both—yet lands with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “universe moved through her like breath through a hollow reed” is idiosyncratic, not generic mysticism. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then clips—“Light,” the child said simply—under sudden pressure. No head-hopping; child’s interior remains opaque, maintaining distance. Rhythm modulates with volcanic rumble and surf, reinforcing hush without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “stone becoming liquid. Wealth becoming generosity.” packs three metaphors into five words without strain. No filter-verb clusters or synonym loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Occasional lyric repetition (“becoming”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in closure. One mixed image—“lava seemed to gentle”—is borderline personification but contextually justified.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of volcanic offering with bottled memory-insects feels fresh, not checklist folklore. Premise risks sentimental mystic-waif trope yet redeems it through concrete economic backstory (destitute after rebuilding a village she never saw). Final reconfiguration—that transformation is release, not acquisition—grows inevitably from the jar motif. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry obscures causality.</comment>
