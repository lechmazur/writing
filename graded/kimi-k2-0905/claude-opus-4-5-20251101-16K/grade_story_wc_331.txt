<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s eccentric interiority is vivid—her odd-hour rituals, scarf-dowsing, and grandmother-haunted motivation all feel lived-in. Yet the final beat (“she had found…now she only needed to decide”) summarizes rather than dramatizes the decisive cost; we see hope re-ignited but no contradictory impulse enacted in scene, so the arc lands as anticipation, not earned renunciation or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the seam’s discovery reweights years of obsession and the scarf’s accumulated “analog memories” now carry future risk. Causality holds under an accumulative lens—each library walk layers density until the fabric literally warms—but the beat stops at confirmation, not passage, so the cost is conceptual (missed opportunity) rather than viscerally felt; still, the before/after is legible and the lens remains coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Scientific Poetry Library is evoked with concrete, POV-filtered specifics—thermodynamic marginalia, spectrogram paper, non-Euclidean corners that lengthen one-way—so space actively mirrors Mira’s quest. The scarf micro-setting reappears with tactile reweighting (absorbs tears, grows warm), satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the final image; only the rain-streaked window feels generic, preventing the top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Stakes—find the narrative seam—are signaled early and tighten when the scarf warms, foreclosing her old pattern of endless mapping. Pressure escalates via accumulative density (each shift, each patron glance, each geodesic walk adds weight) rather than causal reversals; the cost is the now-undeniable obligation to cross, but because she defers the act, the price remains anticipatory, not yet paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—that stories possess physical mass and familial memory—emerges through patterned imagery (scarf, geometry, grandmother’s breath) rather than assertion. The ending reconfigures meaning: the library is no longer archive but portal, reweighting every prior shelf-walk as pilgrimage. Ambiguity remains (will passage erase her?), giving the concept moral heft without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person floats close to Mira’s math-poetic mind: syntax stretches with hyperbolic imagery then tightens at the seam. Perceptual signatures—“fluorescent lights hummed differently,” “analog memories”—are consistent and character-specific. No dialogue to test, but rhythmic control holds; occasional elevated diction (“hyperbolic fold,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly exceeds librarian lexicon yet reads as her internal shorthand, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One scaffold cluster—“they saw only…they didn’t see…perhaps thought”—slows the early patron paragraph; a mixed metaphor (“stories accumulated like sediment” versus textile scarf) fleetingly muddles the physics. Otherwise no loops, clean grammar, strong paragraph cuts; artifacts never touch the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “scientific-poetry library as dimensional archive” is a fresh synthesis, grounded in tactile specifics and matriarchal heirloom rather than concept for concept’s sake. Risk-taking—hyperbolic geometry as literal map—pays off without breaking causality. Minor echo of Borges/Calvino in the infinite-archive motif keeps it just shy of the 9-band, but the scarf-as-memory-needle transforms the trope into something intimate and irreproducible.</comment>
