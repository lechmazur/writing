<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is textured and consistent—her borrowed-time wound drives every micro-choice, culminating in the charged poise of placing the shard on her shelf. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however; the turn is reflective rather than embodied under pressure, keeping her just shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silo’s thickened time and her hidden-message network reweight the premise—witnessing becomes timekeeping. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early (green-glow residue, chronometers that measure density) and holds to the final honey-thick line with visible cost (“she would fade with them”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s crystallized walls provide a micro-setting that constrains every beat—light falls “soft and strange,” gauges read “heavy,” the shard catches glow each morning. Selective sensory detail (ceramic centuries, honey-pooling time) is filtered through Vera’s biased attention and charges the final image without ever stalling motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—time’s texture versus personal extinction—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when the cracked capsule literalizes decay. One meaningful tightening: the moment she decides to embed messages, trading secrecy for connection; cost is felt in the fading prognosis. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, sufficient under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation through attention, not measurement. Subtext resides in object handling—urn shard moved from “damaged” to “succeeded.” Final image reweights earlier material without moralizing: witnessing equals endurance, cost equals eventual fade. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Vera’s perceptual filter; diction (“borrowed-time herself,” “time pooled like honey”) is character-specific and rhythmic. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses calmly under pressure. Patterned elision (“Tuesday, though that word meant nothing”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual duty—information plus atmosphere—without scaffold. Metaphors remain physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“each one a gift she hadn’t earned” echoing “borrowed days”) is minor and does not dull closure. Rhythm accelerates into the final crystalline line, propelling exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Time-as-texture measured by gut-level gauges is a fresh angle; embedding elegiac messages inside garage-sale blurbs converts mundane commerce into covert memorial, a risk that pays off. The cracked cremation shard re-weights entropy into intimacy, a turn that feels inevitable only after it lands. Specificity throughout prevents generic “time is precious” triteness.</comment>
