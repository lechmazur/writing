<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Margot’s synesthesia and despair are anchored in vivid, embodied beats (amber streaks from floorboards, silver ribbons pulling her into the maze). Her micro-choice to trespass after-hours is credible, but the interior contradiction—declaring “I don’t need saving” seconds after admitting months of emptiness—feels performed rather than lived, slightly undercutting the earned turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the tarot coin’s warmth and sunrise colors reweight Margot’s stance from gray fog to “first stirring” of belief. The fracturing-maze logic is taught early (three states of the bench) and holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is felt in Celeste’s dissolution and Margot’s trembling hands at dawn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The maze’s impossible seasons (apples & pear snow) are specific, sensory, and character-filtered through synesthetic ribbons. The lantern that burns without oil and the coin’s paradoxical warmth constrain choices—both serve as tangible anchors that charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—Margot’s need to feel alive—tightens when the maze refuses the map and time fractures, raising the cost of pressing on. One meaningful deepening occurs at the orchard: seeing Celeste’s age-flickers forces Margot to confront her own vanishing self. The price (permanent loss of Celeste’s echoes) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: performance as lifeline, beauty as resistance. The final image—Margot walking toward sunrise with the coin—reprises the opening “dying applause” motif, now inverted into an encore of possibility. No moralizing; the reweighting is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly inside Margot’s synesthetic sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent (copper-honey voice, gold-violet aura). Rhythm modulates: short clauses under maze disorientation, longer lyrical cadence at orchard revelation. No head-hopping; Celeste’s dialogue carries subtextual urgency without explaining itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—silver ribbons, stage-snow petals—and never overwrought. One scaffold detected: “possibility never dies—it only waits” is a near-paraphrase of earlier “possibility from the brink of despair,” but it lands in the closure beat and is tolerable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic-ghost-orchard fusion feels fresh; the “fractured timeline as theater curtain call” is a non-obvious synthesis. Removing Celeste’s tarot coin or Margot’s color-sound gift would break the story’s engine. Risk-taking (impossible seasons, age-flicker ghost) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
