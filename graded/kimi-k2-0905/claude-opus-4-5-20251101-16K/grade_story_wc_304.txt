<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera’s motive—harvesting the last spark—is vivid and embodied; her tactile handling of the emerald and the body fuses vocation with yearning. Interiority stays specific to her trade (“reading the story written in every line”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page; she never questions or risks failure, so the beat never complicates. Still, her micro-choices (pressing the chip, releasing the body) scale precisely to the word count and carry visible, gentle cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the woman dissolves upward and the chip gains her spark—an irreversible, lyrical cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is internal and ritualized rather than plot-reversing, acceptable under the lyric mode declared from line 1. Orientation is taught early (who, where, when by line 4). No meaningful tightening or turn inside the ritual sequence keeps it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit grotto, frozen air, and crystalline walls are rendered through Vera’s task-directed eye; every sense note (humming light, warmth of the chip) immediately guides her next motion. The skyborne cavern functions as micro-setting—its open roof literally enables the final launch—charging the closure image. Selective, weight-bearing detail throughout; no static postcard blocks. Constraint could be sharper (grotto never fights back), halting just below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage the dying spark—is signaled early and held. Pressure is steady-state, not rising: the ritual proceeds as expected; no obstacle or cost escalation complicates Vera’s success. Under Accumulative lens, density increases (chip gains another soul) but options don’t narrow. One visible cost (body lost to sky, chip now heavier) is paid, meeting minimum escalation for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of reverent transience emerges through Vera’s gentle manipulations and the final fusion of body with aurora—never abstractly stated. Subtext resides in tactile detail: bread-dough memory, the chip’s warming glow. The ending reframes death not as defeat but as donated light, offering resonant ambiguity. No moralizing or echo phrases appear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person prose carries a hushed, ecclesiastic rhythm (parallel clauses, soft consonants) that matches “radiant hush.” Perceptual signature is controlled and particular: Vera notices color temperatures, hair texture, static patterns. No POV leakage; psychic distance stays close and consistent. Under peak pressure the diction compresses effectively (“She let her mind soften, becoming a vessel”). Distinct, sustained, near flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often paints setting, advances motion, and textures emotion. Rhythm modulates from long aurora ribbons to short ritual verbs. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; occasional elevated phrases (“architecture of a difficult life”) stay within Vera’s ceremonial register. Clean grammar and precise sequencing throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Beautician-mortician harvesting souls into heirloom crystal” is fresh, and the aerial burial inversion feels inevitable once taught. Concept marries cosmic aurora with intimate caregiving, generating specific images not seen before. Execution leans slightly on familiar “memory fragments into crystal” tropes but grounds them in tactile ritual. Bold lyric structure coheres, meriting high-band placement.</comment>
