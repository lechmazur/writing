<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—serenity after abandonment—lands early and embodies the story’s thematic hinge. Her micro-choice to invert the performer/audience roles is credibly seeded by the grandmother memory and the dome’s listening history. The “half-lit epiphany” is dramatized, not declared, via the stick’s warmth and her outward step. Cost is present but quiet (she forfeits control, faces possible failure), enough for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to surrender the stick reconfigures her artistic identity with felt cost. Causal chain—argument → reflection → inversion—holds under Accumulative lens; dome silence and stick history tighten the final stance. Orientation is clean within 120 words. The only drag is a brief expository cluster on “ethical storytelling” that slightly stalls escalation before the final turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dome’s stripped instrumentation and meteor-quiet function as micro-setting that constrains her listening stance; the stick’s char and symbols supply tactile specificity. Sensory triangulation—concrete floor, white shell, cool air—anchors without cataloging. Radar-origin detail is economical and filtered through her metaphor of “listening for what survives descent,” feeding closure. Setting never overruns the psychic action, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep controlling the narrative—is signaled in paragraph 4 and sharpened by Marcus’s accusation. The single deepening occurs when she reframes “reverse” from preaching to relinquishing the stick; options narrow to one risky circle show. Cost is conceptual but legible on-page: she abandons authorship. Pressure is coherent; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stick’s passage and the dome’s listening architecture rather than didactic statements. The final image—truths revealed “in pieces” and transformation living “in the spaces between knowing”——reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting the reader into the half-lit contract. Only the mid-paragraph definition of “ethical storytelling” edges toward thesis-speak, slightly blunting subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited retains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filters every object through Mira’s calligraphic precision (“precise brushwork into puppet shadows”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped final sentences for resolve. No head-hop or register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice carries the entire load—successfully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “meteor hush,” “white shell and the memory of listening.” No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances stance or atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent under the sky/listening motif. One stock phrase—“the irony wasn’t lost on her”—slips in; a fresher formulation would secure 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Puppet-questions in dive bars inside an abandoned radar dome is a fresh synthesis; reversal of performer into listener offers genuine reconfiguration. Cultural specificity (calligraphy → shadow puppets) grounds the concept. While “artist doubts method after fight” is familiar, the half-lit mechanic and communal stick lift it into memorable territory.</comment>
