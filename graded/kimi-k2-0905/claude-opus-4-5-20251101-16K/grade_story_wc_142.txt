<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to Council paycheck vs. sabotage via murals—are declared rather than enacted in scene; no moment shows her body fighting itself while painting or lying. The stone chip returns as talisman but never constrains a micro-choice; its “weight” is abstract. Still, her orderly trait visibly shapes the neat mural code, and the final “she painted” is a credible renunciation with felt cost under the hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: dawn mural finished, network mobilized, splinter still in pocket—cost is the perpetual duplicity she must keep living. Causal chain holds: Council acceleration → mural intel → raft reorganization, each because/therefore step tightening options. One minor scaffold: “They would not go quietly…” paragraph restates the stakes already shown. Under 800 words, one meaningful deepening is sufficient; lens stays causal-accumulative hybrid to the final image.</comment>

<comment>The perpetual carnival is evoked through motion-saturated detail—spinning lights, moving platforms, paint on swaying raft—rather than catalogue. Micro-setting (body pressed against cold platform, paint pot sliding) constrains the brush strokes and charges the final azure fish. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: narrowed to touch and sway under pressure, wider at calm dawn. Spatial choreography is flawless across seven hundred rafts; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—stopping privatization—is signaled early and escalates when timeline collapses to “within the month.” Protagonist agency drives every turn: she translates, then encrypts murals, then accelerates graffiti output; each action narrows her safety margin. Cost is legible: the splinter-in-heart line shows psychological price; dawn painting leaves her exhausted and exposed. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reliance on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. commodification emerges from the stone’s endurance and the mural’s fugitive code—no character sermons. Final image—colors no developer can privatize—reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in graffiti symbols (“kite shaped like the old collective agreement”) lets Drift-born readers decode while Council remains blind, creating dramatic irony. Ambiguity persists: victory is partial, duplicity endless, which invites reflection rather than tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is tactile-ordered—“grooves worn smooth,” “azure paint,” platform sway measured in brush resistance. Syntax tightens under pressure: clipped clauses during Council meeting, lengthened lyrical cadence at dawn mural. No filter-verb clutter; metaphors are concrete (neon veins, stone remembering). Dialogue sparse but natural; Tomás’s gentle contradiction reveals affection without exposition. Voice modulation matches beat, no monotone drum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: one sentence often performs description, stakes, and motion (“She began painting, her strokes orderly despite the platform’s sway…”). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; “platform” recurs only when spatial anchor needed. Mixed metaphors avoided; carnival lights as neon veins stays consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“aggressive joy,” “corporate poetry”) is POV-justified through Mira’s translator ear; never muddies causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating gentrification war reframed through covert graffiti code is fresh; stone-as-memory trope revived by tactile generational hand-off. Risk-taking in hybrid lens (causal sabotage + accumulative mural texture) pays off without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors novelty: seven-feather bird, left-curling wave, coordinates spelled in dancer ribbons—details impossible to swap. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
