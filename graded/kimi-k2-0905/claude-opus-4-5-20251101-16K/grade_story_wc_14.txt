<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Miriam’s interiority is atmospheric but generic—no contradictory impulses in scene, only serene focus. Actions are observational (recording hum, pressing gold paper) rather than risk-laden choices, so no visible cost or stake-shift occurs. “Earnestly studious” is asserted, not dramatized through micro-trade-offs. Closure is a quiet return to routine, offering Earned Stasis, yet the prior beats never jeopardize her equanimity, so the cost feels conceptual rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetitive dawn ritual, texture harvest, and final cadence of descent. Closure is Charged Poise—her notebooks now hold three new unreal histories, reweighting her quiet life with intangible but legible cost. Orientation clean by line 3; single transition (dawn → full day) is legible. No causal reversals, yet pattern intensification suffices under Accumulative drive. Persistent constraint: the lamp-dawn coupling that limits harvest to one daily slot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and dew-lit branches are vividly handled, constrain her path (narrow terraces), and supply the gold-leaf worktable surface that receives the “texture.” Micro-setting (lamp, notepad, gold paper) is repeatedly manipulated, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her papermaker gaze—fiber, weave, chemistry—not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she climbs, circles, presses, descends.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture usable echoes before daylight thins the veil—is signaled early and tightens once when the hum drops a quarter-tone, narrowing her window. Agency is attention and endurance, not reversal; options do not foreclose, merely intensify. Cost is atmospheric (lost sleep, isolation) rather than dramatized; no credible loss alters later tactics. Escalation is a single deepening of pattern, sufficient under Accumulative lens but modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the fragility of historical authenticity and the human hunger to touch alternate timelines. Subtext resides in the gold leaf—value literally pressed from void—never articulated. Final image of her descending past oblivious townsfolk reweights the premise: reality is whatever texture we can sell. Avoids thesis-statement traps; no moralizing. Could use one sharper ironic echo to reach top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Miriam’s perceptual filter—paper chemistry, electrical hum, spectra through dew. Syntax lengthens and softens under dawn calm, contracts at the harmonic drop, mirroring her attention. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction (“incandescent restraint,” “pink snow”) that feels papermaker-precise rather than generic. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with dawn arc; sentence variation avoids drumbeat. Information density high—each sentence layers craft detail or atmospheric charge. Minor scaffold: “She carried her battered notepad…” followed by “She opened her notepad…” is a 0.2 paraphrase loop; not at closure, so −0.2 only. Metaphors (pink snow, ancient weight) remain coherent and grounded in physical truth of bonsai. No mixed vehicles or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—papermaker who distils fictional histories from dawn electrical hum—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed to. Bonsai mountaintop and fluorescent lamp juxtapose techno-arcane without gimmickry. Specificity of gold-leaf sizing, quarter-tone shift, and dew spectra prevents abstract everywhere-setting. Risk: lyric stillness could read as static, but the accumulative pattern pays off in final charged poise. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
