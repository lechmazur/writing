<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-anchored perseverance is vivid (“palms bleeding against stone”), her micro-choices escalate, and the Earned Stasis of nightly return is credibly costly. Interiority is concrete, avoids label-speak, and entanglement generates authentic contradiction. Flaws are implicit: the fixation isolates her, yet depth plateaus; we get no interior shift in the climax beyond repetition. Still, she reads as a singular, irreparable individual, not a trope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure with causal spine: because Jonah flat-lined → therefore Mira re-stitches their braid nightly; closure lands (Charged Poise) when she sees his waveform dissolve into gold—cost legible. Orientation is secure by ~100 words; no teleporting detail. One soft spot: we are told “doctors wrote quietly rebellious” but never see a doctor or institutional pushback—external pressure remains off-page, blunting complete causality. Still, the interior engine and final image reconfigure stakes cleanly.</comment>

<comment>The sound-wave garden is sensory-dense and constrains every beat: amber frequencies, crystalline chimes, auric lagoon that reflects “resonance of consciousness”—this micro-setting shapes both ritual and ending. Spatial choreography holds; the lagoon as charged object is focal at start and closure, satisfying micro-setting test. Some modifiers verge on purple (“impossible pool of liquid gold”), but they serve POV wonder. Overall, environment is protagonist-level tool, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: resurrect/commune with entangled mind; pressure tightens when Mira drums harder, risking flesh to intensify the signal—options narrow to “keep playing or lose him again.” Agency remains active at climax; no deus ex machina. Cost is visible (bloody hands, dawn fade-out) and forecloses full restoration. One escalation beat suffices at this length; it is driven, visceral, and coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of love-as-persistence emerges from ritual rather than sermon. The notion that consciousness stays braided into vibration is re-weighed when Jonah’s waveform disassembles into gold—reader feels conceptual cost without thesis. Slight over-articulation of prompt language (“auroral sorrow”) dents subtlety, but final image makes sorrow felt, not named. Ambiguity persists: reunion or self-haunting? Complexity remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; lyrical register is consistent and high, yet sensory diction always run through her body and yearning. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates under pressure: clauses lengthen during awe, fracture during frantic drumming, mirroring neural spike. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors are sensory, not ornamental. Voice is distinct enough to risk poetry without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is supple; no template cadence clusters. Metaphors occasionally crowd (“colors that had no names in waking language”, “prism-braid”) but pattern is taught early and paid off, preserving causality. Read-aloud rhythm holds. Minor over-modification in lagoon paragraph, yet propulsion never stalls. Closure line earns its poise cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The neural-entanglement-after-death trope is familiar; author transforms it through Mira’s percussion ritual, the sonified, visible sound garden, and the lyrical “auroral sorrow”—the synthesis feels idiosyncratic and inevitable. All tech/magic details serve the emotional crucible rather than vice-versa. Risk in high lyricism is justified by coherent payoff.</comment>
