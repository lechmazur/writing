<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interior contradiction—quiet insurgent vs. dutiful librarian—remains vivid; the embodied “cradling the locket” beat crystallizes lineage cost. Motivation escalates from passive listening to active orchestration, but the choice to walk home is more coda than fresh micro-risk, so the final cost feels pre-paid rather than newly incurred.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town asleep beneath green-lit windows reweights earlier beats with undeniable social cost. Causal chain (listen→seed displays→Council must pass them) holds; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of green lights replaces plot reversals. Orientation anchored by 80-word mark; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Magnetic grotto returns as charged image, its iron tug literalizing “second thoughts” as physical force; cobalt library’s carpet “older than memory” grounds micro-setting. Sensory triad—mist, warm boulder, compass spin—filters through Eleanor’s bias for uncertainty. Environment constrains no on-page tactical choice, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will silent dissent survive Council bulldozers—tightens when window displays materialize, foreclosing anonymity. One meaningful deepening: midnight walk reveals synchronized green constellation, raising visible price of exposure. No second reversal, but accumulative pressure suffices under lyric lens; cost legible in her grandmother’s locket weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“rebellion can be whispered”—emerges from paper trees and chess grammar of patience, never sermonized. Final image of town “dreaming in green” reconfigures premise without moral tag. Subtext in shopkeepers’ silent agreement carries more force than slogans; ambiguity lingers whether pause will halt or merely delay factory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Eleanor’s perceptual signature: “grammar of strategy,” “forests of second thoughts.” Rhythm modulates—long cadence for library hush, clipped fragments at grotto. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A; free indirect style clean. Compression (“twelve years…”) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer (“memory refusing to fade”) stays controlled, never stacking metaphors in high-pressure beats. Information density high—each paragraph advances display scheme or stakes. One near-cliché “stars wheeled overhead” but immediately undercut by indifference, preserving freshness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar eco-protest frame refreshed by chess-coach strategist who weaponizes etiquette, not placards. Synchronized window tactic feels specific to small-town ritual; magnetic grotto as generational conscience site particularizes setting. Risk taken in eschewing confrontation scene pays off in quiet final image, though premise remains recognizable.</comment>
