<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s “noticer” trait is embodied through tactile micro-choices—touching wood grain, placing the orris shard—that visibly cost her solitude and crystallize into the final “I see you.” Interiority stays specific, never drifts into label-speak; the contradiction between her hunger for connection and her reflexive retreat charges every beat. The earned renunciation of permanent solitude lands with felt weight because every prior observation tightens that noose. Voice remains singular, no puppet-micro-movements, and the moment she presses palm to hush-shard the hierarchy of values is legible: witness over escape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and held to the last line: density of “displaced objects” and “hush” accretes until the final breath reweights loneliness into sanctified silence. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by word 90; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—circuit closed, cost is the perpetual guardianship of silence she now carries. One micro-turn at the shard-touch tightens without breaking pattern; no causality breaks, no props teleport.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Attic bay-window “hush-shard” functions as micro-setting that literally bends light and constrains her final choice to stay; salt-air violet scent charges the closing image. Streetlights’ “liquid state” is filtered through her twilight-minded POV, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every displaced object stays where placed and guides her climb. Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism, and the quiet bay’s spring indifference externalizes the cost she now shoulders.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep witnessing or retreat—tightens once when she places her own displaced offering; that act forecloses leaving before dawn. Pressure is textural: each wrong-right object raises the spiritual ante under Accumulative lens. No coincidences; escalation is a density shift, not a plot twist. Cost is legible: she trades her own future mornings for the house’s solitary vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the material practice of noticing; no final sermon, only the image of violet scent mixing with centuries-old salt air. The reweighted meaning of “alive” lands as perpetual witness, not heartbeats—conceptual repricing accomplished without abstraction. Subtext operates in object placement and swallowed breaths. Insight is earned through concrete handling of orris and hush-shard, never declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—millimeter tides, softened vowels, daydreaming streetlights—syntax lengthens and quietens under dusk pressure. No head-hopping; distance stays close third. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence in attic stillness, clipped ascent on stairs. No register drift; diction stays within her contemplative lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances texture while anchoring body position. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; “hushed blaze” is the single allowed oxymoron and it pays off in closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Only micro-flaw: one stacked modifier “specific loneliness of springs spent alone” could trim, but it does not touch closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: houses as accumulators of silence crystallized into a tangible shard. Displaced-object sanctification feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk of lyrical stillness is embraced without gimmickry; emotional specificity prevents abstraction. Could swap names but not the precise sensorium of orris-violet meeting salt hush; hence stays above template threshold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Early setup frames her noticing; middle beat—cataloguing wrong objects—forces her to decide whether to add her own; closure participation: the final “I see you” is the ultimate act of noticing that costs her freedom. Causal pressure: each observation tightens her obligation. Irreplaceable: no other trait generates the displaced-object ritual.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Appears in first paragraph, handled at midpoint placement on sill, and releases scent in final image that reweights solitude into sacrament. Narrows options: once placed, she cannot retrieve it without breaking the spell. Specific violet-salt fusion is irreplicable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept taught via reflection in window glass early, touched mid-scene, and constitutes the final exchange: her palm against the shard completes the circuit. Alters tactics: she must stay to host the hush. Closure linkage undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Trait manifests as whispered “I see you”—an inadvertently profound truth that costs her any future denial of the house’s need. Earlier observations skirt profundity but this line is the paid-on-page consequence. Could be slightly more embedded in gesture, not whisper, hence not top band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sanctify action drives the entire third arc: placing the orris shard is the decisive displacement that welds her to the house. Reconfigures options—exit is now sacrilege. Final image sanctifies silence into holy witness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Method seeded in teacup on sill, developed through sock, earring, marble; mechanics matter because each item must be “wrong” yet placed with care. Directly shapes her final tactic: she adds her own displacement. Closure beat is the last displaced object.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Quiet bay supplies salt air that mingles with violet scent in closing image, externalizing her cost. Boats “tired animals” mirror her own resignation. Setting never pressures action as fiercely as internal hush, so mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>“While the streetlights daydream” establishes twilight window; lights’ eventual true-darkness flicker marks passage and prompts her to remain. Time is felt but not deadline-urgent; functional but not tactic-altering.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motive stated early, conflicted by her own emptiness, and dramatized when she chooses to stay—trading personal freedom for understanding. Friction visible: she mouths a truth she can never un-know. Integral to closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Hushed blaze tone is seeded in grandmother’s “hush,” intensifies through crystallized silence, and modulates into warm sacred glow at shard touch. Coherent across beats; final scent-release is the blaze made sensory. Holds without monotony.</comment>
