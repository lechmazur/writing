<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mattias’s calm competence, embodied ritual motion, and single-minded question strategy give him a clear, active profile; Corrine’s embodied possession arc (convulsion, eye-color flicker, tearful recognition) shows lived cost. The “I was just a child” beat crystallizes internal contradiction under pressure. Minor: we never feel Mattias’s own stake or risk—he’s a flawless tool—so cost feels vicarious not personal, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain locks tight: artifact-touch → possession → time-box → questions reveal self-worth wound → assumption collapse → entity eviction; each beat narrows options. Orientation lands by line 4; threshold-gray symbols and loop architecture track consistently. Closure beats (silence crash, assumption collapse, entity dissipate) all occur on-page with audible cost. Persistent constraint—the saved silence sample—promises future reuse, satisfying the price test.</comment>

<comment>Impossible room—stone/water/void/skin walls—anchors every move; walls visibly flicker to void under entity scream, so environment reacts to stakes. Palette, pedal, and looping sound act as micro-settings that constrain tactics (only one color, only captured sound). Sensory selectivity tilts to sound/silence, matching POV obsession; no visual overload. Enough to pass 9+ gate: breathing-skin wall plus saved silence jointly charge the final image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—"integration completes in 20 min"—announced early; each loop layer tightens the noose until silence crash evicts entity. Pressure stays causal: questions actively shrink entity foothold. Visible price: Corrine’s tearful admission and dissipated stillness restore anchor equilibrium; option to stay possessed is foreclosed. Could edge higher if Mattias faced personal cost; as is, escalation fulfills lens without secondary wound.</comment>

<comment>Theme of un-earned worth emerges through ritual action, not lecture; final saved-silence image non-literally answers the question "What do we deserve?" Subtext breathes in gesture—gray paint absorbing like medicine, loops becoming belief. No moralizing paragraph; complexity intact: Mother’s accusation left unjustified yet potent. Resonant reconfiguration achieved when sampled silence is stored as future medicine—conceptual cost legible.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mattias’s sensory hierarchy—sound first, sight second—syntax calm, measured, priest-like. "Voice like wind through broken glass" differentiates entity; Corrine’s gasped fragment contrasts. Filter verbs serve pedagogical remove ("he could see") consistent with clerical observer. No head-hop; perceptual signature sustained. Minor cadence repetition in loop descriptions keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most lines dual-purpose (action + world rule). Varied sentence openings avoid template. Metaphors precise: "patient ghost," "breathing skin." Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphor. One scaffold-ish phrase—"decorating with silence the spaces between moments"—survives because it’s later literalized. Closure image clear, artifact-free. Satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Exorcism via Socratic loop-pedal sound-cage feels genuinely fresh;Threshold-Gray pigment mined from interdimensional membrane particularizes magic. Possession hinged on self-worth rather than sin offers non-obvious moral calculus. Risky structure—entire piece is quiet interrogation—pays off because silence weaponized as tech & theme. Specificity transforms trope: saved silence reprise makes prior ritual tech inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
