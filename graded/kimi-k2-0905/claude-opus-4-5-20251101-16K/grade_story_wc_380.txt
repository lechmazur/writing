<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-driven compulsion is palpable, but her interiority drifts toward thematic abstraction (“she knew better”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final resolve to read lost memories aloud is credible, yet the cost is declared, not dramatized—no visible hesitation or bodily toll on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira cradles the recovered journal under the lantern row, the world now “remembering” through her—felt cost is implicit in the gravity-shifted air she still breathes. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each salt-crystal detail and coffee-ground omen tightens the same stake. One minor hedge: the whale’s suicidal intent is inferred, not textured, but the pattern coheres without late rule tricks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Harbor dusk, lantern gleam, and salt-crystal cathedral are filtered through Mira’s practiced eye—light, weight, and odor guide her steps and choices. The gravity pockets act as micro-setting, literally altering her footfall path to the chamber; the chamber then yields the journal, so environment directly enables closure. No spatial drift; every named object recurs with altered charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—surfaces early and tightens when the spiral-pattern “Exhume” command reframes her evening walk into an excavation. Agency is present: she chips the crystal wall, trading risk of breakage for potential recovery. Price is conceptual (the world’s remembered weight now rests on her voice), but the on-page trade-off feels slender—no moment where retrieval could harm or fail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s material persistence emerges through salt-entombed pages rather than exposition; the wildflowers re-weight from sentimental keepsake to resurrection keys. Final image of lanterns “remembering” offers Conceptual Repricing without sermon. Whale-as-courier risks grandiosity, yet the conceit is grounded in Mira’s tactile labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s sensory chain; perceptions tilt with gravity shifts (“footsteps felt heavier or lighter”). Syntax modulates—long breathless clauses for ascent, clipped fragments when she chips crystal—mirroring effort. No head-hop; whale remains external mystery, as it must.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense: one sentence often anchors mood, body, and tool (“her long pole and oil can swinging at her side, lighting the lanterns one by one”). Occasional lyrical overlap—“gleaming silence” appears twice—but rhythm breathes with scene pace. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clusters in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Memory-loss-as-gravity-sink is fresh; coupling it with salt-crystal archiving and whale-borne cargo creates an idiosyncratic cosmology. Detail feels indigenous to this harbor rather than imported magic system. Risk taken with surreal physics pays off in closure image, though whale motivation stays conveniently off-stage.</comment>
