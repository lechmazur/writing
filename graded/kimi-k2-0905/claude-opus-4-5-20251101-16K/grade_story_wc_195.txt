<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Corwin’s muteness, armor-as-shell, and the trembling “yes” form a crisp arc; the gorget’s removal embodies cost. Interiority stays concrete—“his refusal made metal”—and the oath to uncertainty is earned. Still, the war trauma is asserted, not shown, so motivation verges on label. A hairline slip, but the embodied change lands.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the branching light-tree reconfigures all prior imagery with the conceptual cost of permanent openness. Causal logic holds—every fold of reality is tied to the danced pattern and the gorget’s fall. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is declared by the first sentence (“moved through the world like a shadow”) and paid off in the crystallized dawn he now carries. No orientation debt; each spatial shift is tracked through Corwin’s footfalls.</comment>

<comment>The greenhouse is no backdrop; its breathing glass and mercury roots literally redistribute around his steps, constraining the choreography he must complete. The endless-night rule is learned through pulsing fruit and taste of copper, never lectured. Micro-setting is met: the gorget becomes a spatial pivot—its removal alters proximity to the light-tree. Final image of swaying silver trunks re-anchors the transformed space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“shape of possibility” vs. sealed fate—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when each pattern-step collapses alternate futures into the branching bloom. Agency is continuous: he chooses the dance, the unclasping, the spoken oath; each forfeits safety. Cost is visceral—cold air on the bare throat—and conceptual—he must “carry dawn” inside permanent night. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of fealty: from king to ontological uncertainty. Subtext lives in the marionette diagrams—strings stand for pre-written fate; cutting the gorget cuts those strings. No moral is stated; the final “yes” is an open vow, not a lesson. The greenhouse’s impossible night makes the conceptual cost undeniable, reweighting the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person distant is modulated—tightened to poetic lyricism under pressure, then released into breathy monosyllables (“yes”). Perceptual signature is knight-specific: armor joints, tactical formations hidden in dance, metallic taste. No filter-verb stacks; syntax breathes with the spatial folds. Voice remains controlled when reality dilates, sustaining clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long liquid folds to the staccato “He said nothing profound.” No loops or scaffold; each image does double duty—”phosphorescent fruit that pulsed like slow hearts” fuses sensory, emotional, world rule. Opening and final lines are propulsive and earned. Metaphors stay internally coherent; mercury, copper, and dawn form a metallic through-line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The alchemical greenhouse and puppet-war cipher feel fresh, yet draw on recognizable epic and alchemical tropes. The synthesis—folding military formations into marionette choreography—pushes the concept past ornament. Risk is evident in the reality-folding lyricism, but coherence is maintained. Transformation test fails narrowly: swap “knight” for “ex-soldier” and the arc still stands, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>
