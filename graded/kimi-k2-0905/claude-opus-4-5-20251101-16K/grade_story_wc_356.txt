<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s olfactory gift and grandmother’s “doodle” habit are concrete, embodied, and drive every beat; the interior contradiction between burning ambition and the need for stillness is dramatized in the swaying-bridge moment. Thessaly functions as pressure, not oracle, forcing Mira to micro-choose (sit, breathe, accept the seed). The final stillness beside the reeking bloom is earned renunciation of panic, costing her social comfort and physical ease—visible on page. Voice stays particular, never drifting into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: every beat is “because/therefore” from seed request → Thessaly’s test → acceptance → final harvest. Closure is Earned Stasis—Mira endures the stench, foreclosing flight, paying with solitary nausea while children’s medicine drips; cost is legible in the final image. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props or retroactive knowledge. One tight transition (departure at dusk) keeps chronology clean.</comment>

<comment>Treetop village is not backdrop: swaying bridges force Mira’s physical stillness lesson, cedar scent layers supply the olfactory syllabus, and the sealed clay pot acts as micro-setting that charges the final garden scene. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s gift—smell leads, touch follows, sight last. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from platform to bridge to descent. Environment constrains the climax: the village’s motion-in-stillness principle becomes the literal tactic that lets her stay beside the blooming horror.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save dying children—signaled line 1 and tightened when Thessaly demands internal stillness as non-negotiable price. One meaningful escalation: acceptance of the seed → must withstand the bloom’s stench; no reversal, but option space narrows to endure or fail. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence absent. Cost is on-page: solitary vigil, social ostracism during bloom, and implied lifelong burden of containing the smell.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—wisdom as receptive stillness within motion—emerges through Mira’s body on swaying bridges and the monstrous flower, never stated outright. Subtext in Thessaly’s dried-herb rafters (old grief) and the spiral doodle (patience) reweights at the end when Mira sketches the stinking petals. No moralizing; final image of medicine dripping while she breathes decay is Conceptual Repricing that revalues ugliness as healing. Ambiguity remains: serenity is not peace but disciplined coexistence with horror.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited clings to Mira’s olfactory brain: “her head swim,” “nose detected its particular signature.” Syntax lengthens under stillness lesson, shortens during bridge descent, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; Thessaly’s interior remains opaque, read only by scent and gesture. Dialogue sparse, indirect (“You record what you already know how to see”), advancing the test. Prose rhythm is controlled, never mechanical; diction stays within Mira’s herbalist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances scent knowledge or bodily adjustment. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “ambition…a wildfire” is immediately qualified by motion/stillness paradox. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“pressed,” “sorted,” “dripped”). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, breathing with scene tempo. Minor adjective in “ancient cedars” is genre-acceptable; no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower quest is familiar, yet the olfactory training regime, wrapping-paper palimpsest journaling, and swaying-bridge stillness test feel specific and non-transferable. Grandmother’s recycled doodles transform a quirk into inherited tech for patience, avoiding sentimental nostalgia. Risk taken: climax is stasis beside stench rather than action, but causality and theme support the quietude. No close echoes of famous scenes; synthesis of scent-craft and motion-in-balance reads fresh.</comment>
