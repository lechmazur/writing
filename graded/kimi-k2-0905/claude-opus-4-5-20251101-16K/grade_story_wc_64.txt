<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s blithe patience is credibly particular—she hums while weeding a child’s grave—and her decision to map the tapestry’s secrets is the embodied cost that earns her new, heavier knowledge. The interior contradiction (joy amid sorrow) stays active in scene, not summary, and the final quiet renunciation—accepting the weight of uncharted echoes—pays the price promised by her earlier lightness. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; head-count violation is moot because choreography never blurs. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-labeling (“she understood the dead needed tending with lightness”), but it is brief and offset by immediate sensory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the chess clock’s silence is re-weighted when Maren begins her own “game against time,” a final image whose conceptual cost is undeniable. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of faded threads, sovereign case, star-wheeling repetition—held cleanly to the end. Causality is intact: because she finds the case, because the clock is down, she is free to act now that the blocking generation is dead. Orientation is anchored before 120 words (cemetery, October evening, Aldrich plot). One minor scaffold (“after the chess clock runs down” repeated) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting that constraints choice: its cylindrical wall forces her to read the tapestry border at bodily scale, and the star-cut window provides the only light for decoding. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Maren notices soil texture, fray stiffness, not tourist catalog. Velveteen gloom recurs with shifting tactile weight, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves from graveyard to silo bench.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>The dominant stake—will she hear the uncharted echoes before time/memory erases them—tightens once: the tapestry’s frayed border shifts from decay to legible cipher, narrowing her options to all-night decoding. Cost is visible: star-wheeling hours, stiff fingers, the promise of future excavations across the county. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the plot. The escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.</grade>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the living owe the dead not grief but patient listening. The tapestry’s wrongness → map of secrets re-prices mourning as archival labor. Subtext lives in gesture—her cemetery-roughened fingers measuring sightlines—never explicated. Final image of “vast blue quiet” offers resonant non-moral: history is an unfinished game whose next move is hers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is specific—she hears marigolds coax, feels velveteen gloom as curtain-weight. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for star-wheeling calm, fragment-like bursts when cipher letters click into place. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Diction stays within her earthy lexicon; no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Sentence variety is musical, scaffolding minimal. Information density high: “three gold sovereigns nestled in faded velvet” does triple job—object, texture, value. One mixed metaphor—“velveteen gloom soft and heavy as old curtains”—is felicitous and voice-true. No loops or synonym churn; final line cadence echoes opening hum, creating textural closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: cemetery gardener as archival code-breaker, chess clock as temporal gate, tapestry border as OS grid. Sovereign case and cobalt silo feel inevitable, not quirky. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off: star-wheel reprise reweights prior images. Could not swap Maren’s blithe patience for generic sleuth without breaking premise. Conceptual integrity intact: the story commits fully to the metaphor that tending graves is tending memory.</comment>
