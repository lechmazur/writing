<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s drive—find deleted truth / mother—stays legible; the patch-touch before Chen enters shows embodied stake. Interiority keeps to profession-filter (“ghost impressions”) yet slips into slogan (“nothing is truly erased”) at the climax, muting cost. Micro-choice to self-delete is credible but rushed; we’re told she’s “learning from the ghosts” rather than seeing her tactics strain. Relationship with Chen is sharp status drop; mother remains off-stage motivator, so charge leaks sideways not inward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: anomaly → digging → confrontation → flight, each beat tightening risk. Closure lands as Charged Poise—coordinates copied, traces wiped, path foreclosed; cost is legible in her trembling hands and erased future at Nexus. Orientation clean by ~100 words; single-scene default met. Compression forces one shortcut: Chen delivers the entire conspiracy in a monologue; no preceding breadcrumb makes the revelation feel imported, not earned, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>“Social-network archive” is sketched by function (timestamps, metadata) rather than décor, keeping density high. The patch serves as micro-setting: sun-rays/stars/planets re-map as 7-3-1-9 and migrate from desk to trembling hand to screen, charging the final image. Corporate corridor is default-white; only Chen’s “smile thin as a razor cut” grants a sensory hook. Enough constraint for 7-band, but environment never actively impedes or enables Mara’s hack sequence, so stays below 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find truth vs. corporate erasure—clear in first paragraph; risk escalates with each query Mara runs. Mid-story tightening: Chen’s arrival flips threat from digital to physical, foreclosing her Nexus life; choice to self-purge is irreversible. Cost visible in “trembling hands,” though emotional price drifts toward abstraction (“finally understood”). No fake coincidence; escalation is agency-driven under causal lens. Missing a tactile obstacle within the archive itself keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory vs. mandated forgetting—emerges through job ritual, anomaly hunt, and final self-erasure instead of editorial comment. Patch and 7319 motif reprice from curiosity to survival map, yielding quiet resonance. Chen’s exposition is the only overt statement, but it’s framed as antagonist pressure, not authorial thesis. Final line edges toward aphorism yet earns its weight by threading earlier “echo of forgotten songs,” so stays above mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: numbers “showed up,” archive “existed in a strange temporal space,” aligning tech POV with lyric tilt. Syntax stays controlled; no filter-verb clusters or register drift. Corporate diction (“metadata of vanished images”) is character-appropriate. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Chen’s soft threats contrast with Mara’s clipped cover. No experimental compression, so safe 7+ without distinctive rhythmic signature needed for 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; adjacent sentences rarely restate. Figurative language sparse and purposeful (“smile thin as a razor cut”). One near-loop: “deleted everything. Then we deleted them” works as chilling refrain, not scaffold. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance. No grammar slips or pronoun drift. Lacks the sonic/rhythmic originality that pushes to 9+, but line-level clarity supports immediate publication.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of big-data ghost forensics with classic missing-parent noir feels fresh; patch-as-cipher converts sentimental keepsake into navigational key. 7319 pattern moves from easter-egg to life-raft without gimmickry. Corporate “memory keeper” job title is prompt-sourced yet gains lived detail through cataloguing erasures. Story leans on familiar Evil-Corp trope, but mother-survivor twist repurposes it. Not radically original, but synthesis is specific and memorable at this length.</comment>
