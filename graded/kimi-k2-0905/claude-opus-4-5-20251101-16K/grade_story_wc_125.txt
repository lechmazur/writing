<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictions—ethical outlaw / seeker of communion—are alive in the rope touch and the quiet “Show me” surrender. Interiority is specific, never generic: “ethical playfulness” shows up as laughter mid-alien-parable, not label. Choice to become “between” carries the exact cost foreshadowed by the prison-break rope; agency is legible. Emotional progression is steady, no resets; Earned Stasis lands with felt forfeiture of human time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via moving constellations and rope weight; closure is a Charged Poise crystallizing the surrender. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are present by line 5 and reinforced each paragraph. Pattern of “peeling back” is consistent; no teleporting props. Only minor softening: energy-beings’ offer is stated more than tested before she accepts, so the Decisive Change feels slightly pre-explained rather than discovered in real time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting: its warm clay and vanished-water contours mirror Mira’s own fossilized layers, and the starlit aperture supplies the final image. Sensory range is narrow but character-filtered; poet’s perception privileges texture over sight—rope fibers, clay warmth. Place guides action: beings bend light near stones, Mira sits where the floor “remembered” water. No spatial drift; one coherent pocket that charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to time’s texture—signaled line 1; pressure tightens when refusal option is costed as “poems about what you cannot feel.” Single turning-point beat: acceptance of knowledge that severs her from human temporality; no coincidence. Price (loss of shared time) is visible on page. Escalation is one-step, sufficient; could reach higher band if the beings’ promise generated an immediate micro-denial or foretaste instead of straight exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thematic core—ethical transgression as gateway to perception—emerges through rope memory and consent-to-drift, never authorial lecture. Subtext coils around “texture” (fiber, clay, time) so final “depths instead of distances” reweights every prior image. Ambiguity survives: reader cannot decide if she is exiled or freed, which is correct. No echo-statements; resonance is imagistic, felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poet’s perceptual signature is consistent: language stays tactile, lyrical, slightly off-balance (“morning light had its own particular weight”). Rhythm lengthens in calms, fragments under revelation; no head-hopping. Free indirect tension between wonder and ethical irony (“had always been ethically playful”) feels character-native. No dialogue, so voice compression and lyric elision carry the entire load—cleanly done.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, rarely wasteful—each sentence advances image or emotional turn. Varied sentence length mirrors time-stretch conceit; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. One mixed metaphor (“time…rough as rope, warm as terra-cotta, endless as spaces”) in closure beat is acceptable because it accumulates rather than contradicts. Ear-test reads aloud smoothly; zero filter-verb clusters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Alien-time-as-geology trope is refreshed by pairing with an ethically playful poet and the concrete rope relic; synthesis feels inevitable. Conceptual risk—lyric speculation inside a single quiet choice—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of “pattern meaning from lived time” reframes standard transcendence plot. Some tonal DNA echoes Calvino/Butler, but voice and object use are distinct.</comment>
