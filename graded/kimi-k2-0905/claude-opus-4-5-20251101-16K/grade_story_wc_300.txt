<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. compulsive emotional hoarding—drives every beat; the pearl-to-forehead gesture is an embodied micro-choice that crystallizes her turn. Flaw-rooted inertia (never crying, never calling) is the explicit cost foreclosed by the ending. The shift from hoarding secrets to speaking them lands as earned renunciation. Missing 9-band only because estranged daughter remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is implicit, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bunker artifact layers density until the spiral shell pattern-break concentrates the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no penalty. Closure is Charged Poise—pearl pressed to skin—reconfiguring meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (“walls between hearts” vs. bridges). The persistent constraint is Vera’s new responsibility to speak, not hide, foreclosing her prior detachment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz cathedral and rusted door serve as tactile obstacles that must be pried open; the pearl-in-alcove micro-setting literally cradles the turning point. Sensory hierarchy follows Vera’s inspector gaze—oxygen filters first, nacre second—tying professional habit to emotional rupture. Spatial choreography is clean: door → cave → alcove → pocket → forehead. Crystal refraction reappears in the final “glow,” charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she keep collecting silence or risk speech?”—tightens once, when the etched confessions force her to recognize her own withheld truths. The spiral’s microscopic center acts as the single deepening that reweights cost. No external antagonist is needed; internal fear supplies coherent pressure. Cost is legible: she loses the safety of emotional anonymity the instant the pearl touches her skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: unspoken vulnerability is the only renewable shelter. The pearl’s impossibility (cultivated without oyster) performs the central metaphor—truth can grow in dead air if given silence and time. No moral is declared; the final “resonant hush” re-prices the bunker paradigm from protection to isolation. Reader left to feel that confession, not concrete, is the final radiation shield.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is inspector-cold (“cataloging shapes that human fear took”) warming under shell-light. Syntax lengthens only in the spiral-reading beat, mirroring the inward dive. No dialogue, so no register clash. Free-indirect “she understood” is clean, justified by the heartbeat pause.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stake. Figurative layer is selective—only one metaphor per high-pressure beat—avoiding density penalty. “Frozen prayers,” “abandoned hopes like dust” are concrete enough to earn their place. Final-line “world that had forgotten how to glow” lands as earned recurrence of latent radiance, not ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Doomsday-prepper trope is inverted: bunkers become mausoleums of unspoken love rather than survivalist fantasy. The impossibly cultivated pearl rewrites magical-realist rule without exposition, growing from human secrecy instead of oyster biology. Fresh synthesis: post-apocalypse story whose true apocalypse is emotional silence. Risky central image pays off because closure keeps the physics metaphorically coherent.</comment>
