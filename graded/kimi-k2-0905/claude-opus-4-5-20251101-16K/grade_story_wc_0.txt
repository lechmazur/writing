<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Elena’s contradictory impulses—intellectual control vs. the emotional pull of butterfly dust—are dramatized in a single vivid beat on the bench; her final micro-choice to call her mother crystallizes a change foreclosed by prior avoidance, with humility embodied in cracked voice and damp clothes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: butterfly-dust patterns tighten the emotional stake by reweighting Elena’s perception of gradual decay; the last image—phone call with cracked voice—delivers Charged Poise with undeniable relational cost, satisfying closure under the taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse’s warped frame and shimmering wing dust act as micro-setting that constrains Elena’s posture and attention; bench dampness seeps through clothes, charging the final sit-down; butterfly dust refracts light to mark water’s retreat, directly feeding the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s need to strip drama vs. her need to feel—is tightened once by the dust revelation; the accumulative pressure of microscopic scales forces stance crystallization on the bench; cost is legible in the cracked voice that ends avoidance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of gradual loss emerges iridescently through dust layers rather than exposition; final image reweights prior neutron-star analog without moralizing; ambiguity remains—Elena does not promise repair—creating resonant aftereffect tied to humility’s warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Detached scientific diction early—“preprocessed reality through equations”—modulates into cracked oral plea; perceptual signature stays consistent via density imagery; no head-hopping; final rhythm collapses into fragmented phone dialogue matching emotional peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates from measured clauses to breathless phone line; no loops or mixed metaphors; “dust smeared across her fingertip like a whisper” is precise; information density high—each sentence layers emotional and physical stakes without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star cooling as mirror for butterfly-wing decay; risk in merging astrophysics with horticultural microcosm pays off; specificity of iridescent dust rescues trope of flood aftermath; ending would fail if butterflies swapped to generic silt.</comment>
