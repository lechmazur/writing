<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s wound-driven inertia and her micro-choice to hand Marcus the pendant are credible; the internal contradiction between teaching release while still chained to her own stencil is present yet not activated in a beat of scene pressure. The emotional embodiment (“woman-shaped wound”) risks diagnostic shorthand, but the sensory workbench detail keeps it from sliding into label-speak. Marcus remains a receptive mirror rather than a source of status friction, so relationship-as-crucible is thin. Enough cost is felt to meet the 9- gate, but contradiction could bite deeper under higher pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: each artifact (paper birds, stencil, pendant, telescope vision) layers density until the final star-image reweights meaning with visible cost—Marcus’s broken-open sound and Vera’s permission to change. Causality is lyric rather than plot-sequence, taught early and coherent at closure. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One reflective block exceeds 20% but is interleaved with micro-choices (folding, tracing, handing) that tilt present stance, satisfying BRR exception. Closure lands as Charged Poise: futures reconfigured, cost audible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory rules are learned through action—ash jewelry, star-map telescope—rather than exposition; ceiling that “opened to constellations that belonged to no earthly sky” economically fuses wonder and liminality. Micro-settings (bench, pendant vise, telescope eyepiece) constrain action and return in the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and tactile detail aligned to Vera’s craft, justified by POV. Spatial choreography stays clean across two bodies and one dominant prop. Environment does not yet charge the final image with tactical constraint, capping Q3 below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Vera’s need to release her own grief by releasing others—signals early; pressure intensifies through cumulative artifacts rather than because/therefore turns. The telescope beat offers one visible tightening: star-image forces Marcus’s audible break and crystallizes the cost of looking. Price is legible on the page (his sound, her relinquishing pendant), satisfying 8+ threshold. Coincidence (stars mirroring psyche) is thematic device, not resolver. No second tightening beat; escalation plateaus after telescope, preventing 8.8+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—ash, hair, stencil, paper birds—rather than thesis: grief must be containered and then allowed to change form. Final line (“But it also needed permission to change”) is explicit but grows from accumulated imagery, avoiding moralistic sermon. Subtext operates in gesture: Vera tracing faded stencil lines “when her hands needed to remember what hope had looked like.” Complexity acknowledged—refusal to promise pain-free outcome—gives plausible counter-readings. Resonance reweights earlier motifs; no tidy equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Vera with clean psychic distance; no head-hop. Diction (“woman-shaped wound,” “sleeping question mark”) carries idiosyncratic perceptual signature without purple drift. Rhythm modulates: longer languid sentences for observatory timelessness, clipped fragments (“Look.”) under pressure. Dialogue sparse and subtextual—three lines total—serving as action beats rather than exposition. Experimental elisions (“—some said—”) are taught early and paid off, maintaining legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: single sentences fuse craft, memory, and metaphor (“last breath captured in glass spheres no larger than a teardrop”). Occasional modifier stacks (“genuinely artificial stars—genuine in their light, artificial in their arrangement”) flirt with overwriting but serve conceptual emphasis and do not recur in peak beat. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or synonym churn detected. Final third is artifact-clean, allowing high-band eligibility. One mixed metaphor (“curtains of intention”) survives because it is immediately taught as psychic fabric, not random flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mourning-jewelry-as-grief-tech feels fresh; pairing it with telescope that maps personalized constellations creates specific synthesis rather than trope recycling. Risk-taking in folding Victorian memento mori into liminal timeless observatory pays off: closure image could not swap settings without collapsing meaning. Origami-calling-card mechanic avoids cliché by embedding causality (coordinates lead here) and cost (Vera once followed one, now scatters them). Voice-level specifics (ash, hair, stencil) anchor universals of parental loss, resisting generic abstraction. Bold premise fully committed to, no retreat.</comment>
