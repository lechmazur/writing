<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-rooted mission is vivid, but interiority slips into abstract self-diagnosis (“she came to magnify small kindnesses”) rather than embodied contradiction; the button moment crystallizes her value hierarchy, yet no micro-choice in the present scene risks or costs her anything, so the arc hovers at observation rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust→button→database pattern tightens across decades, re-weighting the stake from forgetting to witness; the final image of colored tab + next file delivers Charged Poise with felt cost—her life’s work is endless, the room always wins—so closure lands on-page under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>File-room as sensory prison—fluorescent hum, metal shelves, water-stained ceiling—anchors every beat; dust patterns function as tactile map and decision tool, constraining which file she opens; brass button’s eagle+insignia supplies the charged micro-setting that reconfigures meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue kindness from erasure—intensifies once when the button surfaces, but pressure plateaus; no live option is foreclosed, no price paid on this beat, so escalation stays modest under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of archival mercy emerges through concrete relay of dust, button, database, colored tab—no moralizing; final image reframes the endless task as both penance and grace, inviting reader to weigh the cost of remembering what the system forgot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter—dust as spirit-release, brass as universe—without head-hop; rhythm modulates from long archival sentences to staccato “The work continued.” under final pressure; diction remains within a file-clerk’s lexicon, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn; figurative language (dust like released spirits) is spare, patterned, and paid off. One mixed metaphor—“unknown histories compressed into bureaucratic shorthand”—barely grazes clarity, not closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Foster-care archive as site of tender archaeology feels fresh; dust-reading method and button-relic turn bureaucratic detritus into sacred witness. Risk is quiet—no structural pyrotechnics—but specificity of gesture (colored tab, database photo) transforms familiar grief-recovery template into memorable stance.</comment>
