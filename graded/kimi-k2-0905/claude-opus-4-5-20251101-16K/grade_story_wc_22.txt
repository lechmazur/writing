<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The coachman’s grief-riven vocation is rendered through tactile ritual (seed-scattering, bird-listening) rather than labels; his contradictory need to keep moving versus his need to stay and mend is embodied in the jetty beat. Interiority stays concrete—his lips shape “prayers, perhaps, or apologies” without spelling guilt. The final renunciation—empty satchel, years he won’t live to see—carries unmistakable cost, earning the stance crystallization. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; single-POV voice stays distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each seed-scatter and bird-call adds density until the final image reweights the stake—garden will outlast him. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“twilight…jetty”); no disorientation. Closure is Charged Poise: “The seeds lay invisible…waiting for the garden that would eventually swallow every memory of war” reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Cost is legible in the same sentence—he won’t live to see it—so 9+ test met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Jetty stones, scorch marks, poppy cracks, tidal sediment—every environmental detail is filtered through his planter’s gaze and guides where he scatters. Body-as-setting: worn satchel, hands moving “with the certainty of ritual,” final empty pouch swinging. Reef-as-memory and drowned treaty fragment reappear to charge the ending image. Micro-setting (seed pods, treaty parchment) constrains tactics and reweights closure—satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—battlefield reclamation—signaled in paragraph 4; pressure tightens when he empties the satchel, foreclosing any future coach-runs. Escalation is accretive: each scatter narrows his remaining agency to zero. Cost is felt in final line—“longer than he had left”—but not dramatized as physical loss; keeps score just below 8.8 band. No coincidence; all pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated particulars: seeds, treaties, birds—reclamation versus erasure. No explicit moral; final image of invisible seeds re-prices the premise—peace as slow green conspiracy. Subtext in tern calls and dead-language prayers keeps implication off-page. Resonance lingers in “narrow vastness” reframed as temporal, not spatial—memory compressed into corridor of years he won’t see.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is herbal-ornithological—“seed pods rattled like small prayers,” “tern called…three short notes.” Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for tide-settling, fragmentary bursts for seed release. No head-hops; diction stays within coachman’s worn, post-war lexicon. Compression in “prayers, perhaps, or apologies” teaches pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Figurative control: “narrow tongue into the gray expanse” marries body and landscape without mixed metaphor. High density—e.g., “dead reef…bleached white as old bone” layers war, death, and calcium in five words. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: battlefield gardener who listens to terns for soil cues—combines eco-restoration with oracular birding. Submerged treaty as ticking sediment is novel. Risk of lyric accumulation is held by tight causality—each scatter dictated by bird-call soil map. Could edge 9+ with sharper irreplaceability of reef-death timeframe, but still memorable.</comment>
