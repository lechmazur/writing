<comment>Mira’s occupation as “clean-slate vendor” is dramatized through tactile ritual: incising, measuring, bottling absence. Her parole constraint (“one transgression… crystallize again”) is repeatedly tethered to on-page micro-choices—she handles bottled moonlight instead of prying at unripe stories. Interior contradiction flickers in the final beat: she yearns to step through the threshold she tends yet forces herself to “count what was missing,” a renunciation whose cost is felt. The only drag is near-total absence of secondary pressure—no voiced antagonist or customer resistance—so the arc is solitary, still credible within 800-word lyric frame.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira crystallizes her perpetual “waiting” into an Earned Stasis—she will keep counting absence, foreclosing her own narrative entry. Cost is legible: “Her parole required her to stand at the threshold… and never step through.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each measured exhalation adds density until the final image re-weights the premise. No orientation debt; cloud-library rules remain stable. Only hairline slip: the single customer beat resolves too easily, slightly undercutting the tightening that precedes it.</comment>

<comment>Glass trees, bottled moonlight, and sea-of-clouds choreography constrain every motion; no detail floats as mere postcard. The moonlight bottle literally charges the culminating image and is handled twice—spill and lift—meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking stays clean despite surreal physics because perception is filtered through Mira’s task-oriented gaze. One micro-drag: “colors that had no names” leans abstract, but it is immediately tethered to sensory work.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—remain parole-compliant while tending unborn stories—tightens once: Mira records the absences rather than opening them. Escalation is situational pressure under accumulative lens; each measurement adds weight to her abstention. The customer request supplies a micro-test; she resolves it without breach, demonstrating the cost of perpetual self-denial. Price is visible and scales to lyric length, but the beat would carry deeper punch if the customer’s need conflicted more sharply with her prohibition.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without dictation: stories begin in engineered emptiness; mercy can equal erasure. Final image of “slow bloom toward being spoken” revalues prior absences into generative patience. No thematic echo or moralizing sentence. Subtext in the customer’s softening edges implies unknowable grief, letting reader bridge silence to meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person floats close behind Mira’s perceptual filter: moonlight “taught the light how to whisper,” glass exudes “unborn narratives.” Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under incising stress, all without drum-beat repetition. No POV leakage; reflections stay anchored to present stimuli. Voice sustains lyrical compression while teaching its pattern by 150 words; closure remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates; sentence stems avoid mechanical loops. Figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Information density high—e.g., “seventy-three units of unspoken fear…”—conveys world-rule and emotional math in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no artifact touches the closing line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—orchard cultivating pre-narrative absence—synthesizes familiar meta-fiction into tactile occupation. Lunar harvest for narrative horticulture feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in lyric stillness pays off: the ending’s charged poise could not survive without the invented metrics and glass incisions. Specificity prevents abstraction from ballooning into gimmick.</comment>
