<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s solitary ritual, her “gift” of reading absences, and the final renunciation of disclosure all track cleanly; the micro-choice to withhold from the authorities crystallizes her inherited duty with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—breath in salt-thick air, the drawer’s weight in her hand—avoiding label-speak. The only limit is that the stranger remains a prop; his absence is thematic but supplies no live pressure on Maren, so the crucible is purely internal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren’s decision to keep the secret reconfigures her custodianship and is paid for by the lifelong solitude it confirms. Causal chain is tight—Edelweiss → memory → photograph → concealment—each beat because/therefore under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is swift: lighthouse, twilight, body on dock by line 4. No meaningful leaks; the drawer reveal is set up by the stranger’s hand-off and her nightly returns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The opal dock’s shimmer through mist, the spiral stairs, the salt-thick air—all filter through Maren’s keeper-bias and constrain her nightly investigation route. The Edelweiss functions as micro-setting: its alpine impossibility reweights the entire coastal space. Final image of the pinned boutonnière above the photograph charges the lighthouse bedroom with permanent alpine after-image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep or expose the strangers’ story—tightens once: the drawer discovery forces the choice to withhold. Pressure is accumulative: each night’s return layers absence until the photograph makes silence the only reverent act. Cost is legible—she accepts perpetual isolation by lying to authority. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: love survives through custodianship of absence, not possession. Subtext lives in gesture—pinning the flower above the photo replaces spoken eulogy. Final image reweights “softly persistent” from romantic hope to keeper’s vow without moralizing. The refusal to explain amplifies resonance; reader left holding the same secret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature—selective attention to negative space, nautical lexicon, salt-thick breath. Rhythm modulates: longer hypnotic sentences during memory absorption, clipped fragments at drawer reveal. No head-hopping; the stranger’s interior arrives only as borrowed fragments she cannot interpret, preserving distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every image performs double duty—opal dock shimmers and signals otherworldly threshold. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (fever dream, brittle petals). Filter verbs serve voice (“the Edelweiss whispered to her”) rather than dull immediacy. Final line cadence mirrors lighthouse sweep, closing sonic circuit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime ghost-story meets alpine relic, resolved through negative-space detective work. The “read absence” method inverts conventional clue logic, turning void into evidence. Risk taken—no living antagonist, no dialogue—yet coherence holds. Slight deduction for echo of “keeper inherits predecessor’s love relic” trope, but alpine/lighthouse pairing and memory-gift mechanic transform it.</comment>
