<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—yearning for “real” texture while performing a mandated ritual—drives every beat; the moment she rings the lens against the bell crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Yet the miner-child voice arrives as external grace, not earned through her prior choices, softening the cost. Still, her embodied listening (“powerfully gentle”) and final renunciation of certainty land with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonic layer (bells, cylinder hiss, child’s song) densifies meaning until the final chord reweights the premise. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Vera’s tone now “carries the ghost”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric design; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The carbide lens functions as micro-setting: its scratched glass warps light and sound, physically constraining how Vera experiments and therefore what she hears. Acoustic vaults are sketched with dust-caked amber light that guides her gaze and emotional temperature. Spatial choreography stays clean; the hillside cathedral exterior is economical and thematic, not touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake—“find real connection inside artificial ritual”—tightens when the lens fractures her bell tone, forcing a trade-off: accept council-approved meaning or risk an uncharted harmonic communion. One visible price: she weeps, acknowledging the rough-edged answer. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversing, but sufficient under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sound-carrying objects: connection is rough, clouded, trans-temporal. No character moralizes; the child’s song re-enters as living proof without thematic exposition. Final image reweights the premise—ritual lie transmuted into authentic resonance—leaving generous ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Vera’s perceptual bias—sound splits like light, shadows warm or chill. Syntax lengthens under wonder, compresses under doubt; no head-hop. Distinctive diction (“prism-song,” “fractal patterns”) remains inside her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature; no scaffold loops. Figurative layers are dense but patterned early (“harmonics cascaded outward in fractal patterns”), so closure repetition feels earned. One mixed metaphor (“warmth cut with long shadows”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-collapse sound-archiving lab plus crystal bells plus carbide-lens séance synthesizes fresh myth without gimmickry. The miner-lamp-as-gramophone idea is specific, low-tech, haunting. Transformation test: swap lens → entire sonic alchemy collapses. Risk heightens coherence.</comment>
