<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s claustrophobia is embodied in every rung she counts and every shallow breath; the contradiction between vocation and terror is kept alive, not merely labeled. Her decision to descend despite panic is credibly motivated by the codex’s promise of twenty-three forgotten names, a moral debt she alone will shoulder. The final ascent, timed against the returning tide, crystallizes her hierarchy of values: personal terror is subordinate to the duty of remembrance. Cost is visceral—she emerges gasping, device clutched, facility already re-drowned—so the arc earns its endurance without tidy self-repair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the facility re-submerges, the recordings are secured, and Mira’s prior anonymity is replaced by custodianship of the voices she alone retrieved. Causality is tight: codex → descent → download → escape, each beat contingent on the last. The six-hour tidal clock externalizes stakes and forces the final ladder climb to coincide with rising water, a temporal constraint that shapes tactics throughout. No orientation drift; who/where/when is anchored by line 3 and never lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drowned station is rendered through tactile corrosion, frost-rimed pipes, and the audible hum of cables that “never stopped carrying” whispers—details that double as sensory ground and thematic echo. Phase-transition mechanics (floor → pool; pipe → stream) are observed, not explained, keeping world-rules legible. The codex’s gold-fleck ink and the detector’s clicks act as micro-settings that constrain choice: she must work while both ink and time remain visible. Final image of ocean “reclaiming its forgotten station” re-weights the earlier descriptors with inevitable loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the last voices before the tide erases them—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens monotonically: water at ankles → calves → ladder. One meaningful deepening: the detector’s scream shifts the mission from archival curiosity to direct communion with the dead, raising emotional cost. No reversals are needed; the single escalating constraint (tide) is sufficient for this length. Agency is continuous—every rung, seal, and cable connection is hers alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the ethical imperative to witness the unwitnessed. No character sermonizes; the thesis is performed when Mira speaks the twenty-three names aloud in empty rooms. The final release of the recordings reframes the opening image of “invisible things” as a social obligation, not a private gift. Ambiguity lingers—will the world listen this time?—yet the personal cost is undeniable, satisfying complexity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mira’s perceptual filter: rusted hatch “breathed inward,” detector “screamed,” ocean “exhaled.” Syntax lengthens during calmer beats, then fragments as water rises (“She worked faster.”), mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; interiority remains concrete (“counting rungs to keep the panic at bay”). Diction is consistent—technical when she calibrates gear, visceral when body intervenes—producing a voice that is literate yet spelunker-tough.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and double-duty: “water stains marked the walls at chest height” simultaneously paints setting and foreshadows submersion. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either image, stakes, or clock. Figurative language is spare—only two metaphors (“walls seemed to breathe,” “cables…veins”)—both earned and non-contradictory. Final paragraph’s cadence slows into iambs (“Tomorrow, she would release…”), giving the exit breath without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing claustrophobia with spelunking is not new, but pairing it with a drowned telecom monastery and tidal heist of ghost data feels fresh. The codex-as-memorial, ink that traps sunlight underwater, supplies a specific, non-generic ritual object. Risk is taken with the quiet ending—no press conference, only the promise of release—yet it coheres under Earned Stasis. Could edge higher if the recordings’ content offered one startling fragment, but restraint is defensible.</comment>
