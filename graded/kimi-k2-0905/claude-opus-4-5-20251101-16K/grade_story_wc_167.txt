<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and temperament are vividly fused, and her decision to keep throwing stones until forced to stop crystallizes her values with visible cost. Interiority is concrete—she notices “unremarkable” stones and “ghosts of the old” rings—yet the prose never slips into diagnostic self-talk. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; her conflict is wholly internal and credibly sustained. The earned stasis is palpable: she forecloses surrender by insisting on continued witness, paying with the certainty of eventual loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the final breath before contracts arrive reweights the premise—beauty exists only in the looking, and she keeps looking. The accumulative lens holds throughout: each cast stone thickens the pattern of interference and memory until the last image crystallizes options without resolving them. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“water’s edge before everything shifts”), well inside the 120-word window. Cost is legible in the single sentence “she would keep throwing them… until someone forced her to stop,” where the future passive “forced” carries the inevitable price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pearl Bay’s pre-dawn stillness and the prism atrium are not backdrop but tactical resources: the atrium supplies the colors that validate her life’s argument, the bay supplies the mercury-calm surface that makes interference patterns readable. The noctilucent clouds and mist are filtered through glazier optics—ice crystals “remembering” sunlight—so every sensory note is POV-colored. Spatial choreography is immaculate: stone, rings, mist, atrium glow track without drift. Environment constrains the final image: only this dawn light + this glass + this water produced the unrepeatable pattern she now holds in memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the atrium’s witness to mundane magnificence—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the ticking clock (“developers would arrive by noon”). Each stone cast is a micro-act of resistance that narrows her option to surrender; the growing rings literalize the expanding cost of refusal. No coincidence rescues her; pressure accumulates through her own insistence. The final beat does not resolve the external threat but crystallizes the internal stance, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—value is created by attentive looking—emerges through refracted light and interference patterns rather than assertion. The atrium’s rainbows and the pond’s rings return as reweighted variants in the last paragraph, making the closing image itself the thematic answer. No moral is stated; the reader must look, as Maren does, to see. Ambiguity is meaningful: the contracts are still coming, yet the momentary radiance is undiminished.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature—glass terminology, meteorological precision, tactile selection of “unremarkable” stones. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then tightens to “She threw the stone,” mirroring the arc of attention. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Prose rhythm is deliberate, but sentence openings vary and no template cadence dulls the ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—“The impact sent rings expanding outward through the patterns… and Maren watched them commune with the mist” advances action, image, and theme. Figurative language is sparse and accurate; no mixed metaphors muddy the closure. One minor scaffold: “expansion, interference, dissolution, memory” is a list that could be trimmed, but it occurs early and does not recur. Final third is clean; no artifact touches the last image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The harbor-glazier POV refracting global stakes through salvaged glass feels fresh, and thescientific metaphor of interference patterns as life philosophy is non-obvious. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure—no confrontation scene—but coherence is maintained. The “rainbow house” versus “eyesore” polarity could slide into trope, yet the specificity of “iron bones” and three-decade salvage rescues it. Not quite 9 because the external antagonist remains off-page and generic.</comment>
