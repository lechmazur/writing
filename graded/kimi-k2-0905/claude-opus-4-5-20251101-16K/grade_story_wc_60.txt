<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s “luminous skeptic” premise is vivid and the slow unlocking of the box shows embodied patience, but her interiority slips into thematic label-speak (“sidereal patience,” “defiant hush”) that abstracts rather than dramatizes contradiction. The mother-memory payoff lands, yet the missing mid-scene micro-choices under pressure keep the arc just short of full earned cost. Interior contradiction is asserted more than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: breadcrumb trail → descent → fused box → tender unsealing → fountains weep. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—memories flow, geese resume, Vera’s skepticism is quietly repriced—on-page cost is the twenty-three-day fingertip labor. Orientation is taught by line 3 and the lens stays causal; no teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>City of dry fountains is sketched with economical, sensory strokes; moss, cracked marble, broken grates filter through Vera’s goal-directed attention. The box’s colored glass and fused dust are micro-setting that literally constrain the final tactic (slow unsticking). While broader civic layout remains vague, the relevant environmental objects are tactile and choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories including her mother’s—is signaled early and tightens through one escalating constraint: haste would shatter the box. The 23-day endurance is a visible, felt price that forecloses quicker options and charges the final image. No reversals beyond the single deepening, but that is sufficient for the length; luck never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory must circulate, not be possessed—emerges organically from the fountains’ resurrection, not sermon. The glass box reweights from prison to canal; skepticism shifts from doubt to tender witness without explicit thesis. Final image of “laugh unstuck from time” offers resonant conceptual repricing. One soft line (“liberate trapped memories was not to possess them but to let them flow again”) nudges toward statement, but it is brief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Vera; perceptual signature favors light, water, texture, and patient quantification (“counted her steps, her breaths, her doubts”). Syntax lengthens and softens under fatigue, matching sidereal patience. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom is consistent and patterned, with taught elision (“Three days passed. / Then seven.”) that pays off in cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density. Occasional poetic uplift (“defiant hush,” “resistant quiet”) borders on overwritten but stays within voice contract. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; temporal sequence clear. One paraphrase loop (“memories of a thousand souls, trapped when the fountains ceased to flow”) repeated near opening and closing costs a sliver of momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fountain-city as memory-cistern is fresh, and the fused-glass box literalizes “unsticking time” in a way that feels inevitable. Breadcrumbs-as-clue subverts expectation of cryptic symbols, adding playful earthiness. Risk is moderate—lyric fabulism rather than radical form—but particulars (geese pause, fingernail unsticking) are specific to this tale. Does not fully escape soft-fantasy template, yet transformation is visible.</comment>
