<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—idolizing her father while hunting his lies—are vivid in the pocket-turning beat; her decision to dive and publish the weapons proof is earned by the prior journal discovery and costs her the last of paternal myth. Interiority is precise: “serene upheaval” and “architecture of lies” are character-specific, not stock. Marek functions mostly as sounding board; no status tension on page, so relationship bullet waived. Sundial pressed to chest in final image shows embodied cost; renunciation of legacy is legible.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because she finds the journals → stops believing; because canal depth is faked → she dives; because she photographs weapons → truth will surface. Closure is Decisive Change with felt cost—the cold sundial against skin marks her exile from guild lies. Anchors clear by line 3; no orientation debt. One transition (twilight → dawn) is legible and tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Canal narrows, depth darkens, trees lean—each environmental detail pressures the choice to dive; the water’s impossible depth literally enables the salvage beat. Amber warehouse lights mirrored in “thoughtfully clear” water reappear in dawn’s first light, charging the final image. Sundial as micro-setting constrains final gesture; its uselessness at night foreshadows the useless legend. Gate met: recurring object reweights closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—expose the lie—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when she opens the crate; option to stay silent is foreclosed by the camera flash. Cost is visceral: she surfaces to “morning radio silence,” now complicit in breaking guild control. Agency pure; no off-stage rescue. Escalation is single deepwater beat, sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of legends into weapons, not exposition. Final image—sundial against chest at dawn—conceptually re-prices “needing the sun” into needing truth; no moral stated. Architecture metaphor threads through without overt thesis. Ambiguity preserved: father’s fear vs betrayal left complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature strong: “amber lights…thoughtfully clear” is biased, poet-scientist seeing through water. Rhythm mirrors twilight drift in long sentences, then clipped “Two hours” under pressure. No dialogue between Elara/Marek until final utilitarian exchange; voice remains coherent. Compression like “errant legend seeker” taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Density high—“serene upheaval” packs oxymoron that advances mood. One metaphor stack at twilight reflection is brief and patterned, exempt from penalty. Final line “carrying secrets that would finally see the sun” is clean, propulsive closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: weapon-smuggling reframed as civic legend, not standard conspiracy. Hindsight clarity concept turned into tactile dive mechanics. Risk taken with quiet, lyric ending that still lands cost. Not radically novel, but particulars (pocket sundial, guild chronicler dynastic silence) feel specific to this world.</comment>
