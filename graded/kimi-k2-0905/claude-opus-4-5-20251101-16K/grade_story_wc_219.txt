<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid—her dismissal of “luminous skeptic” as armor, the amber memory, the shift from data to ache. Yet the climactic insight (“the need comes first”) is declared, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that enacts the renunciation of her former premise, only a voiced epiphany. The cost is conceptual, not embodied, so the arc feels 90 % earned, not fully paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fly amber’s final image reweights the entire premise—humans pay in longing, Visitors in rootlessness. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each footprint, statue, and new pilgrim thickens the pattern until the tower becomes a charged node. The cost is legible in the amber’s suspended flight, even though no single decisive action seals Vera’s change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The rain-darkened tower, bronze statues “listing with neglect,” and the amber’s honeyed light are filtered through Vera’s skeptical gaze, guiding her toward the recognition of ache. Spatial choreography stays clean as four strangers occupy the narrow summit without crowding the frame. The setting’s micro-details (weeds threading cracked stone) subtly mirror internal dislocation, and the amber’s final lift recharges the visual motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understand why humans must return—tightens when Vera realizes the Visitors’ freedom is their poverty. The deepening is intellectual, not tactical: no option is foreclosed on-stage, only re-valued. Pressure accumulates via converging footprints; the cost is felt in the amber’s stasis, but because Vera does not act against an external obstacle, the escalation is lyrical rather than dramatic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: homecoming as species-specific wound, beauty as fossilized yearning. The amber’s image reconfigures the central question without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Vera “withdrawing” the amber instead of brandishing it—and in the child’s unexplained dream. Final resonance is quiet but undeniable: the ache is the gravity we pay for being human.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera; perceptual signature is precise—“bronze quiet,” “dusty footprints troubled her with their precision.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at the tower edge, mirroring breath. No dialogue over two lines, yet each line carries subtext (astronaut: “You’re studying homecoming,” not asking). Voice remains distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, artifact-free. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“stones darkened to the color of old iron”—and never clutters the climactic beat. Information density is high; single sentences layer sensory data with conceptual tilt. Final paragraph repeats “amber” three times, but each recurrence re-inflects meaning, so the echo is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of xenobiology with fossilized grief feels fresh; the Visitors’ rootlessness reframed as deficiency is a sharp inversion. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure rather than plot twist, and it pays off in the final image. The piece could only exist in this form with this object; swap the amber for any heirloom and the fossilized flight metaphor collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Present early, shapes mid-scene insight (“I found that homecoming isn’t chemistry at all”), but no downstream action tests the stance; thus beats stop at declaration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Handled in pocket reveal, palm display, and final uplift; each touch reweights meaning from specimen to sacrament. Removal would implode the closing image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Concept drives stakes—footprints turn controlled study into collective ritual—but mechanics of how others learned of the protocol are elided, slightly blunting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Label seeded twice; trait enables her to challenge Institute orthodoxy, yet no on-page scene shows academic blowback or personal cost for rebellion.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Convergence is the story’s engine: footprints accumulate, strangers appear, final descent joins them. Without it, the tower moment is solitary and static.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Footprints are signaled early, tracked throughout, and their layering visualizes the pilgrimage’s growth; mechanics are simple but narratively indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Tower supplies vertical threshold and vantage for final image; rain-dark stone mirrors internal iron heaviness. Could another ruin serve? Yes, but the height is needed for overview.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Post-contact era frames Visitors’ contrast, yet no ticking clock or deadline pressures Vera; timeframe is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Motivation propels every reflective beat; the shift from measuring oxytocin to honoring ache is dramatized in her amber gesture, though external stakes stay conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Bronze quiet” modulates from morning light to voice timbre to emotional register; the hush intensifies as footsteps multiply, culminating in the suspended amber glow.</comment>
