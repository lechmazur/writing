<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment vs. private grief—are embodied in the ritual of sealing personal notes inside official repairs; the final endurance beside the “hushed blaze” crystallizes a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only minor slip is the single late explicit tag “stoically sensitive,” which momentarily abstracts what the scene has already shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drawbridge will rise again, the water keeps climbing, yet Maren’s secret archive reweights the pavilion’s erasure with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact/note layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality remains intact; no orientation debt; the last-line “refused, somehow, to be entirely gone” delivers the resonant reconfiguration on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The submerged pavilion’s waterline, marble cracks, and silted button constrain every movement and dictate the waterproof paper/epoxy tactic; the brass inkwell’s weight in her palm micro-sets the spatial choreography. Sensory selection is filtered through surveyor habit—measurement cues, archival recall—anchoring who-where-when by line three. Final amber light on the water recharges the opening “bones” image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—witness vs. erasure—tightens when each centimeter rise threatens the pavilion and her hidden archive; the act of sealing the brass button note in marine epoxy is the irreversible micro-choice that forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: waterline, artifact count, and personal risk accumulate to the final “hushed blaze” moment. Cost is visible—time, exposure, eventual loss—satisfying the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges through concrete sequence—marble, button, drawbridge—never named as thesis. The final image of vigil beside extinguishing light offers a non-literal answer: witness itself becomes the last bulwark against erasure. No late moralizing; the brass inkwell’s inherited weight quietly links personal and collective memory without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s surveyor gaze; perceptual signature is steady—measurements, archival dates, epoxy setting times. Syntax lengthens under emotional load then contracts to fragments (“Not erased”) at the vigil beat, mirroring tide rhythm. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her professional lexicon until the final lyric lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and taught early (“bones of something”) and paid off in the final amber blaze. One minor register lift—“conceptual archaeology”—is brief and motivation-consistent, not penalized under tightened rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The flooded-archive conceit feels fresh precisely because it resists spectacle: a bureaucrat-turned-clandestine-scribe weaponizes municipal repair epoxy against forgetting. Specific heirloomed inkwell and centimetered waterline transform familiar climate-grief into singular ritual. Risk is taken and fully committed to; no hedging.</comment>
