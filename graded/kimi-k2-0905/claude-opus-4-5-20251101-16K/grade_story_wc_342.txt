<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—her synaesthetic reading of faces via shadow-geometry is concrete, and the coin-touch epiphany is embodied. Yet the moment she “suddenly understood” is declarative, not dramatized; we’re told the limit flips to gift rather than shown the internal friction of that reversal. Earned stasis arrives, but the cost is asserted (“portraits that would finally hold souls”) rather than paid on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the oak-library’s dying hush layers tactile detail (bark walls, dust sift) until the coin’s fractal indentations break pattern and re-weight her art. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she walks away carrying “infinity in her pocket” while demolition cracks behind; the conceptual cost (library lost, old method gone) is legible. One transition (library → street) is clean; orientation anchor arrives by line 5. Non-closure deduction: −0.4 for slight explanatory nudge at epiphany.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Environment is filtered through haptic bias—bark-lined walls, jawline shadows, coin edges—so setting constrains how she “sees.” The library’s imminent collapse narrows time and sharpens every touch. Micro-setting (the coin) ultimately charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she find a way to paint soul before the library—and her old method—vanish? Pressure tightens when the safe yields only a coin; the indentations force a tactical shift from retina to fingertip. Cost is conceptual (centuries of books reduced to sawdust) and personal (she must abandon visual likeness), both felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through haptic vs. visual epistemology: limits are generative. Subtext ripples in the city’s willingness to “preserve what they couldn’t immediately use,” shadowing her own earlier dismissal of touch. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Slight abstraction in “the limit was the doorway” blunts perfect resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Mira’s synaesthetic perception; rhythm lengthens during tactile discovery then tightens into demolition crack. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Occasional elevated phrasing (“fractally precise”) fits the scholarly guild context and is taught early. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentences vary in length and opening. High information density—each paragraph advances choice or atmosphere. Two adjacent “she would” futures near end create minor template cadence; non-closure cap −0.3. No mixed metaphors or filler stacks. Opening and final lines frame stakes and reverb cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Core combo—face-blind portraitist + doomed oak library + tactile coin map—feels fresh yet inevitable. Vane’s historic mirror-of-sky idea is referenced rather than fully transformed, trimming the highest band. Risk in haptic epiphany is earned by prior detail, not gimmick. Derivative premise guardrail not triggered.</comment>
