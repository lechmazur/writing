<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s watchful-dreamer trait is embodied in her silent observation of David and her micro-choice to hand over the amber; the gesture crystallizes her shift from hoarding pain to offering shelter. Interiority stays concrete—fingers finding the pendant, feeling the honeyed hush—rather than diagnostic. The cost is legible: she relinquishes the talisman that once shielded her, signaling readiness to rebuild together. Brother’s late admission is credible because her prior silence forced him to fill the vacuum.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: pendant transfer reweights “keeping close” from self-protection to bridge-building, with felt cost (she no longer has the buffer). Causal chain holds: viral confession → sanctuary-seeking → brother’s tracked-down arrival → gift. Orientation is clean by line 15. One minor slack: “someone at the grief group said you come here” is off-stage intel, but it merely opens the scene and doesn’t resolve stakes.</comment>

<comment>The moss-coated server racks are not backdrop; their velvet silence pressures both siblings toward softness—Mira seeks to “learn that patience,” David crumbles under its hush. The drip-icicle craters in the concrete foreshadow slow transformation and mirror David’s thaw, charging the final hand-to-hand moment. Light, pollen, and rust are filtered through Mira’s biased attention, never touristic. Spatial choreography is stable: entrance silhouette, arm’s-length stop, pendant exchange track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether shared pain can become shared ground—tightens once: David’s remembered trauma collapses his denial and forecloses the old lie. Mira’s agency is the pendant proffer; it costs her immediate psychological armor and enables their only joint move. Pressure is accumulative/textural: silence plus moss-soft setting deepens until speech breaks; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible—she fingers the empty chain space—sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: preservation vs. transformation—amber entombs, moss reclaims; handing the pendant converts static preservation into active bridge. Subtext lives in gesture: the fly suspended for 40 million years parallels their frozen family myth, released only when amber changes hands. No moralizing final statement; the glowing bridge image reweights prior material. Complexity acknowledged: brother complicit yet wounded, no tidy absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mira; perceptual signature favors hushed, honeyed imagery and tactile detail—fingers, moss, velvet. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at David’s entrance (“Mira said nothing”), mirroring tension shift. No dialogue overreach; David’s two spoken lines carry subtext (“I made myself remember”). Filter verbs appear only when motivated (“she felt something shift”). Voice remains consistent without drumbeat patterns.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “golden afternoon light filtered through the collapsed ceiling, catching motes of pollen” does triple sensory duty. No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; “honeyed hush” recurs with purpose, not padding. One minor scaffold: “she came here to remember that some things could still be quiet” could trim to “she came for what still stayed quiet,” but it doesn’t touch closure. Opening and closing lines are sharp, bookending transformation.</comment>

<comment>Post-digital moss cathedral feels fresh, yet grows organically from real-world abandoned server farms. Viral confession as inciting trauma is contemporary but filtered through Mira’s sensory exile, avoiding headline cliché. Pendant-with-insect trope is familiar, yet repurposed as transferable shelter rather than static keepsake. Risk lies in quiet ending—no public reckoning—but commitment to soft reclamation makes the angle memorable.</comment>
