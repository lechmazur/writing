<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s shift from clinical detachment to self-exposure is embodied in the final palm-to-ivy gesture; the scar’s burn and the tear that “waters” the vine make the cost visceral. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the contradiction between “opening others to heal herself” versus “opening herself to heal them” is held in a single beat. The only bar to 9+ is that the turn is confessed more than dramatized: we are told she “understood then” rather than shown the instant she surrenders her armor. Still, the micro-choice is legible and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the displaced miracle is accepted, the message is delivered, and Vera’s role is permanently redefined—“She would become a conduit.” Cost is on-page: the fresh scar flares, tears fall, the hourglass starts—each a bodily or object-price for the new vocation. Causality is clean: missed-by-seconds miracle → accidental telepathy → ethical obligation → deliberate surrender. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“tower at dawn”), well inside the 120-word window. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower wall with threading ivy functions as both physical barrier and communication channel; its cracks literally guide Vera’s final gesture and transmit the message. Frosted hourglass, coffee cup rings, and the meteor-sky each return with reweighted meaning at the end, satisfying the 9+ gate that an object must constrain or charge the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—anesthesia fog, stone cold, ivy murmur—never touristic. Spatial choreography is tight: bedside table → window → wall, no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Vera will keep the miracle or transmit it—tightens once: from passive reception (“wondering if the drugs still gripped her”) to active surrender (“She pressed her palm…”). The tightening forecloses the option of private recovery; the price is the reopened wound and lifelong vocation. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Could edge higher if the garden’s gratitude created an immediate external consequence (e.g., ivy forcing through the bandage), but the internal cost is already legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of the healer’s axiom: to read you must open, not close. The ivy’s “We tunnel” and the scar’s whisper reweight the central question without moralizing. Subtext resides in objects—frozen sand, coffee rings—whose meaning shifts as Vera’s stance shifts. Final image (tears watering the vine) offers non-literal answer: grief is the water, openness the bloom. No thematic echo or platitude dilutes the effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is precise—meteor hush, anesthesia waves, ivy static—each metaphor organic to her wound-reading sensibility. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective sentences in bed, clipped imperatives during the wall-touch. No filter-verb clusters; diction remains within a medical-aesthetic lexicon. Voice is distinct and sustained under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the absence burning beneath the bandages” does double duty—physical pain + existential lack. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; each figurative vehicle extends the tunnel/network motif. Rhythm varies: caesura in “She tunnelled… through stone and silence” mirrors the act. One minor scaffold—”like fog lifting from a valley” could be cut—but it does not touch the closure beat. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of a miracle missing its target by thirty-two seconds and lodging in the “wrong” patient is fresh; the botanical telepathy trope is inverted into ethical burden rather than wonder. Specificity—coffee-ring bibliomancy, ivy root-network, hourglass measuring miracles—makes the concept feel inevitable to this character and place. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, because the scar-reader’s vocation is integral. Risky compression (800-word single-scene surgery recovery) heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
