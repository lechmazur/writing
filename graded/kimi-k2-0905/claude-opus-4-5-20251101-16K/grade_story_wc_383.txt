<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory stance—skeptic turned reluctant believer—remains embodied through tactile micro-choices (pressing shell to crystal). The final renunciation of inherited isolation is earned by the archival sequence; cost is legible. Interiority is specific, avoiding stock labels. One slip: the “charmed skeptic” label is stated, not dramatized at open, trimming the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each crystal activation tightens knowledge, narrowing options until dawn deadline forces the forgiving utterance. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—choice to walk toward village—felt cost on page (“pocketed the shell”). Orientation anchored by word 78; no drift. One micro-loop: “isolation had become…isolation mistaken” barely dulls propulsion, keeps sub-9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Velvet garden, crystalline resonators, and the seashell half form a micro-setting that constrains every beat; crystals literally gate memory flow, shell is handled six times. Sensory triage reflects twilight urgency—visual purple/gold shifts echo emotional turns. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Mira moves bed-to-bed. Setting charge meets 9- gate but does not yet reconfigure the final image under Q2’s lens, holding at 8.3.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—claim her archived past before star fade—signaled early; deadline visibly narrows tactical options. Each crystal touch escalates knowledge cost (grief, paternity, sacrifice), tightening under causal lens. Final choice to forgive and seek village forecloses continued exile with on-page articulation. Presence of felt but not physically dramatized cost keeps score just sub-8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as both poison and portal—emerges through crystalline images rather than assertion. Subtext of generational self-imprisonment lands in the final re-pricing: “alone by choice now.” No moralizing summary; ambiguity (unnamed threat that killed father) lingers. Slight over-articulation of “translate isolation into independence” nudges down from 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors haptic/tactile detail—shell edge “catching starlight,” crystals “humming.” Figurative register stays within Mira’s sensibility, no filter-verb clutter. Compression increases under dawn pressure: “The star faded. Morning light spilled…” Rhythm control tightens to closure without head-hop. One clause of elevated diction—“conceptual repricing” territory in “conceptual cost” thought—prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line work is lean: sentences pull double duty (action + atmosphere). No synonym loops or scaffold; metaphors consistent (shell as broken mirror/memory). Only minor intensifier (“tragically radiant”) could trim. Clause rhythm modulates, climax beat remains clear. No artifact touches closure; ceiling held at 8.6.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Quarantined memory” via singing seashell and emotion-tuned crystals offers fresh angle on familiar trauma-archive trope. Specificity of velvet garden horticulture plus resonance mechanics grounds concept. Risk of lyrical over-compression is mostly avoided. Premise not radically unfamiliar, but synthesis feels inevitable; reward solid 8.3.</comment>
