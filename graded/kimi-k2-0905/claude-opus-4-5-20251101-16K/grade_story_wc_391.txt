<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sera’s interior contradiction—grief-fired vengeance compressed into glacial patience—is dramatized through micro-choices (ice-testing, charting, dispatching runners) that visibly cost her sleep and safety. The brother-memory is anchored to present stimuli (moonlit ice) and tilts her stance each time. Final “earned stasis” refusal to rush the uprising is credibly paid for by three winters of calibrated risk. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-labeling; body signals (“the ice groans…that tension lives in her too”) externalize the split.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last paragraph crystallizes both imminence and indefinite delay—spring will melt the lake before the empire can recalibrate—reweighting all prior moon-maps with conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each frozen night, rain-charge, and unyoke signal thickens the lattice until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—magnetic viaduct—shapes every tactical decision and is re-invoked in the penultimate beat, satisfying 9+ proof test.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Basalt columns, black ice, and moonlit compass-needles recur with shifting emotional charge, constraining navigation and finale imagery. Micro-setting (the viaduct’s iron-stone pores) directly enables the regime’s blind spot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—cartographer notices gradients, magnetic variance, surface tension. Spatial choreography cleanly tracks messenger routes across the lake. Weather is causal, not backdrop: freezing unlocks the highway; thaw will lock it shut again.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberation without massacre—tightens when each moon-window shrinks: missed timing = death or starvation. Protagonist agency drives every beat: she decides when to test ice, when to dispatch, when to withhold battle. Visible price: three winters, brother’s ghost, nightly exposure. Final “unyoking” crystallizes the trade-off—permanent non-cooperation instead of one heroic clash—foreclosing the path Alek took.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: “to unyoke” becomes literal refusal to fill granaries rather than slogan. Lunar cycle as imperial heartbeat is never named theme—only mapped, exploited, and finally turned inward. Ending reprises frozen-lake image with reweighted meaning: what was highway becomes moat. No final-paragraph sermon; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Sera’s perceptual filters—compass needles “curse,” lake “sings warnings.” Syntax lengthens with patience, shortens under risk (“She gathers her charts.”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Free indirect style stays clean; filter verbs serve cartographer mindset (“she understands…she plots”). Metaphors are volcanic, not ornamental: “frozen flames” anchors premise.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between glacial cadence and knife-edge fragments. Information density high: one sentence often layers magnetic science, memory stab, and tactical consequence. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Opening line anchors voice + stakes; closing line resolves via image that recharges “frozen flames” motif. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geomagnetic physics with insurgent cartography feels inevitable yet fresh. “Patient glacier” revolution inverted from usual blaze-up trope; slowness becomes weapon. Viaduct-as-EMP and moon-phase supply chain are specific to this world—swap any element and the tactic collapses. Risk taken: quiet ending without battle, but coherence rewards gamble.</comment>
