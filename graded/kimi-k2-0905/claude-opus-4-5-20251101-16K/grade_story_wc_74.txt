<comment>Mira’s interiority is textured (“saffron threads dissolving in warm milk”), her insomnia and methodical hope are embodied through ritual brush-strokes, and her final renunciation of sleep lands as earned stasis under the Accumulative lens. The only minor gap: the brush’s hold over her is accepted rather than resisted, so we never see contradictory impulses collide in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canvas row of unread symbols becomes proof that “strangers remember kindness,” crystallizing her three-year vigil with conceptual cost—she forfeits sleep and recognition. Causality runs on accretion; each moon-cycle painting tightens the emotional stake until the vision of the kitchen re-weights the act. No telegraphing or soft resets; the old woman’s absence persists as constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rooftop greenhouse filters oxygen and moonlight, literally supplying the only air and illumination that let her perform the ritual; tomatoes and glass panels recur in tactile handling, grounding every beat. Smog below versus pale coin above mirrors her liminal consciousness without overt symbol-work. Spatial choreography holds as she steps back at dawn; no floating rooms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prove disappeared voices (and the giver) still matter. Pressure deepens by accretion—each new canvas adds urgency as anonymity and exhaustion accumulate. The kitchen vision is the single tightening that reframes the task from rescue to memorial; option narrows to perpetual witness. Cost is legible: three years of insomnia, empty exhibits, and the final acceptance of no audience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the reframing of preservation-as-kindness rather than salvage; the ending image of unread symbols makes the conceptual pivot that remembrance itself is the gift. No moralizing—meaning accrues via moon-lit pigment and the woman’s vanished laugh. The refugee sub-text stays particular, resisting abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perception; diction (“pale coin,” “saffron quiet”) is consistent, rhythmic, and filtered through her fatigue. No filter-verb clusters; moonlight and brush are felt rather than labeled. Voice modulates: longer cadences for trance, clipped fragments at dawn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lines multi-task: “tomato vines and basil plants that filtered what little oxygen they could” shows scarcity, body, and micro-setting in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent (moon → coin, symbols → rivers) and never stall propulsion. Only hairline slip: “methodically hopeful” edges near label-speak but is immediately dramatized by the row of canvases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The insomnia-as-archive conceit feels fresh; lost languages transmitted by moon-stone brush fuses fantasy with ecological grief without exposition dumps. The refugee gift thread subverts white-savior trop by making the act one-sided and unverifiable. Risk taken in quiet ending pays off via earned stasis.</comment>
