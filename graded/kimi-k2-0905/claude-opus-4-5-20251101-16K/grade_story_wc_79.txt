<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirin's quiet drive is shown through obsessive pattern-tracing and the final whistle blast; the refusal to weep keeps her from sentimentality. Interiority is concrete ("ink," "charts spreading like shed skin") and embodied under pressure. The final choice—summoning the watchers—carries visible cost as the city fractures; her steady hands sell credible resolve. Yet no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; she never hesitates, so the arc is pure escalation rather than internal clash.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: spiral shells, cracks, and whistle notes layer until the pattern itself wakes the watchers. Closure lands as Charged Poise—watchers crack awake, city begins descent, Mirin lifts ink—cost is the irreversible start of apocalypse. Orientation is swift (turtle-shell city, 37th day, west-shore cracks). One textual hiccup: "directions that shouldn't exist" is abstract, but it neither breaks causality nor dulls the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is built from tactile bone architecture: vertebral rises, eye-socket houses, calcified shores. The watchers' scale and stillness are economically sketched; their first footstep lands as an environmental shift that reweights every prior detail. Sun-bleached whiteness threads dread through each beat and charges the final gold-horror image. Micro-setting (nautilus grooves, reed whistle) constrains Mirin's decoding actions, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"understand before the city dies"—is signaled early and tightens as cracks radiate watcher-ward. The single meaningful intensification: whistle-question → watchers wake, shell rupture accelerates, exit foreclosed. Cost is legible in the groaning descent and Mirin's explicit acceptance of witness-role. No secondary reversal is attempted; escalation is linear but coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern vs. rupture: knowledge inscribed in spirals repaid by breaking. Final image of "horizon beginning to walk" reweights all mapping effort into terrible answer without moralizing. Subtext of witness complicity is carried by Mirin's steady ink gesture. Quiet refusal to explain "ready for what" preserves ambiguity and avoids thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Mirin's perceptual filter: calcium ridges, reed weight, spiral grammar. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly elevated to match cartographer precision without drifting into purple. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction ("cartographic secrets," "language of spirals") that remains consistent. Compressed elision ("thirty-seven days had passed") is taught early and paid off in accelerating cracks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but clean; figurative vehicles (spirals as speech, cracks as reply) stay coherent and purposeful. No filter-verb stacks, loops, or scaffold. Varied sentence length mirrors tension climb; final paragraph holds long breath then snaps with "first step in ten thousand years." One negligible tic: repeated "quietly driven" becomes deliberate motif rather than accidental repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses extinct megalith-turtles, lithic watchers, and cartographic necromancy into an image set that feels inevitable yet unseen. Pattern-language decoding and apocalyptic reply via structural collapse offer fresh mechanics for cosmic horror. Risk of abstract stakes is countered by grounded shell-crack cartography. Transformation test fails—plot is inseparable from turtle-bone city; specificity anchors novelty.</comment>
