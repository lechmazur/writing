<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Maren’s want-to-find-where-echoes-are-born is clear, but the only on-page beat that forces her to decide anything is the final “borrow deeply” moment; until then she observes and reacts. The interiority is vivid (“she felt herself age… possibilities close”) yet never pits contradictory impulses against one another under pressure. Cost shows in silver hair, but it lands after the single decision, so the arc feels front-loaded with gorgeous seeing and back-loaded with a single paid withdrawal.</comment>

<comment>Earned Stasis closure lands cleanly: Maren chooses irreversible time-debt, uncages the spirits, and we see silver hair as visible cost. Causal chain from hummingbird test → canal journey → amber cracking → giant waking holds, each because/therefore step borrowing future minutes. Orientation is firm within 120 words (rooftop canal, skiff, three-hour clock). One minor slack: the off-stage “someone” who locked the cadence is never hinted at earlier, so the antagonistic force feels retro-fitted rather than fore-shadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The copper-bright canals, temporal amber, and echo-spirits are rendered through Maren’s illustrator eye, making each descriptor a tool that guides her next sketch or choice. Micro-setting (infinity pendant against collarbone) literally sculpts the final tactic. Spatial choreography stays clean across the skiff moves and giant breathing. Only the Giant’s physiology (“body curved like a mountain range”) stretches baseline physics, but the piece cues altered reality early, so verisimilitude holds under its own rules.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—restore echoes before the Giant wakes—tightens once: amber cracking costs future minutes and strands her visibly older. Agency sits squarely with Maren at every freeze/re-start of water. No arbitrary luck rescues her; the Giant’s stirring merely raises ambient pressure. Cost is legible on-page (“silver threading through her hair”), satisfying the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The piece quietly equates artistic witness with moral responsibility: observation without intervention equals complicity. That idea emerges through the interrupted cadence image and Maren’s ultimate refusal to leave the spirits caged, never through exposition. Final image—her “faithful, singing shadows”—re-weights the pendant’s debt without moralizing. The theme invites counter-readings (did she doom herself? save the world?) yet stays coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: attention to translucent moths, iridescent stillness, cadence of water all filter through an illustrator’s synesthetic gaze. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure—“time rushed through her like a river”—without breaking clarity. No head-hopping; POV stays tight to Maren. Prose texture (glass singing, copper-bright) feels organic to her vocation, not ornament stapled on.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; most lines do two jobs (“channeling rainwater and starlight”). Occasional stacked modifiers (“luminous, barely corporeal, and heartbreakingly beautiful”) flirt with purple but appear in a caloric beat, not at climax, so momentum survives. No loops or synonym churn; pronouns track cleanly. Opening and closing lines both recharge motif (pendant hum / singing shadows), meeting the ear-test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of time-sculpt jewelry + giant alarm clock + echo-breeding spirits feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky elevation (rooftop canals) is tethered to sensory specificity rather than quirky ornament. Premise commits fully: borrowed minutes must be repaid on-page. One slight echo of “borrowing time” tropes keeps it from the top sliver, but the illustrator-eye angle transforms the familiar.</comment>
