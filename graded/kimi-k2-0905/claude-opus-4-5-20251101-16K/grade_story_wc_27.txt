<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s awkward confidence, barefoot sensitivity, and need “to understand” are cleanly dramatized through the opera-glass scan and the decision to walk the circle. The interior contradiction—logic vs. bone-deep hum—is present but stays verbal (“Mira knew better”) rather than manifesting as simultaneous embodied impulses. The final crystallized stance costs her nothing palpable on the page; she leaves buoyant rather than bearing visible price for the reignition she claims. Characterization is solid, but the beat that should lock the arc lands as declaration, not paid-for endurance or irreversible choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: single POV, bay, twilight, three-week lull. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory pass thickens the pattern until the hum becomes a map. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira exits with the constellation-pattern internalized, rebellion re-weighted. Cost is conceptual, not felt—she sacrifices nothing concrete—so the beat rings inspiring but not irreversible, capping the score below 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Abandoned repair bay is sketched through cold metal, skeletal ships, and collapsing dome—details filtered by Mira’s barefoot proprioception and vintage-lens vision. The opera glasses act as micro-setting, constraining perception and finally revealing the star-map light-threads that rewire her mission. Spatial tracking holds as she climbs, kneels, walks the circle. Environment is purposeful and tactile, though the Authority’s off-stage menace stays generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: re-ignite a stalled rebellion. Pressure escalates via pattern-accretion: silence → hum → visible star-map → charged directive. No antagonist appears, but the lull itself functions as erosive force. The tightening is conceptual rather than tactical; options narrow only inside Mira’s perception, so the cost remains off-page, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—meaning persists in wreckage—emerges through the uncovered stone circle and the shift from mourning to reignition. Subtext stays implicit; no character moralizes. The final image of barefoot woman carrying star-map achieves Conceptual Repricing: rebellion’s premise rewired from material salvage to ancestral resonance. The idea is fresh, but its cost is still abstract, preventing a 9+ landing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps tight psychic distance; diction (“ribbons of dying gold,” “thunderous serenity”) mirrors Mira’s operatic tilt without purple drift. Rhythm modulates: long sensory sentences contract into clipped resolve. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Perceptual signature—barefoot vibration, brass lenses—remains distinctive through the final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, and largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“she would carry…she would show”) softens the final paragraph. Metaphors stay coherent (dying gold, thunderous serenity). No grammar artifacts. Information density high; each sentence layers sensation or stakes. A 9+ gate is blocked by two adjacent “she would” future loops that slightly dull the exit momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of stone-circle mysticism with derelict spaceport feels non-obvious; the rebellion reboot via sacred geometry rather than tactics offers fresh inflection. Vintage opera glasses repurposed as frequency detector provide specific, memorable instrument. While “lost ancient power” is familiar terrain, the settlers’ sacred geometry seeded beneath launch-scaffolding carries enough particularized detail to avoid template drift. Risk is moderate, not radical.</comment>
