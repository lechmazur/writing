<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her scientific ache, the thaw of “calcified bitterness” into cosmic joke—but the decisive renunciation (leaving with no data) is under-motivated on-page; we’re told her grief yet never see her confront the Institute’s demand in scene, so the final sacrifice feels assumed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each surreal garden image layers density until the arrowhead’s reprise crystallizes the cosmic joke; closure lands with visible cost—she abandons career and credibility—yet the Institute’s off-stage menace remains abstract, blunting the tightening’s edge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Underground garden is tactile: frostbitten lavender, hovering water beads, ceiling soil; the arrowhead micro-setting constrains her hand, then charges the final image when re-planted. Spatial choreography is pristine—no impossible moves—and the inverted gravity rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake—personal integrity vs scientific proof—signals early; tightening occurs when arrowhead points at her chest, forcing choice. Cost is legible: she forfeits data and career. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes because the Institute threat is ambient, not imminent, keeping escalation one-note.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief-turned-cosmic-joke emerges from images (upside-down lavender, unaged son) never abstract assertion; final smile reweights prior bitterness without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—was the son real?—inviting reflection while keeping emotional honesty intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is scientist-filtered—“gravitationally playful,” “static-laden confessions”—with rhythmic control in frost-crack cadences. No head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly fuses Elena’s lexicon with lyrical compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long botanical clauses contract to staccato “Static-laden confessions.” High density—every sentence layers image or knowledge; zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent within inverted-physics rule-set; no register drift. Clean copy; strong verbs anchor every beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptid memoir meets grief-garden surrealism; “gravitationally playful” as literal physics, not whimsy. Inversion trope is transformed through Margit’s bitter motherhood, not generic upside-down décor. Risky refusal of data-heist payoff pays off thematically; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
