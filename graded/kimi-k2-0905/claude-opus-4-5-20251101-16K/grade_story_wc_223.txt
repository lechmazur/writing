<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s survivor trauma and “benevolent ruthlessness” are vividly particularized; the embodied recall of collapse rubble grounds every move. Yet her present-tactic agency is thin—she walks, whispers, lifts a queen, but no micro-choice inside the gallery visibly raises the cost or narrows her options. The arc is less a change than a ritual re-enactment, so the required earned shift lands as mood, not decision. Still, interior contradiction and sensory specificity keep her convincingly alive under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the walls return REMEMBER softer, crystallizing her lifelong stance with the cost of endless, pawn-less repetition. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each whispered name layers density until the dome itself becomes archive. No causal reversal occurs, but the final image reweights all prior walking/beats without contradiction. Orientation is swift; the 120-word anchor clears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustic rule is concrete, exploited, and final-image-charged; the chessboard’s absent pawns function as micro-setting that mirrors Mira’s mission. Light’s “nomadic penumbra” is tracked in motion, guiding her footfalls. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound>sight) filters through trauma-biased perception. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single circuit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep vanished gestures from oblivion”—is clear from line one. Pressure accumulates via each whispered name, tightening the emotional density rather than external jeopardy. No option narrows and no new cost is exacted inside this beat; escalation is tonal, not tactical. Sufficient for lyric/accumulative mode but stays in mid-band because the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: historical erasure vs. individual witness. Subtext lives in the pawn-less board and the returning whisper that is “softer,” implying consent of stone to bear memory. No moralizing line distills the idea; the final image lets the reader feel the unending burden. Complexity is honored—the history she saves is fragmentary, the price eternal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s synesthetic perception; diction skews to archival metaphors (“equation with lowest terms erased”) that fit her historian mind. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for drifting light, staccato name-list for beats. No head-hop or register drift. The slight abstraction is voice-motivated and pattern-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence doubles duty (image + theme). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language peaks at the closure beat (“luminous absence… silence that speaks louder than presence”) but is earned by prior acoustic setup. One clause (“history books would chronicle…”) edges toward editorial, but momentum absorbs it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing crisis-actor trauma with whispering-gallery acoustics to archive the “pawn-less” dead feels fresh and specific. The concept of walking typography is taught early and paid off in the returning softened word. Risk lies in the lyric, almost static arc, yet coherence holds. Not radically unprecedented, but synthesis is memorable.</comment>
