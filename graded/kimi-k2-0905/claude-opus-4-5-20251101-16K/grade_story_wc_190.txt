<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses (professional detachment vs. unspoken grief-tending) stay embodied: she steers, watches the vial, modulates breath. One micro-choice—offering the “space that holds you” line—reconfigures the passenger’s posture and the glass; cost is the emotional labor she can never bill for. Passenger’s arc is credible renunciation: jaw tight → hands unclench → walks away carrying the quiet she midwifed. No interior head-hop; her eleven-year fatigue flickers through without expository label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each refracted image and storm-glass feather thickens emotional density until the final cadence shift—“they realize they were never enemies”—reweights silence from hostile to hospitable. Causality is present yet subordinate: glass movement correlates with, rather than causes, internal change. Closure lands as Charged Poise: passenger exits with newly crystallized quiet, Mira turns back toward incoming echo; cost is legible in her perpetual return to others’ grief. Orientation anchored by line 8; transitions clean; no prop or rule violations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism terrace, rotating platforms, and liquid-metal light constrain trajectory and pacing—gondola must weave around mobile hazards, forcing slow time. Storm-glass doubles as micro-setting/tool: its shifting crystals dictate Mira’s conversational timing and final diagnostic. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s professional filter: frequencies beneath speech matter more than color, yet color still paints the man’s face, externalizing change. Final image of echo thinning into “something almost visible” reuses environmental rule to charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the passenger exit without hostile silence? Pressure tightens through glass response—dense cloud → feathering → clarity—mirroring internal shift rather than external obstacle. No antagonist; escalation is tonal and physiological: hum of interference lowers as man admits “I still can’t manage it,” then lowers further when Mira reframes silence as invitation. Cost is emotional exposure for him, perpetual absorption for her; option foreclosed is his former corrosive rumination loop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refracted particulars: transit as emotional purgatory, silence as space that “makes room.” Subtext resides in glass choreography and the man’s unclenching hands—no authorial thesis. Final reweighting: silence stops being an accuser and becomes an invitation, resonant without moralizing. Image of Mira “listening for the echo’s end” echoes opening, now re-priced as hopeful rather than desolate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder, filtering perception through her occupational ear and lexicon (“corrosive rumination,” “barometric pressure of grief”). Syntax lengthens during explanatory passages, then compresses at peak insight—“Silence becomes hostile when we fill it with our own accusations.” Dialogue sparse, distinct from narration: passenger’s two clipped lines contrast Mira’s measured cadence. No head-hop; perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anacoluthon sentences mimic gondola glide, short declaratives mark glass shifts. Figurative language is selective—only one metaphor per beat—avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor scaffold: two instances of “prismatic” in fifty words but within permissible pattern reinforcement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Venetian gondolier with quantum-crystal therapist feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Storm-glass as emotional stethoscope refreshes both steampunk and grief-parable tropes. Conceptual risk—no physical antagonist, only frequency—pays off via accrued texture. Removing any image (echo, glass, refracted light) collapses the emotional math; transformation test passed.</comment>
