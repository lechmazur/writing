<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Morrow’s “stories walls have heard” obsession is concrete—she palms stone, climbs, hangs tapestry—so the trait drives every micro-choice; no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her, so the interior stays one-note and caps the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each layer (diary, palm-reading, tapestry) deepens the same stake—recover lost dreams—until the final image reweights the world with undeniable cost; orientation is fixed by line 4, transitions are clean, and the closure beat (“the silo absorb her grief”) lands as Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silo curvature, bronze light, and fireplace ash are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Morrow’s descending emotion; the tapestry fragment finally acts as micro-setting that charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate even while the exterior world stays deliberately vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can dreaming be remembered?—tightens once: diary → wall-memory → tapestry reprise; the tightening is textural, not causal, but the final hanging forecloses her retreat to mere collecting and the price (wet eyes, sitting in darkness) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: collective memory as surrogate for lost dreams; dragons–tapestry–bronze quiet form a returning triad that reconfigures meaning at the end; no moralizing, only the felt cost of enduring a dreamless age.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Morrow’s haptic vocabulary—grain dust, sediment of secrets—syntax lengthens then compresses with her rising wonder; no head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the final cadence slows to mimic “echo, memory, ghost.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (information + image), rhythms modulate without algorithmic loops, metaphors stay coherent; one clause (“books spiraled upward like a chambered nautilus”) flirts with excess but does not stall the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Dreamless apocalypse + wall-whispering historian + tapestry dragons synthesize into an image-set I haven’t seen; the concept risks gimmick yet commits fully, and the quiet ending turns the premise inward rather than retreating to spectacle.</comment>
