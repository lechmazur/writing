<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is lucid—she refuses to let “coldness calcify”—and her decisive empathy drives every beat. Yet the interior contradiction promised by “empathetically decisive” is asserted, not dramatized; she never hesitates or pays a visible price for her certainty. The choral librarian identity is vivid through her humming calibration of wheels, but her final choice (placing the weight on the altar) is symbolic rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Still, her voice is specific enough to anchor the communal arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town “begun, at last, to remember itself whole” reconfigures the stake with undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pass of the cuckoo weight thickens pattern until the midnight strike crystallizes the new stance. Causality is clean—Mira’s multilingual invitations cause the gathering; the stories cause the braid—no late rule changes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Stellarium Tower”) and never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tower’s brass zodiac wheel, the pine weight’s heft, and the triple districts’ geography are tactile and selective. The clock mechanism itself functions as micro-setting: neutral ground that “belonged to no single nation,” directly enabling the convergence. Starlight filtering through glass mirrors internal thaw, but the image is woven through action, not pasted on. Spatial choreography is flawless—forty-three bodies climb, circle, descend without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair fractured town—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens as each linguistic group risks proximity. The single deepening occurs when Jozsef, Clara, Klaus supply memories that foreclose the option of permanent silos; the cost is the emotional exposure each speaker pays. No reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; density of shared stories reweights the stake. Price is visible in cracked voices and threatened tears, though a sharper tangible loss (time, social capital) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—community as mechanism requiring every voice—emerges from the clock/choir metaphor rather than sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: the weight passed hand to hand replaces spoken apology. Final image of starlight “illuminating a town that had begun…to remember itself whole” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. The refusal to declare victory keeps complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: her humming against “cold from stone,” her cataloguing of fractures. Syntax is rhythmic, liturgical—“Hungarian welcome flowing into Portuguese pleasantries”—mirroring choral blending. No head-hopping; when crowd speaks, we remain outside their heads, hearing only the timbre of voices. Register remains elevated but consistent with Mira’s librarian precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—“starlight filtering through the tower’s great glass dome”—and never clogs high-pressure beats. One mixed metaphor cluster (“mechanism of community required every voice to function”) is minor. Information density is high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, character, and world-rule. Final line earns its lift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing astronomical clock, multilingual hymn fragments, and cuckoo weight into a parable of post-ethnic healing feels fresh, not checklist. The weight’s reprise as communal talking-stick reconfigures a household trinket into civic tool. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than triumph—but coherence justifies it. Could edge higher if a single unexpected detail (clock gear failure, dissenting voice) had complicated the harmony.</comment>
