<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—scientist craving maternal absolution—embodies the “eclectic pacifist” label, but the epiphany is delivered in therapeutic summary (“I understand now”) rather than a final embodied choice; the cost is felt but not dramatized in a micro-action, keeping the arc just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the locked diary, still unread, is re-valued from puzzle to relic of forgiven love—an undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens; causality within the tune-and-catalogue pattern holds, with only minor drift in reflective paragraphs that slightly dilute tension before the fireworks image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The skylight stars, humming glass tubes, and copper coils form a tactile micro-setting that constrains Vera’s tuning actions; selective sensory detail mirrors her inward listening, though the town festival remains off-stage garnish rather than interactive pressure, capping the score just below the 8.5 gate that demands environment alter the final tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering unspoken maternal love via silence-cataloguing—tightens once when Vera hits the “regret” frequency and chooses to carry the still-locked diary; escalation is textural rather than causal, but a visible price is paid in her cracked-voice admission, satisfying short-form pressure even without external opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely through the reframing of silence from data to sorrow, avoiding explicit moral; the diary’s clasp and the untriggered fireworks reweight empathy as acceptance of unknowability—yet a faint therapeutic gloss in the final paragraph keeps it from full 9-band resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, measured rhythm mirrors Vera’s listening obsession; patterned diction (“silence forty-seven…”) is taught early, paid off in the numbered final whisper. No dialogue, so no voice leak; perceptual signature is sharp, though one clause (“theatrical sincerity she could not suppress”) momentarily advertises itself, clipping the 9.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image plus emotional decoding—without scaffold; figurative control is sure (“stars peered through like curious witnesses”). Only minor loop risk in repeated “silence of…” anaphora, but it serves pattern, not padding, and never obscures the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “tuning frequencies to read emotional residue” conceit repurposes psychometry into fresh speculative territory; combining it with an unopened diary flips the expected reveal, making the refusal to unlock the book the emotional twist. Specificity of radio dials and needle twitches grounds the novelty, earning the high band without gimmickry.</comment>
