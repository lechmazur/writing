<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s skeptical-yet-open stance is credibly embodied in the twice-over handling of the tile; the “courageously kind” trait costs her weeks of emotional labor, a price shown on-page. Interiority is specific to her profession of cataloguing phenomena, never drifting into diagnostic speak. The final renunciation—placing the tile back, becoming listener-scribe—grows directly from established motives and closes the arc with visible fatigue as cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elena finishes transcription, returns the tile, forecloses personal ownership while establishing the tower as memory-library; cost is her exhaustion and relinquished certainty. Causal chain holds—tile handling → memories flood → study → transcription → release—without gaps. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; lens is Causal throughout. Persistent constraint (emotional debt of others’ memories) shapes nightly work and final decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tower, tile, and migrating whales form a tactile micro-setting that constrains action: open platform exposes Elena to whale-song frequencies that mirror memory “harmonics,” reinforcing her choice to listen rather than possess. Specific sensory triangulation—salt air, stone pedestal, obsidian weight—grounds every reflective beat. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the repeated pickups/sets of the tile. Final image of wheeling stars reuses early pedestal axis, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve or release accumulated memories—tightens once: initial overwhelming flood → deliberate transcription → public bequest. Agency is continuous (study, cross-reference, nightly writing); price is exhaustion and altered worldview. No coincidence resolves tension; whale departure marks time but does not intervene causally. Cost is legible in “worked through exhaustion” and final relinquishment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: attention as secular sacrament—recording without owning—argued through tile, whales, star charts. Subtext runs via echoing “unheard symphony” phrase, quietly repriced when Elena becomes its newest scribe. No overt thesis statements; final line’s “write down the notes” is image-driven, not moralizing. Complexity preserved: skeptic remains skeptical yet acts devotionally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elena’s perceptual lens: mathematical noticing, sensory filtering of sub-audible whale song, archival diction (“cataloguing phenomena”). Syntax lengthens under fatigue, shortens during first tile shock—rhythmic fidelity to stress. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Free indirect discourse (“She still didn’t call it magic”) keeps modest uncertainty, aligning with skeptical trait.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “dark shapes breaching through silver waters” does triple sensory duty in six words. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught—“harmonics in a chord” returns in memory layering—no mixed metaphors near closure. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Final paragraph varies cadence, releasing into quiet resonance without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Neuro-mathematical memory-storage via engraved tile feels fresh against familiar “inherit grandmother’s gift” frame; rigorous refusal to term it magic distances piece from genre cliché. Integration of whale migration as temporal metronome and sonic metaphor is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specific scholarly transcription process, not abstract ritual, drives resolution. Risk in quiet ending heightens rather than hedges emotional stakes.</comment>
