<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“cold and patient” jar, trembling hands). The maternal reveal instantly re-codes Mira’s life-long urge to steal, giving her a credible, costly pivot to guardian. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the high band is barely missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: flower-code → seat → maternal portrait → moon-beam decryption → tomorrow’s assassination warning. Closure is a decisive shift from profit to protective theft, cost legible in “she began planning her next theft—not for profit.” No orientation or telegraph problems.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Emerald Station’s jade tiles refract both sunset and moonlight, a living threshold that mirrors Mira’s transitional vocation. The jar’s cold hum and the moon-silver spill are micro-settings that directly enable the decryption beat. Spatial choreography is clean; no clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of prophetic portraits—tightens when Mira learns the paintings scream warnings she must act on. One visible price: the assassin tip she can’t ignore, foreclosing her mercenary path. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “collecting endings” emerges through the decrypted warnings, not exposition. Final image of “catching… light before it disappeared” reweights earlier thefts as urgent rescue. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close, filtering perceptions through Mira’s light-thief sensorium (“light became something you could almost taste”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under shock. Distinct, consistent, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high density (“thirty-seven portraits… whispered secrets she couldn’t quite hear”). One mixed metaphor (“dual assault” of sunset/moon) is minor. No loops, no scaffold, strong propulsion to final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Golden-hour portraiture as encoded prophecy feels fresh and is rigorously followed. Flower-code smuggling, moon-beam decryption, and maternal time-bomb cohere into a singular mythic yet tactile world. Risky conceit fully realized.</comment>
