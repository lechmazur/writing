<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s dual identity as net-weaver and verse-weaver is vivid, but the interior contradiction between obedience and rebellion is told more than dramatized; the final “orchid solace” is earned yet the council threat arrives too late to test her under pressure. Still, her lifetime craft-to-verse synesthesia permeates every tactile beat and the needle-through-dust micro-choice seals the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: seventeen embroidered canopies tighten the pattern until the glowing verse ripple reweights the labyrinth from ruin to reverence; the warm plate against the hip is a legible conceptual cost. Orientation is swift (tide-pools/entrance anchored by line 3), transitions clean, no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Red dust, salt spirals, phosphorescent thread—each sensory notch is filtered through Mira’s wharf-honed priorities and literally constrains the sewing action. The canyon’s crumbling anchors dictate canopy placement; the micro-setting of bone needle vs stone dust charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sacredness to heal sleepwalkers—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each sewn canopy heightens risk of council discovery while deepening luminous beauty. No visible price (fatigue, thread shortage) is shown on-page, keeping it from the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the loom itself: reclamation through craft. The final indigo breath reconfigures the premise—ruin can be re-verenced, but only by acts that defy erasure. No moralizing; the image of glowing thread rippling through stone carries the conceptual reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, salt-tinged diction stays inside a wharf-poet’s lexicon; rhythmic control (“spiraling salt patterns on stone”) escalates to the short, breath-stop finale. No head-hop, no filter clutter; purposeful elision (“she works via overlapping sleepwalking paths”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: each sentence braids action, memory, and sensory detail. Figurative language is restrained until the climax where the mixed metaphor of labyrinth “breathing” is earned by prior tidal imagery. No scaffold, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sleepwalker cartography transmuted into sacred embroidery feels inevitable yet unforeseen; the copper plate’s unseen book becomes a literal pattern for canopies. Risk—defying council taboo—heightens stakes without gimmick. Synthesis of maritime craft and canyon ritual is specific to this voice.</comment>
