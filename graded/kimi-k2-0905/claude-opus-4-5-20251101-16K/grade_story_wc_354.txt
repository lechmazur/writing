<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—thumb on stone, chess logic in memory—and her endurance is credibly rooted in past choice. Yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the exile stance is static, so the “peace” feels arrived at rather than fought for again. The worry-stone ritual supplies embodied repetition but never forces a new micro-choice under fresh pressure. Earned, but barely escalated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spinning needles and song crystallize her ongoing exile with felt cost (“she would break it again”). Causality holds—covenant breach → exile → rotation—but the present beat is observational; no fresh because/therefore narrows options tonight. Orientation is clear by word 60; lens stays accumulatively textured. One tightening would push it higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Magnetic nexus confounds tracking spells, a setting-as-constraint that directly enables her survival; twilight palette is filtered through her worn attention. Basalt outcrop, valley echo, and compass needles supply tactile anchors without catalogue. Spatial logic is clean; weather and rock temperature affect her skin and decision timing. Micro-setting (stone in palm) parallels exile curvature and recurs at closing image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—stay ahead of Abendroth’s hunters—signals early; moon-phase clock tightens departure. No new reversal occurs tonight; pressure is accumulative memory rather than fresh external threat. Cost is retrospective (loss of home, student) rather than newly paid on this page. A single present-tense obstacle or temptation would deepen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—beauty carved from difficulty—emerges via chess pedagogy, stone wear, and nightbird song; no explicit sermon. Final image of “stubborn, precious hope” is earned through stated willingness to re-break the covenant. Ambiguity lingers: peace co-exists with perpetual flight. Subtext of silence-as-language threads without thematic echo cliché.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: magnetic chaos, stone dent, chess patterning. Syntax lengthens with reflective memory, shortens in sensory now; rhythm mirrors twilight fade. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within her lexicon (“correlate the evidence,” “architecture of patience”). Distinctive, controlled, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense—figurative layering in almost every sentence—but pattern is taught early (“needles spun lazily… everything and nothing”) and sustained, so reads intentional rather than purple. No mixed metaphors; basalt / volcanic / eclipse imagery coheres. One paraphrase loop (“difficult… difficulty”) costs −0.2. Final image of scattered pawns lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy covenant-chase is familiar, but fusion with geomagnetic nexus and chess pedagogy feels fresh. “Translating silence” as investigative method and exile rotating through liminal nodes twist stock tropes. Risk level moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversal—but execution is coherent. Specificity of worry-stone dent and eclipse oath counters generic feel.</comment>
