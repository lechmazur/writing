<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Helena’s sensorial history and present numbness are embodied through concrete contact (palms on stages, fingertips on phonograph), contradictions felt inside the same instant, and micro-choices (wind the broken machine again) that steadily expose her hierarchy of values—silence over sound, re-feeling over safety. The final renunciation of “chasing lost sound” is fully prepared by the filament beat and lands with visible cost: tear-salt, a tightened chest, a return to students that accepts permanent deafness. Interiority stays particular, avoids diagnostic labels, yet the emotional arc is slightly smoothed by an almost therapeutic symmetry of loss→reversal→wisdom, keeping it beneath the true 9-band where contradiction would cut deeper in the closing moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“gray tide drowning everything”) and holds: each backward record adds density to the filament of hush until the pattern break/peak image (“filaments…stitching the torn places”) reweights the stake with undeniable cost. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“drum maker's cavern”), causality remains coherent (because needle drags backward → therefore she feels silence → therefore she stays), and closure is a Charged Poise: she leaves with earned stance & persistent constraint (still deaf, now electively listening to silence). No causal slips or convenient amnesia; only the mildest curve below 9.0 because the texture escalates so smoothly it borders on aesthetic inevitability rather than risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cavern geometry, scattered drum types, and oak outside are sketched with economy; every tactile detail (tarnished green horn, rough bark) is filtered through Helena’s vibration-hungry fingertips. The phonograph-as-micro-setting constrains every turning beat and supplies the final image-charge, satisfying the 9-band gate for environment constraining choice. Spatial choreography is clean; only the sky-wide “autumn evening” line feels slightly postcard, preventing a full 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through intensifying silence-filaments that replace expected sonic feedback. Helena’s agency drives escalation: she keeps lowering the arm even after she realizes the needle is ruined, trading safety-from-disappointment for possible feeling; this sustained risk manifests visible cost (tears, tightened chest) and narrows future options (she will teach silence, not sound). Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, so it stays just below the 8.8 top tier where a second, costlier tightening would be required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely—silence as generative presence—via reversed grooves, cavern breath, and bodily texture rather than any explicit thesis. The ending crystallizes meaning (“silence…was presence, waiting”) but earns it through prior filament imagery and the choice to stay, so it reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, not moralism. Complexity is respected: no false binary between sound/silence, only cost acknowledged. The final sentence’s lyric uplift flirts with convenience yet remains grounded in salt-taste and oak heartbeat, keeping the score sub-9 by a whisker.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Helena’s tactile epistemology: every perception is vibration- or hush-coded, diction stays within her professional lexicon (“timpani thunder”), syntax lengthens under contemplation then compresses during the first tear. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; occasional slight poetic overlay (“world itself seemed to hold its breath”) is consistent with established mood and paid off by closure. Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are sustained, falling just short of 9.0 because one or two phrases edge toward atmospheric soft-focus rather than acute specificity under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose shows strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, and high information density—each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (“filament of hush”) stay coherent and are reused with accrued meaning rather than decorative overload. Two adjacent clauses both use “tightened chest / tasted salt” in quick succession—minor paraphrase loop that slightly dulls the climactic beat; likewise one participle opener (“Watching the disc spin…”) risks simultaneity ambiguity. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and artifact-free; minimal hedge keeps it above 8.3 but below 8.8 where absolute zero loop is required for 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit of “music heard backward to reveal tactile silence” is fresh, non-obvious, and organically fused with character need; it could not be swapped out without collapsing plot and epiphany. Transformation of familiar “deaf musician” trope pivots from loss to ecological embrace of negative space, executed through specific craft detail (shellac grooves, brass horn). Risk is taken with an almost conceptually abstract antagonist (numbness) yet remains dramatized via object interaction. Only slight deduction for thematic phrasing that momentarily approaches writing-workshop epiphany, holding it just under 9.5 perfection.</comment>
