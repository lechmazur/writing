<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kira’s contradictory impulses—yearning to feel while fearing pain—are dramatized in her trembling legs and the decision to fight for loss; the handshake with Maya crystallizes a credible renunciation of sole identity. Interiority is concrete (“flatline where joy and grief should have registered”), never diagnostic. Micro-choice to admit “I don’t know what I am” directly alters Maya’s stance and forecloses legal victory. Cost is visible: the numbness cracks open in the final beat, earned by prior admissions rather than therapist-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the handshake reconfigures identity from singular to plural under the Accumulative lens—image of clouds flickering amber reweights prior timeline sand-shifts. Causality holds: ego death → numbness → dojo admission → confession → shared custody of self. Orientation anchored by “final stone step” at ~90 words; waiver applies as disorientation (physics leniency) pays off in final image. Cost is unmistakable: “the numbness receded, just slightly” on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Floating rock dojo constrains choice: invisible tether and churning clouds force confrontation; no exit possible, raising stakes. Brain-in-jar functions as micro-setting—Chen rotates it to re-weight meaning of “duplicate.” Sensory triad present: wind howling (sound), stone step under knee (touch), amber flicker (sight) filtered through Kira’s narrowed crisis perception. World rule (“laws of physics had grown lenient”) taught early and consistent; no exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who owns a duplicated soul—tightens from courtroom abstraction to embodied duel; temporal rewrites flicker beneath as live pressure. One meaningful turn: Kira abandons legal argument, chooses vulnerability; this narrows her options to either shared identity or continued numbness. Cost visible: conceding sole authenticity hurts (“admission sliced through pretense”). Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (history rewrite) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: identity as practice, not possession. Subtext in gesture—Maya’s surprise crack, Chen’s slow jar turn—carries more weight than any thesis. Final image of clasped hands reweights earlier custody battle into cooperative parenting of self. “Vivify” returns recharged: once Maya’s boast, now the shared method for feeling again. Ambiguity preserved: no moral that clones are always better/worse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Kira; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: physics leniency as emotional metaphor, “laws of physics had grown lenient” mirrors her inner dissolution. Syntax lengthens under stress (“I don’t know what I am anymore”) then shortens at crack-open moment. Dialogue sparse but natural: Maya’s “I vivify them” carries subtext of superiority. Free indirect clean: “She had survived, technically” fuses narrator and Kira’s judgment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long opening sentence suspends, then staccato admissions accelerate. Information density high—one sentence links ego death, emotional numbness, custody battle. No mixed metaphors; “scattered like light through a prism” is singular and apt. Minor scaffold: “trembling not from exertion but from…” is template cadence but occurs early and doesn’t touch closure. Final line短而音调转变干净利落。</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clone custody + martial-arts truth ritual + mutable history. “Vivify” turned from corporate buzzword to emotional lifeline. Risk of floating dojo could read gimmick, but physics-leniency rule is taught early and pays off in final cloud-flicker image. Specific detail—“seventeen hearings,” “brain in a jar labeled DUPLICATE”—anchors high concept in tactile stakes. Emotional specificity trumps surface novelty.</comment>
