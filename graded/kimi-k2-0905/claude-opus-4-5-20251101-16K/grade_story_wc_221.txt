<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s paradoxical imprisonment is vividly embodied: she strokes the journal, “her body a living paradox,” and each charcoal line externalizes the contradiction between static exile and forward motion. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—yet the final shift (“motion itself became home”) is earned by the accumulating sketches rather than declared. The only nit: the grandmother’s voice is filtered through nostalgic summary, slightly blunting the inherited flaw that should complicate Mira’s compass. Still, her contradictory impulses (cling vs. chart) play out in scene, and the cost—eternal departure from linear time—scales to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last drawing re-weights “true north” from fixed star to iterative gesture, cost felt in the phrase “whatever tomorrow meant here.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layered sketch tightens the pattern until the cadence断裂 (“motion itself became home”) reconfigures meaning. No因果 reversals are needed; the densifying charcoal lines are the escalation. Orientation is anchored by word 93 (“observation deck stretched endlessly”), well within the 120-word waiver, and the final image crystallizes options under the same lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass-and-silence deck, spilled-mercury seconds, charcoal dust on fingertips—details are selective, tactile, and filtered through Mira’s professional eye for star positions. The viewport’s blurred star-threads act as both metaphor and constraint: they make the ancestral compass rose physically useless, forcing the reinterpretation of “direction.” Micro-setting qualifies: the journal’s gilded applique is handled twice, its sharp edge against skin charging the final closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no prop teleportation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Mira convert isolation into meaning?—is signaled early. The single meaningful intensifier is the discovery that her sketches show Polaris “like a heartbeat,” which collapses the option of waiting for rescue and deepens the cost of perpetual drawing. Agency is present-tense: she turns to a fresh page, choosing exploration over stasis. Cost is legible—each line commits more of her infinite yet finite now—but the escalation is one-note; a second tightening beat would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: navigation as ontological act rather than destination. The compass rose and charcoal constellations recur not as symbols but as tools whose utility is repriced—“true north” becomes the vector of continued sketching. Subtext resides in silence: the absence of rescuers, of chronology, of any reply turns every line into a one-sided conversation with the lost. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—motion as home—charged by prior particulars, no moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s dilated sensorium: “light itself confused,” “stars weren’t stars anymore.” Syntax stretches then snaps in the final paragraph, mirroring the temporal distortion. Figurative diction (“cathedral of glass,” “spilled mercury”) remains within her educated lexicon and is pattern-taught early. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long liquid cadences to the staccato “She began to draw…” without falling into template churn. Metaphors are coherent—mercury, heartbeat, compass—all serve navigation logic; no mixed vehicles. High information density: each sentence advances image or decision, zero paraphrase loops. Opening line anchors voice; final line resolves by image that recharges “compass.” No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The time-dilation ghost-ship is familiar, but the fusion with ancestral star-mapping feels fresh: astrophysical isolation meets folk craft. Transformation test fails if you swap the compass rose or the sketching custom—those specifics drive the redefinition of “true north.” Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist, and it pays off in the charged poise ending. One small echo of “find your true north” aphorism is redeemed by being repriced, not repeated.</comment>
