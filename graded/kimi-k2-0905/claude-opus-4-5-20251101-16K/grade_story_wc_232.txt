<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interior contradiction—empirical mapmaker chasing an irrational promise—stays vivid in embodied beats (crawling after ants, chip warming in pocket). The final renunciation lands with cost: he emerges empty-handed, having traded isolation for a still-uncertain social future. One slip: “he would not remain lonely” tells the shift instead of letting body or object show it, briefly flattening the earned arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: stepping through the arch reweights every map in his shop and every day he has left. Causal chain holds—chip→letter→cave→ants→arch→insight—without gaps or convenient amnesia. Rising floodwater supplies a visible ticking clock that narrows options and prices the final choice. The only hairline nick: a single explanatory clause (“he understood now”) could be deleted to keep causality purely dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wild-rose curtain, bioluminescent moss, and ant column are selectively filtered through Marcus’s cartographer gaze, turning terrain into a living map he must read. The matrix chip functions as mobile micro-setting, its warming metal registering the moment of cosmic alignment. Spatial choreography stays clean through crawl, stream, chamber; floodwater functions as environmental lever that forces the final step. One more sensory squeeze under peak pressure—cold water seeping up his sleeve—would have pushed this into the 9 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfill father’s promise before flood traps him—tightens exactly once when water audio shifts from distant rush to chamber seep, converting abstract quest into bodily risk. Ant trail provides the single meaningful narrowing of options that precedes the climax; no extraneous reversals. Cost is visible: soaked clothes, no proof, future still unpaid. Could edge higher if the flood touched his skin one beat earlier, forcing a louder physiological toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted images of maps, doors, and ants: every moment is an unmarked junction, not merely the mystic arch. Subtext stays off-nose; father’s whisper returns re-weighted once Marcus sees ordinary life as series of doorways. Final image of “paths not taken” reconfigures the opening loneliness without moralizing. No thematic echo violations; insight stays implicit, earned, and particular to this ex-map-hermit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person voice carries restrained melancholic cadence that mirrors yellowed parchment and loneliness, then lifts into lighter syntax at dawn exit. Perceptual signature is crisp—he notices distance, scale, magnetic deviation; never lapses into tourist-catalog cavern description. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; internal diction stays within a meticulous cartographer’s lexicon. A single clause (“he understood now”) slips toward helpful-narrator but is too brief to breach the 9 gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and ingress, accelerating through crawl-space claustrophobia, lengthening again at the shimmer. No loops, no mixed metaphors; each image (roses as curtain, moss as map light) pays its way once. Information density high—one sentence can anchor era, scent, and emotional state. Micro-proofing only: delete “exactly” from “suggestion of light” to shave adverbial clutter without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fuses two well-worn tropes—mystic doorway and secret cave—through idiosyncratic engine of typography chip plus ant navigation, making the quest specific to a map-dealer’s skill-set rather than generic hero. Emotional stakes hinge on ordinary loneliness, not world-saving, keeping risk human-scaled and fresh. Final reconfiguration (doorway = any present choice) feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight. No derivative-premise penalty applies because professional-grade specificity transforms the template.</comment>
