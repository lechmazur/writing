<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Yuki’s interiority is vivid—hand to chest, watching strangers confess—yet the final shift (“she would begin to tell her own”) is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page micro-choice shows the first act of self-disclosure. The dye-master lens supplies concrete perceptual bias; the borrowed-heart contradiction fuels the stakes. Still, the decisive agency is off-loaded into future-tense resolution, muting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each image (ladder, wing, window-light) layers density until the wing’s projection delivers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights Yuki’s vocation. Causality is internal but coherent—Kenji’s silence → magnetism → Yuki’s vow to speak. Closure carries unmistakable cost: the fixed permanence she once pursued is renounced. Orientation anchored by 40 words; pattern taught early.</comment>

<comment>Floating stone tea house, swaying ladder, crystal in the floor—environment constrains physical risk and enables the climactic light-map. Mist and morpho-scale optics integrate with theme of structural color. Micro-setting (dye vats, light angles) is filtered through professional gaze. Spatial choreography clean; no anchor drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: learn why stories stick to her, then decide whether to keep absorbing or begin emitting them. Pressure tightens once: wing-beam projection reveals Kenji’s hoarded dreams, foreclosing pure spectatorship. Cost visible—loss of her prior aesthetic of permanence. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through optics metaphor—structural color vs fixed pigment—culminating in the revaluation of impermanence. Subtext of donor heart as silent archive of untold stories avoids literal statement. Final image of shifting dyes crystallizes thematic reweighting without moralizing. Avoids tidy closure; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice saturated with dye-master diction: “watchful by trade,” “patience reveals truth,” “color shifts with light.” Syntax stays lean, rhythmic; no template cadence. Perceptual signature consistent—light, surface, refraction. Dialogue minimal but tonally distinct from narration. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, characterization, and world-rule (“The massive stone hung suspended…tethered by ancient chains”). Figurative language disciplined; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with ascent tension. Zero scaffold or paraphrase loops. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses organ-donation, impossible architecture, and structural color science into an organic whole. Morpho wing repurposed as memory projector feels inevitable yet fresh. Quiet risk: plotless lyric escalation instead of external showdown. Combine elements unavailable elsewhere; transformation test passed.</comment>
