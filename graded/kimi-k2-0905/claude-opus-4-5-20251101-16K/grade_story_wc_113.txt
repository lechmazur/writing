<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Miriam’s obsession is credibly anchored to 17 years in the pit, but the “strange impulses” remain abstract; no embodied contradiction plays out in-scene. She acts—wading, playing, naming—but the internal cost (guilt, fear, complicity) is asserted rather than dramatized. The final resolve to “trace the lineage” lands as exposition, not renunciation, so closure feels foretold, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: flood → stained program → decoded murder → vow to expose. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3), the single-scene default met. The closure beat—name etched in memory while water recedes—delivers a Charged Poise with felt cost: the opera house exhales, Miriam’s life inhales a new, dangerous obligation. One lens ambiguity: the ghost’s agency vs. Miriam’s inference is never tested, but the final image stays legible under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flooded auditorium is tactile and specific: black water at waist, lanterns reflected in ripples, velvet swollen into Rorschach faces. The cello bow as divining rod turns tool into sensory extension; the water-damaged program is handled, flipped, dropped—its translucence a literal window. Spatial anchors hold as Miriam wades from pit to exit; the receding water tracks causally with the revealed name. Environment constrains movement and supplies the code surface; final image of lanterns steadying crystallizes the shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover a century-old murder—signaled by the stained hands/face images. Pressure tightens once: the program’s hidden notation → Maestro’s name → Miriam’s vow. No external antagonist, but the rising water and bending flames physicalize resistance. Cost is conceptual (safety, reputation) rather than visceral; a tangible forfeiture (time, job, relationship) would sharpen the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of histories submerged and resurfaced emerges through water imagery and marginal notation, never sermonized. The “official narrative” vs. ghost-truth opposition gains weight as stains become evidence. Final image—unstruck chords awaiting true play—offers resonant CR without moralizing. Ambiguity persists: is Miriam medium or author?—inviting reflection rather than closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Miriam’s sensorium: bow as divining rod, paper “like a window,” lantern heat on her knuckles. Syntax lengthens under the sustained low C, then contracts at the exit—rhythmic mimicry of pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through textured, restrained metaphor that avoids purple. One filter slip: “she understood now” could be internal or narratorial, but context keeps distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and precise (“water etching stone”). Opening and closing lines frame voice and resonance cleanly. Minor scaffold: “she had been… she had never” could compress, but momentum never stalls.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Flooded theatre as séance-room feels fresh; the program as palimpsest murder note is a sharp repurposing of ephemera. Ghost communication via lantern flame and ripple avoids clichéd whispers. Risk is moderate—haunted-archive trope—but specificity of setting and sensory code elevate it above genre template. Transformation test passes: swap venue or instrument and the emotional anatomy collapses.</comment>
