<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mei’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment vs. private longing—surface only in summary; the final self-addressed letter is earned but the on-page moment is one gentle nod rather than a pressured micro-choice. Interiority is textured yet stays in lyrical register, never quite letting us see her re-prioritise in real time. Still, the spiral motif and ribbon act keep her sensibility consistent and particular. Cost is present (she surrenders anonymity) but lightly dramatised.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mosaic shard structure is taught early (nested memories, installation build) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mei’s first “letter to everyone” reweights her prior secrecy. Cause-and-effect linkage is accumulative rather than strictly causal; the lens holds. Orientation is clean by ~100 words. Closure carries conceptual cost—she steps from ghostwriter to participant—but the beat itself is one declarative sentence; a shade more bodily immediacy would push higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lotus temple, lily pond, and resin-preserved nest are re-used, handled, and finally mirrored in the pond’s reflection—charging the closing image. Weather-post-cloudburst filters every visual through prismatic light; humidity lingers in silk ribbons. Spatial choreography stays exact as Mei walks the gallery. The micro-setting (nest) literally shapes the installation pattern, constraining design choices and anchoring theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mei’s search for “the thread” via others’ letters—tightens when she risks exposure by mounting fragments publicly. No antagonist; escalation is accretive: each ribbon adds reputational jeopardy until the stranger’s recognition crystallises cost. The single deepening is forceful enough for 750-word scope. A hair more tangible consequence (a sender’s anger, temple censure) would sharpen the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through juxtaposed love-fragments and spiral architecture: connection resides in the anonymous longing itself. Final image of Mei’s ribbon catching light offers Conceptual Repricing—privacy is relinquished to become part of the communal bridge. No moralising; resonance is visceral. Subtext in the mother-daughter exchange quietly reframes “rejoin” from romantic to generational, deepening the thread idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature leans on colour (prismatic, pink-white blooms) and curvature motifs that feel character-specific rather than decorative. Syntax modulates—long breathless sentence for ribbon-hanging, then clipped clauses for the woman’s revelation—mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue to test voice divergence; narrative voice stays sure-footed and un-filter-verb-laden. High-band line control supports the lyric mode without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; metaphors (pond as mirror, nest as heart) cohere without mixed clutter. Occasional adjectival stacking (“inevitably whimsical”) is rare enough to keep momentum. No loops, paraphrase churn, or scaffold beats. Final paragraph contains one slightly ornate triad (“temple, ribbons, nest, and the keeper…”) but it lands as intentional crescendo rather than overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—professional love-letter ghostwriter turns confessions into public installation—feels fresh yet inevitable. Spiral/nest image and silk ribbon device particularise the concept; removal would collapse metaphoric architecture. Emotional stakes hinge on anonymity-to-visibility shift, not gimmick. Risk-taking (quiet mosaic, no villain) pays off through accretive pressure rather than twist, giving durable resonance.</comment>
