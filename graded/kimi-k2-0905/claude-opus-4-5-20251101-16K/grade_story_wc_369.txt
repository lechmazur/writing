<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—sweeping grief yet feeding on it—peaks when she smashes the sextant into a root-lens; cost is her freshly healed palms scarring again, visible on the same page. Motive stays anchored to “gardening sorrow,” never abstract, and her micro-choices (tugging a mirror shard, tasting dust) keep hierarchy of values tactile. The only bar to 9.0 is that the renunciation is more conceptual than relational—no second character on stage to crystallize status shift.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sextant’s new reflection of root-light reweights her lifelong chore into stewardship, with the cost of perpetual bodily scarring legible in the final paragraph. Causal chain is intact—because she dismantles the astronomer’s upward lens, therefore she can look inward; the pin-drop beat is the because that crystallizes the shift. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is given by line 4 and never slips. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of dust→seed→oxygen tightens once at the mirror-clouding beat, satisfying “one meaningful deepening.”</comment>

<comment>The tower’s fractured window, moon-double exposure, and the warped brass arc act as micro-setting that literally refracts choice—she angles the cracked mirror to catch root-glow, not starlight. Sensory economy is strict: only silver dust, lightning flash, and pin-ring sound are allowed, each reused to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across the bench→window→stair axis; no phantom objects. Meets 9+ gate: the broken sextant on the bench constrains her hand movements and focuses the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform maintenance into meaning before bodily exhaustion. Pressure escalates accumulatively—dust samples gain shimmer, moonlight heals then relinquishes, storm recedes into pin-drop silence—each layer reweights the cost of continuing. The decisive tightening is the mirror-clouding to root-view, foreclosing astronomical escape; price is renewed scars. No coincidence; all intensification flows from her tactile choices with the instrument.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief is not waste but biomass; the labyrinth is a compost bed, not a puzzle. Subtext resides in the repeating silver particulate—first as detritus, finally as “something almost like grace,” reconfiguring sorrow’s value. No moralizing line; the oaks’ oxygen is offered as image, not sermon. Final resonance is conceptual but felt: reader breathes the converted grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—she weighs dust by “shimmer,” measures time in “regeneration of palms.” No head-hopping; astronomer appears only as notebook object. Syntax flexes with pressure: clauses shorten during mirror alignment, lengthen in moon-heal lull. Diction remains within a sweeper’s lexicon; no academic leakage. Patterned elision of article (“She began to deconstruct…”) is taught early and paid off in the ringing pin sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no synonym churn between “silver particulate,” “dust,” “grief-flecks,” each chosen for precise shimmer weight. Metaphor count is spare—only “repository,” “garden,” “compost”—and biologically coherent. Information density high: single sentence conveys sextant fall, warp, abandonment. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from storm sibilants to pin’s hard stop. No overwriting in peak beat; mirror-clouding is two clean clauses.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise twist: labyrinth as aerobic digester, not maze, is non-obvious and irreversible—plot would collapse if setting swapped to cathedral or desert. Sextant re-aimed at roots而非 stars offers fresh epistemic angle. Risk of quiet cosmic scope is taken without gimmick; emotional specificity saves it from abstraction. Combines caretaker SF trope with arboreal afterlife, made particular through dust-ledgers and palm-scar cycle.</comment>
