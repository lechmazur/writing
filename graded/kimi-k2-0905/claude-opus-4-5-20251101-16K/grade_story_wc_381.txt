<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but stays in a single emotive register; the “quiet intensity” is asserted more than embodied. No contradictory impulse ever threatens her resolve, so the victory feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. The spent paper talisman is a visible relic of cost, yet she handles it the same way at the end as at the start—no micro-choice reveals a shifted value.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush lingers, sleeper still bound, her footprints the only debt. Causality is legible—mapped silence → dissolved cadence—but the “how” of propagation (coded drum → mountain) is off-stage, kept abstract. One shard, no orientation drift; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held steady.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The brook, dew, paper wing, and hollow oak are tactile and POV-filtered; spatial choreography never blurs. Environment doubles as tool: the brook’s negative spaces become the actual working surface. Final image—“peace that would echo through the brook’s song”—recharges the setting with conceptual cost, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stake is clear: abort the prophecy before quorum. Escalation is a gentle density increase—more pockets of silence stitched in—rather than a narrowing of live options. No visible price is paid by the protagonist (no exhaustion, lost memory, social risk), so tension stays aesthetic, not visceral. Meets single tightening rule for lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “silence can be weaponized gentleness,” shown through the working rather than named. The crane wing’s fade and the footprints in dew supply understated cost, letting the idea resonate without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries: prophecy is not evil, just too loud. Final image reweights earlier “architecture of emptiness” with societal stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her perceptual filter; diction (“architecture of emptiness,” “terrestrially cosmic”) is consistent and voice-motivated. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for stillness, shorter pulses when the wing warms. No dialogue to test, yet the free-indirect texture feels singular and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors are dense but patterned (starlight / constellation / atmosphere) and paid off in the closing line. One paraphrase loop—“quiet... stillness... silence”—in paragraph 2, not repeated. No filter-verb stacks or mixed vehicles. High information density; every sentence advances atmosphere or intent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fantasy trope of “silence magic” is re-angled through cartography of negative space, not force. Propagation via incidental street sounds feels fresh, avoiding the usual plague-oracle cliché. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but coherence stays high. Could swap mountain sleeper for any buried titan without altering arc, capping summit.</comment>
