<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-to-hope arc is grounded in embodied beats (packing, walking, pressing the wax leaf to her eye). The sixteen-year absence is compressed into telling, dulling interior contradiction; the reunion hug is performed rather than explored. Still, her tracker instincts visibly steer every choice, so the change is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: riddle → cylinder decoding → trek → grove reunion, each step foreclosing retreat. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren’s purpose flips from cataloguing death to “tracking something living,” cost shown in her cracked knees and single pressed leaf. Lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence-level selects for tracker perception: “monuments of rust rising from hardpan,” “smoke threaded upward, thin and blue.” Scrapyard, salt flats, black maples each supply directional cues that steer her feet; the burned grove functions as micro-setting that charges the final embrace. Sensory range is narrow but POV-loyal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost child—signals immediately and tightens when the cylinders foreclose every path except north. One meaningful escalation: the maple grove proves both destination and test (wait vs. despair). Agency sits entirely with Maren; coincidence is absent. Price is legible in miles walked and years grieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges from Maren swapping the cataloguing of endings for the pursuit of continuance; the wax leaf’s autumn stasis reweighted into living embrace. No explicit thesis—final image of heartbeats inside the wild hush supplies Conceptual Repricing. Subtle counter-reading: reunion does not erase wasteland, only re-purposes it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s shoulder, filtering every notice through tracker lexis—“counted days by footsteps.” Rhythm modulates: clipped clauses under fatigue, elongation at reunion. No head-hop; diction stays within wasteland idiom. Dialogue sparse but voice-distinct (Lira: “You solved it.”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; no loops or filler. Metaphors are sparse, physical, consistent—“grief like a stone lodged beneath her ribs.” Occasional mild elevation (“wild hush transformed into something softer”) but stays inside POV register. No scaffold or mixed vehicles; closure image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic parent search is familiar ground, yet the cylinder-as-map device and the bloodhound switching from death-tracking to life-tracking give a fresh inflection. Specificity of wax grooves versus wallpaper code feels idiosyncratic to this world. Not radically new, but angle and object use are non-obvious.</comment>
