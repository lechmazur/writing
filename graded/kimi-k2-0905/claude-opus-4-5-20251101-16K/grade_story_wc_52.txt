<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is concrete—wood grain under thumb, kettle’s rising pitch—and her “hauntingly practical” grief is shown through the micro-choice to carve rather than weep. The contradiction between clinging and releasing is held in-scene as she cuts the muzzle she knows will never be Empress, yet the final beat stops just short of a visible cost being paid; the gouge hovers, not yet decisive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lifted gouge crystallizes the stance “here and gone” with the ash shaving still curling—felt cost is the irreversible moment before the next cut. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain slows, tea cools, wood breathes; the cadence shift from drumming to whisper reweights the stake from loss to presence. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank are returned to three times, each touch altering Marta’s rhythm; the loft’s narrowing light literally constrains how long she can see the grain, forcing the final pause. Micro-setting (the blank as “pale bone”) charges the closing image without ornamental spread.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deserve love while it lasts—tightens once: the kettle’s scream truncates the cut, turning endless grief into the finite three minutes left. No reversal, but the pressure jump from amber suspension to shrill whistle narrows options to “carve now or never,” cost legible in the shaving she can’t replace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tactile recurrence: every handled object—droplet, shaving, cup—carries the same impermanence. Final image of breathing wood offers non-literal answer: presence is the scar left by the blade. No moralizing; the reweighting is felt in the hush after the kettle stops.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Marta’s perceptual filter—rain rhythm mimics heartbeat, tool weight gauges grief—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short clauses at the whistle; diction remains artisanal, never drifts into workshop jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative layer is spare—only “amber suspension,” “pale bone”—and never clutters the high-pressure whistle beat. Information density high: “ash wood accepted her cuts with soft resistance” simultaneously reveals material, action, and emotional yield.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Widow-carves-lioness could slide into sentimental trope, but the inversion of carving as release rather than memorial feels fresh. Risk is modest—quiet lyric rather than structural experiment—yet specificity of lion-tamer marriage and grain-reading elevates it above grief-template.</comment>
