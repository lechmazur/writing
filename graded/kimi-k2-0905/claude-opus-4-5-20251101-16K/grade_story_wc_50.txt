<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-anchored need to “store wonder” is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to seal her apprentice’s name in crystal crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction—reason versus wonder—remains present yet is stated more than dramatized in scene beats, and no secondary character applies live pressure. The final renunciation (keeping only one echo per night) carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the single-POV arc is slightly over-narrated rather than pressed through risky action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of echo-harvest tightens through sensory repetition and crystalline storage, reweighting grief into preserved wonder. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maren’s cellar visits reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost (she pays in ongoing solitude). Orientation anchors by paragraph 2; no causality breaks. One minor loop: “wounded season” phrase repeats without fresh inflection near end (−0.2), but closure image remains intact.</comment>

<comment>Marble cavern acts as micro-setting that constrains acoustics and therefore the entire harvesting tactic; temperature-shifted reflection angles are tactile and POV-filtered. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) mirrors Maren’s peripheral focus. The timer mechanism as handled object charges the final cellar image. Slight over-indulgence in echo metaphors mid-story (−0.2) but no static white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“store wonder before grief calcifies”—is signaled early and escalates through each harvested crystal; each sealing beat narrows future availability of the lost voices. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and emotional. Cost is visible: crystallized echoes are finite, nightly ration creates ongoing austerity. Escalation plateaus after 12th crystal; a second tightening beat would push score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge doesn’t kill wonder, it bottles it. Subtext resides in the silent cellar rationing—preservation becomes quiet self-denial. No final-paragraph thesis statement; last image of “magic she did understand” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Resists moral binaries: wonder and reason coexist without forced synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature privileges peripheral sound over direct gaze (“she watched the edges”). Syntax loosens slightly under pressure—“she spoke her apprentice’s name into one and sealed it”—mirroring controlled urgency. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk averted. One register lift: “reconfigured meaning” edges toward academic but stays within Maren’s reflective lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: each sentence advances either acoustic method or emotional charge. Occasional metaphor stack (“worn soft as river stones” after prior marble imagery) borders on excess but pattern is taught early and paid off. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Final paragraph could trim adjectives (“wounded season passed. Others followed.”) for crisper cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—“echoes as harvestable grief technology”—feels fresh yet inevitable given acoustics + locksmith precision. Crystalline time-storage marries profession to metaphysics without contrivance. Transformation test fails if Maren were simply a generic tinkerer; her lock-picking peripheral vision is essential to sonic mapping. Risk taken in quiet accumulative structure pays off in resonant cellar image.</comment>
