<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the freeze response is viscerally rendered. The final stance—holding the photo while choosing to “continue the patient work”—earns its cost through prior somatic navigation. No contradictory impulses are staged in a single beat, but the accumulated micro-choices (touching soil, gripping rail, pocketing photo) sufficiently motivate the Earned Stasis. A hairline slip: “therapy-speak” label “somatic markers” is used twice without on-page dramatization of the term itself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the photo remains in pocket, grief stays alive, and the next forward action is seeded—cost is unmistakable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; lighthouse automation, garden tending, and freeze cycles tighten the pattern to the final beam-sweep. Orientation is anchored by word 60 and the reflective block (≤18 %) is interleaved with micro-choices that tilt present stance. No因果 breaks; every beat reweights the dominant stake of “how to carry memory forward.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arboretum cliff, salt wind, and cold railing are filtered through Amira’s plant-focused perception and constrain her grounding ritual. The mechanical lighthouse beam and cypress grove mirror the human/automated tension without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; distance between propagation house, cliff edge, and lighthouse remains consistent. Environment charges the final image: seeds pushing unseen parallel the photo kept in darkness—micro-setting meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—how to hold grief and still live—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each freeze cycle deepens the cost of remembrance until the final beat crystallizes the bargain (“anchor optimism in realism”). Agency is present in the decision to pocket the photo and walk back to seedlings—visible forfeiture of forgetting. One tightening suffices; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through imagery of automated vigilance versus human tending; no explicit thesis is stated. The jasmine/seed motif reweights from wedding destruction to future growth without sentimentality. Final image of unseen seeds reaching for light offers Conceptual Repricing—optimism now carries the cost of permanent memory. Ambiguity is preserved: reader must decide if this bargain is enough.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Amira’s plant-attuned perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses during freeze—“Her lungs forgot their rhythm. Her spine turned to iron.” No head-hop; lighthouse and sea are observed, not interpreted by another mind. Distinct rhythm and selective metaphor (“dust had settled on white lace like gray snow”) sustain voice credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, character, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“Conceptual Repricing”) stays within Amira’s educated lexicon and is pattern-taught early. Final third is clean; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Familiar trauma-recovery arc is refreshed through horticultural specificity and the lighthouse-automation metaphor. Tending seedlings as the answer to drone violence feels inevitable once established. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but coherence never wavers. Could edge higher with one more unique detail that could not transplant to another story.</comment>
