<comment>Interiority, motivation, and micro-choice are tight: Mira's decision to "reexamine" is rooted in years of earned trust, embodied in the bell reveal, and crystallized in her rooftop watch of the listing arch. The ghost's altruism is never declared; it is shown through the contradiction of a dead woman still pruning for the living, forcing Mira to reciprocate with collective action. The final bell-ring is a renunciation of individual escape, foreclosing that path with visible communal cost as Veridian-7 cracks behind them.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the fleet rises through amber sky while the nebula ahead reframes every prior chalk warning as one long because/therefore chain. Cost is legible in the apple-tree farewell and the planet disintegrating in the rear-view; togetherness is no longer optional but the only remaining delta-v. Causal lens holds from first pre-dawn warning to final butterfly shimmer; no outline drift.</comment>

<comment>The floating rock arches are not backdrop; their listing cracks mirror the settlers' fracture and physically force the exodus timetable. The bell under the oldest apple tree anchors micro-setting inside one square metre of soil, constraining Mira's dig and later the communal ring. Descriptor economy is ruthless—"amber skies," "bones of forgotten giants"—yet every noun later resurfaces (arch collapse, nebula glow), passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten exactly once but decisively: from "stay or go" to "go together or die." The chalk message under the listing arch eliminates partial solutions; refusing togetherness equals planetary death. Agency rests with Mira's bell-ring that transforms ghost advice into communal covenant; cost is paid by the planet they abandon and the ghost who dissolves once obeyed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—hope as cultivated, thorny, communal labor—emerges solely through horticultural metaphors grafted onto space-opera bones: pruning, frost cover, pollination, butterfly bell. No character lectures on hope; the concept is repriced when the mythical nebula becomes the only possible greenhouse. Final image of butterflies inside starlight reweights the orchard planet's loss into seed diaspora, satisfying 9+ resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Mira's perceptual filter: she "reads the dawn," notices hairline cracks "overhead," hears bell tone "silence arguments." Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under urgency; no filter-verb stacks. Ghost POV never leaks; her only "voice" is chalk, maintaining distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence alternates between aerial long shots and soil-close stabs: "floating rock arches drifted... beneath the oldest apple tree." No scaffolding, no mixed metaphors, no paraphrase loops; information density peaks in single-sentence reveal of botanist identity. Figurative language is sparse, taught early ("bones of forgotten giants") and paid off at arch collapse, avoiding peak-beat muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Altruistic ghost-as-colony-botanist converts familiar trope into specific generational stewardship; chalk-messages-as-IPM-scouting freshens the haunted orchard. Risk taken: solarpunk exodus without villain, powered only by trust and botany. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at launch.</comment>
