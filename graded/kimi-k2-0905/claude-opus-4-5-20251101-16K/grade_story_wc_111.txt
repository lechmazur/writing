<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her shaking hands, the ritual of cracked marbles, the quiet weight of “she had deceived them.” The final renunciation (admitting the lie to Chen) is earned by the prior beat of touching the hedge and watching it regenerate under her hand, so the cost is visible. One flaw: “wisely pragmatic” is stated once rather than shown through contradiction; still, her micro-choices (polishing, pressing the marble into Chen’s palm) reveal hierarchy of values. Voice remains distinct and aged without slipping into generic sage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mara confesses, Chen lets the order vanish, the maze survives with a new quiet risk attached. Causal chain holds—every prior manipulation is exposed, yet the deeper truth (garden recognition) overrules the numbers. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of cracked marbles + simultaneous bloom/decay reweights the stake at the end. One hairline slip: the demolition threat is referenced but never shown as an on-page countdown; still, the final image of Chen “losing” the order supplies decisive cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The maze functions as micro-setting: hedges that “lean slightly inward,” roses that “turn their faces,” vines that “brush her withered shoulders” constrain Chen’s reading and justify the luck-deficient label being overturned. Sensory hierarchy is gardener-specific—touch and scent over sight. The cracked marbles act as portable setting-objects whose fractures mirror the garden’s own damaged vitality. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies or impossible distances.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maze survival—tightens when Chen announces “irregularities.” Mara’s agency is the admission of deceit; that choice narrows her options to truth-telling and risks instant demolition, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible: she trades invulnerability for moral exposure, and Chen’s off-record erasure becomes the fragile price paid. No reversal beyond that single deepening, but it is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: metric tyranny vs. living reciprocity. The cracked marbles reweight from tools of fraud to relics of mutual recognition; the final image of Chen pocketing one makes the conceptual cost undeniable. No moralizing line spoils the resonance. Counter-reading is plausible: Mara’s deceit is paternalistic, yet the text lets that ambiguity stand.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s gardener-perception: “hedges rising around her like old friends,” “roses turned their faces.” Syntax ages appropriately—short declaratives, tactile verbs. No head-hop into Chen beyond what his halted action shows. Free indirect style is clean: “Gardens know different truths” reads as her axiom, not authorial commentary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare yet textured: “yellowed leaves she pruned each autumn” packs season, age, and occupation in six words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is scarce but precise—cracked marbles as “rebellion recorded in broken glass.” Final line lands with cadence shift: “waiting for tomorrow’s tending” closes the breath of the piece without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-fantasy with data tyranny; the cracked-luck-sphere relic feels fresh. Ritual of deliberate fracture turns a toy into a living ledger of defiance. Risk is taken in the quiet ending—no demolition fight, only a bureaucratic shrug—but the gesture is earned. Transformation test fails if relocated to non-garden setting, confirming specificity.</comment>
