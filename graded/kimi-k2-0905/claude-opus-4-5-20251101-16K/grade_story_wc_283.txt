<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s refusal-to-flee motive is concrete and embodied; the button-sorting micro-choices externalize her quiet stubbornness. Interiority stays specific—no therapy-speak—and the final climb carries visible cost (she returns alone to turn every glass). Yet the grandmother’s whispered “secrets” arrive as off-page backstory, so the hinge from inherited clue to personal agency is slightly under-cooked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the village’s non-burning reweights prophecy itself, cost paid in Mira’s all-night labor and solitary descent. Causal chain (catalog buttons → find seams → stay-tend fires) holds; no late rule changes. Orientation is clean by word 80; amber warehouse, cliffs, winter solstice clock are anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory triangulation—honey lantern light, frozen sand, canyon echo’s pre-verbal rumble—grounds the cathedral scale without cataloguing. The amber desk and button trays function as micro-setting that literally steer the climax. Only the cliff village above remains a sketch; it never constrains choice, capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—village fire—signaled in first 120 words and tightens once: prophecy hardens when neighbors flee, forcing Mira’s all-night catalog gamble. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each button layers proof that certainty cracked before. Cost is legible—her blistered night, the echo’s ancient risk—but the final “they stayed” beat is reported, not dramatized, muting peak pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—“prophecy is possibility wearing certainty’s mask”—emerges from button evidence and the echo’s stone witness, never sermonized. The refusal-to-burn resolves without moral symmetry, leaving residual risk in the turned hourglasses. Final image of resumed sand-flow reconfigures meaning without closing interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays latched to Mira; perceptual signature favors tactile antiquity—bone, pearl, copper—against hush. Syntax lengthens during catalog, then shortens at dawn ascent, mirroring fatigue. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal diction, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors. Figurative load is restrained—only “cathedral of stopped time” risks cliché but is earned by resin walls. Rhythm modulates without mechanical patterns; final paragraph’s anaphora (“They stayed. They tended…”) is purposeful cadence shift, not template.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Button-archive-as-fate-seam is a fresh synthesis; the canyon echo jar repurposes geological memory as usable tool. Risk lies in quiet ending—no blaze, no crowd scene—but coherence justifies it. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight, not grafted.</comment>
