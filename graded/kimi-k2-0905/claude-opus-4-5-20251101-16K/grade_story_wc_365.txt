<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s sensorial cataloguing and shard-guided choices embody a coherent, embodied interiority; “the weight of collapsed stars” moment crystallizes her cost. The filial drive is legible, yet the genocide revelation arrives as told summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the internal split needed for 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decision to step backward reweights all prior hops with genocidal cost. Causal linkage holds—the shard’s twelve-hour pulse drives every transition—and the final redirect choice is seeded by the etched symbol and coordinates. One artifact: the enormity of erasure is asserted not witnessed, a hairline slip keeping it from 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Repair-bay micro-setting is filtered through sensory vocation—oxidized steel, sub-sonic hum—each datum constrains her mapping workflow. The shard’s temperature against skin functions as portable setting, charging the final grip. Spatial anchors remain consistent across the single location; no environmental beat is wasted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“the unbearable heaviness of not knowing”—tightens when Vera realizes she must search backward, not forward, foreclosing her entire past strategy. Escalation is accretive: each universe adds data until the pattern break (REDIRECT) reweights cost. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt and dimensional culpability emerges from the shard’s green after-image and the scorched triple-circle symbol rather than exposition. The final backward step reframes every prior hop as complicity in erasure, offering resonant ambiguity about whether discovery equals repetition. No moralizing capsule line; meaning stays in the image of swallowing green light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a cool cartographer’s precision—cataloging humidity percentages—yet liquefies under shard-hum into honeyed time, a controlled modulation. Sentence rhythm alternates between tactile fragments and longer sinuous clauses that mimic dimensional bleed. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line craft is dense: “time felt like honey” compresses viscosity and slowed cognition in four words. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors; each sensory datum does double duty for map and mood. A single paraphrase loop—“her mother’s face… hands… voice”—is purposeful anaphora, not scaffold, and charges the filial obsession.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Merging sensory cartography with multiversal genocide is a fresh synthesis; the shard as both heirloom and leftover universe avoids standard portal MacGuffins. Risk lies in summarizing cosmic atrocity off-page, yet this restraint also avoids spectacle cliché, keeping the concept character-anchored. Specificity of the repair-bay fold between realities feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
