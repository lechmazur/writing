<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s longing for starlight is specific and embodied; the anchor-link ritual externalizes memory without slipping into nostalgia-speak. Her “balanced curiosity” is shown through action—teaching edge geometry while privately tracking constellations—so contradiction lives in-scene. Final renunciation of the link onto the horizon carries cost: she trades a private talisman for pedagogical continuity, a choice foreshadowed by her classroom stance. One slip: the tears feel generic; “eyes burned” is stock phrasing under peak emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: mirrored rises—pressure chamber, city, ocean, sky—each layer adds density rather than causal turns. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the same stars re-weighted from obsolete to indispensable, cost legible in the relinquished anchor. Transition from bathysphere to surface is cleanly signaled by pressure shift and single sentence paragraph. Only micro-loss: Visitors’ archive reveal is off-stage summary, not dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent spires, pressure seals, and corroded iron form a tactile triad that constrains movement and memory; every prop is handled—chain against chest, against starlight—so setting lives on the body. Pacific darkness functions as vertical maze, making the ascent a mechanical and emotional pressure valve. Micro-setting rule satisfied: anchor-link acts as portable horizon that finally orients Mira. One clause drift: “constellation of bioluminescent spires” risks prettifying cliché, but salvaged by next sentence’s “pressure-sealed corridors.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can obsolete knowledge regain operational value? Tightening occurs when archive proof plus surface access compress theory into lived experience—no second reversal needed. Cost is opportunity: once she exposes herself to raw starlight, edge geometry can no longer be her sole compass; the anchor release makes that fork visible. Visitors’ gift feels slightly convenient, but because it complicates rather than solves, coincidence penalty is waived.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as negotiation between compression and expansion—folded distance versus unfiltered vastness—never named outright. Anchor mutates from nostalgia token to pedagogic bridge, re-weighting the meaning of “hold fast.” Final image of infinite horizons reframes prior classroom lessons without moralizing. Only reservation: “somber marvel” is stated in prompt language late, a faint echo that slightly externalizes the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s sensory filter: she notices pressure, corrosion, star scatter in idiosyncratic hierarchy. Syntax lengthens during surface awe, then contracts back to declarative for closure, mirroring ascent/breath rhythm. No dialogue, so voice must carry difference; accomplished through navigational lexicon—edge geometry, Polaris, sextants—woven without glossary pause. One filter verb cluster (“she noticed,” “she felt”) could be trimmed, but does not adulterate immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm: paragraph pulses expand from 3-line city sketch to 8-line starfield release, then contract to 2-line coda, creating breathing cadence. Sentence openings vary; no template runs. Metaphor density peaks in star description but pattern is taught early (“constellation of bioluminescent spires”) so payoff feels controlled, not purple. Only micro-loop: “she would teach… she would also tell” repeats future-conditional stem; adjacent but not identical, so −0.2 max.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of celestial navigation nostalgia with alien fold-space tech reframes both, avoiding retro-fetish or gadget triumphalism. Benthic city + surface re-emergence reverses the usual “stars to sea” migration trope, making the ocean the middle, not the edge. Anchor-link re-purposed from nautical deadweight to cosmic bookmark—specific, irreplaceable. Risk: quiet ending without twist, yet stance crystallization feels inevitable rather than safe.</comment>
