<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt, technical gentleness, and need to re-cast the dead are concrete from the first beat; the “technically gentle” hands that once destroyed now restore, showing contradictory impulses in-scene. The rope-braiding micro-choice visibly risks failure and crystallizes her new responsibility, earning the ending’s earned stasis with felt cost. Interiority stays specific to her craft vocabulary; no diagnostic self-talk. One flaw: the grandmother’s deathbed exposition is off-stage, slightly blunting the lineage pressure that could have been dramatized in one line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the light-through-card moment reweights the premise—absence becomes mold, silence becomes voice—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: because she re-braids the rope, the aurora refracts, the card speaks, and her future path forecloses guilt in favor of custodianship. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt. One hairline slip: the aurora’s cooperation feels half a beat short of motivated, but the pattern of “light through carved voids” taught earlier waives any break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ice walls, frozen rope fibers, and the aurora’s moving spectrum are filtered through Mira’s metal-worker eye for void and form; every tactile detail constrains the braiding action. The sanctum’s cold literally slows her fingers, raising stakes. The punched card’s yellowed edge and torn holes are micro-setting that later become the sound source—an object charging the final image. One missing beat: we never feel the rope’s actual texture (rough/silken), a hairline gap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the dead’s names or remain silenced—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the frozen rope may snap during re-braiding, risking permanent failure. That single turn is sufficient at 750 words; the cost (her lifelong custodianship) is legible on the final line. No escalation loop; the aurora’s surge is external complicating, not resolving, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through absence—emerges from the lost-wax/card void metaphor and is re-priced when light shines through holes to speak names. No moralizing; the final image of her walking “carrying seventeen voices home” lets the reader feel the weight. Subtext in the rope’s re-braiding implies lineage repair without stating it. One prior echo of the theme (“forgiveness…was choosing to move forward while carrying what remained”) is articulate but earned by the preceding fire guilt, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mira’s craft perception; diction of casting, punching, refracting matches her foundry background. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in the sanctum give way to clipped clauses during the rope work, mirroring tension. No head-hopping; aurora is perceived, not explained. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“began to illuminate”) could be trimmed, but it does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances memory, craft, or cold. Figurative language is spare—only the aurora “breathing” and the card “warm” in her palm—each paying off the theme. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. One mixed micro-metaphor (“light poured…until the entire sanctum began to illuminate”) is a hairline slip preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, punched-card sound storage, and auroral refraction feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist. The ancestral rope-braid reconfiguration as trigger for optic-audio resurrection is a specific, non-obvious hinge that would collapse if swapped. Risky compression of three-year guilt into one rope gesture pays off through charged specificity. The concept commits fully without late rule patches.</comment>
