<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s inherited sensitivity and reluctant compulsion feel concrete; the moment she presses both palms to stone makes her perceptual gift bodily and costly. Interiority stays specific to her “corridor echo” vocation, never lapsing into therapeutic self-labeling. The final paralysis-by-ivy crystallizes a credible, tragic endurance that her grandmother’s burned pages foreshadow, so the arc earns its stasis with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a chilling Charged Poise: Mira is claimed by the very building-memories she sought, cost paid in real-time entanglement. Causal chain (diary → photograph → wall-response → ivy snare) tightens options beat-by-beat under the Accumulative lens; grandmother’s burned research functions as both warning and trap trigger. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first 120 words and hold; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory triage favors touch and acoustic detail over visual catalog, reflecting Mira’s vocation. The ivy-veiled passage and rain-ruined atrium constrain movement and supply the closing threat; the fireplace’s fresh ash is a micro-setting clue that enables the diary discovery beat. Spatial choreography remains clean as Mira ducks, kneels, and is finally seized. Environment directly shapes the final tactical crisis, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map or be consumed by wall-dreams”—is signaled early and escalates through the photograph shock to the physical ivy snare, narrowing options under Accumulative pressure. Each beat increases density: unheard frequencies, written walls, animate ivy. Cost is viscerally legible when her ankle is caught and she surrenders to merger with the architecture. Could edge higher if an earlier concrete forfeiture (tool, time, stamina) had altered her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of generational obsession and architectural mourning emerges through diaries, negatives, and final assimilation, never authorial lecture. The walls’ dream of lost wholeness reweights the graffiti-like ivy into animate longing, creating conceptual cost without moral. Subtext in the half-burned pages and grandmother’s open-mouth warning lets the reader infer the inevitability Mira refused to see.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction favors tactile and sonic vocabulary (“cold stone,” “frequency she recognized”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for reflection, staccato fragments when ivy strikes. No head-hopping or register drift; the final whispered line maintains voice discipline while shifting into Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description cues both atmosphere and foreshadowing (“relentless green life,” “softened by relentless green life”). Figurative language is spare except for one mixed instant (“breathed with wild growth”), not enough to muddle. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by charged image. Minor opportunity: one or two verbs could be stronger than “feel,” “press,” “breathe.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Acoustic cartography of memory-soaked ruins feels fresh; the concept of “walls that mourn” is pursued to its literal endpoint without flinching. Tropes of climate ruins and found-diary are reanimated through Mira’s synesthetic vocation and the photograph negative that semi-predicts entrapment. Risk in letting architecture “speak” back could have slid into gimmick, but the ivy snare keeps the threat tactile and earned.</comment>
