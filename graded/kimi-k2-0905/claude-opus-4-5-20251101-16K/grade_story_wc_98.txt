<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation and private doubt interlock believably; every beat shows her measuring the absurd with calibrated rigor. The luminous doubt is embodied—palms on fruit, voice steady while “doubt sang beneath her sternum.” No head-hoppers dilute pressure; the lone POV sustains contradiction through to the earned smile that still costs certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blight → last seed → ritual dream-interpretation → germination test. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she buries the island’s memory in soil she cannot guarantee will nourish it. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting knowledge. The final image reconfigures stakes: doubt remains, path foreclosed, new shoot visible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Flowering ridge, translucent fruit, approaching monsoon cloudwall—each tactile detail narrows Mira’s tactical horizon. The grove’s spatial logic stays coherent; weather functions as clock and antagonist. Environment directly constrains the final act: only this soil, this hour, this storm-shadow. Micro-setting (seed in palm) charges the last beat with felt weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save cultural memory—tightens from 7 fruits → 1 seed → germination or extinction. Single meaningful escalation: seed awakens only when spoken dream-tapestry is complete; failure would foreclose all future memory. Cost legible in her immediate planting under storm-dark horizon, trading certainty for possibility. No coincidence rescues; pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: knowledge survives not by proof but by performed belief—empirical whimsy. Subtext in gesture (trembling seed, warm pulse of recognition) avoids thesis statement. Final smile through doubt reframes earlier mantra (“doubt illuminates truth’s edges”) without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: shoot may yet die, making preservation an ongoing wager.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited voice carries scientific precision salted with island poetry—“empirically whimsical,” “luminous, persistent doubt.” Syntax breathes with ridge ascent, accelerates during dream recitation, softens at shoot unfurl. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent. Dialogue absent by design; narrative idiom sustains authority.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; every sentence advances premise or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Figurative layer stays physically coherent (“doubt sang beneath her sternum” licenses physiological tremor). One clause-level softness—“translucent in the morning light” could trim modifier—but artifact-free at closure.</comment>

<comment>Reality-checker tasked with verifying singing fish and memory fruit is fresh occupation; dream-awakened seed as cultural backup feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Conceptual risk—lyric empiricism—pays off in earned shoot. Detail knot ("forge temperatures," "rain falling upward") prevents generic fantasy drift. Synthesis of science and myth carries singular charge.</comment>
