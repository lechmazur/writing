<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vesna’s interior contradiction—yearning to reclaim memory while refusing to chase—shows in the calibrated breath-matching that fuses hunter and prey. The embodied cost (lost father-face) drives every beat; her final smile lands as earned stasis. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived. One micro-slip: “firmly grounded” is asserted twice without fresh embodiment near peak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes when she opens her arms and the dream “came to her like light returning to its source”—visible cost is the surrender of distance she guarded seventeen years. Causal chain: sextant → breath-sync → boundary erasure → capture → mirror-prison; no off-stage shortcuts. Lens (Hybrid) holds: Accumulative texture builds fog/frost/reflection pattern, final causality arrow lands. Orientation anchored by 52 words; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fog, frost, and dead apple trees constrain navigation and force the breath-sync tactic; sextant-as-micro-setting charges the final image by literalizing navigation inward. Selective sensory triage—mirror gleam, crystallizing breath, mercury-like dream—keeps moment-to-moment urgency. Spatial choreography clean: dream-flight path and footfalls tracked without drift. One tiny lapse: “glass mountains” simile appears once, never reweights.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover father-face—tightens when breath-sync erases her outer edge, foreclosing safe observation; price is porous self-boundary. Single meaningful turn at dream-pause under apple tree; no reversals needed. Escalation under Accumulative lens: frost/fog density increases until reflection swallows difference. Cost legible in final smile that accepts perpetual captivity of memory inside mirror.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasure-as-creation emerges through mirrored surfaces, breath-merge, and the sextant that turns outward navigation inward. No statement of thesis; final image of “window in the fog” reweights loss as artifact. Subtext in humming father—sound without words—carries unspeakable affect. One soft echo: “firmly grounded” nudges toward explicitness but is absorbed by vocational detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Vesna’s glass-maker perception: light, fracture, polish. Syntax lengthens during sync-breath to mimic fog pulse, then fragments at capture. No dialogue, so naturalism bullets waived. Filter verbs (“she saw”) appear twice but are motivated by instrument mediation through sextant mirrors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long fugue sentences to clipped “It came to her.” No scaffold or loops; each sentence advances breath, sight, or stakes. Figurative layer is spare—three metaphors across 738 words—each ties to glass or light. Opening and closing lines bookend with reflective ingress/egress, satisfying cut test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines sextant, dream-hunting, and mirror-craft into a fresh inward-navigation conceit. Transformation test fails if setting shifted to generic city; fog-orchard and glass vocation are inseparable. Risk in breath-sync mechanic pays off by making empathy literal. Slight ding for “glass mountains” lone appearance—feels grafted, not grown.</comment>
