<comment>The erased woman’s interiority is precise—her refusal of names, her ear pressed to metal, her cataloguing of overheard grief—yet she never makes a micro-choice that visibly costs her something inside the scene. The final “she sleeps” is stasis, not renunciation; we feel no fresh forfeiture, only the ongoing condition. A single beat where she withholds or sacrifices a fragment would have tipped the arc into earned change.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the moonlit folding of the poison label reweights every collected voice into a single, undeniable conceptual cost—erasure is mutual, imminent, shared. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of tide-groan → fragment → label → sleep, each layer thickening the stake without causal plot. Cost is legible in the final image; the lens never wavers.</comment>

<comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop; its salt-metal respiration literally marks time, dictates her listening posture, and supplies the sealed corpse whose label becomes the story’s dark heart. Micro-setting mastery: the blue Rotterdam box, the rust nail, the slack-tide hush—all constrain her ritual and charge the final fold of paper. Environment is fate here; remove it and the piece collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates by density, not event: each overheard shard adds weight to her unnamed archive until the poison label crystallizes the stake—erasure is coming for her too. No option is foreclosed on-page; the tightening is intellectual, visceral, but still abstract. A late-moment threat—container scheduled for demolition, guard patrol—would have sharpened the cost to 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory is communal, identity is compost, erasure is the only citizenship left. The final image of sleeping “in voices that are not her own” reconfigures the entire catalog into a haunting, non-literal answer—she becomes the anthology that outlives the erased. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to her perceptual filter—metal taste, tide breath, cigarette cadence—without ever slipping into exposition. Syntax lengthens and contracts like tide itself; the repeated “she” anaphora becomes incantation, teaching the reader the accumulative pattern. Voice is inseparable from body and place.</comment>

<comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: every sentence carries image + motion + time, zero scaffold. Only two adjacent “she” sentences in the final paragraph echo without new pressure, a hairline loop that keeps it from 9+. Metaphors (broken bells, umbilical severance) are precise, never competing; diction stays within her self-taught lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The bureaucratic death error + container archive is a synthesis I haven’t seen; the lyric accumulation of other people’s grief as identity is fresh, risky, and inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its quiet premise, never flinching into conventional plot. Specificity of port slang, tide mechanics, and poison label grounds the concept in lived grime.</comment>
