<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and past are cleanly knotted: her drunken bridge-burning translates into the exact patience required to seal grief inside glass. The visitor beat crystallizes her role under pressure—she chooses preservation over personal comfort with on-page cost. Interiority stays concrete: “she could almost hear the ghost of a lullaby trembling.” One contradiction—ex-drunk now handling sacred ritual—drives the arc without safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the future listens while Maren writes, reweighting mortality into continuity. Accumulated-textural lens holds; pattern of “jar→music box→new jar” teaches early and narrows meaning at the end. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props. Only micro-slip: “she had saved herself sound by sound” is retrospective summary just before the final image, trimming immediacy a notch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Loft, dunes, and warped planks track spatially; sand sifts through every beat, constraining how jars are placed and retrieved. Jars and music-box serve as micro-setting, handled on-page twice each, directly charging the closing image. Sensory triangulation (salt-crust, gull-cry, wax seal) stays selective, never catalogic. Weather is causal: dawn whistle sets ritual window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vanishing voices—tightens once when girl delivers grandmother’s song; option to refuse is present but Maren commits, paying with perpetual guardianship. Accumulation pattern (jars + music) deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for lyric short form. Cost visible in her lonesome loft and the “bitter truth of mortality” she must keep tasting. Could use one tangible forfeiture (food, warmth) to push higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: transmission beats loss. Final image of “future listening” reframes prior jars without moralizing. Subtext in girl’s silent tears and Maren’s choice to write shows translator burden rather than tells. One minor echo risk: “gleaned redemption” phrased twice; still earns resonance because closure reenacts it physically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at lyric middle-distance, consistent and patterned. Syntax carries sand-and-salt cadence: sibilance mirrors environment without overwriting. Perceptual signatures (“wind spoke in tongues only the forgotten could understand”) bind voice to character worldview. No dialogue contamination; girl’s two lines read credibly childlike, subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic variation supports mood: long sentence for wistfulness, fragment for “She wound the music box.” Figurative control high—metors of sleeping giants, tapestry, threshold hold coherent logic. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. One near-purple phrase “positively wistful melody” is self-aware label permitted by music-box frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise flips apocalypse trope: salvage sound, not fight silence. Particularized coastal poverty and penny-poet economy freshen familiar redemption arc. Music-box origin via dead woman’s coat feels random but later integrates with fragility theme. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; not gimmicky.</comment>
