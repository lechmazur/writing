<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s map-maker identity is vivid in early description but never converts into a decisive on-page choice; the punch insertion is instinctive, not a cartographic decision. The moment she finally speaks her father’s name lands as earned catharsis, yet her interiority flirts with abstraction (“graveyard of her throat”) that blurs embodied cost. Reflection blocks exceed 20 % and are not interleaved with micro-choices that alter present options, so momentum flattens mid-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crack-arrows, mist-vault, and crystallized-whisper architecture build density that reweights the stake toward “everything unsaid.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her first spoken truth completes the conversation death interrupted—cost is felt when the gate stays open, implying inheritance of the punch. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity; one transition (city → fortress) is legible. Non-closure accumulation: reflection-to-action ratio tilts toward summary, −0.4.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory layering—brass teeth hum, frozen-breath bridge—filters through Elara’s surveyor gaze, turning environment into navigational instrument. Starlit vault and crystallized whispers constrain movement: she can only cross where breath solidifies, so setting actively shapes tactics. Micro-setting (phantom punch) charges the final image when it remains in the slot, gate ajar—object state alters next inheritor’s options. One atmospheric cliché (“ceiling was infinity itself”) barely dulls the texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the fortress of unspoken truths”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when cracks form the only path forward. Single meaningful deepening: punch meets slot, foreclosing retreat; cost is the irreversible step onto the bridge of frozen breath. Agency is present but abstract; the cracks, not Elara’s cartographic skill, dictate every move, blunting protagonist-driven escalation. Coincidence (pavement spontaneously arrows) is allowed under Accumulative lens and does not resolve the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—liberation through articulation of silenced truths—emerges from the crystallized-whisper architecture and her father’s returned voice, never sermonized. Subtext operates in the punch’s worn teeth and the mother’s unmailed letter, implying generations of withheld speech. Final image of the open gate reweights earlier maps as mere rehearsal, delivering conceptual repricing without moral tag. One thematic echo (“everything unsaid”) approaches explicitness but is saved by material embodiment in the fortress walls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is map-maker—“analytically artistic,” noting divergence, spur, tunnel—until metaphors occasionally overreach (“cathedral whose ceiling was infinity”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, clipped fragments at gate—heightens tension without obscuring clarity. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on interior diction; filter verbs minimal. Patterned elision (“fortress of unspoken truths”) is taught early and paid off at entry, satisfying experimental tolerance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety strong; only one scaffold pair (“every divergence… every tunnel”) and no synonym loops. Figurative language dense in starlit-vault paragraph but serves accumulative texture, not clutter. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction slips into academic meta-commentary, −0.3. Otherwise information-dense, propulsive, and clean at the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Familiar “mystical ticket” trope is transformed through cartographer POV and architecture of crystallized whispers, making the punch a key forged from collective silence rather than mere portal gimmick. Specific occupational detail—hand-drawn maps balancing math and beauty—anchors freshness. Risk taken in accumulative, lyrical structure pays off when final spoken truth reconfigures all prior mapping as rehearsal. Could edge higher with one more concrete navigational choice unique to Elara’s skill.</comment>
