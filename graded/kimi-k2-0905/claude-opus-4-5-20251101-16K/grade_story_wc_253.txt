<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is viscerally embodied—her “blank face” and “remade hush” are lived states, not labels—and the contradiction between performed joy and internal void is active in every beat. Micro-choices (whittling, touching the bouquet, self-narration) reveal a hierarchy of values where survival trumbs truth, and the cost is visible in the closing image of “her own ghost.” Moral ambiguity is not declared but shown: she once taught others to bury grief and now buries her own. The only bar to 9+ is that the arc is pure stasis; the ending refuses change, so the “earned” quality is poignantly static rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final paragraph crystallizes her perpetual stance—“survive by becoming her own ghost”—with undeniable emotional cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern is taught early (the self-narration tic) and paid off in the last line, reweighting all prior empty performances. Turbines and bouquet recur with shifting affect, tightening the cadence toward the hush. No causality gaps; every artifact (bouquet crumble, wooden bird) is present and evolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the dried bouquet literally crumbles under her finger, constraining her next micro-choice and charging the final image. Turbine shadows act as “indifferent clock,” mirroring her stasis while remaining physically plausible. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track her body vs. table vs. window vs. shelf without drift. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—only what a grief-numbed performer would notice gets page time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintain the performance of serenity under surveillance—tightens through each self-narrated beat; the bouquet crumble is the visible price that forecloses nostalgia as a live option. Agency is pure endurance, a credible renunciation under a regime where any slip means removal. Escalation is incremental but coherent: each wooden bird adds weight to her ghosthood. Cost is legible on the page; no external coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of wooden birds and evaporating lavender: the state-mandated lightness is literally weightless because it is hollow. Subtext lives in gesture—her finger’s tremorless touch on the bouquet speaks louder than any protest. Final image reweights the premise: the wooden flock embodies the social cost of outlawed sorrow. No moralizing sentence; the reader is left holding the hollow bird.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade><comment>Voice is a controlled anesthesia: clinical syntax (“the performer does not weep”) yet lyric cadence, matching her split self. Perceptual signature is unforgettable—she sees the world as stage directions. Patterned elision (never naming the regime beyond “they”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; distance remains stable third-person limited. Diction never exceeds her plausible lexicon; even “revolution” is literal for turbines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors blade strokes—short, precise, then a longer curling shaving of clause. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new information or image. Figurative control: “shadows swept like hands of an indifferent clock” is fresh yet physically exact. Only micro-slip: “the happiness mandate” is named twice in close succession; a hair below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: the grief-ban dystopia is filtered through solo performance art rather than rebellion, turning a premise that could feel familiar into an intimate study of complicity. Wooden birds as un-flying memorials is an indelible image not seen elsewhere. Risk—the entire story is stasis—pays off because the hollow flock makes stasis horrific. Conceptual integrity never blinks; the regime’s logic is followed to its ghostly conclusion.</comment>
