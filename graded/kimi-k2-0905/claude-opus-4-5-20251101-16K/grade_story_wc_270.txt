<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sora’s insurgent past and plant-gift feel texturally concrete; her decision to dissolve the amber is motivated and embodied. The arrival of Emi is under-used—no status tension or value conflict is activated, so the relationship crucible stays cool. Interiority avoids label-speak and shows contradictory impulses (“It’s not for me to wake” vs. the act of unsealing). Cost is present but diffuse—no single irreversible loss is foregrounded, capping the arc just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: seed dissolves, choice is irreversible, future is opened. Causal linkage holds—kite prophecy → amber break → genetic dispersal. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; spatial anchors (sulfur path, terraced pools) remain coherent. Only one micro-turn, but it suffices under short-form causal lens. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Hot-spring terraces, sulfur stink, and tattered kite strips provide tactile specificity; the pools actively receive the dissolved seed, so environment constrains the final act. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual/thermal—but selective economy works at this length. Micro-setting (amber against chest) doubles as tool and symbol, reinforcing POV bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate destiny from priestly monopoly—is signaled early and tightened when the seal cracks. Pressure is coherent but externalized; the plants cheer rather than resist, so tension plateaus rather than spikes. One meaningful narrowing occurs: prophecy read → amber opened → future communalized. Price is societal, not personal, keeping escalation earnest yet abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—tradition as living choice, not fixed text—emerges through image and action rather than assertion. Subtext operates in the ferns’ whispers and the kite’s found language, avoiding overt thesis. Final image of golden particles diffusing into soil reweights prior hoarding without moralizing. Complexity is honored: no single “correct” future is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Sora’s sensorium; plant telepathy is filtered through her breath and cortisol, maintaining perceptual signature. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates at the unsealing. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven (Emi’s single line crystallizes legacy transfer). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; most sentences advance story or atmosphere. One paraphrase loop (“You’re troubled” / “I’m always troubled”) is permitted as character beat. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Final line breathes properly, avoiding drumbeat cadence. Minor filter verbs appear early but vanish before climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fused biopunk with insurgent mythopoeia feels fresh; embryo-as-fossilized-collective-memory reframes eugenics tropes. Kite-prophecy delivery is delightfully specific and inevitable in hindsight. Plant-telepathy gift could read as twee, but here it pressures the unsealing. Risky elements cohere without gimmickry, landing a memorable inflection.</comment>
