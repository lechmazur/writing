<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maya’s curiosity is embodied early (tracing blueprints, scanning fractures), and her obsession with Chen’s system drives the 40-hour sprint. The final “she chose forward” crystallizes a credible renunciation of full restoration, paying the cost of partial resurrection. Interiority is mostly concrete (“felt something shift in her chest”) rather than abstract, though a few phrases (“quiet recognition”) flirt with label-speak. Overall, competence and genuine struggle balance; the sextant acts as both talisman and catalyst, grounding her shift from intern to steward of one wing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maya consciously forecloses demolition and accepts a limited revival, cost felt in “the terminal would never be what it was.” Causal chain holds—sextant → discovery of Chen’s gravity-fed water logic → redirected-flow turbine plan—each step because/therefore. Orientation is clean within 120 words (who, abandoned terminal, after-carnival). One micro-turn at the box discovery tightens options. No outline drift; every beat advances either knowledge or constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Duraglass window, frozen Gate Seven countdown, and broken hologram ads pin the derelict grandeur in three swift strokes. Brass sextant fragment acts as micro-setting that literally steers her gaze and later charges the final image (“heavy in her pocket like a talisman”). Spatial choreography holds as she walks beneath vaulted ceilings into Maint-17-C. Dust, rust desert, and emergency-strip glow narrow perception to post-carnival abandonment, mirroring her narrowed ambitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—resurrect a fragment of the terminal vs. let it die—surfaces by paragraph four and tightens when the committee’s demolition memo looms. The sextant discovery flips her goal from survey-only to partial revival, foreclosing the easy exit. Cost is visible: 40 sleepless hours, acceptance of “never be what it was.” Agency drives every escalation; coincidence is absent. One meaningful deepening suffices for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: navigation as embracing partial fixes amid irreversible loss. Motif of “maze of intentions” recurs in both architecture and personal choice, reweighted when she opts for one functional wing rather than impossible totality. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing—brass sextant in pocket signals continuation, not triumph. Ambiguity remains: the desert still stretches indifferent, but the lights now “almost resembled warmth.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual filter—she notices cracks before skylights, water flow before décor. Syntax mirrors attention: long sensuous clauses at rest (“dust motes drifted…”), then clipped fragments under pressure (“She chose forward.”). No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts cleanly. Distinct diction (“duraglass,” “quantum positioning”) feels natural to an engineering intern without jargon dump.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence moves either scene or metaphor (“blueprints looked like abstract art”). Mixed metaphors are avoided; brass-and-starlight navigation metaphor stays coherent. One paraphrase loop detected (“abandoned…abandoned” in resort planets line) but minor. Rhythm accelerates into the final sentence, propelling closure. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-carnival derelict terminal is fresh scaffolding; coupling it with obsolete sextant navigation gives a tactile retro-futurist texture. The “maze of intentions” angle reframes standard ruins into palimpsest engineering, elevating the piece above generic salvage tales. Risk is moderate but successful: quiet stake (one wing, not whole port) pays off thematically. Could edge higher if Chen’s ghost haunted present action more viscerally.</comment>
