<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and interior contradiction—mapping grief while avoiding her own—are vivid; the gold thread as tactile memory anchor embodies motive. Yet no on-page choice after the bench moment forces her to pay or forfeit anything; the closure is observation, not micro-action with cost. Interiority avoids label-speak and stays embodied, but the absence of a final, irreversible decision caps the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the stake of “recording before erasure.” Closure is a Charged Poise—ink continuing while autumn dies—reconfiguring absence as presence with conceptual cost (“making darkness bearable”). Orientation is clear by line 3; no因果 breaks. Cost is felt, though not paid by Maren’s own flesh, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Garden’s decay is not backdrop but instrument: crumbling statuary limits seating, copper maples color the light that times the writing session, the owl’s note marks dusk deadline. Gold thread micro-setting constrains her fingers and recurs in the final paragraph, charging the image. Every detail is filtered through Maren’s archival gaze; no sensory checklist. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, cottage edge, thread—within a single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will this testimony be complete before Isaveth and autumn end?”—tightens once when dusk and owl announce closing time. Pressure is textural, not antagonistic; options narrow only to “write faster,” not a forked choice with trade-off. Cost is aesthetic and existential, not personal or tactical for Maren. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but not the visible price that would push 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: healing is not restoration but learned flourishing in ruins—shown via garden, thread, and act of writing. No final moralizing; last line lets autumn’s “quiet obituary” reweight prior images. Subtext of Isaveth’s explained absences mirrors Maren’s unstated fear of her own erasure, creating irony without exposition. Complexity accepted: no tidy uplift, yet clarity remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual filter: “impossibly fine” thread, “lonesome splendor” valuation. Syntax lengthens in calmer reflection, shortens at dusk cue—“owl called its first evening note”—mirroring external pressure. No head-hopping; diction remains within her scholarly yet sensory lexicon. Distinctive rhythmic control without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “decay and dignity intertwined” advances theme while describing hedge shadow. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; occasional Latinate elevation (“cartographer’s masterwork”) is justified by Maren’s archival mindset. Zero filter-verb clusters. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, letting image resonate. Minor: two adjectives (“rust and amber”) could be one, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Obituaries for the living” is fresh, fused to decaying garden and gold thread; synthesis feels inevitable. Risk: lyric stasis instead of plot, yet coherence and emotional cost hold. No trope recycling; palace-ruins trope is retooled through archival vocation. Specificity of carpet weft as memory line prevents generic swap.</comment>
