<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to scent as threat while craving illumination—drives every beat; the micro-choice to inhale the rose’s grief crystallizes her arc with felt cost. The vial’s message retrofits motivation, but the embodied weep beneath a dying rose earns the shift from avoidance to permission. A hairline slip: “she understood now” skirts diagnostic label-speak, blunting the final contradiction momentarily. Still, the endurance of fragrance-as-gift lands as credible renunciation of fear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (moon-split glass, moss-light, rose exhale) deepens the dominant stake—can grief be borne? The vial’s UV reveal acts as pattern-breaking intensifier, not coincidence, forcing the final inhale. Closure is Charged Poise: “permission” reweights all prior scent-avoidance with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse architecture—glass dome, phosphorescent moss, UV lantern—functions as micro-setting that literally enables the climactic revelation; remove any prop and the beat collapses. Light refracts through grief, constraining Maren’s movements and attention. Spatial choreography is immaculate: palm on door → pavilion → dome → seated at dawn. The extinct botanicals supply stakes larger than personal loss without world-build bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she risk olfactory memory?—tightens exactly once when UV text appears, foreclosing the option to keep the vial sealed. Aromatic caution converts to deliberate surrender, a visible price paid in tears and opened perfume. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure coheres under accumulative lens. Cost is legible, but secondary deepening (e.g., forfeiting future lantern sales) remains off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s scent is not possession but permission to feel. The Cimmerian Rose’s single exhalation reconfigures prior fragrance-terror without moralizing. Subtext hums in the off-key bread-bread-kitchen triad—love made sensorial, not stated. Final image refracts grief into bearable light, achieving Conceptual Repricing with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—lantern trader’s metallurgical metaphors, scent-as-currency worldview. Syntax lengthens under emotional swell then fractures at climax: “She wept… She wept…” mirroring breath cadence. Prose teaches its prism motif early and pays it off in “shadows that glittered like grief transmuted.” Zero head-hop or register drift; UV reveal diction stays within ex-astronomer lineage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty—description advances stakes, e.g., “cold, angular, almost sentient” light foreshadows UV knife. No scaffold or synonym loops; each metaphor extends the glass-and-light through-line. One mixed vehicle: “key turning in rusted wards” beside “stone in her throat” is allowable under emotional crest. Final paragraph breathes without overwriting, letting vanilla-cedar ghost linger.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Scent-as-grief engine feels novel yet inevitable; no recent market duplicate. Combining extinct botanical metamorphosis with UV epistolary reveal is elegant synthesis, not gimmick. Transformation of cliché “smell triggers memory” into “permission to remember” supplies fresh inflection. Risk of UV device is fully integrated, not bolt-on.</comment>
