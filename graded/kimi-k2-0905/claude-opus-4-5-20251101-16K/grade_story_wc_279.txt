<comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—artist eye, lilac fear, pocketed shard—and her micro-choice to surrender protest and place the tile lands with cost. Whimsy-as-trait is asserted rather than shown in on-page chalk gesture; the “socially perceptive” label is used once without visible trade-off. Still, the shift from panic to spaciousness is embodied and earns the closure stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: tile placed, protest renounced, hush embraced—cost is the foreclosing of old certitude. Accumulative lens holds: mandala pattern, grotto murmurs, and shard reweight meaning in the final lilac breath. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; one causal micro-turn suffices at this length. No prop or motif breaks chain; the emergent hush pays off the set-up.</comment>

<comment>Grotto acoustics, mist, and sand mandala are filtered through Mira’s artist gaze; every sensory note pressures her stance. The tile flake micro-setting acts as handled object and final image charger. Selective detail avoids exposition; whisper physics stays consistent. Environment quietly mirrors internal dissolve without overt symbol clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she find footing as knowledge dissolves?”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: protest dies, tile offered, hush accepted; option to argue structure is foreclosed. Cost is conceptual loss of framework, felt on page. Accumulative deepening satisfies lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of meaning-through-silence emerges via mandala void, grotto hush, and chalk-space; no explicit thesis. Final image reweights earlier dread into creative possibility without moral. Subtext carries in half-heard whispers and shard placement. Ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s artist perception; no head-hop. Syntax breathes—long lilac clauses contract to fragmentary hush. Word choice favors tactile verbs over abstractions. Only two spoken lines carry distinct elder gravity; chalk voice remains in perception. Rhythm modulates with unease then release.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined; no loops, no filler. Mixed metaphors (“sugar in water,” “lilac-colored fear”) stay coherent. One scaffold near-open: “She was socially perceptive enough to notice…” could trim. Otherwise density is high and momentum clean.</comment>

<comment>Post-unlearning acoustic grotto + chalk artist is fresh synthesis; mandala as negotiator map feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking lies in quiet Conceptual Repricing rather than plot twist. Could edge higher with more idiosyncratic chalk imagery on page.</comment>
