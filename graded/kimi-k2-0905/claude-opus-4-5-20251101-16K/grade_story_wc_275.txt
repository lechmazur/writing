<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s pacifist stance and “senselessly perceptive” gift are shown, not told, through her soil-blackened fingers, her refusal to draw steel, and the micro-choice to weave lethal ballast into seed blankets. The father-daughter hunting legacy is evoked by concrete objects (airship cloth) and embodied memory, giving her renunciation a felt lineage. Interiority stays concrete—she registers root-tremors, pressure shifts, blight-whispers—never sliding into diagnostic labels. Final “quiet rebellion” is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the bounty path with visible cost, yet the contradictory impulses (blade at hip, hands in loam) could be sharper in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: the last image of roses “waiting for their season” crystallizes her stance and reweights the premise—entropy accepted, continuity chosen. Causal lattice holds: tower-fall → stranger with ballast → ballast becomes seed-weight → final image fuses lethal and generative. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each repetition of “speak to roses” deepens pattern until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible—she forfeits the hunter’s economy of violence and embraces vulnerability to time/raiders—but the moment of stranger-entrance is slightly late (~140 words), nudging orientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass dome functions as micro-setting: its pressure walls, heat shimmer, and sound-bending silence constrain every choice—sound is “round, held,” eavesdropping impossible, entry a ritual. Desert roses are handled tactually—crimson against sand stems, ballast strips woven into tray-covers—so the object becomes environment. Spatial choreography stays clean: stranger collapses beside irrigation channel, pack spills, Mira’s fingers move from soil to blade to cloth. Final image of “rows under carved silence” fuses setting with theme, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—continuity versus entropy—tightens once: stranger brings relic of violent past (ballast) that Mira converts into generative weight, foreclosing the option to flee or fight. No reversals, but the single deepening (lethal cloth → seed blanket) is agency-driven and reweights options. Cost is conceptual yet felt: she accepts that her roses, like her, may be uprooted, but the weight of ballast now anchors seed, not airship. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; a more visceral external threat (raiders mentioned, not shown) would sharpen stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: repetition of “inculcating values” versus inherited violence, culminating in non-literal answer—lethal ballast repurposed as cradle for life. Subtext operates in gesture: sheathed blade, soil under nails, silence that “holds its shape.” Final image avoids moralizing; resonance comes from material re-weighting, not assertion. Ambiguity is preserved—roses may still die—but the conceptual cost (choosing cultivation over killing) is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adopts Mira’s perceptual signature: minute botanical observations, weather pressure sensed as “living thing,” synesthetic “chemical whisper.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for languid heat, clipped fragments when stranger arrives. No dialogue until midpoint, then sparse, sand-rasped: “I didn’t believe it was real.” Diction stays within desert horticulture lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Compression taught early (“tranquil blaze” paradox) and paid off in final “patient as petals” cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences carry scent, memory, and threat (“airship ballast sandbag material, the weave unmistakable”). Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles; “silence carved from crystal” is sustained. One paraphrase loop: “She would never hunt… never harvest violence… only grow” —intentional anaphora, not scaffold. Clarity at closure: final clause “patient as petals waiting for their season” lands clean, no figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist botanist daughter of bounty hunter repurposes airship ballast as seed blanket—violence literality inverted into life support. Desert rose farm in post-collapse dome is specific; nottransferable to any apocalyptic garden. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than plot twist; payoff is conceptual reweighting at close. Could edge higher if raider threat had been more than mention, but within word limits the inversion feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
