<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—taxidermy eyes warming under fingertips, knees stiffening on stone—and her endurance-of-not-knowing is embodied rather than labeled. The shift from “equation to solve” to “relationship to tend” is earned through iterative ritual, but the brother remains off-page abstraction; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, only recalled. Final renunciation carries visible cost (“she would sleep without dreaming of answers”), satisfying change within flash-fiction scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic’s broken glaze reweights loss from problem to companion, cost felt in the shift from frantic ritual to measured ascent. Causal chain holds—each return to the cavern refines the spell—while accumulative pattern of chipped tiles teaches the lens early. Orientation clear by line 6; single transition (descend / ascend) is legible. Persistent constraint intact: unanswered absence remains, now framed as renewable equation rather than void.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is never backdrop; dripping stalactites nourish moon-fed apples that mirror Mira’s mineral patience, and the mosaic stepping stone literally guides her stance during the spell. Prop handling tracks: lantern shadow, glass eyes placed, pocket click on exit—each tactile contact alters next move. Final image of “apples…growing toward nothing yet growing still” recharges earlier subterranean fertility with reweighted meaning, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make sense of ambiguous loss—tightens when the ritual finally answers not with Eli but with reframed grief. Single meaningful escalation: eyes warm, patterns rearrange in perception, foreclosing need for bodily return. Cost legible: she abandons three-year search yet accepts lifelong not-knowing. Pressure coherent under accumulative lens; no external coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repetition and fracture: mathematics of damage, not repair. Subtext resides in glass eyes that “see nothing, remember everything,” quietly re-pricing memory versus confirmation. No moral stated; final orchard image invites ongoing contradiction between growth and void. Ambiguity preserved without confusion, resonance anchored in specific tactile detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—she reads stress lines in glaze, hears drops as metronome—without hedging into editorial. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, shortens at tactile beats (“glass eyes clicked”). No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Prose rhythm mirrors mineral patience, modulating under lantern flicker without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences multitask: “dripped their mineral-rich water in patient rhythms, nourishing apple trees” fuses motion, sustenance, timescale. Figurative control disciplined—only one metaphor per high-stakes paragraph, none contradict. Zero filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Strong verbs (“fracture the silver light,” “dovetail together”) propel without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Subterranean moon-orchard is fresh, yet “mathematics of emotion” concept flirts with abstraction; saved by mosaic micro-mechanic that literalizes the idea. Glass-eye ritual repurposes taxidermy remnant into scrying lens—specific, unsettling, inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken with quiet epiphanic ending pays off via charged poise. Could edge higher if brother’s off-page presence were given one unexpected shard of memory.</comment>
