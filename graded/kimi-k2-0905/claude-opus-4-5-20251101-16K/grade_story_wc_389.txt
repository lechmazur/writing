<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically vivid (“gritty sound, worn smooth by solitude”) and her renunciation lands with cost, yet the pressure between isolation and discipleship is told more than dramatized; no on-page beat shows her falter under direct challenge, muting contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration—she walks away, dawn reweights her frequency—cost felt in “the dawn you shape will not be yours.” Accumulative lens holds: pattern of static → pilgrims → raw noise teaches that meaning is co-authored. One transition (portico → descent) is clean; orientation anchor at 118 words clears waiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, cobalt portico, and salvaged radio create tactile micro-setting that constrains her final choice to surrender control. Lightning through blue glass recharges the closure image. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors altitude and breath. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of meaning versus surrender to noise—tightens when she switches from interpretation to raw static, foreclosing guru authority. Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) rather than visceral, but legible. Agency drives the turn; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: prophecy as collaborative static, not certitude. Subtext in “they’ll want certainty—give them wonder” reframes factional strife. Final image scatters blue fire like signals finding home—resonant, non-didactic. No moralizing echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice owns rhythmic control—“rusted needle through gray silk,” “flower made of thunder”—without purple overload. Perceptual signature is atmospheric, scientist-poet, stable in third-person close. No dialogue to test, but prose breathes with storm cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: every sentence layers image, metaphor, and forward motion. No scaffold loops; metaphor chains stay coherent under electric/storm logic. Variation in sentence length mirrors weather surge and calm. Final paragraph propels descent without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Mythic hermit-prophet trope is flipped: she abdicates authority, valorizing distributed meaning. Cobalt-glass altar + radio static feels fresh synthesis. Risk in abstract culmination pays off through charged image. Could edge higher with one concrete factional confrontation beat.</comment>
