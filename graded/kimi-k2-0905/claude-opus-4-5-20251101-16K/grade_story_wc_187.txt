<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vesna’s preemptive nostalgia is vivid, but interiority slides into self-diagnosis (“she understood this about herself…”) rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choice on the deck alters her next tactic—she only records. The final smile feels unearned because the causal link between shadow-reading and identity-sculpting is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the image of writing “into the hush” reweights the premise with undeniable cost—she will become the sole living vessel of the forecourt. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each shadow measurement thickens the density of loss. However, theOrientation Test waives penalty—observatory anchors arrive by line 6 and disorientation serves the final hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is tactile—brass astrolabes, calibrated stone, pearl-light through cloud—yet the cube monument’s perfect-equilibrium shadow constrains her hope, charging the final image. Crystal forecourt is sensually alive even in memory, rain releasing layered whispers. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object teleports.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the forecourt memory survive?”—tightens as eastern markings prove communal recall weakening. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes personal memory will die with her; cost is legible in the smile that already mourns itself. No reversal, but accumulative pressure suffices under lyric lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: identity is what we choose to remember together, and the price of survival is solitary grief. The hush itself becomes the thematic answer—silence as the texture of erasure. No moralizing; the final image lets the silence speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Vesna’s perceptual bias—light as “pearl and bruise,” quill sounding like “wind through dry grass.” Syntax lengthens under stormlight, then compresses into the final hush, rhythm mirroring nostalgic dilation. No head-hop; diction stays within her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—figurative language is patterned, taught early (“stormlit,” “pearl and bruise”) and paid off in the silver flashes of closure. No synonym loops; every paragraph advances memory-loss stakes. One mixed vehicle (“ivory crust” atop fog) but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Solidified fog” and memory-measuring shadows synthesize fresh worldlogic; crystal forecourt that speaks only in rain is specific to this tale. Yet the preemptive-nostalgia trope edges toward familiar elegiac templates, capped at 7.8.</comment>
