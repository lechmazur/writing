<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s calm withholding and Marek’s desperation are embodied in breath and tear tracks; the “centuries folded within her bones” gives concrete interiority. Internal contradiction is muted—her gentleness never collides with the cruelty of delay—so the arc leans instructive rather than agonized. The final gift of the warm stone is a micro-choice that forecloses Marek’s old grief and crystallizes new obligation, paying visible cost. Voice convergence between teacher and student is intentional and thematic, not accidental flattening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple widens absence until “vanishing to appear” reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Marek holding the stone, future ripples now his burden—felt cost legible in the hush. Orientation anchored by line 4; no penalty. Delayed-reveal architecture is taught early (“telling is not teaching”) and paid off when the fourth ring resolves the sister’s backward path. Causality remains intact: withholding causes stillness, stillness causes sight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Magnetic grotto and floating platform are not postcard backdrops; they bend light and gravity to make the trance mechanic plausible. The warm stone handed from Elara’s palm to Marek’s functions as micro-setting that constrains next action: he must throw it to continue learning. Starlight threads and “sycamore hush” are sensory, selective, POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean: platform rocks, pond below, grotto walls bend—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Marek see why his sister vanished? Pressure escalates via accretion of rings; each ripple deletes an earlier assumption. Fourth-ring reveal forecloses the possibility she is dead, forcing a new stance toward time itself. Cost is conceptual—he inherits an endless curriculum—yet still felt in on-page tears and the stone’s warmth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: disappearance as transformation, teaching as withholding. Subtext lives in gesture—stone passed, not explained—and in the negative-space mirror of the water. Final image reweights “vanishing” from loss to vocation; no moral is spoken. The sycamore hush modulates from lull to charge when Marek realizes he must become the next listener.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, anchored to Marek’s perceptions during trance; no head-hop. Distinct lyric texture—“sycamore hush,” “spilled diamonds”—serves concept, not ornament. Psychic distance breathes outward only after trance release, mirroring knowledge expansion. Filter verbs (“seemed closer”) are few and motivated by altered gravity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathy clauses for hush, abrupt imperatives (“Softer.”) under pressure. No loops or synonym churn; “rings,” “ripples,” “circles” each carry distinct semantic weight. Metaphors stay coherent—water memory, dawn arrival—without mixed vehicles. Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Backwards-aging mentor teaching vanishing through withheld stone ripples is a fresh synthesis of familiar mystic tropes. Risk-taking—quiet lyric closure instead of reunion—heightens meaning without obscuring causality. Specific detail (“magnetic grotto,” “negative-space mirror”) prevents abstraction. Premise is followed to conceptual end: the student becomes the next withheld-from, ensuring cyclical freshness.</comment>
