<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sirel’s interior contradiction—vision turned inward to erase rather than see—is dramatized in the nightly palm-to-temple ritual and crystallizes when the feather’s texture punctures that defense. The mercury-glass skin, trembling fingers, and tear-seeded stone give embodied cost to her choice to remember. The final micro-choice—“she would remember”—lands as earned renunciation because the story has shown the pain of both forgetting and recall. Minor slack: the decades/centuries amnesia is told-not-shown and the “shape of home” epiphany edges toward abstract label-speak, keeping it just shy of the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of invented dreams → feather rupture → stone inscription glow. The tightening is the hum of language she refuses, then accepts; cost is the tear-lit volcanic glass that makes the “home shape” reconfiguration legible. Orientation is secure by line 8; single-scene default met. Closure is a Charged Poise: she will teach, path foreclosed, cost felt. The slight abstraction of “geometry of love and language and loss” tempers the 9-band, but the image of light filling carved channels keeps the effect on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mountain-library’s impossible architecture—folding staircases, phosphorescent moss—actively constrains Sirel’s life: she sleeps in its deepest chamber and walks its corridors nightly. The volcanic-glass tablet and feather function as micro-settings that bear her body’s history (trembling fingers, tears). Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices texture first, bird species second, echoing her gift. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep forgetting vs. allow remembering. Escalation is the feather’s impossible softness forcing her gift awake; agency is the deliberate finger-trace that seeds the stone with light. Cost is the tear-channeling and the exposed “shape of home” she can no longer bury. Under lyric lens, one meaningful intensification suffices; the moment the inscription floods with light reweights options decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of vision: reading what isn’t to avoid what is. The child’s prayer reframes “home” from geography to internal geometry, recharging earlier motifs (invented cities, crest-wing nests). No moral is stated; the final image of light-filled channels offers a non-literal answer. The slight risk of universalizing “geometry of love and language and loss” is offset by the concrete tear-light seeding the stone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice keeps tight psychic distance: every adjective (“mercury-glass,” “gray-barred”) is filtered through Sirel’s perceptual gift. Syntax mirrors her dazed re-awakening—long cadences that tighten into single-clause beats at the touch of the feather. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact (“something felt like home”). The rhythm’s swell-and-ebb teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final line’s quiet declaration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density high—“the mountain had devoured a thousand libraries” does world, history, and threat in eight words. No loops or scaffold; metaphor stack is sparse and coherent (“hidden thunder,” “memory-weight”). Register stays within POV lexicon; no purple drift. Opening line anchors voice; final line resolves by image that recharges prayer motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The inversion of clairvoyance—seeing inward to forget—feels fresh and inevitable. The mountain-library as devouring archive, the tear-seeded volcanic glass, and crest-wing feather are highly particular; removing any would collapse the emotional logic. The “shape of home” reconfiguration grows from prior specifics rather than late rule change. Risk is lyric quietness rather than spectacle, but coherence rewards the gamble.</comment>
