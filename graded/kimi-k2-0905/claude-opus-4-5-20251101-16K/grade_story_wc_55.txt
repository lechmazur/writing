<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to silence while craving music—are alive in scene: she avoids the forecourt 17 years, then steps in; she comes to bury the dream, leaves composing again. Deafness is embodied through touch-only perception; no diagnostic labels. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: risk frozen knees → press palms → accept pattern-music. Renunciation of audible composition is earned and costly; closure shows her returning to ledgers now charged with new purpose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “she would compose in crystal and touch”—path foreclosed to sound, reopened to texture, with felt cost (“she began to weep”). Causal chain holds: rain → whispers visible → palm-pulse → compositional rebirth. Anchors clear by word 60; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening: spiral center converts defeat into new medium. Accumulated pattern (hush / crystals / ledgers) lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen monastery, quartz geometry, and evaporating droplets are filtered through Mira’s tactile bias; every detail either bars or enables her final gesture. Crystal grooves function as micro-setting that literally transmit pattern-to-touch, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography tracks her bare feet, knee soak, palm press without drift. Environment constrains choice: only after rain can crystals “speak” to her new sense.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim or relinquish composition—tightens once: spiral center forces decision between clinging to old silence or embracing texture-music. Cost is visible: she trades audible glory for hush-bound creation, weeps, returns to ledgers transformed. Agency drives turn; coincidence (rain) merely enables. Pressure accrues under Accumulative lens via density of remembered voices she must either feel or forever lose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art mutates rather than dies when the medium is denied. Subtext in water droplets trembling like unvoiced chords reweights silence from absence to material. Final image—composing between ledger lines—offers non-literal answer: time-keeping itself becomes the instrument. No moralizing; complexity intact as she accepts permanent sensory exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance; perceptual signature renders world through weight, cold, vibration—“memory of sound translated through touch.” Syntax lengthens for glacier slowness, shortens at spiral reveal. No head-hopping; knowledge strictly Mira-bound. Prose texture mirrors her silence: no auditory verbs, only sight/touch. Pattern of “excruciatingly gentle” repetition is taught early and paid off in final delicate tracing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“glacial hush…became her second skin”—never overloads. Information dual-loaded: “ledgers that turned without rustle” shows both material and silence. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, stakes, or interiority. Rhythm breathes with sunrise reveal then tightens at palm-press climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Deaf composer re-invents music through crystal tactile patterns—fresh angle on artist-adapts-to-loss trope. Specificity of quartz grooves after rain as conduit for touch-score feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in avoiding all auditory description pays off, creating singular sensorial world. Could edge higher if monastery lore were slightly less opaque, but transformation is grounded and memorable.</comment>
