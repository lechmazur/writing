<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—self-erasure vs. song-preservation—are dramatized in the singing beat; the meteorite transfer literalizes cost, earning renunciation of silence. Interiority stays concrete (dust mote music-score, pigeon wings as audience). Micro-choice hierarchy clear: birds < anonymity < song < trust. Voice distinction n/a (only Marcus speaks), but his newspaper diction contrasts with her sensorium. Closure choice credibly forecloses attic safety with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—dust pattern, meteorite, song motif accrue until reweighted by reprise. Orientation clean by 60 words; attic/bookshop geography stable. Closure is Charged Poise: “Tell me about them” crystallizes reopened risk with conceptual cost (loss of invisibility). Persistent constraint: meteorite’s impossible distance mirrors her exposure, shaping future tactics. Non-closure slips: one teleported prop (velvet pouch appears at door un-signaled) but does not touch climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting constrains choice: skylight beam = scoreboard, pigeon coop = surveillance risk, meteorite weight anchors final palm. Sensory hierarchy filtered through musician’s ear: “feather dust,” “laugh like water,” meteorite “impossibly dense.” Ink/parchment odor carries paternal guilt without exposition dump. Spatial choreography holds; pigeon thrash visible when name strikes. Environment supplies tactical resources (birds for flight, dust for divination) that shape ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice vs. silence—signaled in para 2; tightening occurs when lullaby reprise makes exposure irreversible. Agency: she decides to sing; no coincidence resolves. Cost legible: anonymity forfeited in front of witness. One meaningful deepening sufficient for 700-word scope; could use sharper pre-sing tension beat to enter 8.8 band. Persistent price (meteorite, Marcus list) charges future options under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emergent theme: preservation requires voice, not memory alone. Subtext carried by object travels—pigeon, meteorite—versus forged stasis. Final reconfiguration reweights dust motes from meditation tool to prologue of reopened risk. Avoids explicit moral; “slow, blooming work” image offers CR without sermon. One decorative echo: “blooming” appears in dust paragraph and ending, but recurrence is purposeful, not token.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate aligned to Elara; perceptual signature musical (dust = notes, meteorite = rest in measure). Psychic distance contracts during sing: syntax lengthens, clauses accumulate like breath. No head-hop; Marcus’s interior accessed only by exterior cue (“eyes filled”). Dialogue minimal but natural; subtext in “impressive work, really” carries recognition of her forgery skill. Rhythm mirrors action: short clauses during pigeon startle, legato during lullaby.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops/scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative control: “laugh like water” precise to Tuvan singer; no mixed metaphors. Density high—“stole melodies from dying languages” does three jobs in six words. One minor filter stack in paragraph 3 (“She had spent…”) but low-pressure exposition, so artifact does not touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes; cadence swells into lullaby paragraph then tightens at close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of courier-pigeon forgery + ethnomusicological restitution feels novel; meteorite as mnemonic anchor fresh. Premise transforms familiar “exile reclaiming voice” via forged paper trails and bird-borne secrets. Specificity: dust-mote musical notation, attic skylight as proscenium. Risk in making protagonist passive for first two thirds pays off when song becomes decisive act. No close echoes of canonical scenes; synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
