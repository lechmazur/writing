<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory inheritance—her father’s pyromania, her own firefighting vocation—drives every micro-choice; the coin kiss and sand-scatter are earned, costly renunciations. Interiority stays concrete (“ridged maps of survival,” the child tracing scars). The only minor slip is a touch of self-diagnostic phrasing near “heritage was not destiny,” but it is immediately re-embodied in action. Character arc lands in credible Earned Stasis: she forecloses vengeance on fire and accepts perpetual vigilance instead.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: the coin lifted from black water reconfigures her stance toward fire and heritage with undeniable conceptual cost (“she would be ready”). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each image—sand, coin, lagoon—gains density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“Elena found the obsidian lagoon…”). No teleporting props or soft resets; every object’s state is tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lagoon’s volcanic rim and mirrored surface constrain her ritual: stillness is required for the coin’s suspension, black sand sinks only here. Cloud-migration window supplies temporal pressure—three-day breathing time—yet never feels touristic. Body-as-setting functions via burn-scar “rivers” that guide the child’s fingers and the reader’s eyes. One hairline slip: “gradients of amber and violet” edges toward palette-list, but it is brief and distant from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she sever her identity from her father’s fire?—tightens once: the sand-offering forecloses revenge-ritual and commits her to perpetual rescue. Pressure is textural, not causal-oppositional, but the final image makes the cost visceral: she accepts the next unseen fire. No coincidence resolves anything; the lagoon merely receives. A second tightening beat would push this into 9-band, but single-deepening is allowable at 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—destruction as generative heat redirected toward preservation—emerges through concrete recurrence: black sand once lethal now seeds still water; scars once shame become maps for a child. No moralizing line tells us; the final coin-kiss reweights all prior fire imagery. Ambiguity lingers: she will still face fire, but its meaning has permanently shifted. The kelp-drift image crystallizes this reconfiguration without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited stays welded to Elena’s firefighter sensorium: pressure shifts, smoke scent, tactical stillness. Syntax lengthens during lagoon stasis, then shortens as she climbs out—“Somewhere, a fire was starting”—mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; grandmother’s voice arrives only via quoted artifact. One clause drifts toward editorial certainty (“She had learned that heritage was not destiny”), but voice immediately re-embodies in sand-scatter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layer is spare—obsidian, lacquer, kelp—yet every metaphor accretes meaning until the final “kelp-drift peace.” Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to clipped exit, propelling without overwriting. Proofing is clean; no mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density: “the same black sand she carried… against her heart” fuses backstory, motive, and prop in one stroke.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The arsonist-daughter firefighter is fresh angle; the volcanic-lagoon ritual feels discovered, not invented for quirk. Cloud-migration timeframe and coin-on-thread device are specific enough to resist swap-test. Risk lies in quiet ending—no conflagration showdown—but the kelp image reconfigures fire mythology without gimmick. Only the scar-as-river metaphor faintly echoes familiar tropes, yet child’s finger-touch re-specifies it.</comment>
