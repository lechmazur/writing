<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Watcher’s silence is not emptiness but active witness; her only “choice” is the invention of the shutter-constellation, yet that micro-movement reweights the girl’s options and costs the guardian her customary invisibility. The girl’s tremor-to-tears arc is carried entirely through embodied perception (pale face, unclenched hands) without label-speak. Interior contradiction is palpable: the guardian’s stillness wars with her need to intervene, resolved by the single pull-cord gesture that severs her rule of absolute passivity. Cost is visible: the guardian’s spiraling calm fractures when she acts, and the girl’s return to speech tomorrow is foreclosed as the only path tonight is silence—Earned Stasis lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early (light/dark bars, dental-mirror stars) and lets density accumulate until the final mist-galaxy reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise—“small stars in darkness” crystallizes options and undeniable pressure without explanatory coda; cost is the guardian’s broken vow of non-interference. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by “cobalt dock,” “third mooring post,” “canal guardian” within 50 words. One transition (girl exits alley → sits) is legible; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt dock planks, canal water, mist, and the dental mirror function as micro-setting: the mirror’s reflected beams literally redirect the girl’s gaze and constrain her suicidal stance. Weather residue (wet planks, mist) affects footing and visibility, forcing the guardian to invent the light-pattern tactic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: three-meter distance, bench vs. shutter line-of-sight, mirror angle vs. fog all tracked without drift. Setting charges the final image—artificial stars tremble in the very mist that earlier threatened to swallow the girl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will the girl step into the canal tonight? Escalation is textural: each shutter flick adds photonic weight, tightening the noose of possibility until silence plus manufactured stars become the last counter-suicide tool. Agency is renunciation: the guardian endures the rupture of her own code; the girl endures the survival of her secret. Cost is visible—guardian’s invisibility forfeited, girl’s tears testify to living with unspoken shame another night.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of communication: darkness learns star-value not through speech but through patterned silence and light. Subtext resides in the mirror—an instrument meant to look inward is turned outward to scaffold another’s survival. Final image reconfigures the premise: the smallest light is worth making precisely because darkness is unalone. No moral is stated; resonance is visceral—reader feels the cost of staying alive in the trembling fog-stars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient kept at guardian’s shoulder; perceptual signature is maritime-oral: “stillwater tension,” “sky’s residue,” “spiralingly calm”—phrasing no other character could own. Syntax lengthens and contracts with tide-rhythm; colon-and-dash pairings mimic shutter slats. No head-hopping; girl’s interior accessed only through observable tremor and breath. Voice modulation: guardian’s diction grows almost liturgical as she nears the star-making act. Compression taught early (“silence as complete as water”) and paid off in final “temporary constellations.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances image, atmosphere, or pressure. Figurative language is patterned, not piled: water-sky-mirror-star form one coherent optic chain. No mixed metaphors; vehicles obey physical logic (mirror catches shutter light, scatters upward). Information density high: “silver circular face catching ambient light” simultaneously reveals object, mood, and upcoming tactic. Rhythm breathes—long sentences during stillness, fragments at mirror tilt—accelerating into the final star-burst without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Familiar trope—mystical mentor saves suicidal youth—is inverted by refusal of speech and invention of shutter-constellation, a tactic specific to canal-side night, dental refuse, and post-rain mist. Guardian’s namelessness and tool-choice feel inevitable, not quirky. Risk: entire rescue hinges on light-play instead of dialogue; stakes intensify because method is so fragile. Synthesis feels fresh yet folkloric, as if every city canal hides such a mirror-armed watcher.</comment>
