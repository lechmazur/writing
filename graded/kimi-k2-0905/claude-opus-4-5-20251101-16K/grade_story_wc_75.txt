<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—guarding memory while fearing exposure—surface early and tighten through the bread ritual; her renunciation of private grief to teach the beekeeper’s daughter carries visible cost in the final “T” loaf. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through the emerald lens and flour-dusted fingers, never sliding into label-speak. The only reason this stays sub-9 is that Tomasz’s daughter arrives as an off-stage gift; Mira’s acceptance is credible but the daughter’s own pressure is not yet dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira chooses to swallow the letter’s cost inside communal bread, foreclosing retreat into private mourning. The causal chain—thaw → exposure fear → Tomasz’s absence → daughter arrives → bread ritual—tightens once and holds. The emerald lens re-appears at the end, re-weighting “remember who we were” from surveillance tool to inheritance, a clean Conceptual Repricing. No lens ambiguity; every beat obeys because/therefore logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s perpetual drip and limestone oven are not backdrop but constraint: bread must be baked at dawn before seepage swells, the lens fogs, the falls roar louder after thaw. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Mira notices “droplets like tears” because the city itself is now a body she must keep alive. Micro-setting qualifies: the clay oven’s mouth and the emerald lens’s single pane physically shape her final choice. Only hairline slip: “thundering veil” is used twice in close proximity without cadence payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the displaced arts survive?”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Tomasz’s silence removes their sole conduit. The reversal is the daughter’s arrival: a new thread offered, not seized by luck, but accepted at cost (Mira must share sacred bread knowledge). Price is visible: she presses a “T” for Tomasz into dough she will never eat alone again. No secondary stake dilutes urgency; coincidence complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bread’s alchemy: memory must be swallowed, embodied, then passed on or it petrifies like thawing ice. Subtext operates in gesture—flour on Katya’s palms, honey jar clutched “like a relic”—never in exposition. The final image refuses moral; the waterfall keeps inhaling and exhaling concealment, a Charged Poise that lets ambiguity live. Rosewater dread and golden crust re-weight each other without authorial nudge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder, diction never exceeds her lexicon—“seepage,” “grotto,” “embroider rivers”—while rhythmic compression matches breath under falls-roar. No head-hopping; even the daughter’s interior is inferred through Mira’s lens. Filter verbs (“she noticed”) are voice-motivated, aligning with museum-guide perception. Minor template cadence in two “she [verb]ed, then she [verb]ed” lines, not enough to breach 9-band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from cataract-long to single-clause punches; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“green tint casting forests in the color of memory”) and paid off in the velvet-case snap. Information density high: one sentence flips lens → memory → fire → exile. Zero mixed metaphors; “rosewater dread” is the only perfume metaphor and it accrues rather than repeats. Closure line breathes without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar exile trope is inverted: refuge is vertical, wet, and sonic, not desert or camp. Opera-glass surveillance repurposed as heritage periscope feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Bread initials transform a quaint folk custom into survival technology—specific, non-portable, irreplaceable. Risk taken: quiet lyric escalation instead of overt chase, and it pays off by making silence itself the antagonist.</comment>
