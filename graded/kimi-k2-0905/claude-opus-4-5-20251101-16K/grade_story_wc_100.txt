<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s weary stubbornness is palpable in every micro-choice—tracing cracks, descending alone, pressing her own archive pages to the lens—so the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“weariness had become her second skin”) and avoids label-speak. The only gap is absence of visible flaw or blind-spot that could complicate the repair; she succeeds exactly because she’s stubborn, so cost lands more as fatigue than error. Still, the endurance itself is charged and specific to her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: broken lens → descent → impossible-space gathering → self-donation → revived beacon → spirits shelved. Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: she forecloses retirement, pays with permanent weariness, and the library’s stillness is the irrevocable new state. Cost is legible in the final image—“the stillness had stopped running. And so had she.” No teleporting props or motive amnesia; orientation anchors within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Underwater library is evoked through usable oddities—corridors between water molecules, pressure-differential reading rooms—rather than catalog tour. Micro-setting (the lens, her own archive book) constrains the climax: she must sacrifice personal pages to re-light the beacon. Spatial choreography holds as she gathers shards and returns. Sensory economy is tight; kelp-wrapped package and salt-dark dissolution supply tactile saltwater life without checklist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give these three spirits rest—signaled immediately and tightened when she chooses self-donation, narrowing her future. Pressure escalates because each weaker pulse shrinks the window for repair; her refusal to retire is tested by literal fragmenting light. The price (her archived life-force) is paid on-page and alters her prospects. No coincidence rescues; the repair succeeds only through irreversible personal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “rest as earned address” emerges from the archive’s cataloging ritual and her final sacrifice; no character sermonizes it. Subtext lives in gesture—her fingers “inadvertently stubborn,” the lens drinking her weariness—rather than thesis statements. Final image reweights earlier fatigue into a luminous stasis, offering resonant ambiguity: she gains peace by abandoning the quest for it. No moralizing closing line; meaning stays inside the glowing cracks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic-librarian: elevated diction (“cataloged,” “fractured desperate”) yet salted with bodily weariness, consistent with a 40-year undertaker. Rhythm swells and recedes—long sentences for descent, clipped fragments at the shard-gathering beat. No head-hopping; perception stays riveted to Maren’s selective attention (cracks, light, book pages). Purposeful repetition (“stillness,” “impossible spaces”) teaches the pattern and pays off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description plus momentum (“Glass shards littered the seafloor, each one crying out…”). Figurative control holds: cracked eye, held breath, permanent address extend without mixed metaphors. One minor paraphrase loop—“distress signals frozen… Distress signals, dozens…”—but it occurs early and does not obscure causality. Closure image is uncluttered, letting the glowing cracked lens carry the weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Underwater afterlife library is fresh, but the “broken beacon needs mending” plot is familiar; vitality comes from repurposing the undertaker’s own archive pages as fuel, turning cataloging into self-immolation. Specificity—“pressure differentials of ocean depths,” books writing themselves with half-finished memories—prevents generic gloom. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation rather than twist, but execution is committed and coherent. Could not swap lens or setting without collapsing the emotional calculus.</comment>
