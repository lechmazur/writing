<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent—her “second heartbeat” and need to map the uncharted mind feel lived-in. Emotion stays embodied (laughter startles the clockwork macaw). The gear-pocketing choice is a credible micro-act of participation, but the arc is more insight than crucible; no relationship or status friction on-page means lower-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard layers pattern (translocation → place answers hidden question → gear-as-absence). Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the still gear reweights the premise—wisdom as participation in slow loss, not hoarding. Cost is conceptual but undeniable in the final image (“probable miracles… inevitable”). No orientation debt; transitions legible; beat-tightening lands on the hum-to-gear shift.</comment>

<comment>Mechanical rainforest is protagonist-level character: its wind-music dictates insight, its shedding gears create the lesson. Spatial choreography clean (deck → mercury stream → pocket). Micro-setting = gear + soil; both constrain choice and charge closure. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—philosopher hears before she sees, aligning with her epistemic hunger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she exit the collector-mind and enter participatory wisdom? Pressure tightens when still gear = designed absence; the forest forces her to embrace loss as engine of meaning. Cost is conceptual (she forsakes certainty), not visceral, keeping it shy of 8.8+ visceral band. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge as compost, not archive—emerges via gear-shedding music rather than assertion. Final image of “probable miracles” reweights earlier fragments without moralizing. Subtext in wind-voices bypasses ears = insight bypasses reason; lovely and earned. Ambiguity feels purposeful; no late thesis sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical distance stays steady; perceptual signature rich (“phosphorescent sap,” “clockwork macaw”) yet filtered through philosopher’s taxonomic hunger. Rhythm modulates: long, nesting clauses for wonder; short laugh for rupture. No dialogue to test, so no voice convergence issue. Compression (“seven years… stray”) is taught early and paid off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; metaphor density high but patterned (wind = voice); no mixed vehicles. Sentence openings rotate; scant scaffold. One template risk—“She… she… she…” paragraph—restrained to three lines, does not touch closure. High information density; each sentence at least doubles (setting + metaphor or action + insight).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Clockwork ecology trope is familiar, but here the shedding = designed imperfection to teach participatory epistemology—fresh twist. Synthesis of sound-as-thought and gear-as-absence feels inevitable after closure. Risky lyric accumulative structure works under 800 words. Specific detail (aluminum birches sing fifths) keeps it from abstract everywhere-setting.</comment>
