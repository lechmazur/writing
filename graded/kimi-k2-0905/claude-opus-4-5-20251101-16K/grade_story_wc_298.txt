<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—reckless hope vs. gnawing guilt—stay active in-scene: she palms the burned card, presses it to bark, then offers her intact future. The final shared destiny is earned by that visible forfeit; cost is felt. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak. One slip: “reckless idealist” is author-applied label early; otherwise characterization is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: two silhouettes on a restored tarot, shared road ahead, cost acknowledged. Causal chain holds—card → tree → trade → transformed deck—without gaps. Orientation anchored by word 80; no penalty. Lens stays Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and continuously filters through Mira’s urgency; lantern-light on bone-lace is economical. The sarcophagus-swallowed trunk and moving roots constrain the final bargain—setting directly shapes outcome. Micro-settings (pocket, bark, half-lit corridor) recur with shifting charge. Meets 9+ gate: environment enables tactics and images final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve consumed destiny—signaled by paragraph 3 and tightens when Mira declares she will trade her own. One meaningful escalation: roots stir, bones shift, price becomes visceral. Cost legible in burned-to-whole card and her sensation of future draining. No false reversals; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared fate vs. solitary sacrifice emerges through image pattern (crossroads → two figures) and the final fused destiny; never stated. Grief repurposed into mutual forward motion; ambiguity remains about what shared greatness looks like. No moralizing. Resonance charges final tarot image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter: “half-light,” “bone shadows into lace,” “dusky resolve.” Rhythm modulates—long sentence for descent, staccato exchanges for confrontation. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Distinctive texture without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences double-duty (advance + evoke). No loop or scaffold detected; figurative language sparse enough to keep peak beats clear. Strong verbs (swallowed, trammelled, alchemize) replace modifiers. Card/bark press beat rendered in tight sequence without simultaneity error. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Destiny-trading in root-bone cathedral” feels fresh and fully commits; trope of bartered fate is inverted into collaborative graft rather than restoration. Specificity (stone sarcophagus inside trunk, tarot re-forged with ash) prevents generic swap-out. Final two-figure card synthesizes all prior imagery without gimmick. Risk heightens meaning and paid off.</comment>
