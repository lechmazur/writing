<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thessaly’s disenchantment and drive to “unravel the mystery” are palpably embodied in the climb and crown-removal; the mirrored self is a sharp externalization of internal contradiction. The final refusal lands as earned renunciation because the text has tethered her weariness to tangible cost—burning lungs, copper taste, the clatter of metal on stone. Minor slack: the shadow-woman’s dialogue over-articulates the thematic mirror, muting micro-choice in that beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: crown-clatter + bleeding-star image reweights “queen” to “something else” with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—dreams → climb → mirror → choice—each beat foreclosing retreat. Orientation locked by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens: the slow hemorrhage of starlight re-stains the stakes until refusal is the only unoccupied space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ember-grotto’s cobalt walls, thinning air, and weeping starlight are not backdrop but pressure mechanism: altitude throttles breath, star-pools convert stone to ember underfoot, forcing the queen to feel transformation literally under her skin. Micro-setting victory: the crown’s metallic chill against stone is the final environmental cue that severs her from former status. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—selfhood versus crown—signalled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each drip of bleeding starlight re-tints the grotto, tightening the noose of identity until the only live option is refusal. Cost is legible: forfeiture of kingdom (“a kingdom slept, dreaming of a queen who would not return”). No reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sovereignty as garment that can be doffed when its fabric no longer fits the soul. Subtext lives in gesture—crown clatter louder than any manifesto. Final image of bleeding stars re-prices the glamour of rulership into cosmic hemorrhage; no moralizing sentence intrudes. One hairline slip: “path not taken” line flirts with thematic echo, but silk-wrapped blade image rescues it from abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is regal yet fatigued—“gentle authority expecting obedience from flesh” is idiosyncratic and character-bound. Syntax lengthens then fractures under altitude breathlessness, mirroring climb exertion. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk null; prose rhythm itself carries the subtextual conversation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: strong verbs (“clattered,” “hemorrhage”), sensory specificity (“silver plumes,” “lace unraveling”), zero paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but patterned—starlight as wound-water taught early and paid off in final ember pools—so qualifies as purposeful rather than purple. One negligible micro-repeat: “impossible blue” appears twice in close proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar trope—monarch abandoning throne for self—is refreshed by altitude-as-pressure and star-blood alchemy. Shadow-self made of “starlight and old lace” feels novel, not archetypal. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure instead of causal duel, yet coherence holds. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: disenchantment → ascent → cosmic transfusion → abdication.</comment>
