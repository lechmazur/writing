<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—grief versus the need to keep the covenant—remains vivid and embodied through ink-steeped action. The moment she signs her name feels earned because every prior beat links the walnut husks, the fading photo, and her grandmother’s laughter to her present micro-choice. The only soft spot: “haunted euphoria” is named rather than dramatized in body, trimming the highest band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the signed covenant and pressed locket crystallize continuity with felt cost—loss made visible in ink and starlight. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt breeze, darkening planks, blooming lavender) tightens the stake until the final handwriting stroke reweights meaning. No orientation debt; twilight and jetty are anchored by word 45. One decorative echo (“the jetty bloomed” repeated) nicks perfection.</comment>

<comment>Jetty flowers, weathered planks, and salt scent filter through Maren’s archivist gaze, constraining her pace and posture. The walnut husks in her jar function as micro-setting, dictating the slowalchemy wait; their dark perfume charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—case, locket, ink, pen tracked without drift. Environment never stalls momentum; every detail serves the covenant ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the chain of small moments—tightens once: faded ink forces the decision to retrace or let the covenant die. Escalation is textural: daylight commerce dissolves into liminal twilight, narrowing temporal space for the act. Signing her name carries visible cost (permanent ink, acknowledgment of loss). No reversal, but the single deepening satisfies the 600-word Accumulative track.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation is not resistance to time but making time’s weight legible through proximate choices. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing each letter becomes a quiet resurrection love. Final image of nodding sea lavender offers a non-literal answer: witness without demand. No moralizing; complexity survives in the simultaneous ache and gratitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is archivist-noticer (“spectral ink,” “acid-free sleeve”). Rhythm modulates: long clauses for steeping, staccato strokes for signing. No head-hop; inference stays character-bound. The elevated diction (“liminal,” “proximate cause”) fits a document-keeper’s lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—walnut perfume, ghost-shaped petals—never clogging high-pressure beats. Information density high: one line can layer sensory detail, memory cue, and ritual step. One near-loop: “the jetty bloomed” appears twice; otherwise zero scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar ancestral-pact plot is refreshed through walnut-ink craft and archivist occupation. “Proximate cause” as mechanical heirlooms feels non-obvious, turning legal abstraction into tactile ritual. Specificity—sea lavender, wild carrot, 1887 vellum—anchors universals in one place. Risk is moderate; accumulative lyric structure suits the votive act.</comment>
