<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coachman’s contradictory pull between paralysis and forward motion is embodied in tactile beats (thumb on the needle, reins gathered). Interiority stays concrete; the final crystallization of “Stay present” is earned because every sensory filter has dramatized attention as love. Cost is legible: the silence after the gutters stop is the forfeiture of all prior noise/grief. Minor slip: the ferryman is purely functional, so relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ferry push-off reweights every palimpsest layer into one distilled stance with undeniable conceptual cost (he abandons the right to keep rewriting vows). Accumulative lens is taught by the ticking gutter pattern and held without wobble. Orientation anchored by word 86; transitions are clean single-scene. No causality breaks; the yarn needle’s return is the micro-turn that tightens the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>River-fog, tin roof, and needle-as-micro-setting all constrain perception and finally choice; the far shore emerging is literally the only possible next step. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound > sight) mirrors the POV’s professional habit of “ambient awareness.” No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography across the ferry deck is tracked. Environmental silence at the end charges the closure; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“distill complexity into essence before the gutters stop”—is signaled early and tightens once: when ticking slows, inaction converts to irrevocable crossing. The palimpsest promise escalates via pattern break (single drop countable) rather than causal twist; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt silence forfeiting former multiplicity. Could use one sharper external obstacle to push band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from sensory filtration rather than thesis: attention as eros. The yarn needle’s reprise reconfigures grief into present-moment stewardship without moralizing. Final image offers plausible counter-readings—tranquility or perpetual deferral—charged by prior auditory cadence. One decorative echo (“spindrift serenity” repeated) slightly dilutes multiplicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual signature: fog fragments, rope music, gutter metronome. Rhythm modulates with storm drain cadence; syntax lengthens then compresses as drops separate. No head-hop; ferryman’s speech is filtered through coachman auditory bias. Free indirect style clean; diction stays within coachman’s vernacular. Distinct texture sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer weather, hoof rhythm, memory cue. No synonym loops or scaffold. Mixed-metaphor risk (“steam like prayers”) is earned by established religious diction. One paraphrase loop on “promise” abstraction in mid-paragraph costs 0.2. Otherwise propulsive to final short sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ferry-as-liminal-space is familiar, but the palimpsest promise + ambient awareness as eros synthesizes fresh angle. Gutter-ticking countdown compresses lifetime vows into audible hourglass without gimmick. Yarn needle chosen over sail-maker or upholstery specificity roots metaphor in vocational reality. Risk adds +0.3; could push further if ferryman challenged the stance.</comment>
