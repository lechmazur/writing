<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—fury vs. compassion—are dramatized in embodied micro-moments (thumb on shed tail, jar ritual) that externalize interior split. Her final stance is earned: causal chain from denial→shame→affection→adapted trust, each beat visibly shedding a layer and foreclosing the old compass. Cost is felt: she pockets the tail beside other “evidence of growth through letting go,” accepting permanent loss while choosing guarded openness. No therapy-speak; chameleon gaze mirrors her own maimed survival, cementing individuality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each remembered email/pledge adds density until the shed-tail jar becomes the decisive compression point that reweights trust itself. Closure is Charged Poise—stars indifferent, workshop breathing, tomorrow’s call still unmade—undeniable conceptual cost (her name on reference forms can’t be unsent). One micro-turn at midpoint (shame layer dropped) tightens stakes without causal gymnastics. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no prop drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, heat-lamp amber, and dripping filtration form a tactile crucible that constrains her pacing and focuses attention on the terrarium wall; tail-tip later returned to this charged space. Spatial choreography clean: stool, jar shelf, corner tank track consistently. Sensory hierarchy reflects caregiver bias—sound of gecko click, smell of reptile mulch—rather than scenic tourism. Final star image reprises cold indifference, reframing prior workshop warmth as fragile enclosure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to harden or reopen trust—tightens once via layer-shedding sequence; each peeled skin narrows her viable stance. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates under accretion of remembered betrayals. Visible price: complicity in wildlife commission paperwork can’t be undone. Escalation plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping it short of 8.8+ but cleanly sufficient for 800-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “conviction as living tissue that must molt to survive” emerges through recurrent shed matter (tail, skins, feathers) rather than thesis statement. Final image reframes earlier innocence as untested larval stage—quiet conceptual repricing without moral. Subtext in her cataloguing the tail beside other sheds signals acceptance of permanent scarring. Avoids explicit echo; resonance lingers in indifferent stars vs. continued caregiving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited maintains calm, caretaker perceptual filter—soft anatomies, humidity breath, star distances—mirroring her tempered rhythm. Sentence cadence lengthens during reflection, then contracts to single clauses at each “layer” drop, teaching pattern early. No dialogue required; when she imagines Theo’s voice it stays reported, preserving distance. Diction stays within wildlife-handler lexicon; no register drift even at peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High info-density: “thumb and forefinger, curved like a question mark” shows loss, curiosity, and future doubt in one squeeze. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances layer, atmosphere, or object state. Metaphors (tail as punctuation, conviction as hollow bone) stay internally coherent. Final line lands on monosyllabic beat—“Both had remained”—that lets breath settle without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Wildlife-rescue betrayal angle freshens familiar mentor-betrayal template; shed-tail motif gives concrete, non-sentimental handle on trust trauma. Risk taken in quiet, almost static scene pays off via accumulative lyricism that reweights ordinary objects. Could not swap chameleon tail for feather or claw without breaking symbolic logic tied to adaptive survival. Specificity of rehab paperwork complicity adds occupational verisimilitude rare in revenge narratives.</comment>
