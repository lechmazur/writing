<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—scars mapped as rivers, the box as traded innocence—yet the reflective mode keeps her contradictory impulses summarized rather than enacted in the present beat; the final “hard enough to survive, soft enough to feel” crystallizes a credible, earned stance at visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for renunciation, but the absence of on-page opposition caps her at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked box pressed to her heart reconfigures her vocation from rescuer to translator of pain, cost encoded in “heat from old burns still lingered”; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each celestial return and crack-tracing deepens density until the final cadence shift—while causality remains coherent; no orientation debt; persistent constraint (tomorrow’s fire season) shapes the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ridge, moonlight, and planetary arc function as micro-setting that literally paces her ritual and metaphorically teaches patience; the cracked porcelain box—a recurring tactile “environment” in her hands—constrains the final choice to carry rather than bury, charging the closure image; selective sensory detail (silver on scars, porcelain fracture line) stays filtered through Elena's fire-trained perception; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry accumulated grief without fracture—tightens through each alignment night; the reflective deepening pattern (trace cracks → deeper knowledge) reweights the stake with felt price, but escalation is interior and cumulative rather than a single decisive external test; cost is legible yet once-removed, keeping it just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: broken things persist and must be translated, not erased; the cracked forget-me-nots reappear in the final heartbeat, revaluing “broken” as continuance; ambiguity remains—no moral dictates—while the reader feels the conceptual cost of adopting Elena's translator role; resonance is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“calloused hands,” “brutal arithmetic of triage”) is POV-bound; rhythmic escalation mirrors ritual pacing; no head-hopping; patterned celestial references taught early and paid off; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and texture; no loops or synonym churn; figurative language is spare and accurate (“scars... mapping fourteen years of forest fires”); information density high—each line advances image or stakes; no register drift; closure beat remains unmuddied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter memoir meets celestial haiku; cracked porcelain as vessel of traded innocence reconfigures a familiar trauma trope; risk in quiet lyricism heightens coherence; absence of conventional plot fireworks is deliberate and paid off; specific detail prevents swap-test failure.</comment>
