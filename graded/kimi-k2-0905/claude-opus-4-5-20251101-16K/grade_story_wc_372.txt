<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vera’s vow to guard meaning is consistent and embodied in her careful handling of slides; the moment she recognizes her own frequency is a credible micro-choice that crystallizes her endurance. Interiority is concrete (“her breath visible”), but emotional contradiction is muted—she never questions her duty, so tension stays flat. The final “quiet satisfaction” is earned, yet the absence of any visible cost or foreclosed path keeps the arc from deepening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The library, POV, and temporal frame are anchored within 120 words; the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each slide thickens the portrait of fading belief. Closure is a Charged Poise: Vera replacing her own slide reconfigures the stakes—she is both archivist and artifact—yet the cost is conceptual rather than felt. No causality break, but the piece never tightens a live option; it deepens mood without narrowing future possibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly particular: ice refracting “what little light,” frost crawling across glass, the quartz hush. These details filter through Vera’s practiced attention, constraining her movements and mirroring the external threat of erasure. The setting supplies both resource (slides) and hazard (shatter), charging the final image of her slide settling among thousands. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve meaning from oblivion—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the flickering vows, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no alternative path is ever entertained or foreclosed. The climax reweights meaning by revealing Vera’s own vow, yet no visible price is paid or option sacrificed. Stakes remain conceptual, viscerally felt but static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: collective memory’s fragility and the solitary act of preservation. The luminous vow motif returns re-weighted when Vera confronts her own slide, shifting from abstract duty to personal testament. No moral is stated; the resonance lingers in the image of her promise slotted among thousands. Complexity is present but stays cerebral rather than morally ambiguous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s perceptual signature: “crystalline silence,” “quartz hush,” technical diction of “frequency sampler” filtered through reverence. Syntax is controlled, rhythm steady, with occasional lyrical lift that matches the contemplative stakes. No dialogue, so voice carries the entire load without strain. The texture feels singular and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and economical; figurative language is selective (“luminous vows,” “edge of oblivion”) without crowding beats. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing—“spectral imprint,” “growing nothing”—stays within Vera’s lexicon of reverence. Momentum breathes but never drags; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—“library of frozen vows above the clouds”—is fresh, yet the execution leans on lyric atmosphere rather than rule-based invention. Vera’s self-recognition twist feels inevitable in hindsight, but the concept’s implications (who sends slides? how does light equal fidelity?) remain unexplored. Emotional specificity lifts the piece above pure conceit, though risk stays moderate.</comment>
