<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s hunger for forbidden knowledge is concrete from the first paragraph and drives every step; the mirror-fruit moment externalises her internal contradiction without therapeutic label-speak. Embodied reactions (“brightened at the edges, shot through with terrible wonder”) keep emotion specific. The final acceptance of perpetual mid-story inheritance costs her linear identity—visible price, credibly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the mirror shows simultaneous selves, making the cost of nonlinear inheritance legible. Accumulative pattern (fruit-drop answers) holds the lens; each repetition tightens the stake. Orientation is taught early via the impossible orchard and blank cameo, so disorientation is functional. Persistent constraint—the orchard always was and will be hers—shapes the final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystalline trees bearing sun-fruit, soft moss-ground, and the porcelain bathroom create tactile otherworldliness without catalog excess. The bathroom micro-setting literally hosts the philosophical break, constraining the midpoint turn. Sensory hierarchy follows Maren’s curator eye: labels absent, significance intuited. Spatial coherence survives the impossible physics because the rules stay internally consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“what happens to those who learn the forbidden?”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through fruit-answers that foreclose safe ignorance. The mirror-fruit beat narrows options: she can’t unread her mult selves; the cost is the loss of singular chronology. Agency sits in asking each question; coincidence never rescues. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern rather than statement: knowledge as state-of-being versus possession. The blank cameo and mid-sentence journal literalise the idea that meaning is carved and simultaneous. Final image reweights prior material—portrait already populated by every future/past holder—without moralising. Subtext persists in silence after last line, inviting counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual filter: curator’s taxonomic eye, then vertigo. Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts under disquiet; rhythmic control mirrors pulse of luminous fruit. No head-hop; psychic distance clean. Fragment “Simply complicated” is voice-motivated, patterned early, paid off in bathroom realisation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence advances premise or stakes. No filter-verb clusters, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare and precise (“fruits that resembled small, trapped suns”). Paragraph cuts pass test—each block advances knowledge or stance. Opening and final lines bookend with circular resonance, no scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Nonlinear inheritance as literal orchard-on-asteroid feels fresh yet inevitable; trope of forbidden archive is inverted—knowledge is existential condition, not data. Bathroom epiphany device risks cliché but earns its keep by becoming the site where pattern crystallises. Risk-taking (mirror of selves) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Specific object logic prevents swappability.</comment>
