<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s scarred wrists and radio call anchor her as survivor-catalyst; each beat (entering, decoding, lifting seed) links motive “plant resilience” to tactile choice. The final image—ruin vs. seeds—crystallizes her hierarchy of values without tidy redemption. Interiority stays concrete (“cradling it like something sacred”), avoiding label-speak. One micro-flaw: no contradictory impulse in-scene, so the arc is linear rather than torn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: because she broke in, therefore finds piano clue, therefore locates vault—each step forecloses time as regime loyalists scatter. The radio call at 75% tightens the clock and triggers the decisive load-out; closure lands with felt cost (“weight of ten thousand futures”) under this lens. Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: magnetic-burn pain echoed in “trembling hands” keeps caging memory alive at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned midway prizes, dusty skylight, and false sunset wall filter through Mira’s scavenger eye; each detail enables next action (piano, seam, vault). Iridescent arrow fletching reappears in pack, charging final image. Climate-control closet scales from toy-cheap to life-precious, mirroring stakes. Setting constrains tactics: cramped closet forces one-by-one loading, heightening time pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save seed diversity—signaled in paragraph 2; radio news escalates from personal quest to regime-collapse urgency inside 600-word window. One meaningful tightening: eastern barricade fall converts abstract “eventually” to “perhaps hours,” narrowing options. Cost legible: scar pain + pack weight + ticking loyalists. No reversal, but deepening sufficient for Causal lens at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration-after-tyranny emerges through concrete images: plastic trinkets vs. living seeds, cuffs vs. soil. No explicit thesis; final line “learning to grow” reweights earlier liberation, implying freedom is only prerequisite. Subtext in arrow—weapon remade as marker—suggests violence repurposed for nurture. Ambiguity remains: no guarantee seeds will survive, avoiding moral neatness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Mira’s sensory filter (“dust motes swirling,” “feather that seemed iridescent even in dim light”). Diction stays within her lexicon; no academic drift. Rhythm breathes—long reflective sentences early, shorter clauses under radio pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Tiny slip: “staggering grace” edges toward evaluative grandiloquence not fully earned inside her perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry triple duty: “abandoned prizes surrounded her—cheap plastic reminders of a world that had valued distraction over sustenance” advances setting, theme, and stakes. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Metaphors stay coherent (cage→scars→jewelry). Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths rise and fall with tension. Copy-clean except one optional comma after “fletching.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fuses dystopian heist, botanical rescue, and music-cipher clue in one organic package; premise feels specific, not trope-stitched. Transformation test fails if seeds swapped for gold—genetic heritage is irreplaceable. Risk: carnival-ruin backdrop could read gimmicky, but arrow keeps it offbeat. Final reconfiguration—liberation complete, but harder cultivation ahead—offers non-obient uplift without triumphalism.</comment>
