<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s refusal to collapse seventeen truths into one is dramatized through embodied recitation; the micro-choice to keep speaking sharpens the internal contradiction. The cost—“eternal remembering”—is felt on the final line, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Fen’s “innocently mischievous” tag is label-only and never pressures her choice, a minor flaw. Otherwise, motives, limits, and hierarchy of values track cleanly under rising ritual threat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: Mira rejects the ritual and accepts endless wandering; the reverb cost is legible in “her echoes joining all the others.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each refracted confession adds density until refusal crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (tower, bones, tomorrow’s ritual). No causality breaks; the off-stage disappearance is foreshadowed by “before the ritual came she would climb down.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The bone-littered stairs and canyon acoustics constrain the poetry sessions—sound must be swallowed or it multiplies, shaping the tactic of fragmentation. The pale spire reappears through mist at beginning and end, reweighted from distant threat to immutable boundary. Selective sensory detail (yellowed bones, guttered candles, forged hush) filters through Mira’s artist-perception. Environment is not mere backdrop; it supplies the ritual rule-set she defies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep every truth alive vs. ritual demand for one—tightens with each refracted confession, intensifying density rather than causal reversals. The final refusal forecloses forgiveness, paying the visible cost of eternal exile. No coincidence; the escalating risk is driven entirely by her volitional recitation. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: multiplicity of truth as artistic integrity vs. institutional absolution. The closing image—“her echoes joining all the others”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Fen’s delight contrasts fatal innocence to her deliberate damnation. No thematic echo violations; no platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric, controlled third-person hovers close to Mira’s artist-perception: “truth, like light, could be refracted.” Rhythm modulates—long breaths during recitations, clipped final sentence of refusal. Compression (“bones beneath her feet had yellowed over centuries”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; Fen’s interior is inferred only through gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image, stakes, or acoustic rule. No synonym loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise—metaphors of light/refraction unify without clutter. Read-aloud rhythm rises to urgent clipped cadence at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bone-tower ritual of linguistic fragmentation feels novel yet inevitable; the premise fuses confession, acoustics, and artist defiance into a singular system. Risk in refusing conventional climax (no escape or triumph) heightens coherence of theme. Transformation test fails if relocated—acoustic canyon and ritual are inseparable. No derivative premise debt.</comment>
