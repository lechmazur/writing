<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s curator eye and “listening as leadership” are shown through concrete micro-choices: she waits for Mrs. Delgado’s locket detail, nudges the manager with collective will, and finally sets the brass key on the counter—each action manifesting her discernment with visible cost (the coming demolition). Interior contradiction is thin—she never doubts her method—so the arc is Earned Stasis rather than reversal, but it is fully motivated and felt. The residents’ secondary pressure is clear and alters her tactics without crowding POV. Voice remains hers alone; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant CR: the unsent letters physically leave Oleander Court, reweighting the premise—healing is witness, not preservation. Causal chain holds: stories accrue → collective will forms → lock is cut → letters mailed; each step narrows options toward the final postal act. The 60-day demolition notice supplies the meaningful tightening that forces the mailbox opening, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable in the final image: courtyard reduced to “concrete,” only the key and photograph left to Maren.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Courtyard at dawn is more than backdrop—its impending loss drives the urgency to open the mailbox. Terra-cotta pots, jasmine, folding chairs are tactile, lived-in, and filtered through resident voices. The locked mailbox #7 functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice; its brass mouth and padlock are re-mentioned under bolt-cutters, charging closure. Spatial choreography stays clean across the collective scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the dead man’s silence be broken before the courtyard is erased”—is signaled early and tightened by the demolition notice. The single escalation beat (deciding to cut the lock) is driven by collective agency, not outside savior. Cost is palpable: loss of courtyard, loss of future letters, Maren’s acceptance that listening can’t save place, only story. No reversal, but deepening sufficient for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accretion: discarded objects, unsent letters, and a soon-demolished courtyard all argue that preservation is less vital than witness. Final image of the key beside the photograph reweights “discernment” from saving things to releasing them. No moralizing statement—insight is borne by the mailed package. Ambiguity lingers: Lucia may still reject the letters, leaving the cost unpaid, which charges resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Maren’s perceptual filter: “she trusted the courtyard” is a curator’s idiom, not authorial homily. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences yield to the staccato of “forty-three letters, all addressed…” under pressure. No head-hop; resident voices reach us only through her listening. Distinct syntactic signature survives the emotional peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive: “letters accumulated behind the slotted brass mouth” packs image + agency in one stroke. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and exact (“sandstorm calm”). Final paragraph repeats the word “enough” for cadence without drifting into template. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances story or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “locked mailbox of unsent apology letters” is fresh, yet the plot arc—community gathers to complete a dead man’s unfinished business—recalls familiar templates. Specificity of Oaxaca, thrift-store discernment, and dawn courtyard push it past cliché. Risk lies in the quiet CR rather than twist, but the commitment to witness over rescue feels inevitable in hindsight. Could not swap the curator-listener lens without collapsing the story’s logic.</comment>
