<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maren’s reticence and observational habit feel consistent; the moment she pries the sea-glass from Thorvald’s hand and then chooses to continue the stone-letter chain crystallizes a credible shift from witness to actor with visible cost (she accepts a life-long vigil). Interiority is concrete—her hands “knew” before her mind—but the final emotional beat is slightly over-articulated (“That was what she wanted to bottle”). Still, the change is earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Maren’s decision to keep returning and add to the stones reweights her role and preserves the anonymous chain even though the lighthouse is decommissioned. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (stacked stones, sea glass, ghost light) layers meaning until the final rainbow scatter. Anchors are clear by 120 words; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in her lifelong pledge and the cold empty tower she now volunteers to haunt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lantern room, Fresnel lens, and eastern stone ledge are tactile and specific; the sea-glass micro-object constrains her final message and charges the closing image. Weather and barometer integrate into action rather than backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean across the climb and descent. Some phrasing edges toward the poetic-generic (“ghost-light of the moon”) but the setting still guides choice: the decommissioning forces her decision to keep the vigil privately.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the anonymous protection alive—surfaces early via pattern observation and tightens when the lamp dies. One meaningful deepening: realizing the sea-glass was meant to add a new “word” shifts her from delivery skipper to keeper-of-meaning. Cost is visible (monthly voyages forever, no pay, no successor), but the escalation is more accumulative than causal; still, under that lens it coheres. No reversal, yet the stance crystallizes with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: anonymous care across time vs. institutional abandonment. Subtext resides in stone grammar and the green shard’s wordless “I mattered.” Final image refracts prior motifs without moralizing. The idea is fresh, but the last sentence’s “luminous ache” nudges toward explicit sentiment; still, the resonance lands through particulars, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Maren’s perceptual bias—sea charts, salt-crusted glass, trembling keeper hands. Syntax is controlled and rhythmic; no head-hopping. Word choice stays within her mariner lexicon. A few lyrical lifts (“ghost-lamp burning bright”) verge on authorial flourish but remain tonally consistent and pay off in the final refraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—e.g., “stacked pebbles… changed with the tides” does world-building and foreshadowing in one stroke. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective until the final paragraph, where three color metaphors stack; acceptable because the moment is static and lyrical. Proofing is clean; pronoun and tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Stone-letter language and decommissioned lighthouse give a familiar maritime ghost-story frame a fresh procedural core. The sea-glass addition to the code feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure instead of horror—but executed coherently. Could swap names without breaking arc, yet the stone lexicon and supply-run logistics root it sufficiently.</comment>
