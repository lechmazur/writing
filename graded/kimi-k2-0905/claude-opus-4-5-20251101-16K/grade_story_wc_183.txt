<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s need to name her absorbed twin is vivid and embodied; the hair-brush moment crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation—leaving the ship with only the swatch and quiet certainty—earns its cost through prior beats of archival obsession and physical descent. Flaw: the mother’s knowledge remains ambiguous, slightly muting the contradiction that could have sharpened Mira’s choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: naming “Sera” on the wall reweights Mira’s identity and forecloses further search. The causal chain—swatch → phrase → carousel → garden—holds without teleporting props. Orientation is clear by word 80. The cost is felt in the final image of fog lifting while the Meridian keeps drifting, but the lens is predominantly Accumulative; a single tighter because/therefore linkage midway would have pushed higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The carnival-ship is tactile: rusted bow smelling of brine, deflated balloon animals underfoot. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from prow to carousel belly. The emerald swatch functions as micro-setting, constraining the final paint choice. One minor slack: “garden” is metaphorical, so the lack of soil texture is briefly disorienting before the wall of names resolves it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—giving her twin a name—tightens once when Mira realizes the garden is a wall, not earth. The painted name is the irreversible act that forecloses further chase. Pressure is textural rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens. A visible price is paid: she leaves the ship, abandoning her cage of fog and the only space that validated her strangeness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as communal caretaking of the unborn. The emerald color reprices from costume sample to growth-symbol at the exact beat she paints “Sera.” Final image—“quiet certainty she hadn’t possessed before”—offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity persists about maternal intent, inviting reflection rather than closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “mist curl like ghostly fingers reaching for something lost.” Syntax lengthens under melancholy, then compresses during descent. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested. Filter verbs (“she felt”) appear only when motivated by bodily shock.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long lyrical sentences mirror fog drift, then staccato clauses for the naming moment. No loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors (“freedom in a cage of fog”) are purposeful and paid off. One scaffold phrase—“she had come to recapture”—could have been cut without loss, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Chimera twin as archive-detective inside a ghost carnival is fresh, yet grounded in believable costume-designer detritus. The garden-of-names wall transforms a metaphor into concrete ritual without gimmickry. Risk taken: entire plot is interior hunt, but pressure holds. Transformation test fails only if relocated; the maritime carnival is irreplaceable.</comment>
