<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s hatred-turned-grief is embodied in the white-knuckled grip on the box and the silent sobbing; the cellular-memory device externalises her contradiction cleanly. Vera’s “scheming pacifist” nature, however, is asserted more than dramatised—no on-page calculation or risk visibly backs the label, softening the arc’s catalyst. The final release is earned because the remembered bodily sensations are causally seeded and carry an audible cost: she walks out humming the melody she once smashed. Interiority stays specific, never drifts into self-help jargon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the broken pin remains broken, yet the song vibrates—an undeniable conceptual cost that reframes the box and her identity. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each memory-surge deepens density until silence itself becomes the carrier of music. Orientation is swift: who/where/when established within 60 words. One minor warp: “reality shifts like water” is never tethered to a rule-set, so the surrealism feels convenient rather than constrained, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s absolute silence functions as both atmosphere and pressure system—soundlessness is a tactile wall that forces interiority. Selective sensory detail (smell of cheap soap, thumb on feverish forehead) keeps the world small and maternal. The music box serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: she can leave it only after the cylinder turns inside her. Spatial tracking is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“convince myself hatred was righteous”—is signaled early and tightened by each recovered tenderness, narrowing her moral option space. The midpoint reversal (body remembers care) is irreversible and visibly painful, escalating the cost of clinging to resentment. Under Accumulative lens, deepening equals escalation; no external antagonist needed. One minor slip: Vera faces no counter-pressure, so the conflict is almost entirely internal, capping the tension just short of 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: mercy as an internal biochemical event, not moral decree. Subtext lives in gesture—thumb stroke, broken pin, silence that sings—never in exposition. The final image reweights every prior bruise without declaring forgiveness, achieving conceptual repricing. No echoing platitudes or tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the hum she now carries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: synesthetic silence, taste of memory, spatial vertigo. Syntax lengthens under emotional surge, then fractures at collapse, mirroring breath. No head-hop; Vera’s interior remains opaque, preserving mystique. One clause drifts toward editorial voice (“resentment protects us until it becomes the prison”) but recovers immediately into embodied sobbing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; metaphor clusters serve the Accumulative mode without clogging beats. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Strong verbs (“calcified,” “vibrating”) replace modifiers. One mixed vehicle—“knife-edge of ethical” beside “water finding stone”—momentarily blurs physical logic, but the slip occurs early and doesn’t recur. Final paragraph lands on a monosyllabic cadence that releases tension cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “soundless trauma sanctuary” trope is refreshed by cellular memory as the operative mechanic, not mere mystic hand-waving. Vera’s pacifist manipulation via strategic compassion offers a fresh moral grey zone, though her lack of personal risk keeps the concept from full ignition. Risk is present—surrendering a three-year hatred in silence—but the external world is absent, muting broader resonance. Still, the synthesis feels particular, not checklist.</comment>
