<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margaret’s fear-of-loss / need-for-control is embodied in tactile greenhouse micro-moves; the phone call turns the trait into action with visible cost (“I need help”). Interiority stays concrete, but the climactic line “fear and growth could share the same root system” edges toward diagnostic summary, keeping it just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each storm-wound (trellis, vines, leaf) tightens the stake until the phone call delivers Decisive Change with felt cost—she concedes the nursery. Causality is clean, no props teleport, orientation anchored by 80 words. Closure image (leaf in pocket) reweights prior patterns; persistent constraint (aging body) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: torn vines physically block her path, force the pause that receives the leaf; the same structure reappears in closure as index of ongoing damage. Rain, scent of wet linden, and greenhouse floor texture are filtered through arthritic knees—environment constrains choice. One minor over-telling (“impossible green”) barely blurs specificity; otherwise every detail earns its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—loss of nursery via bodily decline—signaled in paragraph 2. Mid-story tightening: she kneels to re-tie vines, knees scream, first explicit “I can’t.” This micro-choice forecloses denial and propels the phone call. Cost is visible (shame in throat, leaf trembling); escalation is single-track but sufficient for 750-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of necessary undoing emerges through vegetal imagery rather than assertion; final sentence allows beautiful ambiguity—undoing as both wound and prerequisite. Subtext in the daughter’s silence on the phone carries generational transfer of caretaking. One soft echo of thesis in last paragraph, but image of drying leaf in pocket keeps it from moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Margaret’s perceptual grid: botanical diction (“tendrils dangling like broken promises”) reads as her lexicon, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during knee-pain flare—rhythm tracks physiology. No head-hop; free indirect clean. Dialogue fragment is brief, idiomatic, carries subtext of concession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—plants as emotional circuitry—so density penalty waived. Strong verbs (“screamed,” “dripped,” “wove”) eliminate adjective bloat. Final line cadence mirrors clematis spiral, earning read-aloud closure without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Storm-tossed leaf as letter is fresh; metamorphosis via horticultural failure rather than self-help trope avoids cliché. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off because pattern taught early (cataloging blight) and closure reconfigures meaning. Could edge higher with sharper botanical specificity beyond common names.</comment>
