<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera’s “wisely adventurous” trait is shown only once—she times her entry to a century-wide window—then drops out; the renunciation kneel is earned by theme, not prior contradictory impulses. Interiority is vivid (“ruby flake warming”) yet defaults to single-note awe. No micro-choices complicate descent; risk is asserted, not dramatized. Cost is abstract (“carrying a calling”), not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: kneel reframes throne from power to service, with felt cost of forever foregone coronation. Causal chain is thin—mural knowledge → descent → mirror test—but coherent under Situational lens; alignment window supplies ticking pressure. Orientation clean by 120 words; no late rule cheats. Escalation is one-step, not tightening, keeping score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Holographic waterfall, bioluminescent fruit, and bedrock stair give tactile otherness; each is filtered through Vera’s cataloguing gaze. Ruby flake’s heat against skin micro-grounds POV and later charges the kneel. Spatial track is flawless—no impossible moves. Environment does not constrain tactics mid-descent, capping below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Single stake—claim or refuse throne—signaled early; sunrise clock visible, but time does not tighten tactics on-page (no beats shorten breath). Pressure peaks in mirror chamber, yet mirrors describe rather than test; renunciation is thematic inevitability, not reversal. Cost is conceptual, not tactical, satisfying lens but lacking sharp trade-off needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of power-through-service emerges cleanly from final kneel without moralizing. Ruby flake’s shift from key to test reweights motif. Ambiguity remains: throne still unclaimed, world unchanged, yet reader feels reframed. No echo-line cheapens insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Vera’s archivist perception—selective detail, cataloguing verbs. Rhythm swells in cascading clauses that mimic datafalls, then narrows to short beats at kneel. No filter-verb stacks; diction within POV lexicon. Line-level figurative muddle absent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High density—“precision peeler,” “protective coating”—advances both world and action. One mixed metaphor (“weight of history pressing”) but cleared within two lines. Zero loops or scaffold; final image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse coronation shard and inverted stair descend are fresh angles on lost-empire trope. Central trick—throne that abdicates the claimant—feels inevitable after mural map yet not obvious. Risk is moderate; execution keeps tropes transformed through sensory specifics rather than abstract inversion.</comment>
