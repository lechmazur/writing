<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei Lin’s contradictory impulses—spy discipline vs. accidental compassion—are alive in scene: she encodes state secrets while pocketing a fortune meant only for herself. The interiority is concrete (“she had stopped keeping count”), emotions are embodied in the pen-grip under lighthouse glare, and her final micro-choice (writing one extra slip) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she forecloses any remaining “pure” espionage identity. The 12-year backslide is told, not dramatized, and the “accidentally prophetic” trait is asserted more than tested in-scene, keeping it just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam becomes a double metaphor for guidance/intelligence, felt cost is legible in her self-diagnosis “she had become the lighthouse herself.” Causal lattice holds: every fortune she writes creates real-world consequences that loop back to complicate her cover. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of fortune-cookie meanings increases until the final image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; time/place anchored by line 3. One scaffold loop (“fortunes meant…fortunes had become”) does not touch closure; momentum remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment (lamp room, spiral stairs, rotating beam) is not backdrop but tool: the loupe, rice paper, waterproof case form a micro-setting that constrains how she writes and hides dots. Lighthouse beam charges the final image—its “patient rotation” mirrors her dual-function life. Sensory economy is selective: salt-air silence, gray first light, the sweep of beam counted in seconds. Spatial choreography clean; no geographic drift. Meets 9+ gate: lighthouse-as-tool reconfigures meaning at close.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintenance of dual identity while shipping secrets—tightens when she realizes her lies have become strangers’ truths, foreclosing any “clean” spy exit. Accumulative pressure: each fortune she drafts adds accidental human consequence, deepening ethical weight rather than external jeopardy. No external antagonist needed; the tightening is internal. Visible cost: she accepts irreversible fusion of spy/counselor roles, pocketing the final fortune as talisman—Earned Stasis with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: codes become prayers, lies become truths, guidance becomes self-trap. Final fortune “The keeper of lights casts no shadow” offers non-literal conceptual re-pricing: she can warn others but cannot escape her own visibility. Subtext carried in gesture—folding the slip into pocket—rather than exposition. Avoids sermon; ambiguity lingers about whether the final fortune is prophecy or self-fulfilling curse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Mei Lin’s perceptual filter: maritime lexicon, spy-craft brevity, translator’s precision. Syntax mirrors lighthouse rhythm—long sentences sweep, short fragments cut like beam flashes. No head-hop; knowledge capped to her awareness. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Voice distinctiveness evident in coinages like “cold river…warm tide” dualism. Under peak stress (writing final slip) diction compresses but remains coherent.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“Her light meant different things…”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent (lighthouse as self) and do not overpopulate beats. Rhythm varies: opening compound sentence anchors, final fragment punch-clock ends. Clean grammar; pronoun “she” never ambiguous. Opening line hooks with paradox; closing line recharges “shadow” motif. Zero artifacts in final third; closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune-cookie espionage is non-obvious yet instantly credible. Lighthouse repurposed from scenic icon to encoding hub, transforming trope into character extension. Risk taken with quiet, reflective stakes rather than thriller gunplay—and pays off via conceptual re-pricing. Specificity of microdot rice-paper mechanics prevents swapability; emotional truth (accidental goodness corroding spy purity) transcends gimmick. No close echoes of famous scenes; final image is new.</comment>
