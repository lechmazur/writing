<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s calm, methodical interiority stays consistent; the tactile obsession with knots gives her a perceptual signature. Yet the “warmly methodical” trait is asserted more than embodied—no bodily cost or contradiction surfaces until the final quiet sit-down. The arc is credible: curiosity → translation → earned documentation, but the emotional price is only implied. Still, her competence-balanced-with-limitation feels lived-in and drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: seal → door → rope → re-knot → recovered treaty data. The door-fade at dawn supplies a crisp temporal boundary and forces a Decisive Change: she now possesses irrefutable evidence, university ritual is retro-exposed as engineered forgetting. Cost is legible—“she had rebuilt the braid”—and the price of future institutional blowback hangs unstated but felt. One transition (tower room ↔ mirror room) is handled without disorientation; closure lands under causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mechanism room is rendered through touch, temperature, motion; gears swinging backward instantly signal ontological shift. The rope’s micro-texture—hemp/hair knots—functions as setting-as-object and directly constrains her manual restoration beat-by-beat. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no floating white-room moments. Environment is not backdrop but tool, charging both stakes and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: recover what was erased. Pressure escalates via irreversible time window (door vanishes at six) and irreversible rope damage if mis-handled; each knot re-tied narrows her escape window. No coincidence rescues her; agency is restoration labour. Cost is visible in dawn glare and fading door—forever seals her complicity with forbidden knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of institutional amnesia emerges from rope grammar, not lecture. The final image—unnamed diplomat finally named—re-weights every prior “absence” mention without moralising. Ambiguity survives: who engineered the forgetting? Complexity stays clear. No thematic echo lines, no tidy maxim—just reparative archival praxis as quiet resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Elena’s sensory filter; no POV leakage. Diction—“warmly methodical,” “fables of absence”—is precise, academic yet intimate, matching archivist temperament. Rhythm compresses under dawn deadline without syntactic monotony. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through narrated perception; register remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and propulsion; high information density—“each braid contained knots... too regular to be decorative.” No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse, functional; no mixed metaphors. Final line lands clean, recharging “name” motif. Minor filter verbs (“she felt warmth”) are purposeful, not stacked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Makes archival restoration a heroic quest—fresh inversion of adventure trope. Wax-seal-as-key and rope-as-manuscript feel inevitable yet unexampled. Institutional forgetting coded into graduation ritual is sly, specific critique. Synthesis of mystic portal + bureaucratic forensics yields memorable conceptual sting; no derivative aftertaste.</comment>
