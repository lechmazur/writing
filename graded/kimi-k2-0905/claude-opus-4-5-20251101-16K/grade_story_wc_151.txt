<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet authority and generational memory land; her chalk ritual externalizes contradictory impulses (rebellion vs nostalgia) with visible cost. Vera’s tremor and whispered birth-name give one beat of embodied stakes, but the relationship remains mostly one-way—no status pivot or mutual flaw exposure. Interiority is lean yet particular (“speed of hope”), avoiding label-speak. Still, the final renunciation is more symbolic than personally scarring; cost is abstract, not viscerally felt by Mira, capping arc at “strong” rather than “exceptional.”</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens: golden arcade → chalk cipher → sealed letter; each beat adds density without causal whiplash. Closure is a Charged Poise: the mailed letter crystallizes both Elena’s future and Mira’s perpetual endangerment, cost legible in “surface mail remembers.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no debt. One soft spot: the hopscotch encoding is shown once, never tested under threat, so the tightening feels more lyrical than tactical—keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory triage—chrome catching dawn, chalk dust on concrete—filters through Mira’s attuned nostalgia. The arcade’s scale and carousel shadows guide spatial choreography and supply the covert drawing surface; environment actively enables the covert beat. No weather or macro-geography needed; micro-setting suffices. Golden tiles vs weathered concrete mirror analogue/digital schism, charging the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Lyra’s escape—signalled early and tightens when the chalk code becomes the single vector of freedom. No reversal, but a deepening: birth-name disclosure raises psychic cost, foreclosing anonymity for Vera. Agency sits with Mira’s inventive act; however, the scene ends before material risk (scanners, drones) manifests, so pressure stays conceptual. Sufficient for 600-word window, yet keeps cost in the realm of idea rather than consequence-on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory vs surveillance—emerges through tactile anachronisms (clipboard, chalk, postage) rather than exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: pressed flower + fingerprint = identity as living relic. Final “speed of hope” reprices analogue slowness as moral advantage, reweighting prior motifs without sermon. Ambiguity remains: Network may still win, letting complexity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains Mira’s perceptual signature—dawn “breathed,” horses “strain”—without head-hop. Syntax modulates: longer lyrical cadence for nostalgia, clipped imperatives for the hand-off. No dialogue to distort; chalk pattern stands in for speech, staying goal-driven. Register stable, no filter clutter; lyric compression taught early and paid off at exit image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density—almost every sentence couples image with function (“holographic advertisements flicker overhead - relics...”). Varied sentence openings, natural paragraph rhythm. One metaphor stack at opening (“cathedral to a forgotten age”) is earned by later religious evocation of margins. No scaffold, loops, or register drift; micro-movements purposeful. closure line clean, unburdened by poetic overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopian trope—underground identity forger—feels fresh via postal nostalgia + sidewalk-chalk cryptography, a synthesis not yet overused. Specificity of ebony clipboard and hopscotch cipher ties device to generational memory, resisting swap test. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than thriller beats; coherence justifies choice. Could push further if Network counter-pressure were more than ambient.</comment>
