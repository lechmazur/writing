<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory need for both empirical truth and supernatural acceptance crystallizes in the silent decision to keep “believing”; interiority is specific, yet the ghost’s motives remain off-page, preventing full 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The seal-reveal creates a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the narrator’s reality rule-set rewires from living neighbor to post-death tutorial; cost is felt in the line “I suddenly realized she never actually drank,” reconfiguring every prior tea session under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harlow Building carbon-shadows, cereus blooms, and meteor streaks interleave with action; the rooftop garden micro-setting constrains the final Charged Poise beneath falling ancient light, satisfying the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten cleanly from sugar favor to ontological complicity; the narrator’s agency manifests in the choice to sustain the lie, paying the cost of perpetual uncertainty—visible price, but only one beat of escalation under Accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-obligation emerges through scar-reading imagery and meteor metaphors; final Sumerian “threshold” word gifts a non-literal answer that reweights every prior lesson, earning resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries an architectural precision—“notches in stairs worn by a century of feet”—that modulates into hushed wonder; no head-hop, steady psychic distance, rhythm taught via patterned dashes and paid off in final fragment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only minor echo (“agreed upon lie” twice in four lines) keeps it from 9+. Metaphors stay coherent, syntax varies, information density high; no artifact touches the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusing ghost-tutorial with architectural necromancy feels inevitable yet fresh; the “buildings remember” conceit re-casts mundane demolition grief into supernatural stewardship, fulfilling the transformation test with bold specificity.</comment>
