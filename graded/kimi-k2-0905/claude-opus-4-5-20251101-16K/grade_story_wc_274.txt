<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—protocol vs. truth—are dramatized in the micro-choice of pressing “transmit”; the cost (waiting to be caught) is visible. Interiority is concrete (“trembled—not from cold”) and family grief anchors motive. The shift from conflicted to resolved is abrupt; one more beat of embodied hesitation would have earned the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: cracked seal → read → transmit → networks awaken. Closure is a Decisive Change with social cost legible in “Let them come.” Orientation is secure by line 5; no teleporting props. The single tightening beat suffices for this length, but the transmission consequence is summarized rather than shown, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “hexagonal stacks,” “perpetual chill,” and “dormant networks” are selective, lived-in details that guide Mira’s access and final action. The snow above functions as an indifferent counter-image, charging the last line. No object or spatial constraint directly shapes the transmission beat; hence capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. complicity—is signaled early and tightens once: the decision to transmit forecloses safety. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; the price (personal doom) is felt on-page. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the single turn carries sufficient weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: archived silence as civic murder. The snow and “frozen words” refract from literal setting to moral indictment without authorial commentary. Final image reweights the opening quiet from peaceful to criminal. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter; phrasing like “depth pressure” and “dizzying quiet” is character-tinged. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then compresses at the transmit beat, mirroring risk. No head-hopping or register drift; voice control supports pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is spare and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“dizzying quiet… frozen quiet”) is audible but does not touch closure. Otherwise high-density line craft throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “archive of frozen words” reframes climate-cover-up through a fresh institutional metaphor; the dormant-network reactivation feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Some tropes—evil council, last-ditch data dump—are familiar, but specific cryogenic archiving detail and the snow continuum lift the piece above template. Sufficient risk and transformation for high band, though not genre-redefining.</comment>
