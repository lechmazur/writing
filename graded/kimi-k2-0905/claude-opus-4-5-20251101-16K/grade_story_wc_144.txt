<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is tactile and特定, her patience and synesthetic “reading” of light-through-water feel lived-in. The hummingbird is an extension of her body, not gadget-exposition. Yet the emotional arc is static: she begins and ends in the same calm competence; no contradiction is forced to cost. The music-box restoration is a lovely micro-choice but does not test or alter her values, so the “earned change” clause stays empty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every droplet, gear, and note layers until the final cadence reweights the depot’s transience vs. Maren’s stillness. Closure is a Charged Poise—the Auroras horn reframes her shop as the place where journeys are anchored, not launched. Cost is present but diffuse: the ship’s departure is felt as an irreversible widening of the world she cannot see, yet Maren’s stance is acceptance, not loss. No causal turn inside the scene, so the tightening is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mist, salt, iron, and grease interleave with the body-tool interface; the hummingbird’s refraction data is a sensory replacement for sight, making the micro-setting do macro work. Spatial choreography is immaculate—tracks, platforms, signal booth, fountain—all tracked without slips. The depot breathes: anchor chain, wet planks, horn resonance, each sound timed to emotional beats. Weather is not backdrop; it determines how Maren “sees,” charging the final image when the horn cuts through mist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving the invisible threads between people and their artifacts while the world departs. Pressure is ambient—crowds swelling, anchor lifting, music box silent—rather than a crucible that forces Maren to sacrifice or renounce. The single micro-turn is the cylinder’s restoration, but it does not tighten her own options; the depot keeps humming, the ship keeps leaving. Cost is vicarious (the young man’s grief), not paid by the protagonist, so escalation stays modest.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: repair as protest against impermanence, blindness as deeper seeing. The Aurora’s departure and the restored waltz are two halves of the same insight—every leaving demands a staying-behind act of mending. No character articulates this; the horn and the final music-box chord do the talking. The emotional aftereffect is nostalgia without sentimentality, a ache that lingers past the page.</comment>

<comment>Third-person omniscient stays close to Maren’s synesthetic register; diction is precise yet never clinical, cadence slows to match her patient hands. Figurative language is sparse and tactile—“salt-breath,” “gray suggestion,” “curl of each note”—each image anchored in her water-light interface. No filter-verb bloat; sentences breathe. Voice does not modulate under pressure because Maren herself does not rattle; that steadiness is the point, so the static pitch reads as intentional poise rather than monotony.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, almost every sentence duplexes job: advances repair, layers atmosphere, reveals character. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “mist-coated,” “veil,” “gray suggestion” are variants but each shifts the visual field. One mixed metaphor—“veil softening iron edges into gray suggestion”—is minor. Opening and closing lines are resonant bookends that re-inject the mist/horn motif with earned weight. High information density without padding keeps momentum inside a lyric stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Blind machinist decoding light-through-water is fresh, and the synesthetic prosthesis avoids trope. The “repair shop at departure hub” frame is a clean conceptual splice, but the music-box rescue is a familiar beat. Stakes stay intimate, avoiding larger plot clichés. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist; the payoff is modest but coherent. Specificity of salt-mist on gearbox and compass weight keeps the world from feeling generic.</comment>
