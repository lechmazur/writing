<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation as wreck-diver/ghost-whisperer is shown through ritualized action—descent, candle placement, carving—rather than label. Her “weaves truth carefully” trait directly governs the pivotal decision to offer Elsa partial justice in ice rather than public exoneration; the renunciation costs her the easier moral victory and is legible on page. Interiority stays concrete: “borrowed light, she thought, borrowed from somewhere warmer” fuses world and self-perception. Yet the story keeps her psychological limits off-stage; we see tactic but not the flaw that harms her, so the arc is more job-well-done than self-reckoning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s carving re-weights Elsa’s memory and Mira’s own ethical ledger, with visible cost (she forfeits public vindication, accepts permanent shrine labor). Causal chain holds: recovered snow-globe → ghost interview → dream-data analysis → private truth-craft → ice inscription. Orientation锚定 by line 4: glacier shrine, night, candle niches. One non-closure slip: “three weeks ago” retrieval is summarized off-stage, so the inciting artifact enters without on-page pressure, a minor ellipsis that neither breaks nor charges the final image.</comment>

<comment>The glacier shrine is not backdrop but tool: blue-ice walls steady candle flames against physics, providing the literal surface on which Mira inscribes justice; environment thus constrains the final act. Sensory selectivity mirrors Mira’s professional gaze—she notices fused glass, bent steeple, “borrowed starlight” reflection—never tourist-description. Spatial choreography is tight: globe moves from palms to candlelight to lifted offering, tracked without drift. Micro-setting qualifies: the warped snow globe itself functions as mobile locale where village figures merge, mirroring Elsa’s fused identity and charging the final carving decision.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can Elsa’s innocence be memorialized—tightens once: public vindication is foregone for glacier inscription, a trade-off that narrows Mira’s options and costs her social leverage. Pressure is coherent but single-pulse; after the reveal, no new obstacle escalates. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, fitting the lyric mode but keeping tension abstract. Still, the renunciation is dramatized on-page (“I’ll tell the ice”) and carries persistent consequence, satisfying minimal escalation for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific inversion: salvaging purity does not mean cleaning the object but restoring the dead girl’s name while accepting the stain on the living. Subtext operates in gesture—lifting the warped globe becomes an act of witness rather than exposition. No moralizing summary; final image of carving in ice leaves resonance without thesis. Ambiguity lingers: glacier memory may outlast human rumor, yet Harald’s slander remains unchecked, a complexity that avoids tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature—“borrowed light,” “salt and time,” “growing teeth”—is consistent and character-specific. Syntax flexes from lyric compression to short declarative exchanges with ghost, mirroring ritual rhythm. No head-hopping; Elsa’s voice filters through ice and chest resonance, preserving POV modesty. Free-indirect transitions are clean, e.g., “This was the window Mira needed,” tagged to her professional strategy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “blue ice held centuries of silence” performs atmosphere, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative language is patterned—light as borrowed, glacier as memory—so density reads as design, not purple. Rhythm modulates: long sentence sets shrine, then short beats for ritual actions, accelerating into carving closure without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Premise fuses maritime salvage with ghost-whispering and dream forensics, a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once declared. Snow globe as talisman reverses typical sentimental object into warped evidence, transforming trope through damage. Risky lyric structure (ritual scene rather than confrontation) is held coherent by ice-carving payoff. Could edge higher if Mira’s personal cost were more visceral; currently the innovation is conceptual more than emotional.</comment>
