<question>1</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Driven, credibly obsessed custodian; embodied micro-gesture with prism shows interior contradiction. Retrocognition used as scalpel, not label. Final renunciation of skeptic lands with felt cost: “thistle-blown hope.” Only minor dip: four-year off-stage effort is summarized, muting flaw exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens taught early; closure is Charged Poise—beacon pulses, threads rewoven, cost legible in her continued solitude. Orion insertion at climax crystallizes pattern; persistent constraint (shattered prism) shapes tactics throughout. No orientation debt; single shard flashback anchored to tactile cue. Causal skeptics answered by final image of distant walker turning.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glass pavilion doubles as micro-setting and tool: wind-song governs mood, lattice angles determine prism placement, shards cut fingers—environment actively narrows options. Starlight refraction tracked sentence-to-sentence; no white-room syndrome. Final beam’s fifty-mile limit anchors new scale without exposition dump. One minor lapse: Earth-tilt remark drifts toward abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove coincidences matter”—tightens through each calibration attempt; failure means cosmic silence. Escalation via star-shift calculations raises cost of error; shard of hush placement forces irreversible commitment. Persistent constraint: broken prism cannot regain former range, pricing every mile gained. No antagonist needed; pressure is ontological and sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through refracted light motif: broken pieces still bend purpose. Subtext in moth-memory vs. human forgetting; silence between star-beats equals unspoken grief. Closing image reweights premise without moralizing—walker’s pause is reader’s epiphany. Avoids thematic echo; no character recites thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment> lyrical, patient cadence mirrors Mira’s sky-watch patience; diction stays within her technician-poet lexicon. Glass “sings,” prism “bleeds” past—figurative but patterned, taught early. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens at shard-touch then widens to cosmic scale. Rhythm accelerates only at “The beacon rekindles,” earning climax pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often handles sensory, emotional, and plot work. No filter-verb clusters; strong verbs (“crowns,” “threads,” “scattered”) push motion. Occasional lyrical stacking (“thistle seeds across the wounded earth”) risks purple but stays tethered to voice. Final paragraph loops “might be hope, might be accident” for purposeful echo, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse beacon-keeper trope refreshed by retrocognitive maintenance log and probabilistic theology. Star-path trigonometry as sacred ritual feels non-obvious. Risk taken: quiet climax is image, not battle; coherence maintained. Transformation test passes—swap prism for generic relic and resonance collapses.</comment>
