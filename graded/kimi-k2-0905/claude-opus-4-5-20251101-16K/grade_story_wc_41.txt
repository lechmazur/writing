<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Morrow’s precognitive amnesia and chalk-note ritual create a credible, embodied contradiction; the final beat—marking the sphere after the sound vanishes—shows a micro-choice that costs him the memory again. Interiority stays concrete (“sound like photographs curling”) and avoids label-speak. Yet the story never tests his flaw against an external antagonist or second character, so status/relationship pressure is absent and the arc is purely accumulative; the cost is felt but not compounded by interpersonal stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arrow chalked on bronze crystallizes the endless loop of search-forget-search with visible cost. Causality is accumulative/textural—each breadcrumb re-weights the same stake rather than narrowing options—so the lens holds. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. The ending’s cost is legible in the single line “RETURN. THE SPHERE KNOWS,” reconfiguring tomorrow’s options without solving them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fog, salt, and corroded sculptures are filtered through Morrow’s sensory priorities; the bronze sphere becomes a micro-setting that literally constrains his listening posture and charges the final image. Selective detail (“fog pooled in its basin”) replaces tourist catalog. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly. The sphere’s acoustic property is the one rule introduced and it pays off at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the unholdable sound of aging—is signaled early and deepens through each failed attempt; the tightening is the moment he hears it yet loses it again, reweighting the cost of memory loss. Pressure is textural, not causal, but coherent under the Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves anything; the tide simply repeats. A visible price—another erased memory—is paid on the final chalk mark.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative erosion of memory and the sacredness of what can’t be kept; no character states a thesis. The final image of the arrow re-prices the premise: the search is the only form of possession. Ambiguity lingers without confusion. One near-miss—“the sound of growing older” flirts with abstraction but is immediately embodied as “photographs curling.” No moralizing close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Morrow’s perceptual signature: “salt air sculpted temporary monuments from mist” is a mind that anthropomorphizes weather. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the tide of attention; no filter-verb clusters. No dialogue, so no register drift. The lyric compression (“sound like letters never sent finally dissolving”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final auditory hallucination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per high-pressure beat—and coherent. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One scaffold risk: “fog made ghosts of everything” is followed immediately by “A steel heron emerged and vanished,” a near-self-paraphrase, but the beat is brief and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The precognitively-forgetful prophet chasing the sound of aging through driftwood breadcrumbs is a fresh synthesis; the concept commits fully and follows its implications. Risk-taking (no antagonist, no dialogue, purely lyric escalation) heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. The bronze sphere as echo-chamber feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
