<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—claustrophobic duty versus hunger for unmapped life—surfaces in every tactile beat; the choice to sever the maze-branch and walk out feels inevitable because her hands already bear the scabbed map of that decision. The closing renunciation (“carrying no visions, only the memory of intersection”) lands as earned stasis: the cost is the blank horizon she now must inhabit without prophecy. One flaw: the gathered descendants are named only by scars, so the crucible moment is solitary; relationship pressure is asserted, not dramatized, trimming the upper band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the clipping roots itself, the covenant re-anchors, and Mira is expelled into purposeless aliveness—cost legible in the echoed phrase “impossibly, terrifyingly alive.” Causal chain is intact: eclipse early → sever branch → blood-link summons witnesses → silver threads re-knit dream-intersection. One micro-gap: the summoning mechanics (“the clipping’s call”) are asserted rather than prepared, a slim motivation bruise that keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The maze garden, the spiral branch, and the cobalt glade are not backdrop but gear: each constrains movement (can’t leave without clipping) and charges the final image (clipping roots into the same cobalt soil). Sensory triage is POV-true—Mira notices leaf-veins, not bird species, because her life is hortile topology. Spatial tracking is flawless; no floating bodies or impossible distances. The environment earns its keep in the 9-test but stops just shy because the glade itself doesn’t fight back or demand adaptation—it merely permits.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—‘shared unconscious will shatter unless witnessed tonight’—is declared early and personally tethered: Mira’s own visions will collapse into static if she fails. Mid-story tightening occurs when she crosses the garden gate and prophecy lifts, trading certainty for terror; that emotional flip narrows her options to succeed or become ordinary. Cost is visible (the rooted clipping means the maze claims new custody, she walks away emptied), satisfying the 8+ gate. escalation is single-curve rather than iterated, capping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of collective connectivity: someone must root themselves so humanity can keep dreaming together. The refrain of “rewriting covenant in desperate haste” mutates from dread to release when Mira accepts blankness, a non-literal answer that reweights the opening image of choking vines. No moralizing line intrudes; meaning stays in the rooted sprig and her emptied palms. Minor abstraction in “seven billion isolated minds” is the only soft patch preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Mira’s sensory filter—boxwood scent, scar tissue, static behind the eyes—creating a consistent perceptual signature. Rhythm flexes with pressure: longer sentences while she hesitates, clipped fragments as the silver threads cinch. No head-hops; the brief collective “they” remains external. Voice modulation under stress is controlled; the final free-indirect “impossibly, terrifyingly alive” crystallizes the new stance without breaking texture.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “twilight pooled like liquid sapphire” does double duty for color and liminality. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language thins during the high-tension threading beat, keeping clarity. Occasional elevated diction (“hortile topology,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register but stays within Mira’s lifelong arcane study. One scaffolding trace: “the eclipse came three decades early” is repeated almost verbatim in next paragraph—minor, but keeps it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines oracle-bound gardener with premature-eclipse crisis to create a fresh myth that feels elder-deep yet new. The maze-topiary clipping as passport is an image I haven’t seen; its spiral reappears in scars, sky, and rooted future without feeling planted by checklist. Risk is taken in the lyrical reset ending—prophecy traded for blankness—and it pays off. Only the quick-cluster of forgotten covenant families feels faintly derivative of “lost bloodlines” trope, holding it shy of 9+.</comment>
