<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s affectionate skepticism is lived-in: she kisses Eli’s forehead while doubting the pills, then commits to the light-cure with stubborn empiricism. Her interior contradiction—“believed more in neuroscience than miracles”—survives the climax, showing a hierarchy of values that costs her nothing yet feels earned. Eli’s passive recovery is acceptable because the stake is her agency, not his. Micro-choice arc is clean, embodied, and never slips into diagnostic jargon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the fractally scattered light on the studio wall reweights the entire premise—love as non-technological telepathy—while Eli’s whispered “I felt it” pays the visible cost of recall. Causal lens holds: because she devises the somatic-light ritual, therefore the pathway re-opens. No teleporting props; the geode is present from first beat to last. Orientation is anchored by word 60; lens ambiguity never arises.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The light-painting studio functions as micro-setting: blackout darkness, LED wand, overhead toggle—each constrains Maya’s choreography and charges the final rainbow scatter. Sensory hierarchy is photographer-specific: ISO, long exposure, shutter click felt as haptic memory. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies never float. Weather is irrelevant and rightly omitted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Eli’s recognition—tightens once: static shock → recall → somatic-light ritual. Agency is Maya’s alone; no coincidence resolves. Cost is felt: the ritual must be repeated tomorrow, foreclosing effortless reunion. Escalation is single but meaningful; no secondary stakes compete for oxygen.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: geode-as-thought-pattern, light-as-pathway, skepticism-as-love. No moralizing; the final image of small rainbows on the wall re-prices “hope” as fragile yet workable technology. Subtext lives in gesture—hand to chest—rather than statement. Ambiguity is meaningful: tomorrow may fail, but tonight the bridge exists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Maya; perceptual signature is photographer—fractally precise, long-exposure metaphor extended without strain. Compression is taught early: “light painted their story in the darkness.” No head-hopping; Eli’s tear is externally observed. Diction stays within her lexicon; no academic drift. Rhythm modulates: lengthening sentences mirror the slow arc of light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold. Syntax breathes with emotional arc: short clauses under pressure, longer luminous stretches during the light-painting. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—fractal, scatter, prism—paid off in the closing scatter. Information density high: “muscovite geode sliver” does triple duty (gift, lens, light-splitter). No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—telepathy pill recall—reverses the usual neuro-tech arc: repair comes not from more tech but from embodied art. Somatic-marker plus crystalline-optic synthesis feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk is quiet: quiet ending, quiet light, quiet tear—yet stakes feel absolute. Transformation test passed: swap names and the arc collapses because the geode’s optical specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
