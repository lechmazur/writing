<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradictions—arrogance vs. self-loathing, craving absolution yet refusing to seek it—are dramatized in every micro-choice: bleeding fingers still pulling threads, eyes burning yet leaning closer. The moment she “forgave the woman who had failed her student” crystallizes earned stasis; cost is the blood on the tapestry and the quiet walk into rain. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions live in torn cuticles and the audible hush finally lifting. Flaw: the prince-loss backstory is told, not shown, slightly blunting initial motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the labyrinth complete, rain falling, dog landing—felt cost is the thunder that never broke until her final thread is set. Causal chain holds: fray-detect → decode → pull → release; each because/therefore advances options. Orientation anchored by word 52 (“village was called Stillhaven”) well inside 120-word window. One scuff: “weeks—or what felt like weeks” is a soft ellipsis that could tighten.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tapestry’s platinum border functions as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move; its metallic scent and light-catch guide her choices. Frozen village externalizes her stasis; thawing rain mirrors internal release. Spatial choreography is flawless—eastern wall, dusty windows, single dropped-stone shimmer. Slight over-reliance on visual; a tactile thread-snap or metallic chill could sharpen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she free the village without losing herself?”—tightens when each pulled thread draws blood, turning abstract repair into visceral cost. Single meaningful escalation: the moment she realizes the labyrinth demands stalemate, not victory, foreclosing her habitual win-mentality. Agency is continuous; no outside savior. Cost visible on page: bloody fingertips, trembling sit-down afterward. Could edge higher if lost blood altered her dexterity mid-task.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges from thread-pulling rather than thesis: the same hands that ruined a province now mend a village. Final image—“one more piece freed from a labyrinth of her own making”—reweights the chess trope into moral insight without moralizing. Subtext in “fierce repose” contrasts calm focus with inner war. No echo-statements; meaning stays embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice carries precise chess-tactile diction—“winnow,” “stalemate,” “seventeen moves ahead”—yet stays restrained, matching her exile’s fatigue. Rhythm accelerates during thread-pull beats, slows into the final rain sentence, taught by early “distant thunder” pattern. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Filter verbs vanish under pressure (“hands twitched,” “eyes burned”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Line-level propulsion is clean except one soft paraphrase—“Time had stopped here, or perhaps merely paused”—which repeats the same idea; a 0.1 tick. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene needs, closing on a single-sentence paragraph that lands like the first raindrop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of “wizard solves cursed village” into a chess-problem about stalemate and self-forgiveness; the tapestry-as-chessboard feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of platinum thread labyrinth, frozen laugh caught in a child’s throat, and “productive fidgeting” roots the concept in sensory detail. Risk-taking in quiet, non-heroic resolution pays off. Not quite 9+ because the exile-backstory capsule is familiar shorthand.</comment>
