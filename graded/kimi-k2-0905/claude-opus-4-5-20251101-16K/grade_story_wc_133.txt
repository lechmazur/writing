<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (“salt-cracked hands,” “voice hoarse from disuse”) and Mira’s insomnia is embodied. Yet the decisive brooch-gift feels lightly motivated: the text asserts her need to “let people see” but never shows her weighing loss or risk. Secondary character (trader) lacks individuated speech; both speak in the same measured cadence. Endurance of sleeplessness earns stasis but the micro-choice to surrender the talisman arrives without prior contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the exchange of brooch for canvas crystallizes Mira’s new stance and ends her insomnia. Causal chain—rain trails → brooch → trader → swap—holds; tide/causeway mechanics are coherent. The 120-word anchor passes; orientation is clear. One minor loop: “They say a lot of things” answers a line that was not really a question, but this does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tidal island is more than backdrop—emerging causeway literally enables the trader’s arrival and the climactic exchange. Water-warped debris, kelp-draped stones, and receding tide filter through Mira’s painterly eye, constraining where she walks and what she finds. Micro-settings (wet sand, rusted war scrap) embed history without exposition dumps. Weather and lunar rhythm remain consistent; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Mira can turn war memory into living meaning—surfaces early. Pressure tightens once the brooch forces confrontation with shared symbol; gift to trader forecloses her original plan to paint it, costing her sole evidence. Escalation is single-thread but coherent. Cost is legible: surrender of tangible relic + acceptance that meaning must travel rather than be fixed on canvas.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: enemies share a forgotten root, meaning is mobile, not possessable. Final image of converging rain trails reweights earlier motif without moralizing. Subtext in trader’s “still here” carries survival guilt and gratitude. One soft echo: “ancient amber truth” flirts with abstraction, yet the insect’s trapped perspective keeps it particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under fatigue, contracts at the find: “She almost laughed.” Filter verbs minimal; perception skewed by sleeplessness (“tired eyes burning with haggard awe”). Trader’s dialogue slightly too eloquent for weather-beaten courier but idiom difference is maintained; no consensus voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with tidal rises and Mira’s exhaustion; paragraph lengths vary. Occasional scaffold: “She thought of the amber brooch in her pocket” tells what the next sentence shows. Metaphors are spare and mostly precise; no mixed vehicles. Clean copy—no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips. Meets read-aloud test, but one paraphrase loop prevents 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-war water-scarce island setting feels specific rather than recycled dystopia. Brooch that literally embodies contested symbols is fresh; insect-in-amber as mirror to trapped civilians lands without forcing. Risk taken in quiet, contemplative arc rather than action set-piece; resonance justifies choice. Could swap names but tactile detail—rain trails, salt-cracked hands—anchors it here.</comment>
