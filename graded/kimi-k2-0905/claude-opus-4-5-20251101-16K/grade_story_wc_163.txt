<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is specific—grief as geography, the feather as terrain—and her micro-choice to hold it to the firefly glow crystallizes endurance with cost. The caretaker’s single line of dialogue suffices for status shift, but his presence is too passive to act as crucible; the scene’s pressure is almost entirely internal, limiting relational torque. Still, the contradiction between seeking belonging and remaining a visitor is embodied throughout, not declared. The ending renunciation (she will return, changed) is earned by the luminous witness, not therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: tidal patterning of grief, light, and breath builds to Charged Poise. Orientation is swift—dusk descent, dome, rust—and the firefly arrival acts as the single pattern break that reweights the stake. Closure lands with undeniable cost: the feather’s ash becomes beautiful, foreclosing lifelong grief-geography. No causal plotting is required; the lyric accumulation satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The facility’s decaying bioluminescent corridors and the geothermal pocket are not postcard scenery—they funnel Vera to the antechamber and literally hatch the fireflies that charge the finale. The dome glass and black water outside mirror her internal pressure without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: crack → warmth → fireflies → shared breath. The burnt feather functions as micro-setting that constrains the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging versus exile—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the fireflies offer a “luminous respite” that she must choose to trust. The caretaker’s witness escalates the cost of remaining isolated. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she will surface changed, rhythm adopted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reframing of grief into wonder via witnessed light; no character states it. The feather’s ash-beautiful transformation reweights prior loss without moralizing. The firefly constellation offers a non-literal answer to belonging: presence, not destination. Ambiguity lingers—she still leaves, but now carries the rhythm—avoiding tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Vera’s perceptual filter: “stars spoke differently depending on where you stood beneath the earth.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, compresses at the crack discovery. No head-hop; caretaker’s interior remains opaque. Diction never exceeds Vera’s lexicon—no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and variegated: “honey through gauze,” “living punctuation.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is selective, never dense in the climactic beat. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Underwater star-mapping astrologer is fresh; fireflies bred by geothermal vent in a drowned dome is non-obvious synthesis. The burnt-feather-as-map resists trope checklist. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—yet coherence holds. Conceptual integrity remains intact: grief transformed by luminous witness, not solved.</comment>
