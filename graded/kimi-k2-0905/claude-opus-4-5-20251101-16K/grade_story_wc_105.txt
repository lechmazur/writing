<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulse—crafting a device that will reopen the wound she helped create—plays out in embodied beats (trembling fingers at the forge, pressing the receiver to her own ear). The final micro-choice, sending the aid, is earned by the prior causality of capturing her own unanswered apology. Cost is legible: she gift-wraps her guilt and forfeits control over Elena's response. Interiority stays concrete and idiosyncratic, never sliding into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren holds the device that now contains her plea for forgiveness; the cost—exposing her culpability without guarantee of reply—is undeniable. Causal chain holds: every absence she harvests tightens her obsession, leading to the self-imprint and the decision to mail it. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options until the final image reweights them. No orientation drift; greenhouse geography is anchored early and tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ashen forge recurs as micro-setting: it heats the copper, colours the coals aurora-green, and cools to gray while her hope congeals. Shipwreck planks, salt-tinged roots, and condensation-wept glass all constrain movement and supply acoustic "hollows" she harvests. Final image—the cooling forge under purple aurora—mirrors her spent urgency. Environment directly shapes tactics and charges the last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving the sound of trust breaking—tightens once she realises she must record her own apology; that revelation forecloses anonymity and risks permanent rejection. Escalation is singular but sufficient: from collecting external absences to imprinting her own unilateral plea. Cost is visible: she exposes herself to Elena’s silence anew. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—absence as palpable, portable weight—emerges through the device rather than assertion. Motif of "while cells divide" reframes rupture as ongoing biology, resisting tidy redemption. The ending offers no moral, only the crystallised risk of reopening silence. Subtext resides in gesture: quenching metal equals quenching hope, yet she mails it anyway.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s synesthetic ear; aurora "hums," purple "throbs," forging copper "sings." Syntax mirrors pressure—long, liquid sentences during search, clipped fragments at the discovery of her own recorded apology. No head-hop; lexical range stays within a craftswoman’s diction. Distinct perceptual signature carries through to the final, battering note of shipwrecks "marveling."</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but breathable; each sentence welds sensory image to emotional stakes ("water lapped against drowned branches with a rhythm like breathing"). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language clusters only at beats where pattern is taught (aurora=chroma-sound) and pays off at closure. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during imprint, then lengthens into the resigned final line.</comment>

<comment>The synesthetic grief-crafter who "collects absences" feels immediately specific; combining it with a half-sunk greenhouse-shipwreck orchard yields a world impossible to transplant elsewhere. Conceptual risk—negative-space audio as tactile material—commits fully and grounds every beat. No familiar trope is left untransformed; even the aurora becomes an audible map. Freshness arises from synthesis, not ornament.</comment>
