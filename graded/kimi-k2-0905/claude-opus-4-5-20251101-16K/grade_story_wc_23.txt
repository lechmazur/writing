<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-hardened resolve is embodied in every micro-choice—staying amid rusted gantries, soldering wires with blood-steady fingers, cradling the bronze foot until it warms. The contradiction between clinging to absence and guiding others home is dramatized, not stated, and her final, silent endurance lands as earned stasis with unmistakable cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the wordless settling of Elena beside Mira re-weights every prior map. Causality holds—each midnight call is a because/therefore step that narrows Mira’s isolation until only acceptance remains—and the persistent constraint of broken hydraulics shapes both tactic and image at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The station’s frozen dishes and starlit catwalks are filtered through Mira’s engineer eye; tools, rust flakes, and antenna shadows constrain where she can solder or stand. The bronze foot evolves from talisman to surrogate hand, charging the final silent touch with tactile memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a mother guide her own dead child home?—tightens when Elena’s voice emerges at the climax, converting abstract routes into irreversible personal cost. Agency remains Mira’s: she chooses to keep talking, foreclosing her own escape from grief’s orbit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reverse migration as theme emerges strictly through circuitry and star-maps; no sentence moralizes. The final image—warm bronze in palm, unseeable presence in chair—offers resonant reconfiguration of “home” as a frequency one can occupy rather than a place one leaves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s sensory register: static crackles “like fire,” bronze grows warm, silence becomes touch. Syntax compresses under pressure—“She should have left then, like the others, but”—without losing clarity; patterned elision in the final paragraph teaches the reader to feel presence in absence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short pulses to lyrical elongation without algorithmic feel; information is dense—“patchwork navigator, charting routes through territories that exist only in loss” does triple world/character/theme work. No mixed metaphors or filler loops; the single over-ornate phrase “terrible, tender light” is justified by radio-static subjectivity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “ghost-switchboard operator” trope is retooled through RF-engineer specificity and maternal stakes; moon-phase mechanics feel discovered, not imposed. Risk—quiet ending without visible specter—pays off because prior maps teach us to read warmth and silence as arrival.</comment>
