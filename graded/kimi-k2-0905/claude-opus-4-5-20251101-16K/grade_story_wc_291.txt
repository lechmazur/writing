<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—face-blind yet hyper-attuned to postural grief—grounds every beat; the methodical footfalls and ribbon handling are concrete micro-choices that foreshadow the portrait’s cost. The final renunciation (justice traded for empathy) is earned, but the mother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent and the trembling-hands cue is recycled thrice, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the finished portrait reweights Maya from file number to felt person, and Elena’s “empathy always hurts” crystallizes the cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each brushstroke adds density until the mist lifts and silence speaks. Orientation is anchored by word 86 (“Elena descended the switchback path”). No causal break; the ribbon’s persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Quarry shadows, mist, and granite buttresses are filtered through Elena’s negative-space gaze; the tightening light against rock face constrains where she places the easel. The ribbon’s weave and fray function as micro-setting handled twice with tactile specificity. Final sunbeam through dissipating mist recharges the portrait reveal—environment directly charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—awaken Claire’s numbed grief—tightens once: the portrait must pierce calcified loss. Each stroke accumulates pressure under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed. Cost is legible in Elena’s “empathy always hurts” and the lanced numbness she knowingly inflicts. Agency is steady; no escalation dip, though external opposition is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as moral obligation versus time’s anesthesia—emerges through negative-space portraiture and ribbon residue, never stated. Final image of the speaking portrait reframes prior material without moral. Subtext in Claire’s trembling hands and the quarry’s withheld silence deepens resonance. Minor echo of “calcified grief” phrase twice, but complexity remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elena’s sensorium; perceptual signature—counting stones she can’t see faces of—remains consistent. Rhythmic control: long mist-laden clauses contract to “empathy always hurts.” No head-hopping; dialogue absent, so voice contamination avoided. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and motivated by tactile investigation of ribbon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from adagio descriptive coils to the staccato final clause. Figurative language is spare and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “calcified grief” / “calcification” within 30 words deducts −0.2. Otherwise high density—each sentence advances character, setting, or theme. No scaffold, no brand lists, clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—face-blind cold-case portraitist—feels fresh and inherently tethered to stakes. Negative-space painting of the dead from ribbon fragment transforms familiar crime-trope into lyric ethical act. Risk-taking in quiet accumulative structure pays off in the final image. Could swap quarry for another liminal space, so micro-setting specificity is strong but not irreplicable.</comment>
