<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—“sinew thread hummed beneath her fingers”—but her contradictory impulses stay abstract; no micro-choice after 2:47 AM alters tactics or risks loss. The final “electricity” sensation is told, not embodied cost. Grandmother/mother memory loops repeat without compounding error or desire, so the Earned Stasis feels underpaid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the face dissolves back into potential, reweighting connection as “texture, not a fact.” Accumulative lens holds—pattern density peaks at 2:47 AM with gallery-wide activation—yet the cost is diffuse; no persistent constraint (lost thread, locked door, forfeited memory) is legible on the final line to make the price stick.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gallery rooms are sketched with economical bite—“infinity mirrors multiplied everything into meaninglessness”—and the sinew thread serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors (Escher staircase, loom that exists only when believed) remain coherent; environment guides choice by determining what can be woven. Weather and broader cityscape are rightly absent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates imagistically: impossible fractals grow, gallery illusions synchronize, face emerges. Yet the tightening is observational; Mira holds the thread steady rather than risking a choice that forecloses an option, so the cost feels observational rather than paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring tactile images of sinew and impossible geometry; the final reconfiguration—connection as woven texture—avails itself of Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers about whose memory is whose, inviting reflection on unreliable linkage. No late thesis statement intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—“memories alter, the origins of things become flexible, bendable, like light through a prism”—syntax mirrors her refractive mindset. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately at 2:47 AM. Occasional elevated diction (“rational enchantment”) is justified by her self-naming architect persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates well between long hypnotic sentences and abrupt image bursts. A few near-adjacent metaphors—“water rising through sand” vs. “unsettling calm”—co-exist without contradiction. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; information density stays high. Figurative language never obscures causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Weaving impossible architecture from bodily sinew in an after-hours illusion gallery is a fresh synthesis; the premise commits fully. The “realistically imaginary” trait is shown through loom that exists on belief, avoiding generic magic. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the synchronized illusion surge. Could edge higher if the personal cost were less abstract.</comment>
