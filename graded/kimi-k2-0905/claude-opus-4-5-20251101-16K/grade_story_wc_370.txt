<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt-riven empathy is concretely embodied in the crumpled invitation and the haptic memory of the platform death; the “stones-into-water” moment shows contradictory impulses in scene. Yet the renunciation at the end—letting the paper fall—feels slightly under-costed; we are told it is brave but the scene does not make her pay a visible price for reopening herself to the city’s flood. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak (“mistake like a tumor,” “human condition, magnified”) that softens the edge of her flaw. Still, the interior contradiction is sustained and the micro-choice to enter the library is credibly powered by seven years of accumulated ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the invitation dropped on the midnight threshold reweights “staying while leaving” from self-erasure to self-exposure. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiral shelf adds density until the final paradox crystallizes. Orientation is rock-solid within 60 words; no anchors drift. Cost is legible in the final image—the paper falls, the “city’s flood” re-enters her chest—but the price of future empathy overload is only implied, not dramatized, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The café-into-library impossible architecture is rendered through Maren’s body—thigh-smoothed paper, throat tightening—so the micro-setting (invitation, shelves, ambient chimes) acts as active constraint: she can retreat into the spiral only if she accepts the emotional cost. Velvet darkness and suspended droplets are sensory and selective, never touristic. The “impossible footprint” rule is taught early and paid off at closure when she crosses the same threshold to exit changed. Weather is absent but not missed; the body and clock tower supply spatial grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she reopen to empathy without destroying herself—tightens exactly once: the librarian’s axiom that “you felt his pain correctly, you could not feel his choice” narrows her options to acceptance or perpetual exile. No further escalation occurs; the library tour is expository rather than pressure-generating. The final beat is crystallizing stance, not higher cost. Agency is internal and credible, but the lack of a live test—no stranger’s grief assaults her on the spot—keeps the tightening modest.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: the mistake is reframed from moral failure to structural limit of empathy, a quiet but genuine conceptual repricing. The invitation’s journey from trash to dropped relic tracks the reweighting; no abstract thesis is declared. Subtext resides in gesture—smoothing then releasing the paper—rather than explanation. Final image avoids sentimentality yet leaves an emotional aftertaste: the city’s noise is about to rush back in.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual grammar: “city…pressing into her chest,” “paper soft as cloth.” Rhythm modulates—short clauses under platform memory, longer lyrical stretches inside the library—without head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext: librarian’s “You know exactly why” is an indirect probe that forces Maren to name her shame. Diction stays within a withdrawn empath’s lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“stones into still water,” “ghost inhabiting her own life”—and do not clutter high-pressure beats. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One mixed image: “accumulated loneliness…pressing into her chest” treats loneliness as simultaneous external force and internal sensation, but the slippage is brief and does not obscure causality. Final line lands with cadence that mirrors the clock’s chime, ear-tested aloud.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Secret-library trope is refreshed by the “deliberate ordinariness” camouflage and the paradox curriculum rather than macguffin chase. Empathy-as-liable-superpower is familiar, yet the reframing that compassion is not control feels non-obvious and earned. Risk is moderate—quiet lyrical ending, no shock twist—but coherence is high. The invitation object’s arc from trash to relic supplies a fresh inflection that grows from Maren’s specific guilt rather than genre template.</comment>
