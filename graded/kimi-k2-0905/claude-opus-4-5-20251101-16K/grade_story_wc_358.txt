<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s investigative drive is visceral—she climbs the stack herself, fingers the patch, logs every gust. The micro-choice to keep surveying after finding the patch crystallizes her refusal to let the system erase Webb. Cost is felt: exhaustion blurs her vision, yet she forecloses the easy “negligence” verdict. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: rearranged containers → undocumented wind funnel → Webb dies; Mira’s survey proves it. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the real culprit was the system” reweights every prior measurement. Cost is unmistakable—she walks away hazy, knowing the wind still waits. Orientation anchor (“port fell silent at midnight”) arrives by line 1, no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Corrugated canyons, invisible rivers of wind, corroded drainage seam—each detail is filtered through Mira’s metrological gaze. The ladder climb narrows setting to body-plus-tool: anemometer flutter mirrors her pulse. The patch wedged in the seam literally charges the final image. Container labyrinth constrains every move; remove it and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: prove the fall wasn’t negligence. Pressure tightens when she reaches the convergence point and feels the shove that killed Webb. The discovery of the patch deepens rather than reverses, forcing her to confront systemic culpability. Cost is legible—she ends depleted, haunted by persistent wind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: optimization systems externalize human cost into “statistical margins.” Image of the patch—aviation precision defeated by shipping chaos—reweights the premise without sermon. Final line (“someone would be watching”) offers bleak stewardship, not moral. Resonance sticks because particulars (wind data, patch, funnel) carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter: “she understood,” “her vision was hazy.” Syntax tightens under wind assault—short clauses mimic gust pulses. No head-hopping; technical diction (“anemometer,” “stacking protocols”) stays within her lexicon. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match exhaustion, proving rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lean procedural (“She photographed the patch…”) to lyrical (“patient as gravity”). No loops or scaffold; each line advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors (“invisible rivers,” “metabolism”) are sparse, purposeful, taught early. Only minor filter verb cluster (“she knew immediately”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Accident investigation via wind-mapping is fresh; patch-as-aviation-ghost personalizes systemic critique. Metal-box labyrinth generating lethal aerodynamics feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is taken: no villain, only physics and logistics. If you swap port for warehouse or wind for ice, the emotional arc fractures—proof of specific synthesis.</comment>
