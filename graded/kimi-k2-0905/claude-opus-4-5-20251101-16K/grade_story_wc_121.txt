<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for origin yet surrendering to fragmentation—surface in embodied beats (tilt, kneel, leap). The final renunciation costs her the cycle itself, earned through prior causality. Interiority remains concrete, though “labyrinth of self” flirts with label-speak once. Periodic eternity shows visible trade-off when she drops the tablet and dissolves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored returns, each shard adding density until the final upward leap reweights meaning with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors within 120 words; mosaic taught by second shard. Closure lands as Charged Poise—tablet dissolves, gravity claim released—cost legible in “falling upward.” Persistent constraint: every retracing erases memory, shaping tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Viaduct glow, rainwater puddles, and clay tablet converge as micro-setting that constrains footing and choice; final leap uses the rail as launch. Sensory selection tightens to visual phosphorescence and tactile dissolution, mirroring internal shift. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across three timeline shards. Environment’s amber/silver shifts cue temporal jumps without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find original self—tightens when tablet offers first-ever “path through herself,” foreclosing endless external retracing. Escalation via procedural generation keeps options fracturing, raising cost of surrender. Agency visible: she chooses leap that dissolves tablet and cycle. Price paid on-page: loss of immortality and gravity both.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated images of mirrors, drops, ripples—self as reflective surface finally shattered. Surrender reframed not as defeat but integration; resonance lands without moralizing. Final image reweights prior shards: each abandoned Mira now re-collected. Ambiguity persists—completeness undefined—yet emotional aftereffect concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature: tilted gravity, elastic seconds, procedural runes. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“Between the drop and the ripple”—then expands into final leap. No head-hopping; focalization anchored to present-tense Mira. Diction stays within archaic-tech lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances mirror motif or timeline texture. Sentence variety accelerates toward leap; no loops or paraphrase. Metaphors consistent—light, water, stone—without contradiction. Final clause “falling upward” crystallizes image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Procedural-generation time travel fused with self-acceptance arc feels non-obvious; risk of recursive meta handled via sensory grounding. Transformation test fails if names swapped—viaduct, tablet, and gravity tilt are specific. Quiet subversion of heroic conquest trope: victory = surrender. Fresh inflection: eternity ends by choosing essence over iteration.</comment>
