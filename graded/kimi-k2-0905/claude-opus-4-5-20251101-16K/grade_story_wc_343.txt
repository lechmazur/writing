<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is repeatedly asserted rather than embodied; the hopscotch moment is the only beat where curiosity alters tactics, and even that reads as author-engineered coincidence. Interiority is evocative but leans on abstract labels (“sociable isolation,” “exactly where she was meant to be”) instead of contradictory impulse. The final smile feels unearned because the story never dramatizes a visible cost or internal trade-off for her discovery; she simply follows chalk numbers and wins. Voice remains consistent, yet the character’s flaw/limits never complicate the outcome, so the arc is flat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the ship lifts and Elara feels affirmed, but the cost of using the mirror array or of trusting Venn’s puzzle is never made legible. The causal chain is clean—hopscotch → phrasebook → coordinates → mirror trick → escape—yet the hopscotch numbers appear only when the plot needs them, so the inciting turn feels planted rather than discovered. Orientation is swift and the single-scene default is met; lens is Causal throughout. The beat passes the 9+ cost test only weakly: the “amber prison” fades, but no constraint or price persists in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Meridian’s Rest functions as a tactile micro-setting: the dusty cargo deck, porthole view, and mirror array each enable a specific action that drives escape. Starling murmurations provide an ambient echo of the numeric pattern without overt symbolism. Light-as-fuel rule is taught early and used cleanly at climax. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no geography drift. While the moorlands remain a blur, the ship itself supplies enough constraining detail to satisfy the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—earn journeyman papers, find the Phosphorescent Shoals—but the only on-page risk is continued drifting, which never threatens Elara with anything worse than delay. The mirror-array solution reverses the problem without foreclosing any live option or demanding a trade-off; tension dissipates rather than tightens. Escalation is therefore cosmetic: pattern recognition substitutes for jeopardy. The lens-expected causal pressure is present but lightweight, capping the band below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity-as-companionship emerges implicitly through maps, phrasebook, and starlings; no authorial summarizing intrudes. The final “Here lies wonder” notation offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reframes isolation as chosen fellowship with absent voices. Ambiguity is preserved: we can’t be sure the shoals exist. The piece avoids moralizing, but the lack of dramatized cost keeps the resonance pleasant rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual quirks—numeric pattern hunger, synesthetic light hunger—producing a consistent lyric cadence. Syntax flexes with pressure (“drank deeply…coughed back to life”) without purple overload. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The diction remains within an apprentice cartographer’s plausible lexicon while achieving poetic lift; head-hopping never threatens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with natural rhythmic variation. Only minor loop: “diligently curious” is repeated three times without new inflection. Mixed-metaphor risk is avoided; light-as-fuel physics is kept internally coherent. No artifacts appear in the final third, preserving 9+ eligibility elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The hopscotch-to-pi-to-coordinates conceit feels fresh and specific to this world; it rescues the antique-airship trope from cliché. Starlings rewriting the same numbers in sky is a lovely, non-obvious echo. The shoals-as-twilight-maps idea is lightly sketched but promising. Risk is moderate—pattern-reliant discovery rather than character-cost—but the synthesis is memorable enough to reach the 8-band.</comment>
