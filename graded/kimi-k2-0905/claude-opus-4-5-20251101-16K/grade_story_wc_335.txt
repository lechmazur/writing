<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses—retreating while offering the sphere, sharp tenderness—are dramatized in scene; the boy’s first trembling annotation earns the reversal. Both voices stay distinct, embodied, and cost is felt when she admits she’ll “fight you every step.” Minor: the boy’s interior is thinner, but enough to pass.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: exile → tea reading → sphere offer → pen pick-up, each because/therefore. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—he writes, she remembers her daughter, reversible exile rule is re-priced. Orientation clean by line 5; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Library, coat-mirrors, and glass sphere are tactile, bias-filtered, and constrain choices: sphere must be handled to transmit hope; mirrors scatter possible futures across walls. Playground swing anchors hush-time and reprises in stillness at end. Micro-setting (sphere) literally charges the final image—tree shadow stirs—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can exile be reversed?”—is signaled early and tightened once: tea reading → sphere → pen forecloses surrender option. Cost visible: Vera risks reopening her own wound; boy risks first mark on blank page. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves. Sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of reversible loss emerges from sphere, annotations, and mirrored futures rather than statement. Final image—shadow moving inside glass—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Vera’s backward steps and sharp offer carries parental fear and hope. No thematic echo penalty; resonance earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Vera; perceptual signature—mirror fragments, equations on teapot, geometry of leaves—feels idiosyncratic and consistent. Syntax breathes with her nervous retreat, then steadies as boy writes. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinctive without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or scaffold. High density: “glass sphere containing what appeared to be an afternoon shadow caught in glass” does triple object/image/rule duty. One mixed metaphor (“rough-edged words”) but clarity intact. Clean mechanics, no artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile + mirror-fragment archivist + tea-leaf geometry synthesizes into fresh emotional physics. Sphere-of-shadow object feels inevitable, not quirky. Risky backwards-walking tic is patterned early and paid off. Concept and image could not swap into another tale without collapse. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>
