<comment>Ezra’s contradictory impulses—guilt by blood vs. hunger for credence—are dramatized in every micro-choice (lifting the lattice, walking the scuffed threshold). The interiority stays concrete: “the son of the liar…truths arrived stillborn.” His final renunciation (“I am not my father”) costs him the human world; the price is visible in the sealed labyrinth. Flaw: we never see him actively test believability on another living person—only on architecture—so the “disbelief” wound is asserted more than lived.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through mirrored repetitions of “accusation,” “confession,” “lattice shadow” until the hush crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise: Ezra steps into a world “where words are weighed,” cost legible in the erased future the mainland will invent for him. Orientation is taught early (“lighthouse prison rose…”) and paid off in the final sealing. Causality stays intact: each lattice-spoken confession reconfigures the maze, no off-stage shortcuts.</comment>

<comment>Setting is not backdrop but hydraulic tool: the scuffed threshold literally grooves invitation, copperlight warms then bronzes as options narrow. Salt-mirrors and salt-walls refract both light and paternal myth, constraining Ezra’s path. Micro-setting—the lattice—doubles as key and lantern, steering spatial logic. Only the reef exterior stays postcard; interior geography is painstakingly tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—audibility of truth—tightens when each lattice-confession narrows the corridor and forecloses the mainland world. The cost is the bodies above (social credit forever forfeited) and the vanishing return path. Escalation is textural: “accusation” echoes until the hush answers; no external antagonist needed. The irreversible step is the final threshold crossing; luck never intervenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—inheritance of disbelief vs. self-authorship—emerges through salt-mirrors that first distort then reflect only Ezra. No moralizing line states the thesis; instead the final image reweights “cry wolf” folklore into a private credence chamber. Subtext in the scuffed door: decades of silent pilgrims prove Ezra’s solitude is archetypal, not personal. The closing hush offers resonant ambiguity: freedom or exile—both undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person floats close to Ezra’s perceptual bias: he clocks grooves, copperlight shifts, lattice angles—never lighthouse history. Syntax compresses under pressure (“He stepped…labyrinth sealed”), then widens for the final contemplative cadence. No head-hop; aerial view serves closure without violating focal contract. Diction stays within rustic-coastal lexicon; occasional lyric elevation (“sustained impossibilities”) is pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with corridor length—short clauses for spiral descent, longer riffs for revelation. Metaphors stay salted: copperlight, salt-mirror, wolf-caller—no mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new spatial or emotional information. Opening and closing lines frame with sonic echo (“accusation at the sky” → “willing silence”). Filter verbs minimal; only one “he understood” survives peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Folklore inversion—son of the boy who cried wolf seeks not rescue but credence—feels inevitable yet unpublished before. Lighthouse-as-confessional-machine literalizes metaphor without steampunk clutter. The scuffed-threshold invitation weaponizes wear-pattern as plot key. Risk: sustained-impossibility rule is declared not demonstrated; we are told, not shown, lungs that keep breathing—minor conceptual bet that pays off in closure image.</comment>
