<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—diluting craft vs. yearning for precision—embodied in the ache “like a second heartbeat.” Micro-choices (pressing pen, turning shell, deciding to finish before logic reasserts) all tether want to action. The final renunciation—returning to the factory carrying the reclaimed music—pays the cost of re-entry into mass production. Only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so status/relationship crucible bullets are inactive. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the horizon beneath the feet reweights every prior spatial image and forecloses the fantasy of escape; cost is the silence she accepts by returning to the factory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of mirrored images (lake/sky, past/present, cookie/shell) tightens until the final note collapses the boundary. One transition (night → dawn) is cleanly anchored and taught by repetition of “mirror.” No orientation debt. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, and shell function as micro-setting: the mirrored horizon literally dissolves the boundary she must internalize. Shell ridges guide fingertips, ice reflects dawn into her eyes—environment constrains perception and thus choice. Selective sensory economy (ink, almond, sugar, light) keeps pressure high. Setting charges the final image; without the mirrored lake the “horizon beneath your feet” collapses. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost precision before exhaustion reasserts control—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens via the night-clock. One decisive deepening: dawn’s arrival forces the final fortune out of threshold space into permanence; the option to tinker further is foreclosed. Cost is legible: she must leave the spire and re-enter the factory unchanged outwardly, transformed inwardly. Accumulative escalation suffices; no causal reversals required under this lens. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the spiral: return is the only way forward. No explicit thesis; the mirrored horizon reprises the nautilus curvature, letting geometry argue the point. Subtext resides in silence’s opposite—a hum heard only after relinquishing perfectionism. Final image refuses moralizing; the horizon beneath the feet is an embodied paradox, not a lesson. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a hushed, lyric register that modulates under fatigue—short declaratives appear as dawn nears. Perceptual signature is precise: Mei Lin notices ridges, sugar smell, symmetry of light before generic skyline. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Patterned repetition of “mirror,” “spiral,” and “silence” is taught early and pays off in the final hum. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat—avoiding purple overload. High information density: “time moves like this shell—always forward, always returning” compresses theme and memory in one line. Only micro-loop: “silence pooled like water / frozen lake below held the night in its ancient stillness” adjacent aqueous images; does not touch closure. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune-cookie industrial writer as secular oracle, fused with nautilus cosmology. Risky lyric accumulation could have drifted into self-parody, but grounded in tactile cookie-making memory. Mirrored horizon concept reweights the familiar “you are already there” trope through literal ice-sky fusion. Transformation test fails—names could change—but specificity of Taipei kitchen and factory line resists full swap. </comment>
