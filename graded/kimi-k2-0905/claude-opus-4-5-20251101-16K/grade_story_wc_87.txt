<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clutching the compass while confessing she ‘follows utility poles’—are vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to text her daughter costs her the last safe distance she kept. Interiority stays concrete, but the ‘merrily melancholic laugh’ is asserted more than shown in scene, and the divorce papers / funeral flashpoints arrive as compressed labels, not felt beats. Still, the final stance crystallizes with visible forfeiture: she sits exposed on the dock, compass warm, option of retreat gone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sent text forecloses anonymity and reweights the compass from relic to possible re-instrument; cost is legible in the exposed wait on the dock. Causal chain holds—collapsed life → return → message → exposed vigil—without soft resets. One minor slack: the ‘utility-pole navigation’ conceit is announced late (after midpoint) yet asked to bear thematic weight; still, it doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Coastal launch is anchored by sensory triangulation—salt wind, bobbing kayaks, brass weight in palm—and governs choice: the same tide that once launched ships now forces her to sit publicly exposed while awaiting digital absolution. Brass compass functions as micro-setting, its scratched face mirroring internal state and constraining the final gesture. Utility poles remain visual wallpaper until late; earlier integration would have tightened the spatial metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she risk real connection—tightens once: the daughter’s text collapses safe ambiguity and forces the reply that might end in rejection. Pressure is coherent under situational lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible (message sent, shield dropped), though the beat would carry more torque if we felt immediate physiological jeopardy of waiting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—navigation as moral alignment—emerges through compass/utility-pole polarity rather than thesis statement; final image reweights ‘north’ from geographic to relational without moralizing. Subtext in the daughter’s “if she exists” cuts deeper than any exposition. One slight echo: the grandfather’s aphorism borders prompt-like articulation, but it’s earned by childhood memory and brass heft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through nautical lexicon—‘reading stars and currents like scripture.’ Syntax modulates—long reflective sentences in calms, clipped fragments when the phone buzzes. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet internal diction stays consistent and sea-worn.</comment>

<comment>Prose carries density—‘backlash of regrets hit her with the salt wind’ does double sensory duty. Rhythm breathes: paragraph breaks mirror tide-like intake and release. Minor scaffold: two successive ‘She wanted…’ anaphora lines feel templated rather than pressured. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final image is clean and unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ex-ship’s navigator reduced to following power-line silhouettes offers fresh inversion of epic-to-domestic scale; compass-as-conscience refreshes familiar redemption arc. Risk is moderate—quiet realist slice rather than formal experiment. Could push further if the utility-pole metaphor were physically enacted (e.g., counting poles toward daughter’s house) rather than declared.</comment>
