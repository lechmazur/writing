<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is textured—her empathy for meteors is embodied through the glass, and her solitude feels lived-in. Yet the “spiritually curious” label is asserted more than dramatized; no micro-choice shows curiosity altering her next beat. The final endurance is credible, but the turn from fear-of-fragility to chosen illumination is compressed into lyric summary rather than a visible on-page act. Still, contradictory impulses (flight vs. caretaking) coexist convincingly in the quiet sweep.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last paragraph crystallizes her refusal to be remembered and reweights the stake—illumination for its own sake. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the meteor shower’s density and the broom’s rhythm tighten until the glass glow charges the final image. Cost is felt: she forfeits external recognition and embraces perpetual disappearance. One minor loop: “ancient descent / ancient work” feels templated, not essential to causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Station Vela-9 is anchored early; the viewport, humming sensors, and creaking joints constrain her movement and pace. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting—its amber refraction literally filters how she sees the shower and thus shapes the closing image. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual, but the cold metal floor under her broom and the glass’s warmth against her chest keep touch alive. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—visibility versus erasure—is signaled by line 3. Pressure escalates texturally: each meteor’s burn intensifies the pattern of “brief brilliance then nothing,” tightening her empathic identification. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the glass to her chest—this act forecloses the option of ever leaving the station without cost. No causal antagonist is needed; the void itself is the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the necessity of giving oneself to the act of seeing even when unseen. The meteors’ sacrificial beauty and her maintenance ritual braid into a single question—what is light worth if no one witnesses it? No moralizing line declares the answer; the final glow in her pocket reweights the premise without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is her choice noble or self-erasing? The text refuses to adjudicate, letting the image resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter; diction (“cathedral no one prayed in,” “calligraphy written in fire”) is poetic yet consistent with her contemplative stance. Rhythm modulates: long clauses mirror the slow orbit, then shorten under the bright meteor. No head-hopping or register drift. The lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure, satisfying the elision rule.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but not purple; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. One paraphrase loop—“ancient descent / ancient work”—is minor and does not touch closure. Strong verbs (“bled light,” “scratched the darkness”) outweigh modifiers. Metaphors stay coherent: meteors as calligraphy, glass as small sun. No filter-verb clusters or scaffolding in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The “cosmic janitor” premise is fresh, and the empathic identification with meteors offers a non-obvious emotional angle. Stillness as flourishing inverts the usual space-isolation horror trope. While the abandoned station and lantern glass verge on familiar symbols, their combination and the refusal of rescue or rebellion keep the piece from cliché. Risk is moderate; a bolder structural gamble could have pushed higher.</comment>
