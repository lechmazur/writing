<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet, methodical nature is credibly entrenched; the blackout shocks her into a new perceptual register and every subsequent micro-choice—feeling page thickness, cross-referencing, resolving to “write herself”—is filtered through that indexer lens. Interior contradiction arrives in the same beat: stillness exhilarates and frightens her, giving the final endurance its earned cost. No stock phrasing; even “dappled resolve” is re-applied to her stance, not merely decorative. She never explains herself in therapy-speak; decisions carry visible risk (pumps silent, dome may fail) so renunciation feels proportionate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mira stamps a fresh page, committing to broadcast a truth that could kill her, cost made undeniable by the failing life-support. Causal chain is intact—blackout → bioluminescence → sensory shift → discovery of layered pages → new hypothesis → deliberate recording—each link narrowing her options. Orientation settled by word 60; no unexplained disorientation. Lens stays causal throughout; no late ambiguity; stillness even re-enters as the final beat’s constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Submerged library functions as both pressure cooker and archive; humming generators, desal pumps, and then their absence directly alter Mira’s hearing, sight, even paper texture she notices. Bioluminescent algae is not mere ambiance—it replaces failed lighting and enables the discovery, re-appearing in the last line as collaborator. Spatial choreography tight: dome overhead, layered pages within arm’s reach, stamp positioned to catch glow. Environment constrains the final choice—no rescue, no power—she writes anyway.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—announced early; blackout instantly removes the “ignore and live” option, tightening with every silent pump tick that doesn’t happen. Escalation is causal: silence → discovery mechanism → proof of genocide → irrevocable documentation; each step forecloses retreat. Price is on-page: “If she did not, she would leave her own trail”—explicit risk of drowning for indexing. One meaningful turn suffices and lands; no coincidences solve anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed history versus individual conscience emerges solely through action—indexing, cross-referencing, stamping—never stated. Final image of her pressing the seal onto new paper reconfigures the library from tomb to transmitter, re-weighting all prior cataloguing as rehearsal for this testimony. Ambiguity remains: we feel the city’s betrayal yet taste her possible doom. No moralizing line tells us “truth matters”; the stamped circle-in-triangle does the talking.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mira’s indexer perception: noticing thickness by micrometer, hearing absence of pumps as “mechanical breathing” gone. Rhythm lengthens during stillness, contracts when she cross-references, mirroring her pulse. No dialogue, so no divergence issue. Diction stays within a cataloguer’s lexicon; no forced poetic upgrade. Occasional adjective pairs (“blue-green,” “soft blue-green”) slightly echo but cadence remains varied and taught pattern holds.</comment>

<comment>Sentences carry double duty: description advances plot (glow allows seeing seal) and stakes (“ocean pressing down”). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful (“she realized” anchors shift, then exits). Paragraph cuts crisp; removing any paragraph would delete causality. Opening and closing lines mirror via “recording/indexing,” giving an ear-tested frame. One tiny scaffold: “she realized she had been living…” could compress, but it occupies low-pressure moment so clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Flooded-archive trope is refreshed by treating the blackout as sensory re-boot that literally changes what paper feels like, turning librarian into forensic investigator. Using an antique stamp both as clue and final act of authorship is elegant inversion of “marking” history. Stillness as actionable concept—not mood but method—adds non-obvious angle. Emotional specificity (seventeen years of tuned-out noise) prevents generic “hero discovers truth.” Risk succeeds without gimmick; bioluminescence feels inevitable, not decorative.</comment>
