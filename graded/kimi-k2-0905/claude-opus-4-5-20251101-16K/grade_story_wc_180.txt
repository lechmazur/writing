<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—pride in her craft versus the ache of estrangement—plays out in live micro-choices (dismissal, suspicion, the decision to teach). The final gesture of tying the faded ribbon around her wrist crystallizes the cost of continuity; granddaughter’s presence re-weights the “deciduous” flaw into a renewable vow. Both women’s speech cadences and body language are distinct; Sera’s swing-leg perch versus Mira’s trembling fingers encode status and generation without exposition. Emotional progression feels organic because pride is neither erased nor punished—merely reframed under new seasonal growth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: because the Guild betrayed Mira, she hides; because Sera arrives with the ribbon, recognition is forced; because Mira chooses to teach, the breach begins to heal. The single transition (present → memory → present) is legible and anchored within the continuous cathedral scene. Closure is a Decisive Change laced with cost: Mira commits to a path that re-exposes her stolen knowledge to the very bloodline the Guild could still target. Time, space, and relational vectors are clear by line 10; orientation waiver applies because later resonance justifies the brief delay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains every move: branches determine where workbenches can balance, the drop forces trust, fruit timing mirrors “deciduous” stakes. Specific sensory triangulation—silver wire, fractured quartz, baptismal font scent—roots attention inside Mira’s craft POV. Spatial choreography tracks bodies at height without impossible shifts; when Sera drops beside Mira the bench’s sway is implied, not narrated, keeping momentum. Final image of blossoms falling while new growth “begins” re-uses the living rafters to re-weight the stake: continuity now grows overhead, not underground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Mira will transmit or hoard her craft—tightens the moment the ribbon appears; refusal becomes untenable. One meaningful escalation: from dismissal (“You’re still doing it wrong”) to active instruction (“Again…trust the quartz”). Cost is visible on-page: by agreeing to teach, Mira re-enters the generational chain the Guild could exploit, foreclosing her eremitic safety. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly; no reversal is needed because the single shift carries irrevocable exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the living metaphor of deciduous cycles rather than any character naming “forgiveness.” Subtext operates in withheld eye-contact, the trembling hand that steadies only after the ribbon is tied, and the echo of a phrase never spoken aloud by its originator. The final line’s quiet instruction (“trust the quartz to tell you where it needs healing”) re-prices knowledge as relational, not proprietary—an answer felt, not sermonized. Complexity is preserved: Guild theft remains unjust, Calla’s pride is intact, Mira’s future risk is real.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual filter: green-filtered light, lens-weight in fingertips, surprise registered through breath-catch. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, shortens under imperative teaching moments, mirroring instructional rhythm. No head-hops; Sera’s interior is read strictly via gesture and Mira’s inference. Ribbon’s reappearance is rendered through the older woman’s sudden time-collapse, not exposition—voice stays credibly bound to her age and craft idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; scaffolding is minimal. Occasional adjective pairing (“endearingly feisty,” “accidental wisdom”) flirts with convenience but occurs outside high-pressure beats and is earned by character voice. No mixed metaphors; cathedral-orchard imagery stays internally consistent. Information density is high: one line often carries sight, emotional register, and back-history (“Their roots drinking from the baptismal font below”). Final paragraph’s imperative “Again” lands clean, propelling closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines guild politics, arboreal ruin, and optician craft in a synthesis that feels specific rather than checklist. The “deciduous vows” concept reverses usual fall-equals-death trope: here shedding enables regrowth, making the emotional insight fresh. Risk is taken by staging almost the entire piece at height on tree branches—yet spatial logic never breaks, turning setting into ethical precipice. Could not swap lens-craft for generic artistry without collapsing metaphoric scaffolding, indicating genuine transformation of familiar estrangement material.</comment>
