<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“tasted eerie nostalgia on her tongue”); micro-choice to lower the sax is credibly costly. Missing contradictory impulse in-scene keeps her just short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: refrains of mist, dew, silence tighten until the final charged poise where she “let one silence grow.” Cost is legible in the last line—“listened at last”—foreclosing the vested hush forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prism atrium, wet stone, sax keys, and fog function as micro-setting; the atrium’s scattered light literally colors her fingers and final stance, charging the closing image. Weather and light evolve causally with her escalating playing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep prophecy unspoken”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via expanding negative spaces. Final silence is a meaningful tightening that costs her the only defense she had. One visible price lands on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-weapon vs silence-as-truth emerges through motif shifts: fog absorbs, crystals scatter, sax interrupts. Final earned silence reweights the motif without moralizing. Resonance is oblique yet undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her perceptions; syntax lengthens under tension, then fractures (“She lowered… let one silence grow”). No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent, weather-filtered, music-timed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates with breath-length phrases; no loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“silences… like water seeking its level”) is sparse, taught, and paid off. High density without overcrowding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Negative-space prophecy delivered by grandmother’s hum feels specific and non-portable. Risky concept is fully committed to; acoustics-as-code grows inevitable yet surprising. No stock tropes; synthesis is fresh.</comment>
