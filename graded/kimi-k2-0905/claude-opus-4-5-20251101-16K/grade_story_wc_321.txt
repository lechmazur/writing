<comment>Marcus’s “resiliently positive” trait is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulse or visible cost; his interiority is generic (“felt something like hope”) and the final choice to “choose arrival” is unconflicted. The flickering woman functions only as expository prompt, applying no relational pressure. Earned stasis is asserted, not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the hourglass in pocket reweights the premise—but the因果链 is thin: Marcus intuits the pattern-fix without prior failure or constraint shaping tactics. The mid-story大块 exposition from the woman halts escalation and is never filtered through Marcus’s embodied choices. Orientation holds, yet lens drifts from situational wonder to declarative fable.</comment>

<comment>Crystalline grotto and sideways-time clocks are vivid, but the ferry itself—essential tool—loses tactile specificity once the shift occurs; we never feel Marcus handle helm or throttle under pressure. Starlight-sand hourglass finally charges the image, meeting the 9+ gate, yet the environment never actively constrains his tactics; it merely displays.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—merge timelines or stay split—is declared late and never tightens through trade-off or resource loss; Marcus faces no visible price for failure. The single “tightening” is expository: woman says “you could end this,” but nothing on-page raises cost if he refuses. Escalation remains informational, not experiential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of devotion to routine as rescue emerges implicitly via the ending image, avoiding moralizing. Yet the story repeats the word “pattern” like a prompt echo, and the final line’s warm hourglass slips toward sentimental convenience rather than earned conceptual repricing. Subtext stays thin; no gesture or silence carries ironic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is clean, stable third-person, with occasional sonic texture (“slipped between frequencies of light”). But diction defaults to literary generica—“spectral grotto,” “luminescence,” “small miracle”—flattening Marcus’s occupational idiom. No perceptual signature distinguishes his deckhand gaze from any sensitive observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is readable and largely loop-free; however, successive sentences open with stock abstract nouns (“The morning the ferry vanished… A spectral grotto opened…”) creating template cadence that dulls immediacy. Some metaphor strain (“patterns connected like neurons, like shipping lanes”) layers vehicles without deepening sense. No artifacts mar the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The vanishing-ferry conceit is familiar, but grounding salvation in memorized commuter minutiae offers fresh emotional specificity. Sideways-time clocks and starlight-sand hourglass feel derivative of sf lyric mode, yet the synthesis with mundane transit devotion is memorable. Risk is moderate; execution keeps concept coherent.</comment>
