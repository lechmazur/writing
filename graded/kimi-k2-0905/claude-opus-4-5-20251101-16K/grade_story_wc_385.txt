<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning to keep her grandmother’s echo yet despising the Keepers’ commodification—drives her single micro-choice: sing rather than surrender. The broken shell as tactile link to grandmother gives credible emotional anchor; the refusal is embodied, not label-speak. No secondary character exerts live pressure; Keeper functions as thematic expositor rather than crucible, so status dynamics remain theoretical. Closure cost is felt—“I’ll be listening”—but the choice is more stance crystallization than irreversible sacrifice, keeping it solid, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: incremental density of voices and star-hum culminates in Charged Poise—Mira’s song that reweights the rule-set (“the dead chose Mira”). Orientation clean by line 3; nexus geography stays coherent. One meaningful tightening at Keeper’s admission escalates stakes. Closure beat—grandmother’s final whisper—pays off seashell cue with conceptual cost: echoing is now Mira’s future burden, foreclosing innocence. Causality intact; no teleport props; keeper’s late exposition is allowed under accumulative reveal pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus, seven canyon mouths, and starlight ceiling function as active amplifier; setting literally shapes the acoustic climax. Shell-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice—only its fracture permits the communal resonance. Sensory selection stays biased to Mira’s echo-singer ear; wind-drone and sub-harmonics mirror interior tension. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Environment supplies both tool and stakes, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some echo—signaled paragraph 1; pressure tightens when Keeper admits echoes are chosen fragments, forcing Mira’s stance. One visible cost: surrendering anonymity—singing exposes her to Keeper market and to the chorus itself. Agency is renunciation/affirmation rather than physical battle; sufficient for short form. No second reversal, but cadence shift from hunted to chosen feels earned under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—echo as chosen persistence versus theft—emerges through shell fracture and starlit chorus, never sermonized. Subtext in Keeper’s scarred throat shows price of forced harvesting. Final reprise of grandmother’s whisper reweights earlier lullaby fragments with adult responsibility. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers: future echoes may still be commodified elsewhere. Resonance is emotional, not asserted, meeting 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush, compressed lyric diction—“serpentine nexus,” “subharmonics of ancient griefs”—matches Mira’s richly perceptive ear. Rhythm modulates: long vowels for cosmic hum, abrupt monosyllables at threat. No head-hop; interiority stays strictly bound. Filter verbs scarce; metaphors consistent with acoustic physics. Minor reed simile for Keeper’s laugh is apt, not ornamental. Voice specificity high enough to edge into 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft excels: no scaffold, no synonym loops, varied sentence cadence that breathes with sonic imagery. Information density high—“ceiling of infinite stars” layers spatial and metaphysical scale in five words. Figurative language is patterned early (echo, resonance) and pays off, avoiding purple excess. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive. One participial opener (“ murmuring fragments”) isSequential, not simultaneous; acceptable. Near-flawless at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy of commodified afterlife voices feels fresh; canyon acoustics as network node is specific world logic, not generic haunt. Trope of死者回声 is retooled through eco-acoustics and market critique. Shell fragment as map and voice capsule is elegant double use. Risk taken with accumulative, almost lyric structure pays off in choral climax. Could verge 9.0 but premise DNA still recognizably “harvested ghosts”; transformation strong, not absolute.</comment>
