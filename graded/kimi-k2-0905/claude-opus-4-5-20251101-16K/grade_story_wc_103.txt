<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“time’s texture… rough as burlap in grief”), but the causality tying her decision to stay to her prior flaws is asserted rather than dramatized; the final renunciation feels slightly abstract because the maze’s cost to her personally remains conceptual, not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “she would solve her own unsolvable maze” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fading photographs and root-response builds density until the final crystallization. Orientation is clean by ~100 words; transitions are legible within the single-scene shard. Causality is lightly abstract but coherent under the lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The living bridges are tactile and agentive—“root-woven pathways spanning… like fingers of sleeping giants”—and the hyperbolic saddle-hedges constrain Elara’s spatial choices. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting that alters her temporal footing, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight; no white-room syndrome. Spatial choreography holds across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map time’s texture—signals early and tightens when photographs force retrocognitive reliving. The meaningful deepening occurs at the photograph touch: options narrow to “leave or become the maze.” Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening the peak; still, the stake is irrevocably foreclosed by her final stride into hyperbolic paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as weave, not line. The closing image of “worse eternities than understanding” offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in the photographs’ silent erosion. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader left to decide whether transcendence or trap—creating lingering charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: syntax lengthens under reverie, fragments under temporal slips (“rough as burlap… porous and crumbling”). Perceptual signature is architect-botanist—angles, root-tension, growth planes. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs are minimal and earned; diction stays within Elara’s lexicon of design and geometry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly propulsive; sentences multitask (“The living bridges responded to intention…”). One paraphrase loop early—“she had wanted this. God help her, she had wanted”—reads intentional as compulsive admission; no scaffold clogs closure. Metaphors are internally consistent (giants/fingers/butterflies). Rhythm modulates with temporal seizures: shorter clauses mimic disintegration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: horticultural hyperbolic architecture + retrocognitive erosion collapses gardener and garden into spacetime fabric. Risk in using higher math pays off because emotional stakes stay human. Not merely “maze that eats time” but maze that grows from designer’s sketches—inevitable yet surprising. Specific detail (halo shard as Byzantine astrolabe fragment) anchors originality.</comment>
