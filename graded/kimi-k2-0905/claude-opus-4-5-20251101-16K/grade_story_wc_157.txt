<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivations are legible—protecting unlicensed thought—and her micro-choice to plant gourd seeds crystallizes the rebellion, but her interiority lapses into slogan (“own our inner lives”) rather than embodied contradiction; still, the final seed hand-off shows visible cost and earned resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the club pivots from clandestine talk to mass planting, a decisive shift under causal lens; the gourd-rattle plan is foreshadowed and paid off, cost felt in Dr. Vasquez’s closed fist; orientation is anchored by word 80, no ambiguity; one tightening suffices for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse humidity and pinned butterflies filter through Mira’s sensorium, guiding her sense of sanctuary; the geometric seed pattern later constrains scanner evasion, meeting the 9+ gate; proper-noun economy holds; spatial choreography clear as members arrive and exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—evading neural taxation—tightens when Phase Three emotional scanning is announced mid-scene, forcing the seed-planting gambit; escalation is causal and one-step, adequate for length; cost is visible in collective fear and final seed relinquishment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of ungovernable interior life emerges through vegetal language and seed rebellion rather than assertion; final image of seeds as “promises” reweights earlier garden codes with conceptual cost; avoids moralizing; slight slogan drift mid-story keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira; perceptual signature vivid (“humid air pressed like a confession”); cadence lifts under pressure; dialogue sparse but distinct; no head-hop; occasional elevated phrase (“converging chaos was palpable”) slightly overwrites yet remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong vivid verbs and sensory nouns; rhythm breathes with beats; no scaffold loops; one mixed metaphor stack (“confession waiting to escape” + “converging chaos pressed”) slightly muddies peak tension; grammar clean; final line sings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Taxable-thought dystopia is familiar, but grafting clandestine botanic cryptography via gourd-rattle acoustics feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in horticultural code language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation test passes—story collapses without seed-geometry gimmick.</comment>
