<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—title "hollow" yet mechanically relearning—tracks cleanly through micro-choices (winding key, tracing runes). Father rescue arc is felt, but the decisive beat ("I closed the loop") is a touch tidy; visible cost (exhaustion, risk of being trapped herself) is implied, not enacted on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each sealed awakening tightens options, knowledge, and final access to the noon-shadow pocket. Closure lands with clear Decisive Change + Charged Poise: the isle sails a "healed night," father freed, Mira’s knowledge no longer "scattered." Cost is legible in his "infinitely tired" body and her seventeen nights of work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Observatory iron stairs, bronze automaton, star charts supply tactile anchors that constrain choice (keyhole placement, equation in automaton’s lap). Floating-isle darkness functions as micro-setting; final light-inward image recharges earlier star chaos. One slip: "river of light mending" is pretty but physically vague, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve father—signals early; each loop sealed removes one escape route until only the lethal seventeenth remains. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: restored constellations quantify tightening. Agency stays with Mira; price is time, stamina, and cumulative risk. Emotional cost visible in father’s exhaustion; still, on-page jeopardy to Mira herself stays abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of knowledge earned through embodied reconstruction (vs. prior rote memory) emerges via runic relearning, not authorial lecture. Final healed sky offers resonant reconfiguration of "before/after" without moral. Spoon-bending nod remains ornamental—never ties to personal stakes—creating minor thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholarly-archaic ("runes carved," "clockwork automaton key") that fits rune-scholar POV. Rhythm modulates well with tension; "Light exploded inward, a perfect point of noon compressed" is supple under pressure. Dialogue brief but voice-true; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional romantic uplift ("stars wheeled in patterns," "river of light") flirts with over-figuration yet stays controlled. Strong subject-verb propulsion; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One micro-redundancy: "She was... then she supposed she still was now" could compress, but it does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Post-reality-bending astronomy, sealed awakenings, and noon-shadow pocket feel fresh yet internally coherent. Risk is moderate—high-concept fantasy squeezed into flash—but execution lands. Spoon-bending reference hedges toward meme; since it’s unexplained, fresh factor dips. Still, synthesized runic astrophysics carries voice-specific detail.</comment>
