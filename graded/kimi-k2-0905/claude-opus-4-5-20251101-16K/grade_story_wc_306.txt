<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction is strong—Maren’s “sincerely insincere” mask collides with Isla’s demand for truth, producing visible hesitation and the micro-choice to strip the chimes. Embodied emotion is present but leans on familiar gestures (eyes glisten, voice steady) rather than idiosyncratic physiology. The renunciation of certainty is earned, yet the mirror shard—charged with maternal history—never physically influences the final decision; its symbolic weight stays abstract, muting cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren forecloses her lucrative performative wisdom and chooses shared doubt, a reconfiguration legible in the silent armful of chimes. Causality is clean—Isla’s refusal to be soothed triggers Maren’s dismantling of her own theater. The mirror shard and mother flashback are smoothly cued by tactile contact and tilt the present stance. One scaffold loop (“certainty was… certainty was”) is minor; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse, chimes, and pre-dawn beach are selectively sketched; wind direction and stair geometry guide movement without tourist excess. The hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting, constraining attention each time it presses the thigh. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Maren catalogs pitch intervals, not seabirds. Final image of mute chimes in arms crystallizes the reconfiguration, meeting the 9+ gate for object-charged closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—maintain profitable certainty vs. risk vulnerability—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Isla rejects the script. One meaningful turn: Maren dismantles her method, foreclosing income and identity in a single escalatory beat. Cost is visible—armful of silenced chimes, client waiting unpaid. No reversal for Isla’s dilemma, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence shift of random wind song suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the progressive hollowing of “mercy” into shared doubt; no authorial thesis is declared. Subtext resides in gesture—unhooking chimes speaks louder than any verdict. Final image reweights the premise: conscience as accompaniment, not command. One soft line (“welcoming nuance into certainty”) approaches thematic echo but is saved by its placement mid-resolution, not tail-summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Maren’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is audible—wind chines, footfalls, mirror’s cold edge. Syntax modulates: longer sentences for performative self-deception, fragmentary cuts during the mirror memory. No dialogue beyond two brief exchanges, yet diction remains distinct: Maren’s internal lexicon of “velvet certainty” vs. Isla’s plain demand for truth. One register wobble: “conceptual repricing” feel too academic for Maren’s idiom, but it sits outside her voiced thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent of lighthouse stairs; no template cadence. Figurative language is spare—only two metaphors (“cloak of doubt,” “sleeping children”) and both serve beats. Information density is high: one sentence often fuses action, backstory cue, and thematic echo. Minor paraphrase loop on “certainty” appears early but does not recur in the closure third, preserving 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—“conscience for hire” monetizing moral theater—offers fresh angle on familiar ethical consultant trope; wind-chime charisma device is specific and memorable. Risk is taken by refusing to deliver Isla’s answer, yet the story commits fully to that refusal, earning Charged Poise. Mirror shard reprise is inevitable in hindsight yet not over-signposted. Slight deduction for near-template mentor–seeker beach walk; specificity of chime ritual offsets.</comment>
