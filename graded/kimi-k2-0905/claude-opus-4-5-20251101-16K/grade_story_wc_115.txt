<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and specific—her “drowsy alertness,” the way she photographs the beads “of nothing and everything,” the micro-choice to touch the valve wheel that echoes her mother’s guilt. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. compulsion to listen, recklessness vs. archival care) play out in scene. The final renunciation—leaving the beads but breaking silence—carries inherited cost that feels earned. Only minor slip: the mother’s stroke is told, not embodied, blunting the stakes-transfer by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to carry the story out reweights the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of swallowed truths now spoken. Causality holds: because Mira touches the beaded valve, because the radio keeps feeding pattern, therefore she crystallizes stance. Orientation is clean by line 6; transitions (tunnel → valve room → return) are legible within 800 words. Cost is visible in the final image—“the silence—that she would break.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tunnel atmosphere is filtered through POV bias—rust taste, corroded rails, “suggestions of their former purpose.” Micro-setting (beaded valve) becomes the charged object that mirrors internal state. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound of water, flashlight cone) guides choice and tightens space. Environment constrains the final image: she must walk the same rails out, now carrying weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve/deliver the swallowed truth—tightens once when the beaded valve materializes and again when Mira decides to speak. No reversals, but a single meaningful deepening: touching the beads converts archival distance into filial complicity. Cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of skepticism, accepting the inherited guilt. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern rather than statement: swallowed guilt eventually demands utterance. Beads-as-rosary refract from memorial to confession-engine without authorial nudge. Final image offers non-literal answer—silence broken by footsteps carrying story—avoiding moral. Subtle irony: the skeptic uses radio charlatans as valid data. Only minus: late line “truths had weight” borders on Echo, but is saved by concrete context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: industrial ribs, “throat of darkness,” “archive of static.” Syntax mirrors drowsy alertness—long em-dash chains, then clipped beats (“Then silence. Then the stroke.”). No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Free-indirect stays clean; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with pressure, climaxing in the click of beads that “echoed too long.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences multitask: “Her headlamp carved a yellow cone through the murk” seeds both tool and mood. No scaffold or synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (tunnel as throat, beads as rosary). One mixed image—“drowsy alertness”—is intentionally paradoxical, not sloppy. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful. Strong paragraph cut test; every graf advances knowledge or charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ghost-shift premise is fresh angle on industrial-trauma tale; beaded valve transforms standard memorial into machine-prayer. Risk-taking appears in lyric-accumulative structure rather than plot twist, and pays off in final reconfiguration. Details feel irreproducible: AM 740 as archive, “archive of static,” mother’s stroke as silencer. Only nearby echo is “ghost shift” itself, but story owns it through specificity.</comment>
