<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kira’s interior contradiction—mechanic vs. temporal seeker—is vivid in the opening beats and embodied in the lever pull. The older-self encounter dramatizes her flaw-driven need, but the emotional cost is declared (“nothing was ever truly past”) rather than shown through altered action, so the renunciation feels slightly under-cooked.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lever click crystallizes her new stance toward time with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each twilight-timed silence tightens the pattern—yet the orientation anchor (station location) arrives after 120 words, triggering the −0.3 orientation penalty; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The maintenance bay’s mechanically warm wall is returned to as tactile anchor and final image, charging the closure; Whisper-Moth silence functions as live clock. Selective sensory filtering through Kira’s mechanic gaze keeps description purposeful, though the wider station geography remains sketchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time—signals early and tightens through each twilight window; lever pull is the single decisive escalation that forecloses her former linear life. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, visible in the final “adjacent” realization; meets 8.0+ bar but lacks a tangible price that alters later tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through Kira’s embodied experiment rather than exposition; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Recurring warmth and silence motifs accumulate meaning, though the older-Kira dialogue edges toward explicit thesis, trimming subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>POV distance stays tight and mechanic-voiced: “patching hull breaches,” “salvaged navigation equipment.” Rhythm modulates from technical precision to lyric swell under pressure; no head-hop. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction in final paragraph—barely grazes the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphor risk in “purple bleeding into gold” is saved by prior color-logic of moth bioluminescence. Final clause stack (“touchable, real”) borders overwrite but compresses into the cadence; no artifact touches closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Temporal adjacency as quiet epiphany feels fresh against familiar time-travel tropes; the station-between-moons and Whisper-Moth clock are specific rather than cosmetic. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric stillness over plot reversals—but the synthesis is internally inevitable, not borrowed.</comment>
