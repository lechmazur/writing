<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s psychometric gift and lifelong hunger for “where explanations fail” ground her swim toward the light; the compass reading gives concrete interior cost and propels the final renunciation. Embodied emotion is strong (“warm as blood, dark as dreamless sleep”). Yet the beat-to-beat micro-choices inside the lagoon are summarized, not dramatized, so the closing decision feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: she leaves the compass, undresses, and swims—an irreversible act that reconfigures her world from knowledge to wonder, cost paid in her abandoned instruments. Causal chain holds: factory silence → descent → psychometry → surrender. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the hush thickens until the final image crystallizes meaning. One minor slack: the “lost expedition” backstory is front-loaded in a single expository block, not earned in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blackberry fissure, mirror-black water, and the spinning brass compass are tactile, selective, and filter through Mira’s sensibility; micro-setting (compass) literally charges the last image. Spatial choreography is flawless; lantern fracture and mineral walls track cleanly. The lagoon’s description could tighten one clause to avoid echoing “black” twice, but this is hairline.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake—cross the threshold where measurement fails—is signaled early and tightens once via the compass vision that forecloses retreat. Agency is present but interior; no external obstacle escalates after the descent, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Still, the final swim is an irreversible trade-off, visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of surrender to wordless wonder emerges through petrichor, needle-less compass, and the final dark light; no moral is asserted. The reweighting is elegant: maps become ash, instruments pointless. A hairline risk of abstraction lingers because the lagoon’s “light” is not sensuously particularized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Mira’s perceptions; diction (“petrichor,” “bramble,” “ash”) reflects her erudite yet earthy lens. Rhythm modulates from long Latinate cadences above ground to clipped, breath-short phrases during submersion. No head-hop or register drift; psychometry vision is cleanly italicized through sensory cues rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image + interior move—and open with varied syntactic shapes; no loops or filler. One clause-level echo (“black and mirror-still… black water”) is easily trimmed. Figurative language is disciplined: “frozen prayers” is the single reach, yet it fits the cathedral metaphor already established.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses psychometric noir with ecological fairy-tale; turning a factory’s silence into the inciting portal feels fresh. The compass-as-anti-guide reversal recharges a stock explorer artifact. While “vanishing into earth-light” nods to familiar myth, the integration with petrichor commerce and measurement critique particularizes it.</comment>
