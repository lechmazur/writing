<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Veris’s want-to-belong is vivid and embodied; the shift from outsider to “vital limb” is earned through the shared search and the final gift. Interior contradiction is light—her grief is shown but never collides with her drive—keeping her just shy of 9-band complexity. Kael functions more as catalyst than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. The final gesture costs her the last of her marsh skill, a visible forfeit that locks the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sculpture refracts moonlight over the gathered faces, reweighting “search” into “found-together” with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds—each tag found and story shared layers density until the gift crystallizes the pattern. One clean time-step from marsh past to orchard present; orientation is swift and spatial logic never wavers. The final image carries the accumulated ache without need of explanatory coda.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are tactile, light-reactive, and used: shards become the sculpture, arbor becomes the display frame. Crater lip location constrains movement—ropes, breath, moonlight all behave differently at altitude. Selection favors refraction and fragility, mirroring internal stakes without overt symbolism. No filler geography; every named place is walked, touched, or risked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—tightens once: from polite distance to shared hand-holding under the new sculpture. The search for the tag supplies coherent pressure; each expedition exacts trust/coordination costs (rope burns, time, memory). No artificial reversals; escalation is accretive, not causal, fitting the chosen lens. Cost is felt in the final unveiling: she spends the last reed-weaving skill she can never replace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of belonging-as-continuous-act emerges through the seeking ritual, never declared. Subtext lives in glances, rope-passing, and the slow rotation of crystal shadows. Final image answers the opening hunger without moralizing—the ache stays luminous. Ambiguity survives: the Cartographer remains unknown, ensuring theme outruns explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers just behind Veris’s sensory filter—callused hands, marsh-mint recall, reed-weaving muscle memory—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, fragments under torchlight climbs; rhythm tracks breath. No head-hops; even Kael’s grief is filtered through Veris’s sympathetic noticing. Line-level diction stays within her craft lexicon—no synthetic poetic overlay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or paraphrase; each sentence advances image, stake, or relationship. Figurative language is spare and tied to light/refraction physics—“latticed bones,” “prismatic shadows”—never stacked. Strong verbs carry motion: “graft,” “fractured,” “etched,” “wove.” Final paragraph breathes out with sentence variety that matches the slow sculpture turn, giving cadence closure without syntactic drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard grown from mineral alchemy feels fresh, yet grounded in tactile craft. The “map that is the seeking” flips usual quest logic without gimmickry. Marsh-reed techniques ported to crystal provide specific expertise crossover that generic survival skills couldn’t. Risk is moderate—lyric accretive structure could have collapsed into vagueness, but line-level precision keeps it coherent.</comment>
