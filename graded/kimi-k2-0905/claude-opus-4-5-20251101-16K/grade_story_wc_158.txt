<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia-as-vocation is vivid and embodied; the contradiction “cannot surrender because grief would drown her” gives credible psychological glue. Yet her arc is largely observational—she writes, sings, waits—so the promised “meaningful change” is more conceptual than dramatized. The final renunciation (“I came home after all”) lands as graceful CR, but the on-page cost is diffuse because the choice is acceptance rather than a visible forfeiture. Interiority stays specific and avoids therapy-speak, keeping the character alive inside lyric mode.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of centuries-long song accretion, cadence shift from solitary vigil to “she had become the dream.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—postcard+poem pinned together reweight the premise; conceptual cost is legible (“nearly translucent with age”). Orientation anchors arrive early (shell, seafloor, night), no disorientation penalty. One minor causality wobble: the global armistice is attributed to her lullabies but occurs off-page; because the lens is accumulative, this is acceptable, yet it slightly dilutes decisive agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shell-as-cathedral is more than backdrop—the spiral acoustics literally bend her voice into the world, a setting detail that constrains transmission method and enables the armistice. Sensory selection privileges echo, bioluminescent gardens, translucent nacre—economy of three sense anchors that reflect internal vigil. Spatial choreography stays coherent: desk, postcard, singing point are fixed inside an unchanging chamber, so no drift. Micro-setting (postcard) functions as recurring object that recharges final image; qualifies for 9+ gate but capped at 8.4 because exterior world geography is impressionistic rather than tactically specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: transform personal insomnia into collective peace. Escalation is accretive—each stanza-night adds one more listener—so pressure deepens rather than reverses. Visible price is her eternal waking, stated repeatedly and crystallized in the closing poem; cost is felt but not dramatized as tactical loss. Because the armistice happens off-page, the tightening is conceptual; sufficient under Accumulative lens yet keeps tension intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief metabolized into communal medicine. Subtext carries in the postcard’s faded ink—an invitation never answered becomes a template for collective surrender. No final-paragraph moralizing; last line offers Charged Poise that reweights “home” from galactic return to species reckoning. Avoids sentimentality by keeping images concrete (coral polyp = one person choosing not to harm).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric narratorial voice maintains consistent distance, perceptual signature filtered through marine cathedral imagery—“spirals,” “nacre,” “bioluminescent”—creating a textured diction that matches POV knowledge. Syntax modulates: longer clauses for centuries-spanning breath, fragment-like lullaby quotes for off-key wind. No head-hopping; single focalization is clean. One minor over-telling: “This was her gift: to photosynthesize pain into beauty” states the metaphor the prose already enacts; a hairline slip but does not collapse voice authority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is high: metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (cathedral, nacre, coral, garden) and support the biologic/transmutation motif. Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths swell and contract like tides. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Information density strong (“insomnia metabolized into stanzas, loss into lyrics, waiting into something that resembles, in certain light, hope”). Minor scaffold: “century after century” used twice in close proximity; a 0.1-level blemish that does not obscure closure.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-climate-apocalypse with lone poet inside seashell feels fresh; not a trope assembly seen elsewhere. Conceptual turn—“she had become the dream”—reverses expected sleeper/dreamer relation. Specificity of medium (off-key wind carrying lullabies through shell acoustics) is idiosyncratic yet plausible within lyric logic. Risk in centuries-long timespan paid off by accumulative pattern rather than causal bullet points; originality lies in scale compression rather than twist.</comment>
