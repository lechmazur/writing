<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her “swallowed dreams” and “pressed flowers” are concrete, embodied metaphors that reveal contradictory impulses (duty vs. self) under pressure. The star-punch micro-choice dramatizes her yes and forecloses the old life with visible cost. Guides remain symbolic ciphers; no status shifts or secondary pressure from them, so relationship crucible is inert. Still, the arc from dissolved salt to uncovered courage is earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist-curtain fragments and looping shoreline cadence tighten the dominant stake (unused courage) until the star-punch and final headland image crystallize a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean by word 60; no teleporting props; indirect-route rule is taught early and obeyed. Closure cost is unmistakable—“the star still marked her skin, fading now but not gone”—foreclosing the caretaker identity. One paraphrase loop (“the path curved…then climbed…then curved again”) slightly dulls momentum mid-arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway functions as micro-setting: fog thickness controls how far Elena can see, therefore how fast she can move toward courage—environment literally constrains pacing. Sensory triangulation (salt wind, damp stone, brass warmth) is selective and biased through her caretaker-habituated attention. Spatial choreography is flawless; cliffs, hollow, spring, headland track without drift. Final star-mark on skin recharges the opening “salt in water” image, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claim the courage she never touched—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through patterned detours: each detour deletes an alibi (voice, grief, silence). No external antagonist; pressure is situational and coherent under mist-limit visibility. Guides supply constraint but do not reverse; the tightening is the lengthening itself, forcing embodied payment (scream, laugh, marked palm). Cost is legible, yet the middle loop of “path curved…climbed…curved” diffuses urgency a notch before the final headland.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the salt-to-star corrosion arc: courage is not acquired but uncovered by walking the longer way—no manifesto required. Subtext lives in gesture: ticket punch pressed “not hard enough to hurt, but firm enough” implies maternal boundary she finally permits. Final image of fading star rebuts early “dissolved like salt” without verbal commentary. One soft echo of prompt language (“unused courage waits”) is tolerable; otherwise avoids thesis-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s perceptual signature—gray sea equals possibility, fog equals filtered future. Syntax lengthens and contracts with terrain, mirroring indirect route rule. Guide dialogue is oracular yet rhythmic, distinct from Elena’s caretaker-plain interior. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean; filter verbs used only when mist literally filters.</comment>

<comment>High information density: “The art school applications never submitted. The friendships left to wither” compresses twenty years in two lines. Rhythm breathes—long clauses for ascent, fragments for punch. One scaffold loop of “path curved…then climbed…then curved again” repeats without fresh pressure; minor. No mixed metaphors, no register drift; star-punch tactile detail lands clean at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “ferry guides on a twilight vigil for unused courage” remixes Charon/psychopomp tropes into a secular, matriarchal frame—fresh enough. Indirect-route mechanic literalizes the self-help bromide but saves itself by sensory grounding and the star-punch specificity. Conceptual risk is moderate; execution keeps it from gimmickry. Could swap coastlines, but the caretaker-to-self arc is particular and would collapse without the mist-path metaphor.</comment>
