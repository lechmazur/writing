<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—grief-hollowed agnostic returning to dig ancestral bones—grounds every beat; the moment she traces a root-veiled skull and whispers half-remembered prayers, embodied emotion and micro-choice collide. The arc from numb exile to “cautious enchantment” is credibly earned, the grave-side stone placement paying the visible cost. Only the grandmother’s language revival feels slightly convenient, not dramatized in-scene, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each chamber, root, and seed adds density until the sundial re-weights continuity itself. The closing image—stone on traveler’s grave, pomegranates fed by bones—delivers Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: faith re-priced as seasonal return, not dogma. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words; causality of return-to-die circle holds without slippage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but hydraulic system: root networks dictate where Mira can kneel, what fruit she dares taste, how she re-assembles prayer. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she smells “late-summer fermentation” above skulls, feels tannic grit on fingers—guiding her choice to harvest and stay. Environment literally charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can exile become continuity?”—tightens when each chamber forces Mira to decide: catalogue or commune, wander or plant. One deepening: learning the traveler returned to die here reframes Mira’s own return from academic pretext to existential stake. Cost is present (abandoned secular certainty) but diffuse; a sharper forfeiture would punch higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from vegetal-metabolic metaphor: belief as root-network, not proposition. The closing stone-and-fruit image reconfigures diaspora grief into cyclical nourishment without moralizing. Only the phrase “faith might be something other than what she had imagined” flirts with echo; its placement mid-story and immediate sensory re-grounding keep the penalty minimal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a hushed, archaeological precision—“disciplined rows,” “amber and rose”—that modulates into lyrical release at dusk. No dialogue, yet interior cadence stays consistent; perceptual signature filters every notice through bereaved, re-awakening sight. Compression like “cautious enchantment” is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, multi-tasking: “roots…threading between skulls and ribs like pale, patient fingers” shows simile secured to POV sensory limit. One scaffold loop—“interrupted journeys” restated twice—dulls momentum slightly; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Closure sentence keeps clarity and lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Necropolitan orchard feeding living fruit is fresh, yet the story’s real ingenuity is structural: excavation as inverse prayer, each scraped layer re-membering rather than unearthing. The traveler's sundial repurposes a familiar trope into time-as-return, not passage. Risk lies in lyrical stillness over plot twists; coherence rewards the gamble.</comment>
