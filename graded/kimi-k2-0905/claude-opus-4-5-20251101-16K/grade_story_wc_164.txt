<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her palm on quartz, the warming crater glass—but the “familiar weight” in her heart is never embodied beyond the label; one micro-choice (gathering seeds) crystallizes her values yet the cost feels light. The contradiction between her gift-as-curse is asserted, not dramatized in-scene. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and the final image of carrying “missing pieces home” earns a credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to transliterate the seeds into a last spark for the dying mother reconfigures the stakes with felt cost (“before memory faded entirely”). Causal chain holds—seeds → emotional fingerprints → final transliteration—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor scaffold: “That was always the problem” restates what the crater glass already showed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The geode is not backdrop; its quartz handprint, cathedral amethyst, and seed-circle physically guide Mira’s stops and constrain her path. Crater glass functions as micro-setting that literally reframes perception, charging the final image. Sensory triangulation (cool crystal, warming glass, iridescent air) is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the descent-ascent arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover a path between mother and daughter before total forgetting—is signaled early and tightens once: the seeds end in a perfect circle, forcing Mira to decide whether to transliterate the fragments or leave them. Cost is legible: she accepts the partial, probably futile, gesture. No external antagonist needed; pressure is existential-temporal. Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: paths disappear not from malice but from organic decay, and memory-work is an act of love against entropy. Subtext resides in the seeds—once bird-provisions, now emotional fossils—reweighted in the final gathering. No moralizing; the crystals’ “cheerful indifference” supplies a resonant, non-literal answer. The concept of “missing pieces” is integrated via the transliteration process rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Mira’s perceptual syntax—“colors that had no business existing,” “star had kissed the earth hard enough to leave bruises”—without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical coils for wonder, clipped fragments for pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are sparse; when used (“she felt something stir”) they serve immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent (rainbow tantrums, salt in rain) and never stack in high-pressure beats. One near-scaffold: “Missing pieces. That was always the problem” could be cut, but it occupies its own paragraph and thus creates a deliberate caesura rather than clutter. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The emotional-cartography premise feels fresh: a recollectionist who reads feelings spilled by bird-seed inside a geode to map a dementia-erased relationship. Specificity of the crater glass as fossilized star-impact and the seed-circle as accidental cartography transform what could be abstract into tactile myth. Risk in the lyric accumulative structure pays off; no familiar plot template is followed. The synthesis is inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at onset.</comment>
