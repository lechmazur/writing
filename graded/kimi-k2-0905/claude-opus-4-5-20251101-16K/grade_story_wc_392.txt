<comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—stoic witness vs. visceral immersion—collide the instant she grips the lantern: "She should have called it in immediately. Instead...she reached." The embodied cost of borrowed memory is dramatized by her bleeding feet-not-hers and the supervisor’s sabotage; the final refusal to drown in them is credibly rooted in twelve years of practiced distance. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when she chooses documentation over surrender, sealing the path to silence at measurable personal risk.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: drought → exposed tunnel → lantern contact → memory bleed → identification of cover-up → decisive call to Internal Affairs, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Decisive Change with clear social cost: by outing her boss she forfeits institutional protection and invites retaliation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no debt applied.</comment>

<comment>Subway crawlspace functions as micro-setting: confined damp concrete determines how she kneels, how the lantern is reachable, how escape routes narrow when visions hit. Historic layering ("predated the transit system by a century") is embedded through action, not exposition. Rain drumming overhead mirrors the pulse of resurfacing memory, charging the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—uncover the truth behind "accidental" deaths—faces a lethal tightening when the same mnemonic trap claims her; agency survives through her trained stance of "fortified vulnerability." The lantern’s second beat, forcing her to relive a cover-up she once authored in another skin, raises the cost of disclosure. One credible on-page price: professional exile implied by the IA call.</comment>

<comment>Theme of historical accountability emerges from the relay of memory: Underground Railroad desperation → modern worker confusion → protagonist’s refusal to erase either. No explicit thesis; resonance arises when past and present deaths are sutured by the same object. Final image of "memories settling into her bones" offers Conceptual Repricing: the cost of witness becomes irreversible bodily knowledge.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maya’s sensory filter—"bare feet bleeding on packed earth" she simultaneously feels and does not feel. Perceptual signature distinguishes present-day clinical precision ("photographed the crawlspace, documented everything") from the fused historical fragments that intrude with older diction ("freedom seekers"). No head-hopping; memory slippage is announced by italics-like paragraph shifts rather than POV breach.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates into clipped present participles during possession—"running...bleeding...barked"—then exhales into longer reflective sentences as she re-grounds herself. Figurative control avoids mixed metaphors; stacked images ("memories...reverberate through time") appear only once and serve the concept. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fuses two well-worn tropes—haunted artifact and whistle-blower thriller—into a fresh mnemonic relay where historical trauma infects present labor exploitation. Specificity of the Underground Railroad signal lantern, encountered in a subway infrastructure gut, makes the collision feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk of magical memory transfer is committed to fully without hedging; internal logic remains consistent.</comment>
