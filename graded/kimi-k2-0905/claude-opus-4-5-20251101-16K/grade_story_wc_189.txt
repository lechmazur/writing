<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her perceptual signature of “watching the spaces between” is embodied, not abstract. The micro-choice to hand over the jade cicada crystallizes her hierarchy of values and carries visible cost (loss of talisman, acceptance of successor). The granddaughter’s motivation is thinner; her silence is felt but her decision to stay and learn is asserted rather than dramatized. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait with one credible endurance/renunciation that satisfies the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final image of two women holding vigil under wheeling stars reweights all prior “between” imagery with undeniable conceptual cost—legacy is now shared, time is textured. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pattern of tidal, cicada, stellar pauses tightens meaningfully. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (grotto, stars, salt air). Cost is legible in the passing of the cicada and the open-ended future the granddaughter now carries. One minor causality bump: the granddaughter’s sudden “teach me” is slightly under-motivated, but it lands inside the resonant reconfiguration, so penalty is capped at −0.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto, cicada, and tidal pool form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Light “like stained glass” through jade wings, salt air, and starwheel overhead are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean: grandmother-to-granddaughter hand-off tracks within one continuous scene. Environment is not backdrop but equipment for the lesson; the cicada literally alters tactics (what can be held, passed, risked). Meets 9- gate: recurring object (cicada) plus body/attention (hand) jointly shape the final poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will father survive?—is signaled in paragraph 2 and never abandoned. Escalation is textural: each natural metaphor (hermit crab, cicada, starwheel) deepens the cost of uncertainty rather than changing external options. The one meaningful tightening is the handing-over of the cicada; it forecloses Mira’s solitary guardianship and passes the burden. Agency is renunciatory rather than active, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is visible (loss of talisman, emotional exposure) and felt. No reversal in causal sense, but deepening qualifies under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulate imagery—tidal pools, molting crabs, seventeen-year cicadas—never from thesis statements. Final image answers the father-survival question obliquely: survival is less important than learning to inhabit uncertainty. Subtext is carried in silence, starlight, and the weight of jade. Avoids overt allegory; “texture of time” is the only near-prompt echo but is earned through concrete particulars. Complexity is honored: no promise of healing, only shared vigil.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature: “watching the spaces between,” “salt air,” “cool weight of jade.” Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—short sentences under starlight, longer reflective loops when memory surfaces. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; granddaughter’s one direct question is raw, adolescent, ungrammatical in a good way. No head-hopping; granddaughter’s interior is inferred only through Mira’s warm observation, keeping psychic distance clean. Distinctive syntactic signature (“completely vulnerable. terrifying to watch.”) mirrors tidal pool pauses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</comment>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high: information often triple-loads (action, image, thematic echo) without clutter. No paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, no template cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided—vehicles stay within marine/entomological field. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes closure without exposition. Read-aloud ear test passes: rhythm rises and falls like breath. One near-purple phrase—“ancient grotto beneath the fractured ceiling of stone”—but payoff at closure justifies the grandeur. Zero artifacts in final third; 9- band eligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: fortune-telling recast as naturalist observation rather than prophecy. Tidal pool as oracle is non-obvious and specific to this voice. Transformation test passes: swap setting and the metaphor collapses. Risk is quiet—no twist, no genre subversion—but coherence is high. Derivative premise guardrail does not apply; seer-grandmother trope is reweighted through ecology lens. Could use one more granular sensory shock (smell of rotting kelp, cut shell) to push into 8.5+ originality band.</comment>
