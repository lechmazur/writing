<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt is embodied in the tactile ritual of counting sins among driftwood and the pocketed watch-hand; her interior contradiction—pride in craft vs. nausea at consequence—drives every beat. The final micro-choice (laying the hand beside the carving) crystallizes her hierarchy of values and forecloses denial with visible cost. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters her stance; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes. Only minor slip: the off-page “tomorrow I will make amends” slightly hedges the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the watch-hand’s renunciation reweights the premise, making the sieved hush audible. Causal chain holds—letter → recognition → shore search → relinquishment—with each step narrowing options. Orientation is cleanly anchored within 120 words; transitions are seamless. The lens (Causal) remains coherent; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and tide-bound driftwood function as micro-setting: salt-bleached carvings physically constrain Maren’s search and mirror her internal erosion. Sensory selection is urgency-filtered—“sky bled indigo”—and integrates into action. Spatial choreography is exact; objects (watch-hand, carving) are tracked without drift. Setting could have constrained a tactical choice even more sharply, keeping it just under 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—atonement for an unmade life—signals early and tightens once: the discovery of the carving forces the renunciation of denial. Pressure grows through causal linkage; no coincidence resolves. The price (carrying the watch-hand, facing the question) is visible, though a sharper tangible loss (time, safety, reputation) mid-scene could have pushed higher. Closure cost is felt; escalation meets lens requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between curated memory and eroded truth; the clock-face carving without hands reprices “time lost” without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—laying the broken hand beside the empty dial—inviting reflection on restoration vs. erasure. Ambiguity is purposeful: Maren’s future amends remain uncertain, preserving complexity. Only a whisper of thematic echo (“sieved hush” repeated) keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person voice carries a forensic chill fitting a genealogist who parses lives like data. Syntax lengthens during recollection, then fractures toward shore-level immediacy (“Did she ever think of me?”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within Maren’s lexicon. One clause drifts toward elevated abstraction—“sieved hush of history”—but it is pattern-taught and pays off, forgiven.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by charged image. One mixed metaphor—“guilt had teeth…gnawing”— survives because it’s isolated and character-true. Otherwise metaphors are coherent and sparse; sentences vary in length and thrust.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise refreshes the familiar “sins of the father” trope via archival forgery, a niche with immediate stakes. The driftwood graveyard as living archive feels particular and inevitable. Risk is taken: no antagonist, no dialogue, yet pressure is sustained through interior causality. Transformation test passes—swap setting or occupation and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
