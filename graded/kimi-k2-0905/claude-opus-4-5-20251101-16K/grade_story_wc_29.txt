<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—scientific rigor versus gambler’s nerve—drives every beat; the final grin is earned because the text has shown her rehearsing that nerve in the micro-choices of dial-turns, chart-checks, and mentor memory. Embodied tension (finger hover, fluttering maps) externalizes stakes without label-speak. Only flaw: “cautiously hopeful” is named twice; convert one to sensation. Still, agency, flaw, and cost cohere at 8.9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: charts predict convergence → Mira rigs clandestine array → subsonic pulse exposes seam → signal answers back, crystallizing new rules. Midnight flip is decisive change with felt cost—she is now “opponent” rather than “listener,” a reconfiguration charged in the final line. Orientation locked by 80 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands clean under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Studio basement, body-as-headphones, astronomical charts as living interface—every object constrains tactics or foreshadows the seam-reveal. Sensory hierarchy tuned to Mira’s profession: hiss of stars, flutter of paper, subsonic silence. Micro-setting satisfies 9+ gate. Could trade one visual cue for olfactory to deepen “radio station” specificity, but spatial choreography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove manipulation before factions destroy each other—tightens at exact midnight beat; interference forfeits anonymity, visible cost on page. Signal’s amused retort escalates from threat to personal invitation, narrowing her future options. One meaningful turn suffices; causality intact. Price legible: she is marked, grinning anyway.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth as negotiated weapon, not gift—emerges through signal war rather than lecture. Subsonic disruption reweights “listening” into “talking back,” repricing the cosmologist’s ethic without moralizing. Final image crystallizes ambiguity: game begins, rules unknown. Echo of mentor’s caution seeds irony, but refrain from naming it again.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual frequency—technical diction filtered by tactile obsession (“charts flutter as if touched by wind”). Compression increases under stress: “She increased the amplitude” becomes single clause before scream. No head-hop; voice modulates with amplitude. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high-density lines (“The tricksters wanted exactly this. Division. Confusion.”) do triple duty: exposition, stake, rhythm. Metaphors airborne yet precise—“signal scream” is literalized by chart flutter. Only micro-slip: “felt her stomach drop” is stock; swap for visceral particular. Otherwise propulsive, clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>SETI-as-information-warfare is fresh synthesis; subsonic seam-reveal weaponizes academic esoterica without technobable. Mentor relic + living chart motif transform familiar “first contact” into cyber duel. Risk (silent bass battle) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Could edge 9+ with one more sensory inversion, but already memorable.</comment>
