<comment>Nadia’s survivor guilt and scientific obsession feel inseparable; every micro-choice—returning to the geode, restarting the sensors—replays the moment she lived. Interiority stays concrete (“the geode survived because she left it in the car”) and bleeds into embodied action at the console. No epiphany is declared; the final resolve is simply the next keystroke, costing her the last illusion of closure. The only drag is a faint diagnostic tinge—“bleak exhilaration her therapist named”—but it’s embedded in motion, not abstracted.</comment>

<comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each new pool of potential widens the moral aperture until the final image reweights the whole sky. Orientation is instant—floating observatory, 40 000 ft, cooling breakers at word 50. Closure is a Charged Poise: the Lagos/Sudan/Yemen readings bloom larger while Nadia keeps typing, the cost legible in the refusal to stop. The 18-minute cooldown is the single tightening that turns reflection into compulsion; no options are closed, yet every future is already mortgaged.</comment>

<comment>Environment is micro-setting—the viewport’s cold glass, the geode’s hollow, the console’s beep—each handled until it constrains choice. The observatory’s altitude is not backdrop but instrumental: thinner air = sharper readings, so height literally enables the hunt. Light refracts off crystal teeth like “frozen screams,” marrying geology to grief without metaphoric overkill. Spatial choreography is immaculate: palm on glass, geode at focal array, body anchored against drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: map the invisible debt of stolen futures before the pools overflow. Pressure escalates by accretion—each new massacre signature enlarges the moral ledger she must triage. The 18-minute rest is the pivot: idle time = more ghosts, so the hunt becomes literal breath-race. Cost is cumulative: every extra data-point is another unlived life she refuses to delete, ending in a sky so saturated with potential it feels ready to burst.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as inverse stewardship: science used to witness, not fix, the unpaid debts of chance. Subtext is in the silence—no mention of revenge, only accounting. The geode’s hollow beauty becomes the emblem of a universe that keeps receipts, not consolation. Final image reconfigures grief as atmospheric data: “ghosts of possibility swirled like slow storms” gives the emotional aftereffect without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is physicist-poet: precise diction (“quantum foam,” “perturbation equations”) braided with sensory cruelty (“crystal teeth…frozen screams”). Syntax tightens under countdown—short clauses mimic breaker clicks. No head-hop; every perception is filtered through Nadia’s instrument bias. Register stays inside her lexicon; even “algorithm decided” sounds like her own lab note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no scaffold loops, no synonym churn. Each sentence carries double duty—e.g., “Up here, she could sense what others couldn’t” advances both altitude and epistemic privilege. Metaphors are few, exact, and non-contradictory. Only micro-slip: “bleak exhilaration her therapist named” edges toward label-speak, but is instantly re-embodied in the next sensor sweep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum grief as atmospheric science—an idea that would collapse if relocated. The drone-mistaken wedding is rendered only through the geode’s survival, avoiding trauma porn. Risk is maximal—no antagonist, no rescue, no hope—yet coherence holds. Final reprise of crystal-as-skull feels inevitable, not clever.</comment>
