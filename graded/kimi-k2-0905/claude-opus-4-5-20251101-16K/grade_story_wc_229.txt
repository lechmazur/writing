<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“each step an ache she had learned to love”), yet the father remains off-page until the final beat, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is theoretical. The micro-choice to open the vial is crisp and stakes-scaled, but no interior contradiction is staged in-scene; the emotional arc is a smooth ascent rather than a twist. Still, the endurance/renunciation is palpable: she forfeits the louder tools and accepts the risk of silence. Character reads as individual, not type, and the flaw (believing quiet can win) is the very engine of resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens: the scent density and rain-cooled cadence tighten until the final image reweights the stake. Causality is lyric-permitting (“she felt it before she saw it”), but the story teaches that rule early and pays it off when the boat answers the fragrance. Closure is a Charged Poise: father’s lifted hand reconfigures meaning without expositional cost, yet the emotional price—months of shouted failure—is felt retroactively. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse and dawn sea are sketched with selective sensory economy; the vial acts as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Weather shift from heat to cool rain is not postcard backdrop—it enables the scent’s travel, hence charges closure. Spatial choreography is immaculate: spiral stairs, lantern room, window, horizon line track cleanly. No props teleport; the cork’s dropped roll is a silent coda that marks the before/after.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers trump shouts—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened once when she rejects horn/binoculars. Escalation is textural: perfume density + rain-cleared air = narrowing option toward silence. Cost is conceptual but legible: she hazards total failure by forfeiting every loud tool. Coincidence (boat appears) complicates rather than rescues; the scent invitation must still be answered by the father’s reciprocal gesture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not lecture: scent invitation vs. horn command. Final image of the lifted hand reweights “whispers travel farther” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—did the garden oil summon, or did patience?—inviting reflection. No thesis statement; the mother’s label “beckoning oil” is the closest to echo, but it is in-scene dialogue, not authorial nudge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is synesthetic (“felt the rain through walls”). Compression and elision (“three months ago”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; father’s POV is strictly opaque until externalized in the hand-lift. Syntax mirrors tide rhythm—long sentences swell, fragments break at climax—without algorithmic pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence variety avoids drumbeat. Only minor scaffold: “she had… she had…” anaphora is purposeful, not mechanical. No mixed metaphors; scent travel = ripple is consistent. Information density high—each sentence layers weather, memory, and choice. Closing line earns its aphoristic lift because the prior beats have embodied it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse + perfumed magic realism avoids genre cliché. Central inversion—quietest call succeeds—reframes maritime rescue tropes. Risk taken with intangible stakes pays off because closure remains legible. Specific detail (cobalt tower, moonflower oil) prevents abstract anywhere/anyone drift.</comment>
