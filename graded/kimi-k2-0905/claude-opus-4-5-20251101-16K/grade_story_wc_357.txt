<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kira’s desire to save the orchards is vivid, but her contradictory impulse—risking death every dawn yet never explaining why she alone must do this—stays off-page. Interiority is concrete (“stomach lurch,” “heart pounding”), yet the moment she decides to resurrect the arrow ritual is compressed into a single clause; we feel resolve, not the knife-edge cost of becoming the world’s only arrow-maker. The arrow tip’s hum against her palm is a perfect micro-choice that fuses object and motive, but the story withholds any glimpse of what she forfeits (time, safety, friendships?) for this new duty. Earned endurance is telegraphed rather than dramatized, so the promised “stubborn echo” lands as hope, not scar.</comment>

<comment>Causal linkage is clean: blight → find miracle arrow → follow inverted rivers → hear ritual → choose to restart it. Orientation is swift (who, where, when inside 60 words), and the inversion physics remains consistent. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kira’s glider banks toward a future of arrow-forging whose cost is implied by the Gathering’s “endless chorus” now inside her. The lens (Hybrid, tipping to Causal) holds, but the final beat could sharpen the concrete price she’ll pay—without it, the cost is conceptually legible yet not viscerally felt.</comment>

<comment>Floating rock arches, up-flowing rivers, and echo-trapping amphitheater are sketched with economy and sensory bite (“green chandeliers,” “ribbons of silver”). Setting is not backdrop but navigational instrument: Kira reads water-spray to steer, and the Gathering’s acoustic rules deliver the lore she needs. Micro-setting (the broken arrow tip) constrains the final choice and is charged by the closing image. A few phrases tilt toward the picturesque (“monolithic arches crusted with moss”), yet every detail is filtered through pilot priorities of wind and gravity, keeping the 9-band in reach.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save the dying orchards—hooks early and tightens when the arrow’s power is revealed as fading. Escalation is driven by her successive discoveries: blight → arrow cure → ritual map → burden of renewal. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the orchards are “starving” without the arrow cycle; this reframes blight from curse to neglect, forcing her irrevocable commitment. Cost is legible but abstract (a lifetime of dawn-arrow launches); a sharper, immediate forfeiture would push this into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-resilience emerges organically from plot: broken arrow tip, echo basin, and returning pilot form a single continuum. No character lectures us; the moral accrues through images (orchards “clinging,” stones “whispering still”). Final image of Kira carrying “the stubborn echo” offers a non-literal answer: continuity itself is the cure. Complexity is respected—no guarantee the ritual will suffice, only that refusal is now impossible.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Kira’s perceptual filter—she notices wind shifts, spray angles, root flex—never lapses into omniscient gloss. Syntax is crisp, rhythmic, pilot-apt: “She read their movements like language.” No dialogue appears; interior monologue is spare and scene-locked. Voice modulates with gravity inversion: shorter, breathless clauses during zero-g drift, longer sentences under normal lift. The absence of trademark tics and the disciplined sensory bias earn high-band consideration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, strong verb choice (“tilting her glider to catch the spray”). Figurative language is restrained; each metaphor is single-layer and physically coherent (“orchards hung like green chandeliers”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line resolves by resonant image. Minor scaffold: two adjective pairs (“whirling silence,” “gentle upheaval”) feel slightly workshop-premium but do not obscure causality or dull the final image, so the 9-gate remains open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combining inverse-gravity horticulture with echo-arch acoustics feels fresh yet inevitable; no tidy genre precedent exists. The arrow-as-root-conduit rewrites familiar “chosen one finds artifact” into “chosen one becomes engineer of an ancient cycle,” flipping empowerment into responsibility. Specific lived detail—fruit stems evolved to flex both ways, pilots mapping sky-rivers—grounds the marvel in agronomic reality. The risk of scientific hand-waving is avoided because world rules are disclosed only through navigational action. Transformation test: swap planet or pilot and the entire emotional scaffolding collapses.</comment>
