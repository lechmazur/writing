<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dry humor and thirty-year obsession anchor Maren; “subtly confident” is asserted more than dramatized. Condensation-map beat crystallizes inner drive, yet micro-choice under acute risk is only packing, not a fraught decision. Interiority is concrete when tied to atlases; falcon/phrasebook interactions remain functional props rather than crucibles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory images (frost, steam) tighten toward the convergence reveal; beat sequence maps → translation → condensation vision → resolve. Closure lands as Charged Poise: northwest coordinates memorized, cost is the outpost left to rust and the “weeping” map erased—tangible forfeiture of proof. Causality holds; no orientation debt. Minor drag: condensation mechanics appear only at climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake, rusted outpost, and condensing window function as micro-setting that constrain visibility and direction, charging the final image. Sensory triad—cold glass, kettle steam, pewter sky—filters through Maren’s cartographic gaze, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean; distance to “northwest” is abstract but stakes internal. Weather is absolute stillness that amplifies psychological breath-hold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate river origin—signaled in first third; pressure escalates via falcon delay → cryptic clue → condensation map. One meaningful tightening: condensation pattern forces immediate departure, foreclosing wait-another-day option. Cost visible in erasure of map, isolation of trek. Agency is active packing; could score higher if a live risk (thin ice, dwindling fuel) imposed tactical trade-off on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from obsession with origins and the impossibility of holding evidence: atlases edit rivers yet can’t show the source. Motif of vanishing—frost reclaiming glass, outpost rusting, linguist dead—suggests knowledge erases as it appears. Resonant non-literal answer: Maren walks toward truth already disappearing. Subtle, avoids moralizing; ambiguity on what she’ll “bring back” invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Maren’s perceptual signature: rivers, cartographic metaphors, dry editorial quips. Syntax tightens under pressure: short declaratives when condensation forms. No head-hopping; inference stays POV-bound (“the world holding its breath”). Phrasebook Evenki is allowed polyglot accuracy; diction remains within plausible editor lexicon. Rhythm modulates with steam rise vs. crystalline silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong verbs (“wings cutting,” “frost eating”) and concrete nouns; figurative language selective, never piled in high-pressure beats. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences on condensation both stress “pattern” without new info. No register drift or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. Paragraph cut test passed; each advances knowledge or charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Convergence of all rivers as literal geographic spot feels fresh, reframed through cartographer’s procedural mindset rather than mystical quest. Condensation auto-mapping is inventive image; falcon courier and nomad riddle root premise in specific cultural layer. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic explorer, proving integration. Risk is moderate: lyric stillness could tilt abstract, yet closure grounds cost.</comment>
