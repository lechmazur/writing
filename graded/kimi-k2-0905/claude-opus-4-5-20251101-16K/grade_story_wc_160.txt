<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—guild duty vs. filial fidelity—play out in embodied beats (trembling hands, patting stone, looping chain). The final resolve to argue for the harder path is earned by the discovered conduit and the irreversible cost of erasing the amphitheater. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only minor withholding: we don’t see her actually speak to the guild, so the cost is anticipated rather than paid on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: thermal shift → re-read envelope → decode adhesive → find auxiliary channel → decide to fight for preservation. Closure is a Charged Poise—she climbs out with the warm chain, options reweighted, six-month cost legible. Orientation clean by 120 words. One softness: the guild’s veto power is told, not shown, slightly defanging the final stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The breathing amphitheater is not mere backdrop; its thermal rhythm literally guides her discovery of the auxiliary conduit. Volcanic dust, shifting stone, and brass warmed by magma tether every beat. Micro-setting (53-link chain = stage diameter) constrains her emotional geometry. The dormant volcano never feels like set dressing; it exhales through every decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save both floodgates and amphitheater—tightens when she decodes the adhesive map and realizes her father almost found the bypass. One clear reversal: from “one system must give” to “both can coexist if I rebuild.” Cost is the six-month rebuild and professional risk, stated but not yet felt on-page. Still, pressure escalates cleanly under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion emerges through particulars: marginal village names, chain length = parents’ meeting spot, adhesive pattern = repeated reopenings. Final whispered line reweights water as resilience without moralizing. Theme stays implicit, refracted through engineering language. No tidy thesis—just the irreversible shift in what precision can carry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tightly fused to Mira’s machinist perception: she “reads” structures, trusts measurements, notices residue patterns. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, climbs toward daylight with chain chiming—prose mimics pulse of both volcano and insight. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Free indirect slips in cleanly: “fifty-three links, each one irreplaceable.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory detail, back-reveal, and forward pressure (“brass links tarnished green” frames grief and tool age). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated lyricism (“coded redemption”) is earned by accumulated specificity. Final cadence varies sentence length to let chain-chime land.</comment>

<comment>Father’s love encoded in flood tables flips the cold-engineer trope into specific emotional revelation. Geothermal amphitheater feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk taken: entire plot hinges on analyzing envelope adhesive—works because method is foreshadowed by her trade and paid off as discovery beat. Could not swap chain or caldera without breaking arc.</comment>
