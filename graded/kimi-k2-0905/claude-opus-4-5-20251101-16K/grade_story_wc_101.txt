<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s “gentle persistence” is dramatized in the midnight bell-ring and the off-stage lobbying that keeps the withdrawn returning; her interior contradiction—teaching poetry vs. clandestine courier—surfaces only in one quick flash, so the cost is felt but not embodied in scene. Bekir’s judge past adds status tension that pressures Mira’s stance, yet his dialogue is only two whispered lines, keeping relationship crucible thin. The final refusal to declare is earned by the prior six-month stealth network, giving Earned Stasis visible social cost: continued invisibility. Voice stays coherent, no label-speak, but emotional granularity peaks early and plateaus rather than tightening under final bell echo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the second bell disperses them back into sanctioned darkness, re-weighting anonymity as the price of survival—cost is legible in the amplified quiet. Causal chain holds: anonymous gifts → secrecy protocol → Mira’s refusal to go public; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation anchor (terra-cotta arbor, dusk, forty-three families) appears by line 4, well inside 120-word waiver window. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. One minor slack: the “six months ago” donation origin is told in reflection block; because it never becomes a present-tense obstacle, tension does not escalate further, keeping score just below 9.</comment>

<comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: it frames the opening and closing bell, constraining the communal act that defines the piece. Ridge/valley geography is sketched in dusk colors, but spatial footprint stays hazy—no impossible moves, yet no tactile navigation either. Silver bell is handled twice, its clear note “amplifying the quiet,” a sensory hook that recharges at closure; this secures the 9-plus gate test. Weather and season remain background, adequate for 700-word scope but not architecturally used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collective survival under sanctions—tightens when pride threatens distribution: Mira’s secrecy protocol is the single meaningful turn that forecloses open appeal. Cost is persistent: continued anonymity, perpetual midnight labor, no reprieve from sanctions. Agency is distributed but Mira authorizes the final “not yet,” so protagonist ownership holds. Escalation is linear, not recursive; luck never intervenes; the price is social invisibility, fully legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from stealth solidarity: anonymity as mutual aid, not shame. Subtext lives in gesture—formula passed in silence—never sermonized. Final bell reconfigures silence from fear to chosen strength, a non-literal answer. No thematic echo line, no moral summary; complexity accepted—public declaration may still arrive later, cost unknown.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Mira, no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: bruised-purple dusk, literature-trained eye naming shades, bell sound “amplifying quiet.” Syntax flexes from lyrical roll to clipped whisper, mirroring stealth tempo. Dialogue sparse but idiomatic; Bekir’s “How long…” carries judicial brevity. No experimental deviation, yet rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean: no loops, no mixed metaphors, high density—each sentence layers image, stakes, and motion. Opening line anchors voice and stakes immediately; final line resolves by image (fading bell echo). Minor filter verbs (“she suspected”) appear once but do not cluster in peak beats. Register stays literary yet within Mira’s plausible lexicon. Proofing clean; no tense drift. Artifact-free in closure third, satisfying 9-plus gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: midnight food-run as covert parliament transforms familiar exile trope into civic ritual. Bell repurposed from keepsake to clandestine bugle, specificity not quirk. Synthesis feels organic, not checklist. Risk is quiet escalation rather than public revolt; coherence maintained. Could swap sanctions context for war embargo without breaking arc, so not fully singular, but ridge-and-bell texture personalizes enough.</comment>
