<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid (“watching her fingerprints dissolve into perfect, impossible mirrors”), but the ghosts do the emotional talking; she mostly listens and summarizes. The final declaration is assertive yet feels lightly prepared—no prior micro-choice shows her testing “independence” on the page. Because the closure stance is declared rather than dramatized, motivation lands solid but not fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara absorbs the ghosts and redefines her role from mourner to keeper, cost signaled by “not brittle…forged.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, taught early by the tidal-shelf motif and held to the last image. Orientation is quick; spatial logic stays intact even with phantoms. One causal gap: we never see the moment she decides to internalize rather than surrender.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selective, textured detail (“shelves rising and falling with the cosmic rhythm,” “light fracturing through…spectrums no human eye would ever perceive”) keeps the cloud-library palpable without cataloging. The brass sundial functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. City glimpses supply scale and mirror her stance. One minor drift: the stone circle’s physical relation to Elara is never anchored, but it does not affect the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to bear endless extinction guilt—surfaces in paragraph four and tightens once: surrender (mammoth’s advice) vs. solitary custodianship. Elara’s verbal refusal narrows options, but the beat is conversational; no external risk or resource cost is exacted on-page. Pressure is present yet static; the ghosts supply moral weight, not obstacles. Sufficient for short-form but not yet knife-edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of custodial independence emerges from image pattern—mirror, book, tide—rather than thesis. Final line reframes prior loss into active preservation, supplying non-literal resonance. Ghost dialogue flirts with overt statement (“Lonely words…Revolutionary ones”) yet stays in character. No moral is preached; ambiguity remains about whether self-annexation is triumph or curse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric compresses into character-specific perception; diction stays high-register but consistent with a millennium-worn observer. Rhythm modulates—long tidal sentences vs. stubbed replies (“I want purpose”). Ghost voices are distinct: mammoth’s grave bass, dodo’s clipped irony. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to Elara’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagistic density, yet occasional modifier stacks (“atomically reflective surface of her brass sundial”) approach purple. Sentence variety is good; loop check clean. Minor simultaneity hiccup: “pressed her palm…watching” implies concurrent long action and observation. No artifacts near closure; final cadence lands uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Afterlife library above clouds is fresh, and the “brittle awakening” coinage reframes reincarnation trauma. Ghost-self merger avoids typical after-life chat by turning it into archival duty. Concept risks echoing Gaiman-esque memory libraries but pivots to custodial independence rather than nostalgia. Specific detail (sundial catching non-existent light) secures memorable visual fingerprint.</comment>
