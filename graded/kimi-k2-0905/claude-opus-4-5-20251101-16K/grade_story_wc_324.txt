<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s protective drive is clear, but her “persistent curiosity” is only asserted; it never complicates her choice or costs her anything. The moment she shields the signal is instinctive, not a crucible that reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority stays atmospheric (“wondered how many more…”) rather than contradictory under pressure. Earned, yet the trait flagged in the prompt stays ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s trembling hands and the warm hearing aid make the cost felt while foreclosing her path of endless listening. Causal chain is thin—predatory frequency appears without prior seed—but the mother-daughter beat resolves through Mira’s deliberate shield, satisfying the lens. Orientation clean by 90 words. One micro-turn, no resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mist, atrium glass, and the antique hearing-aid plastic are filtered through Mira’s professional eye; the photograph’s worn edges tether us to Elena’s grief. Spatial track is clean: photograph handed over, hearing aid connected, mist thickens then lifts. Setting never blocks choice, but the grandmother-aid constrains method and charges the final image. Micro-setting qualifies; strong specificity, yet environment does not actively pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stake—“protect vulnerable voices”—is signaled early and tested once when Mira draws interference onto herself. Escalation is single-step: interference scream → shield → retreat; cost (disorientation) is immediate but not persistent. No second tightening, but the mother’s farewell lands as irrevocable gain for Elena. Meets short-form requirement; could use one more tactical consequence to reach high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening-as-salvation emerges through the photograph and the grandmother’s hearing aid, not exposition. Final line reweights “she was always listening” without moralizing. Subtext in Elena’s silence (“I never got to say—”) carries more grief than her tears. Avoids tidy thesis; resonance lingers in the warm plastic after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Mira; perceptual signature favors auditory detail (“spaces between sounds,” “static, erratic”). Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences for twilight hush, clipped beats during interference scream. No dialogue to test idiom, yet narrative diction avoids generic fantasy fog. Distinct without showing off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean; each paragraph advances image or choice. No loops, no mixed metaphor. “Reeling hush” returns once, earns its keep by modulating into the lifting mist. High information density; clauses carry double duty (“mist-clad sanctuary where the boundary…”). Clean mechanics, strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” plus obsolete hearing-aid tech gives fresh tilt to after-life trope. predatory-frequency rule is introduced late and feels borrowed; keeps score from topping 8.5. Yet the photograph-to-hearing-aid link transforms familiar grief-session into singular ritual. Fresh enough for elite slot.</comment>
