<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Della’s interiority is lived-in: the brass fob “worn smooth by generations of nervous thumbs” fuses heirloom history with her inherited silence-craft. Her three reconnaissance loops are active micro-choices that progressively sharpenCarver’s tells (neck-touch) and foreclose the frontal-assault option; the final refusal to shout betrayal is an earned stasis that costs her the moral high ground yet keeps the family’s market lifeline. The contradictory impulses—vengeance vs survival of the moonshine route—co-exist inside single beats, not alternating summaries. Secondary pressure from “the truce of hush” is ambient but never personified, so relationship crucible is muted; still, her flawed competence (she can read the market but cannot undo her father’s aphasia) feels individual, not typed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: each failed approach tightens the next (because bribe fails → therefore she maps exits; because Carver loops east → therefore she stations with the fob). The sunrise clock is anchored by the graying sky and dissolving market, making the final renunciation a decisive change with visible cost—she forfeits revenge and the sound she hunted, trading them for the explanation her father may never speak to. Orientation is clean inside 120 words (pier, stairs, lantern light). No teleporting props; the fob’s grandfather lineage is paid off when Carver’s “fish-belly” face recognizes it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rotting pier is not backdrop but social regulator: barnacled beams dictate choke-points, lantern gaps silhouette clandestine hands, and the “truce of hush” is enforced by spatial proximity that makes overhearing betrayal lethal. The antique fob functions as micro-setting—its brass glint replaces sunlight and forces Carver’s confession. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Della filters noise through a moonshine runner’s priorities (silence = currency, gulls = alarm system). Waterline stench and copper light evolve as dawn nears, mirroring the fading safety of night commerce.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and narrows to capturing the explanation behind the silence. Pressure tightens once: the third reconnaissance beat flips the goal from vengeance to comprehension, foreclosing public exposure. Cost is legible—she swallows betrayal to keep the family’s smuggling lifeline alive. Sunrise clock supplies external squeeze, but escalation is driven by her accumulating knowledge, not outside violence; still, the single meaningful tightening satisfies causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete arithmetic of loyalty: Carver’s “terrible arithmetic of loving one person more than your word” reweights the watch fob from heirloom to moral abacus. The ending answers the thematic question—what sound does breaking trust make?—with the image of swallowed accusation: silence itself becomes the sound, revaluing the market’s “truce of hush” as civic glue. No final-paragraph sermon; the resonance is in the gold-painted rot and the ringing ears she carries home.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Della’s perceptual signature: verbs of silence measurement (“breathed its nightly breath,” “hiss prices like curses”) and nautical thrift of metaphor. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for stalking, clipped fragments at recognition (“I didn’t—”). No head-hopping; Carver’s interior is read only through his throat-touch tell. Diction stays inside a smuggler’s lexicon; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Information-dense without scaffolding: one sentence (“She’d learned Carver’s patterns…”) collapses three beats into compressed payoff. Metaphors are physically coherent—rotting pier as whale belly, lanterns as copper coins. No filter-verb clusters; actions precede interpretation. Read-aloud ear test passes: paragraph lengths ebb to mirror market dissolving. Only micro-loop is “opened, closed, opened again” which serves Carver’s stammer, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar noir trope—rogue market, heirloom token, betrayal—feels fresh because the coveted object is not goods but an audible fracture. The “truce of hush” commodifies silence into tradable civic currency, turning a pirate trope into a social contract. Final risk: renunciation instead of exposure; the quiet closure reconfigures meaning without gunfire. Specificity of gulls refusing to nest roots the SFF-adjacent locale in biological realism.</comment>
