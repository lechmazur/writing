<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Verai’s refusal-to-silence motive is embodied in every tactile micro-choice (pressing diamond to bone, her own arm); the copper-vein lineage gives visceral stakes. Interiority stays particular—no label-speak—and the final self-imprint is a credible renunciation with cost. Only minor: grandson beat is summary, not pressure. Still, contradiction pulses throughout and drives the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“season into season”) and tightens through pattern: each texture-to-syllable adds density until the diamond absorbs the teller herself. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—her absence becomes the canyon’s new voice—felt cost on-page (“didn’t return”). Orientation clean by 120 wds; transitions legible under single POV. No caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers, porous rib, wind-scent—all filter through Verai’s body-attention and constrain method (what can be “read”). Micro-setting rule satisfied: the flawed diamond’s tunnel literally charges the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency; no exposition dump. Spatial choreography holds as she traverses platforms and walls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—language extinction—signaled in para 1; escalation via each new texture translated narrows option space (time running out, speakers dying). Agency visible: she chooses self-imprint, paying with her remaining life/echo. Cost legible on-page. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal needed for lyric design. Meets 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: translation as refusal of erasure. Final non-literal answer—“voices they couldn’t understand speaking words that felt like colors”—reweights every prior texture beat without moralizing. Motif of echo/tunnel accumulates meaning; no late symbolic graft. Complexity held: no forced symmetry between conqueror and lost tongue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that stays inside Verai’s perceptual signature (copper light, canyon scent). Syntax lengthens then fragments under pressure (“neither word nor music but something between”). No head-hop; grandson dialogue brief and consistent with generational gap. Compression and elision taught early (“the canyon had been singing…”) and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse enough to avoid density penalty; vehicles stay coherent (“cry like grief given voice”). High information density: each line advances texture, motive, or myth. Zero scaffolding; opening and final images bookend with precision. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of “texture-to-sound preservation via flawed diamond echo-tunnel” is fresh synthesis; not a trope checklist. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Specific lived detail (copper veins, canyon mist color-word) makes premise inseparable from this place/people. Transformation test fails—story could not swap names and function.</comment>
