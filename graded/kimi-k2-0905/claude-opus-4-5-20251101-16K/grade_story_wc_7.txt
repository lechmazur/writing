<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-propelled refusal to forget is viscerally embodied in every cut of the shears; the contradiction between hunger to heal and risk of exposure stays alive in scene. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using taste as synesthetic memory. The final renunciation—continuing clandestine cooking after irreversible loss—carries a felt cost that scales to the piece. One minor slip: “something beautiful” is named rather than tasted; slightly under-embodies the motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the charged image of twelve glowing fruits re-weights the world’s rule-set, synaptic plasticity now weaponized. Causal chain holds: seed → tree → alignment → prune → harvest → tomorrow’s soups; each step narrows risk and raises stakes. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by line 3; no debt. One hairline lapse: pruning science is told more than dramatized, softening the decisive causal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is not backdrop but crucible: cracked glass channels moonlight onto the tree, constraining every cut and harvest moment. Sensory hierarchy is chef-tuned—smell of earth, warmth of fruit—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: shears, basket, bark track across moves without drift. Tool-as-setting (pruning shears) charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory versus erasure—signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each snip that could expose her. One meaningful escalation: the alignment window makes tonight irreversible, forcing harvest now or lose the cure. Cost is legible: mother’s forgotten face becomes the price of failure. Agency resides in every cut; luck merely offers light, never solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through edible memory rather than assertion: taste as resistance. Subtextual hinge: pruning as both caretaking and surgical strike against forgetting. Final image of “twelve glowing fruits” revalues prior decay into quiet arsenal; no moralizing sentence. Minor echo of “beautiful” as abstraction slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains chef-perceptor diction: synaesthetic slippage of memory into flavour feels organic. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for nostalgia, clipped fragments under moons. No filter-verb fat; perception stays embodied. One register bob: “synaptic plasticity” momentarily lifts into textbook lexis before returning to sensory voice.</comment>

<comment>Density is high: each sentence advances plant, light, or risk. No mixed metaphors; pruning logic stays arboreal. One paraphrase loop: “something beautiful” phrase repeated twice within closing paragraph without fresh charge. Otherwise crisp, with tactile verbs (snip, swell, tuck) propelling motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef reversing dystopian amnesia via fruit-pruning is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Gentle rebellion through kitchen craft flips expected bomb-throwing resistance. Specificity of hippocampal compound name shows research without exposition dump. Transformation test fails only in that “chosen one gardener” trope is visible, but execution is sufficiently particularized.</comment>
