<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the borrowed-garment metaphor—but the moment she “understands now” is declared, not dramatized. The master’s dissolve-into-acid exit is off-stage, so the emotional baton feels handed rather than earned. Still, her micro-choice to surface and gold-trace the pockmarks shows a visible cost and turns uncertainty into vocation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing statue and the new vocation reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—each key press triggers memory extraction that cumulatively reweights Mira’s stance. Acid-tide clock is coherent; no teleporting props. The only minor slip is the off-stage master-death that motivates the entire arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brass pontoons, glass floor, neutralized basin—each object constrains the breath-held countdown and charges the final image. Acid sea functions as both literal threat and mirrored grief; gears supply audible urgency. Spatial choreography is clean: water rises to chest, keys pressed, surface broken. Micro-setting (statue pockmarks) doubles as memory interface, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“narrate or oblivion”—is signaled early and tightens once: the breath-held window forecloses any second attempt. Escalation is accumulative: each key deepens memory density and lung burn, reweighting cost. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices. Price is visceral: surfacing gasp equals success bought with possible failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the gold-veined cracks: beauty as survival, not rescue. Kintsugi is never sermonized; it’s enacted when pockmarks glow. Final image reconfigures the premise—oblivion still comes, but meaning is now artifact. Ambiguity lingers: is narration consolation or defiance? Complexity held without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature filters through alchemical attention—viridian waves, gear-rhythm, bread-warmth memory. Syntax lengthens underwater, shortens at surface, mirroring lung pressure. No head-hop; master’s voice arrives via copper-key conduit, diegetically justified. Distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “gears meshing with the desperate rhythm of survival” does double duty. No loops, no filter stacks. Metaphors stay coherent—acid as hunger, gold as meaning—without crowding peak beats. Final line cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Memory-extraction via pockmark-key pairing feels fresh; kintsugi applied to eroded stone rather than pottery is a non-obvious leap. Floating clockwork atelier above acid sea synthesizes steampunk and eco-cataclysm without template drift. Risky breath-held mechanic pays off in charged poise. Specificity makes the concept inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
