<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s bereaved persistence is embodied in every micro-choice: kneeling among rotting apples, fitting cardboard “fractures,” surrendering sensory memories one by one. Contradictory impulses—cling vs. spend, speak vs. hollow—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final endurance costs her heartbeat’s sound; the hollowness is legible, earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sacrificed memory tightens the weave; silence literally ravels away, exposing voices. Closure is a Charged Poise—bead vanishing, heartbeat returned—re-weighting love as perpetual expenditure. Cost is visible in the last clause: “until she was hollow enough for Lien’s response to fill her completely.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard’s overgrown apples, moss, and bamboo stalks narrow Mira’s movement to kneeling; the amber bead’s fly-shadow becomes the final projector. Wild fruit no one harvests mirrors irreversible memory-loss; the setting supplies the cardboard altar and the silence that frays. Environment directly charges the ultimate image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—send word across worlds—intensifies each time a memory is traded. The mid-story list (“taste of cherries…”) is the visible price; the final bead push narrows options to hollow endurance. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no reversal, but deepening cost forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as love = unidirectional weaving: every filament given widens the void it hopes to bridge. Silence’s raveling and puzzle fractures literalize maternal grief without abstract labels. Fly-in-amber returning as projected calligraphy offers a non-literal repricing of permanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains Mira’s textile lexicon—“raveling,” “weave,” “pattern”—and rhythmic caesuras mimic loom pauses. Compression (“stoically sparkling”) stays within her emotional register. Final heartbeat sentence modulates to blunt monosyllables, mirroring emptied hollow. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and propulsive; figurative density is high but purpose-driven, taught by opening “whispered of connections.” One mixed image—“space between cardboard fragments that shimmered like heat rising from summer stone”—minorly dulls clarity. No loops, clean tense, strong verbs dominate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms portal-fantasy trope into maternal accounting system where memory IS currency; jigsaw edges as cartography of tears feels non-obvious. Sacrifice mechanics are grounded in textile craft rather than abstract magic. Final bead-casting projection is an image I haven’t seen; risk-taking supports stakes, not gimmickry.</comment>
