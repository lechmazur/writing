<comment>The locksmith’s interiority is evocative but abstract; we never see a contradictory impulse or micro-choice that risks real loss. The mother is a grief-prop, not a crucible. The child’s voice is purely symbolic—no embodied contradiction reaches the page. The final “charge” is asserted, not dramatized through visible cost to the locksmith.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the child’s secret is released and the mother’s stake is rewired. The causal chain is soft—“disorienting fear” is metaphor, not traceable beat—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: twilight pattern → hint → hair glow → reweighting. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors never blur. One non-closure slip: the locksmith’s abilities have no boundary rules, so tension plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<comment>Shadowed nexus and starlight are rendered with lyric economy; the hair becomes the micro-setting that finally charges the image. Sensory bias is consistent—visual/astral dominated, tactile only at the unravel. The shop never constrains tactics, so environment remains decorative rather than instrumental. Still, specificity is high and tone sustains mythic distance without cliché.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the child’s voice—is clear early. Pressure escalates by density, not causality: each paragraph thickens emotional weight until the hair glows. No visible price is exacted from the locksmith; the mother’s tear is consequence, not cost that reshapes later options. Tension is atmospheric, not acute—sufficient for the lyric mode but below the 8-band threshold that demands a trade-off.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as self-imprisonment vs. improbable liberation—emerges through image rather than lecture. Subtext in the ribbon’s rust-blood color and star-code is effective. Final paragraph drifts toward thematic assertion (“the only work worth doing”), a mild echo that keeps the score sub-8. Complexity is present: the secret is ordinary, not monstrous, resisting moral binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical maintains stable distance; diction is controlled, with rhythmic lift (“day hemorrhaged into night”). Perceptual signature is consistent—cosmic, patient, slightly archaic. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narration stays within its chosen register. One filter-verb cluster (“she understood… she had seen… she whispered”) softens immediacy but does not break pattern.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is sonorous but leans on stacked metaphors in high-pressure beats (“sky bruising purple and gold,” “cosmic possibility”). No loops or paraphrase; sentences vary in length and openers. Information density is good—each paragraph advances stake or atmosphere. A few modifier clusters (“enveloped secrets like precious wounds”) edge toward purple, keeping the score south of 8.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Mythic-healer trope is refreshed by focusing on conceptual locks rather than doors; the star-code hint and hair-map are inventive micro-mechanics. The child’s secret is anti-melodramatic—just a wish to be loved differently—which subverts trauma-expectation. Risk is moderate: lyric mythic mode rather than gritty realism. Not transformative enough for 8.5+ but avoids cliché and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
