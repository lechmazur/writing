<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—dutiful guardian vs. silenced dreamer—drives every beat; the final renunciation is earned by the prior causal chain and carries visible cost in her collapsing body and the astrolabe’s weight. Micro-choices (tracking, whispering release, settling to die) reveal a hierarchy of values without tidy epiphany. No stock phrasing; embodiment is vivid (“cold had long since settled into her marrow”). Meets 9- gate: contradiction acts in scene and cost is on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren’s refusal to continue—priced by her last breath joining the aurora—reconfigures the guardian role and releases her own trapped creativity. Accumulative lens holds: each meteor’s release deepens pattern until her own voice returns, tightening stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“beneath the aurora-lit archway”). Persistent constraint: the astrolabe’s impossible star-map literalizes cumulative displacement. Cost is legible in final exhalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The astrolabe functions as micro-setting: brass grows heavier, coordinates lock, final warming against palms—object state constrains the closing choice. Aurora-lit archway supplies spatial and spectral pressure; cold narrows perception to immediacies. Sensory hierarchy is dreamer-POV: celestial mechanics over earthbound comfort. Environment charges the last image as her breath becomes aurora light. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free trapped creativity—tightens once: Maren realizes her own visions are the final meteor. Accumulative escalation: density of released voices increases until her own unheard novel confronts her. No reversal needed; pattern break suffices. Cost is her life, visibly paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific accumulation: unmade art is cosmic debt that must be paid by someone’s lived time. Final image reweights premise—guardian’s death seeds her own art into the world—without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: “she heard them all” replaces explanatory statement. Resonance is non-literal, carried by breath-become-light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: astronomical diction (“sighting vanes, rete, celestial coordinates”) filtered through lunar-mad sensibility. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for vigil, fractured clauses at self-recognition. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as cold and revelation intensify. Lyric compression (“remembered stardust”) is taught early and paid off. Meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Metaphors are coherent: “golden sparks…like seeds” sustains agricultural reprise. No register drift; diction stays within dreamer’s lexicon. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with auroral motion. Closure line is unmarred by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses celestial mechanics with artistic afterlife—fresh angle on “unfinished art.” Astrolabe-as-key and guardian-self-sacrifice are non-obvious syntheses that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring stakes. Specificity of polar vigil prevents template drift.</comment>
