<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is evocative—her tactile ritual with the disc, the “copper and old rain” taste—but her motives stay thematic (“to teach endings how to begin”) rather than a contradiction she must negotiate under pressure; no visible cost or error is risked, so the renunciation feels pre-decided, not earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure is a lyric reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the switchboard’s next ring crystallizes her endless service with felt fatigue; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of grief-calls thickens until the final hum reweights her isolation. Orientation clean by 60 words. Persistent constraint (namelessness) shapes tactics; cost is the ongoing erasure of self—visible in the final “Hello” that loops back to the first line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subway alcove is sketched with serpent-cables and rain-taste; the brass booth and glass disc function as micro-setting that physically constrain every action—she cannot pace, cannot leave, must answer. Final image of the tunnel walls “absorbing their stories” recharges the copper-after-taste and makes the enclosure itself a resonating organ—setting directly charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining nameless estrangement while absorbing others’ grief—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each new caller layers echo-density until the final “Hello” tightens the loop around her own voice; no single tightening beat narrows options, so pressure accumulates rather than spikes. Cost is implicit in the inexhaustible queue; visible price (loss of self) is declared rather than dramatized in a decisive beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative pattern—wrong numbers as accidental ritual, loops as doors—without explicit thesis. Final image reframes prior grief-echoes as choral release rather than trap, achieving understated resonance. Avoids moralizing, but the insight remains conceptual; the girl’s line “I don’t even know your name” is the closest to thematic echo, softening the score slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Vera’s sensorium—metallic air, disc vibration—syntax lengthens during calls, shortens on hangs, mirroring fatigue. No dialogue tags intrude; caller voices arrive as disembodied subtext. “Melodically haunted” risks elevated diction but is anchored by the physical act of wetting her finger on glass, keeping idiom in body.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with call-and-response cadence; sentences tighten around the disc then relax into caller monologue. One scaffold: “She understood loops. They were her specialty…” restates what the scene already shows. Metaphors (serpent-cables, sleeping rain) stay consistent to tunnel ecology; no mixed vehicles. Filter-verb count low; information density high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—underground operator of obsolete grief-phone—is fresh, yet the psychic-service frame edges toward familiar literary magic. Specificity of brass booth + glass harmonica + copper air transforms trope into lived vocation. Final reprise of “Hello” as infinite threshold gives a sharp, inevitable inversion of connectivity-through-exile.</comment>
