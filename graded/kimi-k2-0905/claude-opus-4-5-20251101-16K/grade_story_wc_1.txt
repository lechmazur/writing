<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vera’s interior arc from frantic radiance to “luminous in ways that no fire could ever destroy” is viscerally embodied—scar tissue, frost-crystal fingertip, warm palm melting glass. The contradiction between her old need to burn bright and new capacity to wait is held alive in every micro-choice (walking smuggler routes at dawn, gathering frost-kissed stones). Renunciation of former identity carries clear cost: she forfeits acclaim, safety, even heat, signaled by deliberate melting of frost on the pane. Motivation stays tethered to specifics of canyon stillness; no therapy-speak, only patterned action retraining breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: “She would read them. She would wait. She would create.”—options reconfigured, cost felt in the still-melted frost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns, ledger routes, and glass shards layer until meaning reweights; final image crystallizes without causal fireworks. Orientation clean by line 4; causality intact—smuggler paper triggers canyon walks which trigger new art. Persistent constraint (scars, silence, future frost cycles) shapes tactics and lands with undeniable price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Canyon night, frost lattice, and weathered glass fragments are filtered through Vera’s glass-artist eye—hexagonal geometries noticed, lunar shadows read as negative space. These details constrain material choices (she gathers only frost-kissed stones) and charge the final image of melting ice rewriting itself. Spatial choreography remains steady: cottage window → mining path → alcove signaling points track cleanly. Environment acts—cold dictates wake-time, wind alters crystal growth—rather than decorating backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she survive meaningfully without blazing production?—tightens when frost study forces literal stillness and the ledger confronts her with historical endurance. One meaningful escalation: discovery of smuggler strip shifts her from passive healing to active, if quiet, creation (“Scorched Testament” series). Cost visible in forfeited city reputation and permanent scars. Agency remains hers; coincidence (arrest letter) complicates but doesn’t resolve; closure forecloses return to old pace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile oppositions—radiance vs. shadow, fire vs. frost, speed vs. pause—rather than exposition. Final image of warmth melting cold glass reweights “luminous” from public acclaim to private sufficiency. Subtext in ledger (others survived darkness) lets her reframe scars as text rather than shame. No moral stated; resonance lingers in cyclical frost that will rewrite itself tomorrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains glass-artist perceptual signature: fractal vision, color-as-light, attention to translucency. Rhythm modulates—long breath-like sentences in reflection, short clauses under dawn cold. No head-hopping; knowledge stays Vera-bound (“critics would later call…” reads as her anticipation). Distinct diction—“luminous glass artist,” “drifting resonance across the dark”—without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: frost study sentence packs meteorology, geometry, and emotional shift. Figurative language rarely stacked; when it appears (“silence pooled like water”) it’s brief, apt, and pays off in closure pool of melting. No loops or scaffold; transitions clean. Proofing flawless; pronoun clarity perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Survivor-artist trope refreshed through frost geology and smuggler marginalia, braided into literal “scorched testament” glass. Canyon-as-studio concept feels inevitable yet unclichéd. Specificity—lattice angles, lantern signaling alcoves—grounds novelty. Final synthesis of frost-ledger-glass offers fresh inflection on resilience theme.</comment>
