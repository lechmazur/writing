<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictions—wise yet self-effacing, risk-taking yet outwardly dotty—are dramatized through on-page micro-choices: touching the flame, altering stitches, choosing to embed truth in error. Interiority is specific and embodied; her decision to “save the kingdom” is credibly rooted in forty silent years of listening. The cost of exposure is latent, but her chosen disguise itself exacts a visible price: isolation, erasure, and the need to speak sideways. The only thing keeping the score from the 8-band is the absence of a clear reversal/test that proves her flaw can wound her on this very night; the plan is elegant, but we do not see it fail or nearly fail before the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira’s needle pauses over the silk, and the altered stellar map now exists as an irreversible act whose cost (treason if caught, kingdom lost if unread) is unmistakable. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: information and imagery accumulate until the final image re-weights meaning. Anchors—who/where/when—are conveyed within ~80 words and remain stable. The ending’s conceptual repricing (the sky itself rewritten as warning) is earned by every prior stitch. A hairline slip: “three nights hence” arrives late; a micro-stitch of tension could have appeared earlier, but it does not break the final resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Mira’s professional eye; only the dome slats, flame, and silk are lit. The cobalt-tiled dome, leaf-scrape acoustics, and unheated flame are tethered to action: the flame’s restless dance cues her decision; the echoing silence justifies whispered subversion. The astro-political rule-set (star-maps as coup messaging) is discovered through tactile craft rather than exposition. One minor spatial blur: no floor-plan clue whether scholars could re-enter mid-stitch, but this never distorts causality at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the coup—intensifies through pattern break: the commissioned chart requests an impossibility that would crown the Usurper. One micro-turn suffices: the shift from passive listening to active mis-stitching forecloses anonymity. Cost is visible: each displaced star is potential evidence of treason. Because the lens is Accumulative, escalation reads as density of stitched signs rather than because/therefore reversals; the Princess visit functions as the one tightening pivot that narrows all options to a single night.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth survives only when disguised—emerges entirely through Mira’s material acts: silver lies stitched into black heaven. No character articulates a thesis; the eternal flame’s blue light literalizes the idea that illumination can be cold and dangerous. Subtext operates in the silence between stitches; every “error” is a covert sentence. The ending image (Princess reading falsified stars) re-configures the entire premise without moralizing, achieving the 9-band quick test’s “non-literal answer.”</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate remains locked to Mira; idiom stays within an embroiderer’s lexicon (threads, frame, constellations). Syntax elongates during reverie, shortens during decision cadences (“Now she could think”). Perceptual signature—tiny displacements measured in millimeters—mirrors both her craft and her conspiratorial precision. The only dialogue imagined is the scholars’ laughter, rendered as reported sound, maintaining POV modesty. No head-hopping or register drift; voice coherence survives peak pressure.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: each sentence layers physical motion, sensory cue, and strategic intent. Metaphors (flame as river of possibility, leaves as whispered warnings) are spare and consistent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for star-maps, clipped fragments for stakes. No loops or scaffold; the one repeated stem “eternal flame” is motif-taught and reprices the ending. The final line trades on a single adjective-verb pairing (“whispered warnings…sighed through”) that compresses atmosphere without overwriting.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fresh angle—a palace coup encoded in embroidery—synthesizes spy craft with textile art. The astro-textile code is particular to this world; no tropes are borrowed wholesale. Stakes hinge on an elderly woman’s manual precision rather than martial heroics, flipping genre defaults. Transformation test: if you swap “embroiderer” for “scribe,” the entire fabric of heaven metaphor collapses. The execution commits fully—no explanatory footnote or safety exposition undercuts the risk. Minor proximity alert: “stars hide their youngest children” echoes familiar personification, but the governing idea (celestial maps as political messaging) feels non-obvious and integral.</question>
