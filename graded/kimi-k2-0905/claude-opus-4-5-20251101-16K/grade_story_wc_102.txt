<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is evocative—camera-as-perception, breathing-as-barometer—but her contradictory impulses stay lyrically asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The withheld-love wound is declared, not tested; no micro-choice risks failure or forfeiture, so the Knot-release feels prefabricated. Voice is specific; agency is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: love persists in blossoms, seen/not-seen inversion. Accumulative lens holds—density of floral vessels reweights stakes—but causality is atmospheric, not consequential; nothing is foreclosed for Maren except a loneliness already soothed. Cost is conceptual, not felt; the ending glows but does not hurt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct, wisteria, camera-obscura hood, jade against skin—each sensory layer is filtered through Maren’s synesthetic gaze and returns in the final shimmer. Space stays coherent; the blooms function as micro-setting that literally “hold” the re-valued love. Pinhole inversion and petal-light constrain the seeing-act, charging the CR image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is declared early; pressure accrues through descriptive density rather than narrowed options. No reversal or trade-off is forced; breathing deepens, jade warms, knowledge widens but costs nothing. Escalation is lyrical accumulation; under Accumulative lens this is acceptable, yet remains low-torque.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—love persists without recipient—emerges from floral image-system rather than assertion. Final reconfiguration is resonant, avoids moralizing, invites counter-readings. A hairline slip: “She understood now” edges toward epiphany-label, but is grounded in concrete sensory shift. Mostly earned, quietly haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays close, stable, perceptually specific: “the world made strange enough to finally see.” Sentence rhythm swells and recedes like breath, echoing method. No head-hop; diction remains within Maren’s artisan lexicon. One clause—“energy does not vanish, it transforms”—momentarily lectures, but voice quickly re-anchors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; figurative layering serves accumulation. Occasional surplus perfume—“purple curtains of bloom,” “bruised sky pooled”—but metaphors stay coherent. No loops, no scaffold, strong paragraph cut-test pass. Read-aloud rhythm modulates; near-miss on purple patches keeps it under 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise recycles “past-life memory” and “love stored in nature,” but inversion-via-camera-obscura and breath-attention method give fresher sensorial route. Floral archive image feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric essayistic SF—but execution centers perception, not gimmick. Synthesis is memorable if not wholly unprecedented.</comment>
