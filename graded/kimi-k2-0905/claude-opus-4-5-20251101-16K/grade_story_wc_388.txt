<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s skeptical patience is credible and consistent; the beat-level interiority is spare but shows a clear hierarchy of values. The renunciation at the end is earned—she packs the evidence away rather than expose the orchard—yet the emotional cost is only asserted, not embodied (no bodily register or micro-gesture), capping the score. Dialogue is minimal; Elka’s power shift lands through silence and touch, so status dynamics are legible. No contradictions in motive; competence balanced with genuine surprise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (dust wall, shredded strips, survey memos) tightens knowledge and forecloses Vera’s original exposé plan. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—she departs with the evidence but chooses silence; the cost (complicity in protecting the lie) is legible in the final image of dust rising behind her. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. One minor scaffold: “She began to intuit the shape of something larger” tells what the next strips already show. No causality breaks; escalation is steady and single-scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard-diamond-pillar triad is specific, tactile, and used: dust devils die at the fence line, instrumentation grooves reframed as sacred geometry. Electromagnetic stillpoint is learned through action (reassembling strips), not exposition dump. Micro-setting (body, lantern, shredded paper) constrains the investigation beat. Final image of dust rising against green trees recharges the opening anomaly with new conceptual weight, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. safety of the orchard—is signaled early and tightens once: exposure will bring “lawyers and journalists and government men.” Agency is present; Vera’s choice to withhold the report is a visible forfeiture of her lifelong ethic. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—her smile is gone, the dust reclaims the road. No escalation after the midpoint conversation; pressure plateaus rather than deepens further, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as commodity vs. truth as weapon; survivors weaponize myth to keep exploiters out. Subtext sits in Elka’s fingertip on the flaw—silent admission they already priced the cost. Final image reweights “comfortable lies” from sin to shield without moralizing. No thematic echo or platitude; ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s skeptical perceptual filter—strip widths, lantern glare, groove edges. Syntax is controlled, sentences lengthen slightly under analytic pressure, then clip at departure. No head-hopping; Elka’s interior is legible only through gesture and silence, respecting distance. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” thoughts stay within a journalist’s lexicon and read as inference, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, world rule, and character observation. No synonym loops or template cadences. Rhythm breathes—long investigative sentences contract into the final roadside image. One paraphrase loop (“they wouldn’t sue / they wouldn’t ask”) is purposeful rhetorical anaphora, not artifact. Clean grammar; pronouns stable; no figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corporate-stillpoint-as-myth is a fresh synthesis; inverse of usual“cover-up to hide magic” trope. Survivors’ deliberate self-mythologizing to thwart further extraction is a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk taken by letting the protagonist lose the ethical high ground without melodrama. Detail specificity (instrumentation grooves in concrete pillar) anchors the novelty.</comment>
