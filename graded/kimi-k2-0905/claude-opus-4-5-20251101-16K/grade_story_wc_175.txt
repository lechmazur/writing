<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s quietly obsessive care for extinct and vanishing species is rendered through tactile micro-choices—tying each knot, pocketing the Xerces wing, staying seated while the clouds close. Interior contradiction is present but muted; the “esoteric realist” label is asserted more than dramatized, so the highest band is just out of reach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accretive lyric pattern (building → waiting → watching) tightens around the absent monarchs; the final image of the moth-wing “small blue flame” offers a Charged Poise that reweights the stake without sentimental payoff. Causality is interior and accumulative rather than event-driven, but the lens holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s aerial suspension and green-filtered light are re-used as filters for every perception; twig creaks and cloud shifts double as emotional barometer. Environment directly constrains the only possible action—building a signal that will be seen only by cloud-level passers-by—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake (will anything answer the signal?) is signaled early and tightens through each knot; cost is conceptual—the irrevocable loss of migration memory—rather than personal, keeping pressure coherent but slightly abstract. A sharper felt forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the juxtaposition of meticulous craft and unrecoverable loss; the interrupted cadence is shown, not named, in the silent non-arrival of monarchs. Final image reframes the earlier “small blue flame” as both memorial and futile beacon—earned Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains a hushed, moss-soft diction that never breaks POV knowledge; syntax elongates then shortens with dusk’s approach, mirroring Mira’s held breath. The voice is distinctive, disciplined, and perfectly scaled to the lyric-accumulative drive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Near-flawless line economy: every sentence advances image or stakes; zero scaffold or synonym loops; figuratives are spare yet precise (“blushing stillness”). The only micro-slip is the double use of “embarrassed” for the grotto’s quiet—just enough repetition to stay beneath 9.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing extinct-species grief with cloud-garden signal architecture feels fresh; the story’s risk is its quiet refusal of event, trusting accretion and final optic reverberation. Transformation is complete—genericizing any detail would collapse the whole.</comment>
