<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular—“pain they hadn’t felt in millennia”—and the boredom-erosion metaphor is embodied. The single micro-choice (release the fragment) crystallizes the arc, but the absence of any second character keeps relationship/status bullets idle. Cost is legible: immortality foregone for the unknown. 9+ gate met: contradictory impulses (endure vs. exit) coexist in the final beat and are resolved by causal action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: amulet released, rift sealed, immortal gone. Causal lens holds: solar storm → mutiny → tear → step-through. Cost is visible in the shard falling and the escondite left “empty.” No orientation or telegraphing issues; pattern is taught by word 90.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prismatic walls, crystalline shards, and magnetic saturation are vivid, selective, and guide the final breach. Micro-setting (the body as sensor of EM chaos) constrains timing—“walls groan and shimmer.” Final image reuses the fractured light to echo completion. 9+ gate met: environment charges the last line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye?”—is signaled early and tightened once: the rift widens and exiting becomes possible. Escalation is causal under solar storm; no reversals needed. Visible price: immortal surrenders eternity. Agency drives the last step; coincidence only enables.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: immortality as exile, death as doorway. Subtext in “hushed thunder” reframes every prior farewell. Final image reweights boredom into peace without moralizing. No thematic echo or platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient sustains cosmic distance yet slips into sensorial intimacy—“cold as the void between stars.” Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks under storm pressure, then quiets for the step-through. No head-hop; lexical register remains within immortal’s antiquity. 9+ gate met: distinct perceptual signature and taught elision (“twelve thousand years” compressed to one clause) paid off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned—“dimensions stacked like pages”—and never muddles causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One hairline slip: “colors bled into one another” is minor cliché amid otherwise fresh imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Takes the trope of the jaded immortal and pivots it toward voluntary finitude. Spatial mutiny as a cosmic auroral breach feels non-obvious and inevitable after setup. Risk in lyric abstraction pays off: the ending image could not be swapped out. Synthesis of hard-SF flare and metaphysical quiet is fresh.</comment>
