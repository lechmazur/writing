<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt, methodical nature, and need for self-forgiveness are anchored in concrete memories and objects; the accordion bellows and graffiti lines act as embodied triggers that tilt her present stance. The final decision to “carry her guilt differently” is credibly prepared by the station’s ruin and the remembered phone call. Interiority stays specific to her river-chronicler lens, avoiding diagnostic clichés. A hairline slip: “raw but present” skirts label-speak yet is earned by the prior sentence’s fog image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses the option of medicated forgetting and chooses to “walk the distance” of forgiveness; the cost is the raw guilt she must now carry. The causal chain—bathroom graffiti → re-copying phrases → re-framing guilt → walking toward the next river—tightens once and is irreversible. The inferred lens is Causal; each beat alters her available tactics. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is filtered through Maren’s professional eye: “something between ruin and garden,” a lived-in micro-setting that mirrors her internal state. Light through the collapsed roof and the draft that stirs the bellows are sensory details that later charge the final image. The bathroom graffiti strata provide tactile, geological specificity. The bellows function as micro-setting/object and constrain her final choice to leave whole yet burdened.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—faces one meaningful tightening when graffiti reframes guilt as a map she must still walk. The price is immediate: she gives up the numbing safety of pills and accepts ongoing pain. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict. The escalation is single but sufficient for 750-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through water metaphors that reweight guilt: rivers don’t fight rock, they “continue, patient and persistent.” The final image of sediment settling to riverbed offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext resides in the father’s oblique phone line and the taped bellows—repair without restoration. No thematic echo penalties; graffiti wisdom is framed as found text, not authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual signature: map references, watershed vocabulary, riverine metaphors. Syntax breathes with her recalibrating body: short clauses after the pill cessation mirror shaky hands. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Register remains within her chronicler lexicon without drifting into textbook diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high information density: “Sunlight filtered through gaps in the collapsed roof, illuminating dust motes that swam like river sediment” does triple sensory and metaphorical work. Rhythm modulates from longer reflective sentences to clipped present-tense choices. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-template run—“She had… She had… She had…”—is brief and pattern-earned, not penalized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-work terrain is refreshed by the river-chronicler profession, accordion-lung image, and graffiti-as-map device. The synthesis of hydrology metaphors with bereavement feels specific to this voice rather than interchangeable. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany in ruin—but execution is precise and committed. No derivative-premise guardrail triggered.</comment>
