<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vera’s split-consciousness is viscerally embodied—brass pistons vs. weathered creel memory—and the acceptance of contradiction lands as a lived stance. Still, the moment of highest pressure (pouring bronze) repeats prior beats without deepening stakes; the internal contradiction never forces a costlier micro-choice. Closure is quiet endurance, but the cost feels atmospheric rather than personal. For 700 words, enough contradiction is on-page, yet the final beat re-states rather than tests her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the warm tags dropped into the creel re-anchor future selves, reconfiguring continuity after tomorrow’s erasure; cost is felt as perpetual migration. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—tide, moon, melt-cycle—each loop adding density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is swift; “tomorrow disappeared” taught by line 3. One minor causal skip: why tonight’s smelt matters more than yesterday’s is asserted, not differentiated, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tidal atrium is not backdrop but engine: grates dictate shelf access, brine films every surface, moonlight turns water to amber—each sensory hit filters through POV priorities (catalog order vs. Marsh’s fish-glint wonder). Brass exoskeleton, furnace heat, and drying salt trace body-in-space with coherent choreography. The bamboo creel serves as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Slight over-glitter in “volumes rose like dreaming things,” but image is earned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve continuity of self and library when linear time is gone. Escalation is accretive: tide lifts books, moon dilutes identity, bronze must be remade—each cycle tightening the loop of endless upkeep. No single reversal, but the ritual’s necessity deepens as “tomorrow” stays blank. The final filing of warm tags is a micro-renunciation that forecloses rest; price is legible, if quiet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as maintenance against entropy emerges through concrete cycles—smelt, tide, moon—never slogan. Final image of creel-as-archive reweights earlier “captured stars” memory: continuity is the fish that stays silver. Contradiction accepted becomes praxis, not maxim. Subtext flirts with wider loss yet keeps focus on librarian’s stance, sustaining ambiguity without drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice fuses brass-and-salt lexicons: “pistons exhaling steam that mingled with the brine” is perceptually specific; syntax lengthens under Vera’s method, shortens when Marsh surfaces. Third-quarter moon grants blended idiom without head-hop. Rhythm modulates—clause-heavy for cataloguing, clipped for tide rush—yet stays coherent. One clause overload (“architect of memory and order”) barely nicks propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet agile; most sentences carry double duty (action + salt-metal imagery). No loops, only one near-scaffold (“solid became liquid became solid”) that reads as taught pattern payoff. Metaphors stay physical—no mixed vehicles. Minor: “wintersun” as adjective/noun shift could feel mannered, but cadence supports exhale at closure. High band, not flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Folding post-tomorrow time into a tidal library maintained by a moon-schizophrenic librarian in steampunk fishing gear feels genuinely new, yet grows from integrated world rules rather than ornament. Risk of over-rich concept is balanced by anchoring every abstraction in sensory work (smelting, shelving, creel filing). Transformation test: swap any detail and the emotional engine collapses. Not quite 9+ because premise dazzle slightly outruns the on-page stakes.</comment>
