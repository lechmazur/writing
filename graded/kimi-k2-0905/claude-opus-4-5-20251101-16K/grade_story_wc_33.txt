<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emil’s contradictory impulses—exact courier vs. clandestine bridge-builder—are cleanly dramatized in the silent envelope swap and the decision to carry Sara’s photo; the embodied weight of “thunderstorm in a bottle” against the paper-thin photograph shows cost. Interiority occasionally drifts toward thematic summary (“healing happened differently…”) that blunts immediacy, and the absent daughter is referenced more than she pressures present choice, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: twilight window → drone recharge → EMP canister → crossing; the photograph hand-off is a Decisive Change that locks Emil into tomorrow’s risk. Orientation is swift (arcade, twilight, bench by line 4) and the ending lands Earned Stasis—“the sky belonged to promises kept”—with felt cost of perpetual danger. One micro-loop: “He’d started…he’d stopped believing” states the same shift twice without new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade’s light-confusing tiles and broken clock are re-used as tactical assets, not scenery; twilight hue literally blinds drones, binding setting to stakes. Sensory triage—glow, hush, weight of coat—mirrors Emil’s narrowed attention. The EMP canister as micro-setting satisfies the constraint gate, charging the final image of a sky temporarily his.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reuniting separated families—tightens when Sara’s photograph replaces abstract “missing”; the 30-second drone blackout narrows options to one perilous crossing. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: information received → commitment sealed. Cost is legible in the bottle’s weight and the “brittle hush” he must maintain; still, the immediacy of physical jeopardy is deferred to tomorrow, capping intensity just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through absences made tangible—gaps in return addresses, gaps in teeth—until the final inversion: the empty sky becomes a space of promise kept. Subtext in silent hand-off and “words traveled wrong” refrains from overt thesis. The last line reweights the cobalt glow from beauty to tactical sanctuary without moralizing, achieving resonant CR.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Emil’s sensory filter: columns “held” light, satchel “weighed,” photograph “slipped.” Syntax lengthens in reflective passages, compresses during drone pass—“They both went still”—mirroring risk. No dialogue keeps voice pure; diction remains within a mailman’s lexicon except one lapse: “conceptual repricing” of borders feels academic and external.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from lyrical cadence (“glowing like a portal”) to clipped tactical beats (“Fifteen minutes. That was his window.”). Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors obscure causality. Occasional scaffold: “delivered every official letter with precision, filed every form, maintained every protocol” stacks parallel phrases without deepening pressure, a minor loop preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “disputed territory mailman” reframes a classic smuggler trope through bureaucratic precision, making paperwork the smuggling route. Linking absences into a living map is a fresh operational twist; the EMP “thunderstorm” bottled like a souvenir crystallizes the speculative edge. Narrative risk—silence as policy, twilight as weapon—pays off in a closing image that feels inevitable yet unwritten by any precursor.</comment>
