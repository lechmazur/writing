<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mira’s contradictory pull—running from her calling yet staying to teach—registers in embodied micro-choices (offering her scarred wrist, deliberate breathing). The final renunciation of solitude is earned through the girl’s arrival and Mira’s remembered cost. Minor slip: “tender shadow keeper” is label-speak delivered at the threshold of the beat, not dramatized first.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira accepts the threshold will remain permeable, cost felt in the ring twist and the promise to burn another bridge tomorrow. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—starlit ash imagery thickens until the final shared breath reweights solitude into guardianship. Causal logic intact: girl’s arrival → scar reveal → stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Charcoal pews, brass doorknocker, ash suspended in starlight—each tactile detail is filtered through Mira’s loss-attuned eye and constrains her decision to stay. Micro-setting of the ruined chapel functions as crucible; the ring’s glint against ash supplies the final charged image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve solitude vs. heal seekers—tightens when the girl’s arrival makes retreat impossible. One meaningful deepening: Mira realizes the door “works both ways,” foreclosing permanent isolation. Cost is visible: she will send the girl away tomorrow yet remain exposed to further crossings. Slight reserve: escalation is single-note, no secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from ash-and-star imagery: sanctuary built on absence can become space for shared breath. Subtext operates in silence and ring-glint rather than thesis lines. Final image of “stubborn and holy” breath resists moralizing, offering resonant reconfiguration. Avoids explicit “shadow keeper” echo at end, letting gesture speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, controlled third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder; perceptual signature is grief-sharpened noticing (blackened limbs “reaching toward indifferent stars”). Compression—“loaded emptiness,” “drowning in air”—is pattern-taught early and paid off in final cadence. No head-hop; psychic distance clean. Filter verbs serve elegiac rhythm, not clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors breath cycles: long ash-laden clauses slow, then shorten into “Linking through scars.” No mixed metaphors; charcoaled trees / starlight / ring glint share burnt-light motif. High density: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, interior, symbol). One paraphrase loop—“the suffocation / the drowning in air”—minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar wounded-healer trope is refreshed by inverse sanctuary: healer stays in ruin while pilgrims leave healed. “Doorknocker ring” as portable threshold is specific, non-obvious object-choice. Conceptual risk—static scene in ash—pays off via lyric accumulation rather than plot twists. Slight deduction for recognizable burnout-hermit arc.</comment>
