<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—gloved secrecy, phosphor-stained fingers, the ember-need to “teach dust to tell stories”—and every beat of the broadcast ritual is tethered to that need. No contradictory impulse is staged *in scene*; risk is named but not felt as a live tension inside the singing moment. Closure earns stoic endurance, but the choice to transmit arrives pre-decided, so the final cost reads as confirmation rather than fresh crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: purge → covert encoding → glow-ink → pirate song → listener transcription. Orientation is swift (ember alcove, third-night clock, mist patrol window); shortwave frequency search supplies the tightening beat. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the glowing ash image reweights “dust” from residue to text, and the price—eventual capture—is legible in the patrol-silence counter-weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alcove’s coal-lined mouth, orange sparks vanishing into grey, and the glove-hidden luminosity of Maren’s hands give tactile constraint—every tool doubles as potential evidence. Mist as “curious beast” externalizes breath-scale tension; the shortwave dial’s amber pool becomes a second hearth, guiding micro-motions. Final ash drift revises setting into scripture—dust literally illuminated—so environment charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will tonight’s broadcast continue the story-line?”—tightens when mist thickness opens the transmission window, then narrows again with the unspoken patrol threat. One visible trade-off: ungloving her radioactive fingers inside the alcove increases detection risk to keep ink fluent. The escalation is single-cycle, but the stance crystallizes: she will keep singing even as silence “holds its breath” against her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely—stories as seeds of dissent, music as mnemonic smuggling, dust as palimpsest—without once moralizing. The refrain “teaching dust to tell stories” evolves from private mantra to broadcast ontology, re-weighted when ash becomes visible text. No tidy maxim is offered; the ending’s irony is that the regime hears only “harmless” folk air while the populace re-assembles its mythic skeleton.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual filter—attention flicks from ember crackle to shortwave glow to phosphor-green cuticles. Syntax lengthens under risk, then compresses into liturgical cadence for the broadcast: “a girl who loved the sea, a king who learned tenderness…” No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter; lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the sung code.</comment>

<comment>Prose is textured yet economical: “banked coals kept the mist at bay and her ink from freezing” performs two world-rules in one clause. Figurative layer is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no purple drift. Occasional adjectival padding (“endless grey,” “stubborn warmth”) is minor loop-scaffold but never clouds causality or dulls the final ash-image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Story famine” as state decree, score-as-cipher, and glow-ink made of cave lichen synthesize fresh angles on resistance-through-art. Pirate radio via encoded lullabies feels inevitable yet uncopied. Risk lies in the lyric-static balance: withholding literal patrol confrontation could feel safe, but the piece chooses atmospheric over explicit jeopardy—a justifiable gamble that keeps voice primary.</comment>
