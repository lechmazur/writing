<comment>Mira’s vocation and exile are cleanly linked; the trumpet valve keeps loss tactile; interiority (“learned to read absences like text”) is sharp and specific. Yet the piece stays in summary mode—no single on-page scene forces her to choose under time pressure—so we witness rather than feel the cost. The final stance is earned, but the emotional peak is reported, not dramatized, blunting the necessary contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each vision/interval adds density until the missing pardon coalesces; the final “knowledge that even the erased leave traces” reweights earlier fragments with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; transitions (gangway → archive → harbor edge) are legible. One causal bump: the letter that ends exile is a bald trigger, never given motive or sender—luck, not linkage—but it precedes the main action and doesn’t undercut the closure cadence.</comment>

<comment>Harbor stone, salt-stained paper, and corroded brass recur with POV-filtered specificity; rain-cleansed marble at start and end forms a charged bracket. Space stays coherent; micro-setting (desk, crate pile, slick dock) steers her slow pace. The trumpet valve satisfies the 9+ constraint: handled early, pondered mid-story, and reprised in the final paragraph to crystallize the theme of persistent echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“restore erased voices”—is signaled early; each interval escalates by widening the circle of descendants who must absorb the truth. No antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological: the archive’s decay plus migraine cost tightens options. One decisive tightening: locating the mass-pardon document that rewrites lineage; cost is the ongoing bodily toll, acknowledged but not sharpened in a single beat. Enough for the band, yet a live confrontation (a skeptical official, a physical threat) could have forced a costlier choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“a people without records is a people without roots”—emerges through concrete restorations and communal reactions, never sermonizing. Subtext lives in what remains unsaid: the council’s absence, the ungrieved prisoners, Grandmother’s silenced brass. Final image of rain preparing stone “for whatever marks tomorrow will bring” offers a conceptual repricing that reweights all prior absence-work. Only the letter’s unexplained arrival keeps this from full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Mira’s salt-logged perceptions; diction (“water-stained,” “warped edges,” “gray-green”) is vocational and particular. Rhythm lengthens in calmer archive beats, compresses at vision-onset; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness is measured through perceptual signature—passes. Occasional lyric uplift (“gleamed like bone”) momentarily lifts register above her practical idiom but stays within reflective beats, not peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-rich, loop-free; sentences advance both atmosphere and information (“She charted the empty spaces, mapped the silences”). Metaphors are spare and coherent (bone-like stone, trumpet as echo). No scaffolding, no synonym churn. A single mixed move—“the work did not merely inform. It began to hearten”—abstracts what we already see; minor, non-recurring, and outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ocean-spray archivist + reactive visions is a fresh vocational fusion; treating archival absence as a literal sea to navigate gives the concept bite. The mass-pardon reveal feels inevitable yet not obvious in hindsight. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric resolution rather than set-piece—but coherent. Missing half-point: the exile-return frame is familiar and the anonymous recall letter is a safe trigger; a more originated inciting mechanism could have pushed higher.</comment>
