<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory reflex—quipping to deflect intimacy—shows in every beat; the moon-rock gift, the circle-offering, and her final stay all spring from the same causal thread. Interiority stays embodied ("grinning desperately") rather than diagnostic. The earned renunciation of flight lands with visible social cost: she forfeits her mythic autonomy in front of the witnesses she once outran.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: placing the lunar fragment on the platform reconfigures her identity from runner to anchor, cost paid in the forfeiture of anonymity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each testimony adds weight until pattern breaks with her deliberate stillness. Orientation is clear by line 60; no teleporting props; stakes tighten via the accumulating debt of gratitude she finally accepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ivy-strangled station functions micro-setting: living vines, swallow nests, and fairy-light tangles constrain gathering choreography and mirror entanglement. Moon rock in pocket exerts tactile pressure against thigh across beats. Sensory triage (moss-soft platform, echoing swallow wings) filters through Mira’s disaster-trained eye, sharpening atmosphere without catalogue drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape vs. acceptance of reciprocal bond—emerges in paragraph 3 and tightens when testimonies foreclose anonymity; each thank-you narrows exit routes. Agency is hers: she chooses to place the rock and remain, forfeiting mobility myth. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges through iterated soup/rock/song exchanges, never abstract assertion. Final image reframes prior jokes as communal glue rather than deflection—resonant without moralizing. The moon rock’s passage from astronaut to circle reweights its meaning from cosmic distance to earthly mutual grip, supplying conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; diction ("logistician of the impossible") carries Mira’s weary humor. Syntax modulates—long fugue-like sentence for rumor chain vs clipped final line "and stayed" to mark cessation. No head-hopping; free indirect blends cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with strategic sentence variation; high information density—each sentence advances rumor, setting, or pressure. No mixed metaphors or filler loops. Only minor scaffold: slight over-signature of "improbable chain/whisper" phrasing two beats apart, not enough to dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The Quartermaster myth retold as accumulative gratitude trap feels fresh; rumor logistics replacing plot coincidence is inventive. Moon rock used as social anchor rather than emblem of wonder reverses expected symbolism. Ivy-eaten station as mutual-aid commons converts ruin into resource, specific to this narrative spine.</comment>
