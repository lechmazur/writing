<comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and emotionally specific—her contradictory impulses (scientific detachment vs. romantic ache) collide in the same beat, notably when she kneels and feels the columella curl warm against her throat. The final gift of the pocket-sun to Cass is a credible renunciation that costs her the artifact she chased for seven years, paying off the flaw-driven arc. Secondary pressure from Cass is present but light; the status pivot is more hinted than staged. One hairline slip: “scientifically romantic” recycles as a self-diagnostic label mid-climax, slightly softening embodiment under peak pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira hands over the pocket-sun, crystallizing the new rule that presence is shared, not captured, with the felt cost of forever relinquishing her masterpiece. The causal lens is steady—because she returns differently, the ember nexus responds differently, therefore the alchemical grammar rewrites. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and remain stable. No teleporting props; the columella curl’s state is tracked across every appearance. The final image reweights all prior failure without explanatory filler.</comment>

<comment>The ember nexus is not backdrop but active crucible: its threads literally curl toward Mira’s palms, constraining her gesture timing and supplying the raw material for the final orb. Micro-setting (nautilus shell) doubles as tool and moral compass; its golden-ratio spiral shapes the crystallized vessel, charging the closure image. Twilight is more than mood—its deepening signals the narrowing window for alchemical success, forcing the last delicate transfer. Spatial choreography remains clean across kneeling, palm-cradling, and hand-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“can she forge a pocket-sun without repeating the catastrophic collapse”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through one meaningful tightening: she must finish before full dark swallows the ember threads. Agency is continuous; every density adjustment is her deliberate micro-choice under live pressure. Cost is visible on-page: the completed orb is immediately relinquished, foreclosing her original goal of possession. The lens stays causal; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without assertion: presence is not a substance to own but a relation to honor—demonstrated, not declared. The nautilus spiral’s “geometry’s love letter to time” reprises at the end as the literal architecture of the orb, reweighting the motif from sentimental keepsake to functional moral design. Subtext in Cass’s whispered four-word secret carries the emotional after-effect, letting the reader feel the unsaid years of waiting. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line is an image of shared luminescence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: precise alchemical diction (“density of presence,” “crystallized intention”) yet shot through with sensory twilight. Perceptual signature is Mira-specific—she sees formulas in hearth-smoke and feels ratios against her sternum. Rhythm modulates: longer, breath-held sentences during the orb’s final settling; staccato fragments when ember threads flicker. No head-hopping; Cass’s interior is implied only through gesture and whisper, maintaining clean single-focalizer distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Figurative language is internally coherent—ember threads as “curious creatures” mirrors the later crystallized orb as “small defiance,” both living light. No mixed metaphors; nautilus spiral sustains physical and thematic logic. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the alchemical tempo: tightening sentences mirror the orb’s contraction, then release into the open final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.5</question>
<comment>The pocket-sun alchemist conceit is fresh, but the deeper originality lies in treating failed art as a relational problem rather than a technical one. Returning differently as a narrative engine is rare in flash fiction and is here executed with causal rigor. The nautilus-columella object could feel quirky yet becomes structurally indispensable—its spiral literally shapes the orb—avoiding ornamental novelty. Risk is moderate: lyric compression plus alchemical world-building, but coherence never wavers.</comment>
