<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas’s interior contradiction—protocol vs. involuntary memory—surfaces early and charges the prophecy beat. The embodied shift from archival precision to trance-speaking is dramatized, not labeled. Cost is legible: he forfeits professional safety and accepts “second skin” dread. Could push higher if childhood memory altered present tactics before the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: orchard now active witness, scribe bound to write a debt he didn’t choose. Causal chain intact: cylinder peel → involuntary immersion → unsanctioned prophecy → sound suppression protocol. One transition (ground-orchard memory to present rooftop) is legible. Cost on page: “not his to control.” No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Apples that taste of salt air” and root-web through engineered soil compress world-rules into two lines. The rooftop orchard constrains the final image—trees wait while city holds breath—charging closure. Micro-setting (wax shaving pressed to forehead) functions as tactile anchor. Visual, gustatory, haptic details filtered through archivist’s selective attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent prophecy contamination—signaled when foghorn silence tips protocol. Tightening occurs once: protocol breached, external sound suppressed, path foreclosed. Agency is renunciation; he writes the debt rather than resist. Cost visible (“second skin”), but escalation is single-pulse; no secondary tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges: uttered words birth unpayable debts. Subtext carried in object-shift—shaving curls tighter after speaking, orchard “waits.” No moralizing; final image reweights earlier “forgotten seasons” line. Could edge higher if emotional-pattern vocation had been more explicitly jeopardized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Silas’s perceptual bias—gnarled roots, velvet syllables, salt-fruit taste. Syntactic rhythm mirrors compulsion: long humid clauses yield to fragmentary prophecy. No head-hop; Sumerian line reads as possession, not author stunt. Register consistent with erudite archivist until trance-level compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence variation strong; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density high but patterned—amber/shadow, velvet/second skin—taught early and reprised at closure. One scaffold risk: “wax cylinder phonograph shaving” could be trimmed to “wax shaving” after intro. Otherwise clean, propulsive, information-dense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusing rooftop orchard, emotional-residue archiving, and accidental prophecy feels fresh; each axis needs the others. Wax shaving as memory catalyst flips standard found-footage trope. Risky Sumerian outburst is prepared by linguistic conduit setup. Not quite 9 because concept could still transplant to another techno-mythic city with minor re-skin.</comment>
