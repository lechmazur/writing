<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet, watchful interiority is convincingly embodied—her choice to kneel rather than run, her hand tightening on the key, her surprise at being trusted. The moment she realizes the Archivist always saw her value lands with credible cost: she accepts irrevocable responsibility. No secondary character applies pressure on-page, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A. Micro-choices (handing out drives like sacred texts) externalize her hierarchy of values with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s self-concept flips from overlooked to indispensable, and the lagoon tableau crystallizes the new network. Causality holds—every beat (puddle map, key, booth, arrival of survivors) is seeded and paid off. One transition (street → lagoon) is legible under situational lens; pressure coheres throughout. Cost is felt in the final image: they split into “separate shadows,” each now permanently endangering themselves to remember.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Amber light bled across wet streets,” “auric lagoon,” and shattered booth glass are precise, selective, and filtered through Mira’s scavenger eye. The lagoon’s mineral-gold surface literally mirrors both sky and memory, constraining the final distribution of drives—its reflective surface doubles the stakes. Spatial choreography stays clean: alley → puddle → southeast → quarry edge. No props or geography teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unrevised truth—tightens when safe houses vanish and three leaders disappear; each loss shrinks Mira’s options. The puddle-map reversal is a micro-turn that forces a single, visible choice: trust the ephemeral code and walk to the lagoon. Agency stays with Mira; coincidence merely reveals, never rescues. Final cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity and accepts lifelong vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogan: memory as resistance to curated indifference. The Pacific Bell key and gold lagoon reprice “obsolete” infrastructure as living circuitry of dissent. Final image—starlit water rippling as carriers scatter—offers non-literal answer: remembrance is fluid, replicated, never safe. No overt thesis statement; emotional aftereffect is concrete, bittersweet, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: “dying sunlight caught the water… she saw the old waterfront district inverted.” Syntax grows slightly more lyrical under starlight, mirroring the lagoon’s shimmer, but never loses clarity. No dialogue on page, so voice distinction N/A. Register remains within her plausible lexicon—no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic: “She didn’t run; runners attracted attention.” Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no stacked metaphors muddle peak beats. One template-cadence run (“The Directorate would keep… She would keep…”) is voice-motivated, mirrors mantra resolve. No synonym churn or paraphrase loops; information density high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: obsolete phone-company infrastructure repurposed as a clandestine archive—an elegant synthesis of retro-tech and dissent. Puddle-reflection cipher feels novel yet inevitable in hindsight. Tyranny-through-amnesia is familiar, but grounding it in a defunct Pacific Bell key and auric lagoon gives local specificity. Risk stays narrative, not structural; transformation test passes—swap details and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
