<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—duty to the docks vs. the ache for water—are embodied early and re-appear in every micro-gesture; the final shedding of boots/apron crystallizes a legible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“anchor chains” weight, not abstract guilt). Yet the instant self-diagnosis “her true nature was not human” is too tidy a reveal, not earned by prior on-page cues, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: she swims toward the translucent island, leaving behind human armor; the workers’ lighter grief shows undeniable conceptual cost. Causal spine holds—scrimshaw warmth → whale call → island shimmer → decision to detach. Back-story paragraphs are anchored to tactile cues (bone pulsing, kelp underfoot) and tilt the present stance, meeting BRR rules. One minor nick: pirate Vessels’ dying line is recounted, not dramatized, so the causal spark is second-hand rather than witnessed, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Salthollow docks and the sublittoral fringe are sketched with selective sensory economy—kelp, crate-heft, brine—filtering through Mira’s body-centric attention. The micro-setting of the scrimshaw against her sternum functions as a tactile anchor that later glows, satisfying the “tool/object constrains choice” test. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single wade-out sequence. No environment detail is over-toured; each image bends back to her weight/relief polarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging vs. vanishing—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the whale call forces a now-or-never choice. The single deepening beat (island appears, she undresses layer by layer) visibly forecloses the dock life with felt social cost (Henrik/Suti grief). Pressure is accumulative rather than reversals-driven: each confessional story she carries adds mass until detachment becomes the only breathable option. Cost is legible; could hit 8.8 if a mid-scene complication had further tested her resolve instead of proceeding smoothly to exit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-as-freedom emerges through concrete pattern: every donated pain literalizes as “anchor chains,” reversed when she drops physical armor. Final image reweights earlier combat/tenderness binary—violence impossible only after she stops resisting her own nature. No moralizing line tells the thesis; implication is carried by workers’ inexplicable lightness after she leaves. A hair more ambiguity could push higher, but the resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—sound of crates “like dancing,” whale note vibrating bone—creating rhythmic, marine-tinged diction without overwriting. Syntax lengthens and liquefies in the exit paragraph, mirroring fluid movement; earlier sentences carry dock-edge grit. One micro head-hop (“Henrik swore he felt lighter”) is acceptable at closure distance for collective resonance. Distinct narrative texture supports the climax without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “tenderness crept into her chest like something wounded seeking shelter” performs three jobs—metaphor, emotional state, spatial entry—in twelve words. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; cadence modulates with scene temperature. Occasional poetic uplift (“impossible and undeniable”) is earned by prior grounded specificity and does not clot momentum. Line-level control sustains urgency through the final swim-out.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Found-family longshore folk + selkie-esque return to disappearing island” is familiar DNA, but the piece freshens it through accumulative pain-cargo and the inverse mermaid arc—shedding human posture rather than gaining tail. Whale-generated threshold island and bone-map scrimshaw supply tactile specificity not seen in template versions. The risk of quiet, non-violent departure is fully committed to, avoiding easy spectacle. Not radically novel, yet specific detail makes the synthesis feel inevitable rather than borrowed.</comment>
