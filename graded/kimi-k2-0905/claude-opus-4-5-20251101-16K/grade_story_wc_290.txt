<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature are named early and repeatedly, but only the claustrophobia is dramatized (tightening chest, breath-counting). The compass point functions as an effective inherited motive, yet her interior contradiction—explorer vs. fear—stays declarative; no moment shows her risking safety in a way that costs her an alternative path. The final image of her walking away with both artifacts lands as earned endurance, but the absence of a visible trade-off keeps the arc just shy of high-band integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: compass point → organ sequence → stabilized geometry → key retrieval → escape. Spatial-mutiny rule is taught by immediate distortion (walls breathe, corridors elongate) and paid off when the organ’s notes “transfix” the architecture, making the floor-open beat legible. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; time anchor (“one precious hour”) tightens urgency. Closure is a Charged Poise: she holds the key and compass, the church re-mutates behind her—cost is the perpetual exile her father paid and she now inherits. The slight reserve: causality never tests her proclaimed risk-loving side; the escape feels inevitable rather than a narrowed choice.</comment>

<comment>“Shadowed nexus under winter starlight” is immediate, atmospheric, and specific; starlight later silvering the stone and key crystallizes a recurrent visual motif. Spatial choreography is clean—five-road convergence, organ center, altar floor-slot—tracking her movement without drift. The church’s impossible geometry is shown through bodily effect (ceiling “simultaneously crushing downward and stretching upward”) rather than exposition. Micro-setting compass point in palm constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, but the village and roads remain generic, capping lift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the key before spatial mutiny consumes her—signals early and tightens when the organ stabilization gives “one precious hour.” Escalation is singular but effective: stabilized → floor opens → time expires → she runs. The price is implicit (perpetual endangerment, father’s death), yet on-page cost is only the church re-sealing; no tangible loss (injury, tool spent, social consequence) alters her future tactics. Still, agency is entirely hers, and the clock creates sufficient pressure under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited rebellion against secret-keeping architecture emerges through concretes: father’s letter, compass, crystallized sound key—never abstracted. Final image of her holding both metallic and sonic artifacts reweights “wistful rebellion” as bittersweet continuity rather than triumph. Subtextual echo—knowledge the ancients hid vs. parent-child transmission—lingers without sermon. No overt thesis statement, but the refrain “some rebellions were quiet things” edges toward echo; mild deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Maren’s perceptual filter: breath-counting, dust like “disturbed memories,” steel tip “worn from her father’s countless drawings.” Syntax elongates then shortens with spatial distortion and sprint exit, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on diction: “silver equations on stone,” “phosphorescent moss”—vivid yet controlled. One clause drifts toward editorial uplift (“desperate hope”), but overall texture remains character-specific and resonant.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long sensory sentences under spatial oppression, staccato clauses during escape. Information density high—each sentence layers setting, emotion, and causality (“The space felt immediately wrong—too deep, too angular…”). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay consistent (geometry singing, church as specimen). Minor overwrite: “silver equations” and “crystallized sound” straining, but both serve concept. Clean grammar, prop tracking, and final-line punch keep line craft solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The“spatial-mutiny church” is fresh dark-fantasy tech; crystallized-sound key and organ-as-tuning-fork are specific inventions, not stock relics. Father-daughter inheritance trope is re-angled through architect’s compass vs. sonic key, turning grief into world-scale activation. Risk taken: impossible geometry without explanatory science, but consistency and payoff reward the gamble. If names were swapped, the entire spatial-music mechanism would collapse—transformation test passed.</comment>
