<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gloves and isolation are vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the single beat of bare-hand contact forces change, yet the emotional contagion never complicates action on-page—no guard, no accidental brush—so the curse stays abstract and the cost feels pre-packaged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tide-pool pattern → pavilion → subsuming grief → lighter self. Orientation clean by 120 words; one shard, one transition (surface/underground), closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—gloves still on, fortress buried, taste of mercy in eggs. No causality break, though escalation is interior density, not external turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Coral ice, singing frost, and darkened stones are selective and POV-filtered; the kitchen micro-setting returns charged. Environment constrains only abstractly—no physical obstacle alters tactics—so 8.8 gate missed, but specificity and sensory hierarchy remain tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“sandpaper rough memories”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through accumulating grief density rather than external opposition. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marek’s own remorse is merged and dulled; cost is conceptual (permanent exile from direct touch) and legible in final glove flex. No visible resource lost, so band stops short of 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared human remorse emerges from sediment layers and taste, never sermonized. Final meal seasoned with “sturdy brittle hope” reweights earlier grief without moral; ambiguity lingers whether smoothed memories are mercy or erasure. No thematic echo or final thesis line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric, compressive third-person stays close to Marek’s sensory register; diction (“sea-rot,” “beach glass”) is chef-specific. Rhythm breathes with descent/ascension arc. No dialogue, no head-hop; filter verbs serve voice, not clutter. Distinct but not yet virtuosic under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances image or interiority. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and patterned; “copper and ash, sea-rot and spoiled fruit” is tight. Minimal hedges, strong verbs, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef + desert coral-ice pavilion + stored remorse fuses into non-obvious synthesis. Concept commits fully—grief as sediment, chef as emotional lapidary. Risky ice-in-desert is justified by antique mariner logic and never explained away. Specificity makes trope feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
