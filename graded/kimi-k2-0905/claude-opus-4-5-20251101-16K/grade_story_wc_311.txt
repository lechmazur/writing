<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reaper’s interior contradiction—duty to stay silent vs. need to speak Mira’s words—drives every beat; the embodied tremble of the atlas page against her ribs shows grief under pressure. Micro-choice to whisper “I miss you” crystallizes the arc and forecloses lifelong muteness with felt cost. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and alters her tactical goal for the next soul. Only the late-onset decision prevents outright renunciation from being dramatized in-scene, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: finding recordings → climbing observatory → playing voice → crystallizing fears → choosing to speak. Orientation anchored by word 70; the single night-scene transition sustains pressure. Closure lands as Decisive Change with cost—her vow of silence breaks on-page, audible to the reader. Persistent constraint (future souls will receive named fears) is legible in the last paragraph, satisfying cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Brass gears frozen in Mira’s last positions and prism-scattered starlight give tactile, site-specific anchors; the dome’s open mouth literally lets cosmic light shape the crystallization beat. Observatory functions as micro-setting that supplies the optical tool required for the climax, meeting the 9+ gate. Weather (dusk → night) is tracked without cliché and mirrors internal shift. Only the telescope’s absence feels like a missed tactical object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep silence vs. give names to dread—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when hearing Mira’s recorded plea. The midpoint crystallization makes the cost visible, forcing the final choice. Agency remains internal yet forecloses a two-century path, satisfying small-scale escalation. No external antagonist needed; pressure stays coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through paralleled cartography: naming sea-monsters = naming fears. The atlas page and recording supply concrete particulars; no abstract thesis is preached. Final reweighting—love as a fear that has been faced—earns resonance without sentimentality. The echo motif stays implicit, avoiding thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient keeps consistent psychic distance, modulating toward tight interior in the whisper line. Perceptual signature favors astronomical diction—“bruised purples,” “dying gold,” “light that had traveled impossible distances”—rooted in the reaper’s centuries of dusk vigils. No dialogue to test, yet narrative voice carries subtextual ache. One adverbial uplift (“impossibly present”) edges toward over-explication but survives under lyric license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses: long sentences for starlight reverie, fragment at whisper. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—“crystals caught the dying light, scattering it into fragments that danced across the curved walls” performs scene, theme, and foreshadowing. Only minor scaffold: “broken things could still function / broken things could still love” is deliberate parallelism that pays off conceptually, not a loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—reaper grieving mortal wife via astronomical relic—recombines familiar tropes, but crystallizing voice-waves into fear-shapes provides fresh speculative mechanics. Atlas page as naming technology links historic map monsters to psychopomp duty, giving specific cultural weight. Risk of sentimentality is accepted and survived through concrete staging. Could edge higher if the crystallization physics carried even one line of taught constraint.</comment>
