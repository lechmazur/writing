<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-shuttered gift and her need to rekindle joy are cleanly established; the fresco-touch acts as concrete cue that tilts her stance. Yet her interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“joy…something she’d have to keep creating”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; the cost is poetic but not dramatized on the body or choice—she simply paints. She earns a renunciation-of-despair, but the emotional price feels diffuse, not scalding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog-thickened orchard, relic fragments, and spreading light form a dense palimpsest that reweights Mira’s creative stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing fingertips and half-fading murals crystallize options with felt cost (“joy…fresh each day”). Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. One scaffold: “She painted for what felt like hours. Maybe days” is tell-ish compression that blurs elapsed tactics, but it doesn’t rupture the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pale Orchard’s fog-as-developer-fluid is vivid, selective, and directly metaphorized to exposed film; environment supplies both obstacle and medium for Mira’s light-painting. Micro-setting object—the pulsing fresco fragment—functions as portable node that charges final image in her pocket. Spatial choreography clean: collapsed wall → moss → rooted fragments → archway hollows. Weather never generic; it is the active developer. No occupational detail required. Slight over-egging: “trees had forgotten the sun” is poetic but not sensory; still, setting consistently constrains her luminous tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is creative resurrection; pressure accumulates as fog offers canvas and relics offer archive, deepening Mira’s obligation to re-light the district. No external antagonist; escalation is textural intensification—each fragment warms, each stroke holds on mist—until the final display flickers, narrowing her future to daily re-creation. Cost is poetic but not viscous: “joy…fresh each day” is conceptually sharp yet lacks tangible forfeiture on the page. Meets one meaningful tightening; qualifies for 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—art as iterative, luminous repair of communal memory—emerges imagistically through fog-film-developer metaphor rather than assertion. Subtext lives in silence of absent living peers and the orchard’s centuries-long wait. Final paragraph’s “echo of laughter” reweights earlier ghost-orchard vision without moralizing. Insight is earned, though the refrain about daily re-creation borders on overt thesis; kept just shy of sermon by lingering half-fade.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers close to Mira’s perceptions; diction (“light gathered…like water”) mirrors her chromatic synesthesia. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Rhythm modulates: long accumulation sentences for fog-dream, then shorter declaratives at exit—“She smiled…”—to mark stance crystallization. Rare filter-verb clusters (“she realized”) are acceptably spaced. Perceptual signature distinct: color-as-touch, fog-as-skin. Elision of clock-time is taught early and paid off in closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary; no template runs. Figurative layering is dense (“crystallized light,” “network spanning centuries”) but pattern-taught early and coherent to light-painting premise. One paraphrase loop: “She painted…the murals she created weren’t permanent—they flickered and shifted” restates prior sentence’s gist; costs –0.2. No simultaneity errors, no purple drift. Final line’s “waiting patiently to be remembered” is delicate, not sentimental, and lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fog-as-developer + orchard-as-exposed-film is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory-archive tropes. Light-painting hereditary gift is mythic yet grounded in tactile gesture. Ancient muralists seeding knowledge nodes reverses typical lost-utopia trope into collaborative time-bridge. Conceptual integrity holds: the world never breaks its photochemical logic. Risky lyric escalation succeeds because closure reweights the premise with visible cost—daily re-creation mandated. Transformation is specific: swap “paint” for “write” and the entire scaffold collapses.</comment>
