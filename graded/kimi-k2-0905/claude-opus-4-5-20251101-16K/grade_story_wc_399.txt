<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sev’s vocation as “line walker” is vividly particular—half-mask, porcelain vs. sun-dark skin, scar-textured memory loss—yet the interior contradiction between preservation duty and self-erasure stays mostly told. The single micro-choice (removing the mask) crystallizes Earned Stasis, but earlier beats summarize sacrifice rather than dramatize it; still, the cost is felt and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pavilion’s first silence in three millennia reweights every murmur into seed-form, Sev’s facial scars the visible price. Causal chain is intact—prophet’s footprints → parapet motion → clearing ritual → silence—tightened once through Sev’s calculation of “hours, perhaps less.” No orientation debt; lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the half-mask’s porcelain glare and the pavilion’s rippling fabric constrain every action—no face-touching, no direct gaze. Kinetic parapet rising “like teeth” provides the final image-charge. Sensory economy favors hush and grit over visual excess; spatial choreography clean in the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wisdom’s echo before decay—signals early and tightens once when parapet breach shrinks time to “hours, perhaps less.” Cost is conceptual but undeniable: Sev forfeits more memories, scars blooming under the mask. Agency is attention and endurance rather than external battle; sufficient for Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogan: preservation demands self-erasure, echo outlives echo-keeper. Final image of “satisfied quiet” reweights earlier murmurs as seed, not loss. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in who will next unlock the seed. Subtext carried in gesture—removing mask, tracing circle—rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-archaic yet controlled: “sideways knowing,” “kinetic parapet,” “whisperfield calm.” Syntax lengthens under ritual pressure, shortens at “hours, perhaps less.” Perceptual signature strong—Sev notices wind direction against dune logic, scar tissue itch under porcelain. No dialogue contamination; compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric murmur-sentences vs. clipped “It moves now.” Information density high—one sentence often salts the circle, names the parapet, and clocks the threat. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. Minor filter verbs (“Sev understood this through”) accepted as voice-motivated; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-loss cartography via half-mask, wisdom-as-echo stored in清空ings, kinetic parapet as time-breach guardian. Not a repurposed trope mash-up; specifics are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric stillness pays off—silence as climax—without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swap porcelain for cloth or parapet for wall and the tale collapses.</comment>
