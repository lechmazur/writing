<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present in the tension between Mei's outward calm as bonsai tutor and her internal search for apology-color; the micro-choosing to kneel, speak, and place the compass to her chest embodies the shift from searching to release. The severance and 3-year exile give the cost scale, but the mother's absence keeps the relationship crucible off-page, capping intimacy of pressure at 8.4.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Mei ends the search, forecloses the need for spoken apology, and the compass re-points to her heart—felt cost is the acceptance of wordless forgiveness. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated images (compass, lace, tide) deepen rather than cause, and the final bioluminescent diffusion reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (islet, post-rain, Mei alone). One scaffold: "cerulean" is used three times in close succession—minor, does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The islet’s post-rain micro-climate—juniper needles, salt breeze, bioluminescent cove— constrains the only possible ritual site and supplies the visual carrier for apology-color; the compass and lace function as portable "settings" that dictate her path. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch (warm compass) and视觉 glow at climax, mirroring internal narrowing to forgiveness. Spatial choreography is clean: garden → cottage → cove → kneeling at water. No environment detail stalls momentum; each is filtered through grief-attuned attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies— is signalled early; pressure tightens when decoded lace instruction forces her to act tonight under memory-tide conditions. The single meaningful turn is the act of diffusing words into glowing water—this narrows her options from endless search to embodied release and is visible on page. Cost is internal/relational: she accepts silence can suffice, losing the hope words could fix everything. Agency is present; coincidence merely enables glow, does not resolve conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: apology-color as predawn blue-violet, tides carrying memory, compass pointing heart-ward—no explicit thesis stated. Subtext lives in gesture (kneeling, pressing compass to chest) more than declaration. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing: apology needs no tongue, only diffusion. Emotional aftereffect is quiet acceptance rather than sentimentality; complexity (silence can both wound and heal) is preserved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is grief-filtered botanist—notice of juniper needles, bioluminescent algae, lace knots—never explanatory. Syntax tilts lyrical but stays within lexicon of a patient tutor: "rhythmically placid," "salt-clean scent." No dialogue, so voice contamination risk nil. Filter verbs minimal; only "watched," "noticed," "understood" and serve reflection beats without dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies: long contemplative sentences build texture, then shorten at climax—“I should have said I was sorry.”—to propel. Figurative language is selective: rain leaves islet "breathless and glistening," grief is "cerulean regret"; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold: "rhythmically placid" repeated verbatim in paras 1 & 6—minor, pattern-recognition rather than churn. Information density high: single sentences deliver inheritance, weather, profession, and emotional stance simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bonsai tutor + maritime ghost-compass + encoded lace instructions yields a non-oblique grief ritual. Tropes (ghost ship, bioluminescent tide) are grounded in specific family mythology and color-quest, not generic magic. Risk of preciousness is countered by concrete decoding work and bodily kneeling. Transformation test fails if Mei is renamed and moved to mountain lake—specific salt-air islet, ferry students, and nautical inheritance are inseparable from arc.</comment>
