<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s caretaker motive is vivid, but the boy arrives as a blank wonder-receptacle; his single spoken beat gives her no reciprocal pressure, so the relationship crucible never ignites and the “succor” action stays one-sided. Interiority is lush yet risks epiphanic overload (“raw, unfiltered gaze,” “wonder pouring from him”) without contradictory impulse to complicate her choice. Seed-gift closure is legible cost, yet the beat feels gentle rather than irreversible, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: thinning boundary → boy appears → harvest wonder → gift seed; each beat tightens options under the Causal lens. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the boy departs carrying concrete hope while Maren’s seed now contains his wonder—felt cost visible in “one more preserved color.” Orientation clean within 120 words; no lens drift; no telegraphing. Minor slack: no rebound constraint on Maren after the transfer, trimming the highest band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Threshold garden, waterfall mist, and grafted dreamwood anchor every beat; parapet stones and two-season apples physically constrain pruning choices, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory triage favors moss, silver water, golden light—each filtering through Maren’s gardener gaze. Spatial choreography keeps boy, waterfall, seed, and blossom in consistent reach across the single scene. Selective detail avoids tourist catalog while letting environment modulate internal awe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve wonder before gray world wins”—is signaled early and personified in the boy. One meaningful escalation: Maren decides to distill his live wonder, narrowing her ethical option (permanent extraction) with visible cost (“one more preserved color”). Pressure coherent; no reversal, but under short-form allowance one tightening suffices. Could edge higher had the boy resisted or the extraction left Maren with an immediate debility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image sequence: gray city drained of color ↔ luminous seed; no moralizing paragraph states the thesis. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing seed to blossom silences debate about whether wonder can survive technology. Final reprise of “radiant hush” reweights earlier utopian garden as fragile archive, not escapist paradise. Ambiguity lingers: will one tree matter? Complexity intact, no tidy maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual palette—horticultural verbs, chromatic adjectives—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calms, shortens at transfer beat, mirroring her controlled breath. Boy’s dialogue (“I followed the sound”) sounds eight, soaked, awestruck; diction cleanly beneath Maren’s elevated register. No filter-verb stacks; free indirect slips in “She must succor this child,” voice-aligned. Rhythmic control justifies lyric cadence without purple bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “weathered hands working the soil where moss met ancient stone” seeds age, vocation, liminality in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent (waterfall song, curtain of silver) and avoid incompatible vehicles. No paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts are lean. Minor hedge “upon the hush of budding hope” repeats header phrasing; still, momentum never stalls and closure line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fairy-tale orchard trope is retooled through botanical multiverse grafting and a pensioner-curator protagonist, generating fresh image grammar. Wonder-as-pigment extraction reframes familiar “save magic” plot into material conservation, making the speculative mechanic concrete. Specificity—moon-and-starlight blossoms, seven-generation seed—prevents generic fantasy pastiche. Risk resides in lyric compression; coherence survives, yielding genuine rather than gimmick innovation.</comment>
