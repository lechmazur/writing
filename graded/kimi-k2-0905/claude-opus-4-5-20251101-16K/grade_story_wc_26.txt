<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her perceptual bias as a “dusk noticer” filters every beat—but the grandmother’s off-page authority substitutes for her own contradictory impulse, softening the final choice’s cost. The river-stone beat (cool certainty → warm trust) embodies a micro-choice, yet the shadows’ hunger is accepted rather than tested against a lived flaw. Earned stasis lands, but the price feels inherited, not personally compounded.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira opens an unclaimed sphere, the shadow drinks, and the regret is conceptually repriced as stewardship rather than loss. Causal chain holds—comparison protocol → recognition of hope-theft → decision to guide, not destroy—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One tightening beat suffices; the final image crystallizes the new equilibrium with visible cost (“luminous and persistent” regret).</comment>

<comment>The Blooming Library is rendered through Mira’s professional gaze—paper flowers blooming/ wilting in time-lapse, crystalline spheres dimming—so setting constrains her tools and stakes. Spatial choreography is clean across the Remembrance Wing shift. The river stone micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate by charging the final image when placed on the desk as pledge. A few adjectival petals (“rose-tinted”) flirt with prettiness but never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve hope’s geometry—signals early and tightens once: comparison footage reveals shadows devouring the brightest futures, forcing Mira to renounce extermination. The price is legible (diminished spheres, regret), although the shift from observation to guardianship is a single inflection rather than a progressive vise. Agency is present and irreversible; luck plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and transformation: hope must be tended even as it changes shape. The river-stone and abandoned-sphere callbacks reprice the premise without moralizing. Final image of the shadow “like a faithful hound” offers ambiguous communion—neither victory nor defeat—inviting lingering interpretation. One near-tagline (“preserve the shape of hope”) is uttered but absorbed into Mira’s lineage, not the author’s sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mira’s sharp, dusk-attuned perception; sentences lengthen under wonder, tighten under choice. Metaphorical density (“shadows stretched like pulled taffy”) is patterned early and paid off at the drinking beat. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; diction remains within a trained archivist’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with light-shift without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated flourish (“luminous about them even in their darkness”) is earned by emotional crest, not Purple accumulation. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line recharges stone + shadow + regret in one breath. Grammar clean, pronouns unambiguous, time-markers sequential.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The shareable-dreams premise is familiar, but grafting onto autonomous hope-eating shadows seen via time-lapse archival footage feels fresh and inevitable. Risk is taken—no antagonist, no fight scene—yet tension is reconfigured into custodial ethics. Specificity of the Blooming Library and dusk-noticer profession prevents generic swap-out. Transformation test passes: remove any element and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
