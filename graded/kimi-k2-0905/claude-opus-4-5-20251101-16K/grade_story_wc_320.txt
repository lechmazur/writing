<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s drive to “find the beginning in every ending” is explicit, embodied in the climb and the tuning ritual, and the final laugh signals a credible internal shift. Yet the interior contradiction (doubt vs. certainty) is told more than dramatized; the only micro-choice with visible cost is pressing the star fragment, so the emotional escalation feels thin under the lyric overlay.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the silence speaks, Mira chooses to awaken the city, and the cost is the irreversible step into translation—Earned Stasis under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose but coherent; the star-fragment trigger is pre-set, and the “discard assumptions” beat is abstract, not a concrete pivot, keeping the score just sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The swaying cable-city, mineral-dust moon, and cathedral-bell receiver supply tactile specificity that constrains the climb and tunes the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; the gorge, dishes, and tower remain consistently anchored. The micro-setting of the receiver-as-altar charges the climax, meeting the 9-band gate; only the slight excess of lyrical adjectives prevents the final 0.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will Mira hear the lost signal?”—tightens once: static collapses into hush and offers union. The pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed beyond the abstract choice to “wake” the city, so the cost feels conceptual rather than lived, capping escalation below 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as living memory—emerges through the star fragment and the moon’s complicity; no character moralizes. The final reconfiguration (they became the signal) reweights every prior image without tidy profundity. One hair-line slip: “finding the beginning in every ending” edges toward thesis-statement, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira’s diction—mineral dust, widow’s veils, Hollywood terrazzo—creating a consistent lyric signature. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for awe, staccato for static crackle. No head-hop or register drift; the only bar to 9 is an occasional lush surfeit (“serenely electric potential”) that slightly blurs propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image and motion—and loops are absent. Metaphors stay coherent (veils, widow, moon complicit). A few ornate clusters (“mineral dust…widow’s face”) flirt with overwriting but never stall causality; clarity at closure remains intact, so the artifact cap stays sub-penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of silent-film relic with cosmic radio translation feels idiosyncratic and inevitable; the city-suspension gorge is freshly cinematic yet never steals focus. Risk-taking lies in treating silence as sentient medium—executed without late-rule cheats. Transformation is strong: swapping Clara Vance for any trinket would weaken the thematic reincarnation loop.</comment>
