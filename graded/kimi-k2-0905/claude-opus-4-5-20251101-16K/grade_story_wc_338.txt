<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s “methodically curious” trait is shown through concrete acts—comparing 1962 and new footage, noticing the reversed figure—so the trait drives the plot. Interiority stays tactile (“she understood then…”) rather than abstract, and her final choice to invite the board is a micro-choice with cost (she must stand publicly beneath the stones). Yet the story never exposes a contradictory impulse; she proceeds straight from curiosity to advocacy without a visible moment of self-doubt or competing loyalty, so the arc feels single-note. Still, within 800 words the motivation is legible, embodied, and pays off in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn edge becomes the literal and moral line Elena decides not to mend—“some maps had to stay torn.” The cost is felt: she forfeits sole ownership of the mystery and accepts the rain-soaked uncertainty of public disclosure. Causality holds: each beat (footage comparison, heritage-board pitch, final vault entry) follows because/therefore logic. One minor scaffold—two adjacent sentences declare “She understood then…” and “She made her decision…” without new external stimulus—keeps this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The archival-paper smell, the diagonal tear, and the rain-gleaming stones are selective, POV-filtered details that guide Elena’s gaze and later choice. The vault itself functions as micro-setting: its curved geometry literally shapes the acoustic payoff she stands inside. No spatial drift; bodies and camera reels track cleanly. While no object physically constrains the final move, the torn map edge—repeated in the last paragraph—charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to the whispered chapel—tightens once: from private study to public exposure. Elena’s agency drives the turn; she risks academic ridicule by contacting the board. The price is visible: she must stand beneath the stones in the rain and accept that the voices will no longer be hers alone. Pressure plateaus rather than escalates further, keeping this solidly in the 7-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—listening to silenced histories—emerges through the reversing fresco figure and the final line about maps staying torn; no character moralizes. The torn edge reweights from cartographic error to ethical stance, offering plausible counter-readings (preservation vs. exposure). Subtext in Dr. Marsh’s abandonment stays implied. The ending image avoids sentimentality yet lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays welded to Elena’s perceptual lens: “ink layered over ink,” “stones gleaming like old teeth.” Syntax lengthens when she theorizes, then compresses inside the vault (“The whisper came.”). No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within a conservator’s lexicon. One clause—“physics and faith colliding”—edges toward abstraction but is earned by immediate sensory payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and double-tasking: “rain-scoured after decades of improper drainage” simultaneously world-builds and foreshadows revelation. Rhythm modulates from methodical opening cadence to clipped single-sentence paragraph at the vault entrance. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. A single near-redundancy—“she understood then… she understood their weight”—is minor enough to leave the 8-band intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The acoustic palimpsest chapel feels fresh, synthesizing archaeology, sound physics, and conservation ethics rather than defaulting to haunted-cave trope. The map-framer protagonist supplies an unfamiliar expert lens. Risk is present—quiet lyric ending, no jump-scare payoff—yet the concept commits fully. The reversing fresco image is specific enough to prevent swap-out with another mystery.</comment>
