<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “spongey dread” is a lived, corporeal thing—but the moment of decision to file the appeal is largely stated (“She would continue reading it”) rather than dramatized with visible cost. The contradiction between inherited shame and discovered pride is present, yet the pivot from passive deciphering to active risk is compressed into a single paragraph that tells us the choice instead of letting us feel the micro-moments of hesitation or bodily cost. Still, her perceptual signature (the copper nail, the oilcloth, the coded stanzas) is character-specific and consistent, and the endurance of staying at the station supplies a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a clean Charged Poise: Mira pockets the copper nail and begins composing the appeal, re-weighting her ancestry and future in one image. Causality is intact—every journal decode and storm-wreck delivery logically feeds the final choice—yet the reversal (exile can be reversed) is revealed rather than tested in scene, so the cost is conceptual, not viscerally paid on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 50, satisfying the 120-word gate. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each new flotsam thickens the evidence pile until meaning crystallizes; the pattern holds without contradiction.</comment>

<comment>The experimental weather station is sketched with rattle and groan—instruments “spinning uselessly” against rogue skies—so the environment actively constrains action and mirrors Mira’s useless inherited maps. Micro-objects (copper nail, oilcloth, preservation lamps) function as portable setting, handled in tactile beats that affect choices: the nail’s green patina prompts the stanza decode, the lamp pool limits her workspace. Spatial choreography is clean; no teleporting props. The drowned coastline and reversed currents are learned through action rather than exposition dump, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—clearing Vera’s name—signals early and tightens when Mira realizes the government could still deny the appeal. The deepening comes not from new external opposition but from accumulated evidence that reframes the moral math: each decoded stanza raises the personal price of silence. Agency is intellectual (decoding, composing) yet forecloses the safe path of forgetfulness; the cost is the future confrontation with state power. No coincidence rescues her; luck is only the sea’s indifferent deliveries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: inherited shame mutates into inherited obligation, with the copper nail as silent witness—no character utters a thesis. The final image—Mira writing while instruments spin beyond design—re-prices the premise: truth-telling is now a climatological act as unstable as the weather. Subtext in the coded poems is implication-driven; no stanza is decoded for the reader, only for Mira. The refusal to moralize keeps ambiguity alive: appeal may fail, but the act itself reconfigures her stance.</comment>

<comment>Third-person intimate remains locked to Mira; no POV slippage. Diction is precise yet weather-worn (“groaned with each gust,” “spongey dread”) without straining for lyricism. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fragments under pressure (“She was pressing now”), mirroring cognitive load. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The absence of dialogue is not penalized; when sailors’ logs speak, their clipped stanzas contrast Mira’s interior idiom, keeping voice distinction intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm alternates between long, accumulating clauses and abrupt single-sentence beats that mimic debris hitting shore. No template cadence or synonym loops; “spun uselessly / gray horizon / coded stanzas” each appear once. Metaphors stay coherent—copper nail as key, maps as lifelines—without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “exile had been declared reversible— a clause… that allowed descendants to appeal” could be compressed, but it does not stall momentum or obscure causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The climate-apocalypse map-librarian angle feels fresh, yet the core trope—ancestor’s hidden heroic code—is familiar; specificity comes from the drowned bureaucratic outpost and the reversal of cartography itself (maps that kill becoming maps that save). The copper nail re-purposes a standard gothic memento into a bureaucratic key, a synthesis that grows inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken by making the climax an act of writing rather than escape, and the coherence holds.</comment>
