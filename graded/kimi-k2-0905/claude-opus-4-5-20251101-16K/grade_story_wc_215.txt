<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s serenity is palpable, but her arc is almost entirely internal observation; the single micro-choice—warning the scavenger not to speak—carries cost yet feels like the only beat where her tranquillity actively shapes events. Interiority stays concrete, but the absence of any second visible decision or bodily risk keeps the “earned” threshold shy of excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the scavenger’s retreat reframes silence as sacred, reweighting the covenant with felt conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is swift; causality is loose but coherent under pattern accumulation rather than because/therefore chains. One reflective block nudges the 20 % ceiling yet stays anchored to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Deserted apiary is sketched with tactile ruin—dry channels, skeletal trees—filtered through Elara’s caretaker eye; the stained-glass box is micro-setting that literally charges the final image with withheld light. Spatial choreography stays clean; sensory hierarchy favors the visual, but compressed word count justifies the narrow band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of unspoken weight—tightens once when the scavenger reaches for the box and Elara blocks him; this single deepening is sufficient for the length and lens. Cost is conceptual (his unvoiced grief remains heavy) rather than visceral, keeping the score below the 8.8 gate where a visible price would be required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern—ghosts, empty hives, sealed box—culminating in the final line’s revaluation of silence as eloquent. No explicit moralizing; resonance is earned through the scavenger’s renunciation. A hairline slip toward parable clarity keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; diction is controlled, lyrical without purple drift. The single spoken exchange is terse and goal-driven, carrying subtext about value versus worth. Distinctive perceptual signature is present but not yet fully idiosyncratic under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to the clipped final warning; no looped stems or mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed impossible”) is minor. High information density throughout; final image is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper ghosts preserving silence feels fresh; the covenant’s “honey of unspoken words” transforms familiar eco-grief into luminous concept. Story commits fully, avoids explanatory dumps, and ends with a reconfiguration that could not be transplanted intact to another setting.</comment>
