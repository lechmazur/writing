<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity is concrete—she “lingered over letters,” asks “so many questions” that Aldric begins the diary—and the goggles-as-filter moment is a bodily micro-choice that crystallizes her stake. The final beat (“she was also smiling”) earns its contradiction because the diary has forced her to feel grief and gladness simultaneously on the page. No interiority lapses into label-speak; even the epiphany is rendered as physical action (pressing goggles to page). The only nit: the mother-link is relayed in a single clause, so the cost is slightly generalized rather than singly embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor adds refracted density until light literally rewrites the page, a pattern break that reweights the central stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira steps out carrying both sorrow and permission, the cost legible in the diary pressed to her chest and the remembered wreck below. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“elevator groaned upward through the icebound spire”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. No causal break; even the goggles’ reveal is prepared by the earlier “navigating storms” line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ice-embedded shaft, brass goggles, and tin box of ashes are tactile, lived-in objects that constrain action (goggles must be lifted to eyes, diary can only be read in refracted light). Spatial choreography is immaculate: elevator cage, floor numbers, prismatic ribbons tracked across ten vertical beats. Cold rims, honeyed tea, violet sunset—selective sensory triangulation keeps the world from becoming a postcard. Environment directly enables the climax: scattered ice-light is the only reason the code becomes legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Mira decode the diary and endure what it tells her?—is signaled on first page. Mid-text “symbols transformed” is the single meaningful deepening that narrows options: now she must keep reading. Cost is visible: the final entry forces her to confront her mother’s death anew. Pressure stays internal and coherent; no external antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (“joy beneath anguish”) emerges from Aldric’s specific particulars—burned breakfasts, wind-scattered ashes—never from abstraction. Final image of Mira smiling while missing her mother reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Diary-as-code becomes a literal metaphor for encrypted grief, paid off when the same light that reveals the words warms her face. Subtext in the captain’s line “you are seeking the same thing I sought” is earned because the reader has watched Mira enact that seeking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual filter: she notices “prismatic ribbons,” tastes imaginary honeyed tea, feels cold brass. Syntax lengthens in calm beats, fragments under shock (“Mira gasped.”). No head-hopping; Aldric’s voice arrives only through diary excerpts, a legitimate artifact. Rhythm modulates with floor-count cadence, mirroring elevator ascent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “dawn light began to pierce the ice” simultaneously advances time, sets up the code-break, and maintains momentum. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; “ice-crusted walls,” “frosted windows,” “cloud sea” keep imagery coherent. One scaffold trace: “She had lived here all twenty-three years of her life” could trim to “She had lived here twenty-three years,” but the extra clause does not recur. Final line is airtight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Combines steampunk goggles, invisible-ink diary, and elevator-as-countdown into a fresh configuration; the vertical spire ascent as page-turn mechanism feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Emotional core—finding comfort inside grief—is universal, but the ice-light decryption reframes it through speculative specificity. Risk in the quiet, reflective ending pays off because the stakes were always interior. Could shave half-point only because “elevator stops at each floor” is a familiar countdown; the refracted-light twist redeems it.</comment>
