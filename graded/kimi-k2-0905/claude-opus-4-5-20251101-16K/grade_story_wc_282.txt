<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera’s grief and her need to “give voice to the unknown” are clearly signaled, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a scene-level choice that costs her something. The fossil functions as comfort, not crucible; her witnessing stance remains static. No micro-choice in the cave alters her tactical path or forecloses an option, so the arc feels observational rather than driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the warm fossil and the promise of maps-to-come reweight the premise with felt cost—she will keep bearing solitude. Causality is intact: because she stays awake, she alone can archive the floating grief. Orientation is clean by line 5; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. A tighter causal turn inside the cave—her decision to map the active echo even at personal risk—would have pushed this into the 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The cave system is rendered through heat-color, backward sound, and upward water—specific, sensory, and immediately tied to Vera’s mapping task. The elm fossil serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track her body, sensors, and the floating echoes without drift. One more beat where the cave’s “factually mystical” physics actively obstructs or endangers Vera would have lifted this to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—record the unknown before the sleepers wake—creates coherent pressure, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. The active echo is a deepening of density, not a narrowing of options; Vera never faces a live trade-off or risk. Cost is diffuse (“solitude,” “daughter’s absence”) rather than dramatized on this night. A moment where mapping the new signature might erase an older, precious grief-mark would have sharpened stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as communal duty versus private loss. The fossil’s re-warming at the end reconfigures the earlier botany-book memory without moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the purple grief-clouds—ancient mourners literalizing what Vera cannot say to her sleeping daughter. A slightly more ambiguous final image—maps that might mislead as well as guide—would have nudged this into 8.5 territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Vera’s perceptual filter: heat-colors, mineral taste, fossil weight. Syntax lengthens during wonder, shortens during sensor spikes, mirroring attention. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The occasional elevated phrase (“conceptual repricing”) feels like narrator intrusion rather than Vera’s idiom, keeping it just below the 8.5 tier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or task. No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“thermal signatures…linger like fingerprints on stone and water”—slightly blurs physical logic. Otherwise line-level craft is clean, with purposeful repetition of “bridge” and “voice” that pays off in the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The hibernating-world frame plus emotional cartography is a fresh synthesis; the floating grief-echoes feel inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk is taken: sci-fi concept delivered as lyric vignette without exposition dump. The piece avoids the “mystical cave” cliché by grounding phenomena in mineral science, then undercutting explanation with wonder. Slightly more personal risk to Vera would have pushed originality to 9.0.</comment>
