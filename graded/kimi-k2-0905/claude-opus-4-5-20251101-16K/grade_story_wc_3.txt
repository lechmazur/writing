<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam’s grief-flattened interiority never crystallizes into a contradictory impulse on the page; the seed choice is calm, the tasting beat tidy. “Haunted ambitions” is asserted, not dramatized as an inner tug-of-war. Closure lands as gentle acceptance, but the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt through her body.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative pattern holds: each magnet-text beat thickens texture until the fruit reconfigures meaning. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—knowledge reweighted, mentor gone—but the causal chain from seed to insight is delivered rather than tested under pressure. Orientation is swift; no lens drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Magnetic arbor above the clouds” is economically anchored through Miriam’s climb and the aurora-lit bowl below; the crystalline bark under her fingers grounds the impossible. Setting supplies the literal conduit for the finale, satisfying the 9+ gate. Micro-details (warm seed, humming branches) keep the lofty world tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand transition—stays legible, but pressure escalates only once: plant seed → instant fruit → insight. No intermediate obstacle or tactical trade-off; the arbor never resists. Cost is conceptual, not a foreclosed option, so the tightening feels light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “conservation through transformation” emerges organically from lightning/copper metaphor to fruit tasting; no moralizing summary. The cuneiform leaves subtly reprice knowledge as embodied rather than textual, rewarding reflection. Ambiguity survives: transition understood, yet Tabari remains absent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Miriam’s calibrated, scholarly perception; rhythm widens and narrows with ascent and tasting. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing,” “knowledge reweighted”) nudges academic, but diction remains within a translator’s lexicon. No head-hop or filter-stack; compression is taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer (lightning, steam, copper) stays coherent and purposeful. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” meta-comment—doesn’t dull the final image. High density without purple drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Magnetic tree-as-circuit literalizes spirit-transition physics, refreshing after countless “ghost garden” tropes. Cuneiform tablets as living leaves and fruit encoding felt semantics are specific, not quirky overlay. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, though premise risk is modest.</comment>
