<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—inheritance of violence vs. need to build—stay alive in scene: nightly spreading stolen bills, then choosing donation. Calm is embodied, not labeled, under rising pressure. Final renunciation lands with felt cost. Slight deduction for late explicit articulation of “why he’d come here.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens taught early: images of crossroads, bills, flags layer until cadence shift at end reweights meaning. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—donation converts loot into repair with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality intact; each phase (rise, fall, release) follows because/therefore logic. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train and faded flags act as micro-setting that literally walls off the world and shapes Marcus’s isolation tactics. Foreign bills handled repeatedly, charging the final donation image. Selective sensory detail (sawdust, musk, slanted autumn light) filters through POV priorities. Environment constrains choices and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: can a crossroads create rather than destroy? Start-up rise gives way to tightening loss of clients and staff; Marcus’s calm agency drives gentle layoffs and final decision to donate—each turn narrows options with visible cost. Pressure coherent under causal lens. Enough for short form; no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete cycle: stolen futures → honest wages → restored futures. Subtext lives in silent bill-spreading ritual and flag warnings. Final image reweights “paths that circle back” as second chances, not traps. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in lingering train solitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus; perceptual signature blends highway-bandit vigilance with consultant stillness. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped beats for layoffs. No head-hop. Distinct diction—“dusky harmony,” “evening water”—earned by POV lexicon. Minor filter slips in “he thought” tags.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences advance plot, character, atmosphere. Metaphors disciplined—palm lines, evening water—no mixed vehicular clutter. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts tight. Occasional scaffold phrase (“perceptively calm”) repeats but does not obscure closure. No artifact interference in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Circus-train consultancy run by robber’s son using stolen foreign bills as seed capital feels fresh yet inevitable. Image pattern of crossroads re-prices from ambush site to repair site. Specificity of donation destinations resists generic redemption. Slight risk in accumulative structure pays off; transformation passes proximity test.</comment>
