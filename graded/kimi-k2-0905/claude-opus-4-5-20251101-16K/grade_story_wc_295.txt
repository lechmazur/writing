<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vera’s insomnia-driven obsession is concrete—tracing star-pulses with her finger, whispering syllables that “resonate in her chest like a struck bell.” The interior contradiction (hunger to heal vs. fear of solitary collapse) is dramatized in the dream-temple where she chooses to speak aloud, accepting the risk of redistribution. Cost is visible: dawn finds her “pen trembling with exhaustion,” Oren’s death re-weighted from private grief to communal load. Only keeps the score sub-9 is that the burden-sharing epiphany is partly narrated rather than enacted in waking choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dawn light re-weights Vera’s mission from lone decoding to communal witness, cost legible in bodily exhaustion and the telegram’s fading petals. Causal chain (telegram cue → star mapping → lucid temple → redistribution) holds, each step because/therefore. One soft spot: the shift from waking observation to shared dream is motivated by a single whispered syllable—slight teleport, but dream logic is taught early enough to waive a full penalty. Lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Copper dome, brass instruments, and daylily petals provide tactile anchors; telescope centering on Mira supplies the micro-setting that enables the climactic utterance. Observatory dissolves into “silver mist,” a transition that keeps spatial grounding inside dream logic. Details are filtered through Vera’s professional eye—light curves, star charts—without tourist catalogue. Only lacks a 9-level punch because the temple dream-space is sketched more generically than the waking observatory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or be broken like Oren—tightens when she realizes the syllables must be spoken aloud inside a communal dream. One meaningful escalation: the act of speaking triggers instantaneous redistribution of visible burdens; options narrow from solitary research to responsible teaching. Price is dramatized (physical trembling, dawn exhaustion). Could edge higher if waking world pushed back against her new obligation, but within word count the pressure is coherent and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Shared-burden theme emerges through image—stones, chains, shadow-child—rather than thesis statement. Telegram’s faded daylily reacquires meaning as communal rather than private keepsake, a subtle re-pricing. Final paragraph avoids moralizing; invitation to “witness together” is an action, not a lesson. Slight abstraction in “midnight solace” tag keeps it from full 9-band resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Vera’s perceptions: star rhythms “suggested,” sound “resonate in her chest,” observatory “dissolved” as she recognizes the slip. Syntax mirrors her fatigue—long reflective sentences punctuated by single-word perceptions (“Then something shifted”). No head-hopping; dream figures’ thoughts remain opaque, shown only in gesture. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose breathes with variable rhythm; clauses stretch during mapping, snap short at “Then something shifted.” Figurative language is selective—only one simile per high-pressure beat—avoiding purple patch density. No synonym loops or scaffold; “daylily-pressed telegram” recurs with evolving charge. One mixed echo: “dawn bleeding” edges toward cliché but is saved by immediate internal reaction.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Healing via spoken stellar pulses is non-obvious and organically fused to astronomy occupation; premise commits fully without late rule change. Daylily telegram and variable-star phonetics are idiosyncratic particulars that would collapse if swapped. Emotional truth—grief distributed rather than erased—feels fresh against typical “cure” narratives. Risky lucid-dream shift is prepared early, paying off in communal temple scene.</comment>
