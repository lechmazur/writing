<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s trembling hands, reflexive haste, and gradual stilling are embodied and trackable; the interior contradiction between panic and the growing imperative to “stay” is enacted in the pause with the herb woman and the kneeling beat. The final endurance—walking on without rushing—costs her the old coping pattern, so the arc lands. Mentor absence is felt throughout, but the old woman is a proxy mentor who never pressures Mira, so relationship-as-crucible is only lightly exercised. Still, micro-choices (stop, speak, plant) visibly shift her hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s renunciation of hurry is crystallized in the slowed walk, felt cost is the forfeiture of her former reflex, and the sprouting shoots image reweights the premise. Causality is soft—sympathetic vibration is more metaphysical than causal—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of aurora, pendant hum, and seeded earth tighten the stake of attention vs. speed. Orientation is clean by word 60. One small drift: the old woman’s vanish edges toward situational coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so penalty is minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ridgeway’s crooked stones and aurora curtains are filtered through Mira’s courier gaze—stones as “teeth,” lights as pressure that slows pulse—so description is selective and character-scaled. The pendant functions as micro-setting: its vibration against her sternum constrains the choice to linger. Nightroot seeds evolve from prop to planted evidence of changed stance. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. Environment directly guides the final halt and planting beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hurry vs. presence”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened once: the pendant’s hum forces a literal slowdown, foreclosing the fast-walk option. Cost is legible in the final image: she “no longer rushed,” accepting the unknown timetable of wonder. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. The tightening is single but decisive; meets short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: wonder germinates in paused time. The pendant’s sympathetic vibration and the impossible seedlings reprice the mundane act of stopping into mythic necessity. No thematic thesis is spoken; final image carries the reweighting. Ambiguity lingers—was the woman real?—without confusion. Memory-to-myth transition is rendered as lived experience rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays glued to Mira; perceptual signature is tactile—trembling fingers, spider-silk cord, soil cold against knees. Syntax lengthens in the pause moment (“time seemed to stretch like honey”) then tightens again on the walk, mirroring pulse. No dialogue beyond two brief, voice-distinguished lines; subtext is carried in gesture and seed exchange. Free indirect style is clean (“she was learning what her absent mentor had known”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“curtains of green and violet light,” “honey from a spoon”) cohere within Mira’s sensorium. Figurative language pauses during the high-pressure planting beat, keeping clarity. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“seemed to stretch”) is acceptable at lyrical height.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “courier who must learn to linger” is fresh angle on travel-tale; sympathetic vibration as chronotope device repurposes low-fantasy tech for interior conflict. Aurora-lit ridgeway feels specific rather than postcard. Risk is moderate—quiet mythic intrusion—but the closure commits fully. Could swap mentor name without breaking arc, so not quite 9.</comment>
