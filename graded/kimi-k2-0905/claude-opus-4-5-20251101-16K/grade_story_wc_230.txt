<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s pragmatic skepticism and her yearning for privacy are credibly braided; the moment she lowers the glass eye and weeps sells the cost. Interior contradiction is present—“rational to her marrow” yet chasing occult talismans—but the asylum anecdote is imported summary, not lived scene, so the depth of her obsession is partly told, not embodied. No second character on page, so relationship crucible absent by design; micro-choices (climbing, trading fruit, pressing lens to eye) track cleanly. The Earned Stasis—accepting partial silence as defense—feels proportionate to length and prior cause.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: the pause before speech reweights the virus-rule and carries undeniable social/psychic cost (“interiority was worth fighting for”). Causal chain holds: eye discovery → test → partial failure → new tactic of selective silence. Orientation clean by line 6. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of storm, orchard, and eye imagery accrues until the final cadence shift. No meaningful escalation break, though middle paragraph of backstory is a soft tangent that slightly dilates momentum.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hanging orchard, cable sway, and perpetual mist are tactile and immediately constrain labor choices; storm frequency explains the fruit’s density and prices. Glass eye as micro-setting is handled twice with sensory specificity (milk-white, amber veins). Early anchors arrive inside 50 words. Final image—apples clinging despite storm—mirrors Maren’s refusal to relinquish inner privacy without overt symbolism. No world-rule inconsistency; smuggler tunnels and 1890s occult texts coexist under collapses caused by the virus.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving inner privacy under universal transparency—is signaled in paragraph 3. Pressure tightens once: the eye test fails partially, forcing a tactical pivot to “pause first” rather than full lie. Cost is legible—six months’ food, tunnel silence, and the weep of recognition—but the tightening is single-step, not compounded. Accumulative lens excuses need for multiple reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: privacy as shelter, not deceit. Subtext lives in gesture—wrapping eye in oilcloth, lowering it slowly—rather than thesis. Final orchard image reweights earlier mentions without commentary. No moralizing line; “fractured grace” stays implicit. The asylum anecdote teases but does not over-explain the occultist’s guilt, preserving ambiguity.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: soil logic, fungal networks, cable sway. Diction—“dense and honest” fruit, “swallowing glass”—is character-specific, not ornamental. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is narrative texture only. Rhythm modulates from declarative exposition to shorter, breath-cut sentences during eye test. No filter-verb clutter; immediacy holds.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean and double-duty: storm cadence echoes emotional sway; “fruit that survived grew dense and honest” fuses world and theme. No mixed metaphors; orchard-as-ship is brief and apt. One paraphrase loop—“she could not lie. None of them could”—is purposeful repetition, not scaffold. opening and closing lines bookend with apple/image symmetry. No artifact touches closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Empathy-virus transparency plus occult prosthesis is fresh synthesis; execution keeps concept fully in-scene rather than essay. Risk-taking—quiet stasis instead of rebellion—pays off by reframing “survival” as internal refusal. Specificity of suspended orchard and 1890s marginalia resists generic dystopia. Could edge higher if eye’s occult mechanics were slightly more grounded, but restraint suits rational POV.</question>
