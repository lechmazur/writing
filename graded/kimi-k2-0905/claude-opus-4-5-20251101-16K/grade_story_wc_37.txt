<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thessaly’s interior contradiction—dispersed self vs. merging imperative—drives every beat, culminating in her self-dissolution. Embodied emotion (“her translucent fingers”) and micro-choices (collecting songs, wrapping the window) are specific. The final renunciation is earned: she pays with existence so the realm can re-sing. Minor drift: the refugees remain choral, not individualized crucibles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Thessaly dissolves into the woven dawn, undeniable cost on-page (“Thessaly was everywhere now”). Accumulative lens holds—each collected song tightens the pattern until the mica window ignites. One smooth shard-transition (greenhouse → window) is legible; no orientation debt. Causality intact: forgotten songs → thread → tapestry → sunrise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s phosphorescent rows, silver-leaved trees, and mica window layers are tactile, selective, and mirror internal stakes (cold vs. warmth). The mica window recurs with escalating function: void mirror → wrapping surface → blazing conduit. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through Thessaly’s memory-keeper bias. Spatial choreography clean across 47 refugees and one dispersing POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle the realm—signaled early and tightens when the last tree dims, forcing the collective sing. One meaningful deepening: realization that her own scattered essence is the final ingredient. Cost is visible: Thessaly’s dissolution. Pressure accumulates under lyric lens; no causal reversals needed. Refugee chorus complicates but does not antagonize, fitting accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communal memory as luminous resistance; no thesis statements. Final image reweights the premise—light is not recovered but re-sung into being, a Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in the lullaby fragment vibrating her dispersed self. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the cracked darkness that still frays at the edges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient retains stable distance to Thessaly’s dispersed POV; no head-hop. Syntax is lyrical yet controlled (“threads of amber light materialized between her translucent fingers”). Perceptual signature—memory as palpable filament—threads every paragraph. Dialogue minimal, natural when present (“Sing,” she told them). No register drift; tense stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: longer accumulative clauses build the tapestry, then fragment at the blaze. High density—each sentence advances song, light, or stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned (weaving, spinning, swaddling) and paid off. Final line cadence mirrors sunrise burst.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of cosmology, textile magic, and communal song feels inevitable yet fresh. Mirror-world eternal night plus memory-keeper plus sung dawn is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk in dispersing the protagonist into pure medium works because the textile motif is taught early and charges closure. No derivative echo; specificity (“alchemical orchard,” “mica window”) anchors universals.</comment>
