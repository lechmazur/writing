<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s grief-turned-obsession is viscerally embodied; every beat of ink-pouring is a micro-choice that externalizes her calcified fury. The “serene anger” never slips into diagnostic talk; instead it is shown through the patient violence with which she dispenses the vanishing ink. Brother-loss as motive is anchored in one crystalline flashback that fuels the closing promise to step through the pattern-door. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship crucibles are N/A; the interior contradiction—cold scientist vs. wild seeker—drives all action and earns the final vow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each ink bloom adds density until the doorway pattern crystallizes the stake. Orientation is immediate—eclipse +17 min, sandstone pillars, tent—inside 50 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the last image of layered, folded time reweights every prior evaporated pattern and carries undeniable conceptual cost—she will either vanish into amber or bring Marcus back. No causal break; drone recordings that auto-erase are a taught constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind-sculpted sandstone, iridescent ink, mechanical drone wingbeats—three tactile anchors return to charge the final image. The desert pillars are not backdrop; their “frozen screams” mirror Vera’s stilled grief and foreshadow the doorway she will carve. Micro-setting rule met: the stone table acts as crucible where liquid patterns constrain every choice. Sensory economy is strict—only visual and haptic details that evaporate in real time, matching the story’s vanishing evidence rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—penetrate folded time to recover brother—signaled in first third and tightened when the doorway pattern appears. One meaningful deepening: ink shifts from research data to literal portal, foreclosing the option to merely observe. Cost is legible: each vanished pattern erases proof, tightening her obsession loop. Agency remains hers—she decides to scale up the ink dose, accepting self-erasure risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “vanishing” (ink, body, evidence, time) rather than statement. Final image reconfigures the trauma trope: slowed perception is not torture but a fold one can enter. No moralizing; the question “did time gift her extra seconds?” lingers unanswered. Subtext in the drone’s silent wings—technology records yet cannot retain truth—mirrors human memory of catastrophe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s lexicon—“iridescence that existed only in the moments before it vanished” is a scientist’s precision tinged with mystic hunger. Rhythm accelerates during pattern emergence via parataxis—“Spirals emerged, then dissolved. Fractals bloomed and faded.” No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct. Distinct perceptual signature: she clocks time in eclipse-minutes and reads wind-carved rock as kin. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence survives.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies—from long liquid sentences to staccato documentation commands. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught, and paid off: “frozen screams” sandstone returns in final line as she prepares to carve her own door. No mixed metaphors; ink = time = doorway logic stays coherent. Micro-loop check clean—no adjacent paraphrase. Only nit: “consciously wild” feels slightly packaging-level; −0.2 for minor register blip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: time-dilation grief + vanishing ink as portaltechnology. Eclipse as catalyst for ink-pattern complexity avoids stock trope use. Risk taken—speculative physics folded into lyric micro-beat—pays off in closure image. Not quite 9 because brother-rescue arc is familiar at skeleton level, though surface texture is novel.</comment>
