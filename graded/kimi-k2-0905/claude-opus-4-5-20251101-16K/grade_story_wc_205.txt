<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-riven obstinacy is vivid—crystal pressed to palm, storm-light in her eyes—but her “revolutionary” past is only asserted, never shown pressuring present tactics; the shard and vessel do the emotional lifting while her interior contradiction stays static. Interiority is lyrical, not diagnostic, yet the climactic choice (write the report) repeats the same resolve she held from act one, so no new cost is felt. Daughter’s death is recounted, not re-lived in a micro-choice that splits her. Earned stasis needs sharper on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical-accumulative lens is taught early by amber time-pools and holds to the final charged poise: the intact vessel reframes every prior shard. Orientation is immediate; causal chain is thematic rather than plotty, acceptable under Accumulative rules. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the Council will still reject her, but she has re-priced the Carvers—satisfying Q2’s cost test. One transition (storm→core chamber) is clean; no prop or rule breaches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The asteroid’s baroque spires, time-moss, and mirror protocol are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through Maren’s mourning gaze. Micro-setting succeeds: the shard’s refracted “spectrum she had never seen” directly triggers the report decision, charging closure. Spatial choreo holds across dome, station, and core. While visual dominates, the humming mirrors add sensory layering and credible constraint, meeting the 9- gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Single stake—prove the Carvers’ spiritual depth—faces one meaningful tightening when she lifts the intact vessel and sees encoded joy; option space narrows from doubt to certainty, supplying the required deepening. Pressure is accumulative (grief-glow, storm, Council scorn) rather than antagonistic, coherent under chosen lens. Cost is conceptual (professional ridicule, futile report) not visceral, limiting upper band. No reversal, but lyric mode doesn’t demand one.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—beauty as resistance to erasure—emerges through recurrent refraction imagery, never sermonized. Subtextual irony: the “defunct” revolutionary re-energizes a dead culture while alive with time-light. Final image of starlight on spires reweights the shard motif without moralizing, delivering resonant ambiguity. Daughter’s ghost adds emotional strata but stays secondary, preventing neat thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual signature—burnished sorrow, poetry-seeing eyes—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under storm pressure; diction (“luminous moss,” “poetry encoded in angles”) is character-specific, not purple. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Free-indirect control sustains psychic distance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes—sentence variety, purposeful paragraph cuts, no scaffold loops. Metaphors stay coherent (starlight, amber, refraction) and serve information density. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“temporal accumulation,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register but remains within academic-observer POV. No mixed vehicles or paraphrase clutter in peak beats; closure image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Combining visible time, baroque asteroid archaeology, and grief-crystal funeral vessels feels fresh, not checklist. The notion that extinction response = ornate memorial encoding is specific and memorable. Risky lyric structure pays off via accreted refraction pattern. Could edge higher with one more concrete Carver detail to prove non-human distinctness, but transformation from familiar “relic debate” trope is evident.</comment>
