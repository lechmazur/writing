<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—wilting under lies, re-blooming with candor—drives every beat; the mother’s recorded truth crystallizes her arc with visible cost. One micro-choice (voicing fear to the door) forecloses secrecy. The “leaves” embodiment stays specific, never diagnostic. Secondary characters exist only as voices in jars, so no relationship crucible, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: fragment assembly → Repository descent → map-making reprise tightens the stake around truth-preservation. Closure reweights meaning—Mira’s new map externalizes the cost of candor under toxic skies. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no causality breaks. Minor rhythm repetition in triple “past” phrases (−0.1), else immaculate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse city, cracked Conversation Hall, and zinc plate function as micro-settings that gate choices. Toxic dome pressure is felt on skin and leaf; spatial choreography is clean. The postal plate’s etched coordinates constrain next move, charging final image. Sensory selection favors touch and filtered amber light, matching Mira’s haptic vocation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost honesty—escalates through each fragment found and each door unlocked. One meaningful tightening: admission of fear opens Repository, foreclosing secrecy. Cost is the perpetual wilt/recover cycle she must endure among liars. Agency is intellectual/verbal rather than physical, fitting lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recovered voices: unspoken truth gains archival afterlife. Subtext operates in silences (“answered with silence” jar) and Mira’s blooming/wilting physiology. Final image of shimmering leaves under poisoned sky reweights premise—truth as photosynthesis against toxification. No moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly adhered to Mira’s perceptual bias—gold veins, paper texture, leaf tension. Syntax mirrors calligraphic precision: controlled commas, measured clauses. No dialogue on page; narration carries subtext. Free indirect thought (“Where did such conversations go…”) is clean and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one line often layers world, body, and metaphor (“gold catching the filtered light”). Occasional modifier stack (“sprawling greenhouse city of Veridium”) but never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; varied sentence lengths. One near-mixed metaphor (“toxic sky pressed like something hungry”) survives because it’s taught early and recharged at end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—ark of unfinished conversations—feels fresh yet inevitable. Gilded-leaf calligrapher specificity prevents trope recycling. Repository labels (“Apology from Thom Alder, never delivered”) create memorable micro-vignettes. Risk in botanical body-mod pays off thematically. Could swap city name, but core botanic-truth linkage is inseparable.</comment>
