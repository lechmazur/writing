<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradiction—trained skeptic yet loving granddaughter—surfaces in every beat: palm on key, trembling climb, “logically emotional” epiphany. The micro-choice to activate the lighthouse, not merely believe, crystallizes her stake while sonic release externalizes grief. Cost is felt: she weeps without diagnosis, body “heavy and luminous,” partnership replacing burden. Interiority stays embodied, specific, earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is intact: approaching Harvesters → key insight about resonance → lighthouse activation → ice rerouted → vessel defeated. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the harmonic partnership reconfigures her identity while ice and ancestry answer back. Cost is legible—“key rested warm against her heart”—and constraint persists (she must maintain tomorrow). Set-ups paid: hollow housing, micro-ridges, “sings when it finds its match.” No orientation drift; anchors clear by 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: groaning sheets, narrowing channels, closing around enemies. Lighthouse mechanics—central housing, lens dormancy—integrate with bodily stakes; key and lens become micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s engineer filter: frequencies before colors, micro-ridges before ornament. Final image of stars over frozen marina recharges opening amber horizon, reweighted by harmonic victory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep key from Harvesters—tightens at once; 20-minute sundown clock converts abstract threat into tactical countdown. Escalation is causal: each harmonic sweep narrows Harvester options until ice reroutes them. No violence, yet loss of agency for antagonists and irreversible shift for protagonist: she becomes “true keeper,” tomorrow’s maintenance now forever altered. Price paid on-page: uncontrollable weeping, body re-perceived, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—skepticism and sacredness fused through resonance—emerges without statement: “she had believed through understanding, understood through believing.” Sonic absolution’s double-edged release (grief freed, enemies redirected) offers resonant ambiguity: mercy as tactical victory. Final starlit image answers golden-sunset opening, reweighting ice from threat to choir. No moral delivered; emotional aftereffect lingers in subsonic hum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays latched to Maren’s engineer perception: “frequencies,” “microscopic ridges,” “mechanics and wave theory.” Diction tightens under stress—“bones hum,” eyes water—yet syntax remains precise, mirroring her logical mind forced open. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts smoothly from reflective opening to breath-held key insertion. Pattern of lyric repetition (“older than…”) is taught early and paid off at harmonic activation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual duty: “azure coat catching amber glow” seeds color motif while locating body. Metaphors stay physically coherent—light as held breath, ice as choir—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long reflective clauses early, staccato beats at key insertion (“The key slid home… The lighthouse began to sing.”). Zero paraphrase loops; no filler adjectives. Opening and final lines frame voice and echo with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines burial-crystals, sonic absolution, and lighthouse engineering into fresh mythos that feels ancient yet newly mechanized. Antagonists named “Harvesters” yet never described—trope flipped into acoustic defeat rather than physical combat. Transformation test fails if relocated: drift-ice resonance chamber is irreplaceable. Risky lyric escalations paid off by causal closure; no gimmick, only integrated wonder.</comment>
