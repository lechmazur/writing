<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—mechanical obedience vs. incendiary language—is dramatized in concrete beats: resetting the timer, reading aloud until her voice cracks, choosing to write again. The withheld envelope converts exile into insurgent archive, a visible cost paid in the final image of perpetually reset twenty-minute cycles. Furious tranquility is embodied, not labeled, driving every micro-choice. Only the brother’s vanish lingers as told-not-shown backstory, a hairline slip keeping it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of paused vigil → artifactual trigger → resurrected voice. Envelope discovery at midpoint delivers the single deepening that reweights stakes; timer resets become the visible, felt cost of permanent resistance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she will keep writing under surveillance—foreclosing surrender without sentimental triumph. Causality is interior but coherent; no orientation drift; world-rules stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory above storms is evoked through violet lightning, rarefied air, star emergence—each filtering Elena’s perceptual shift. Darkroom timer and bus timetable function as micro-settings that constrain choice; timer’s tick governs the resurrection ritual. Spatial choreography clean; no tourism catalogue. Needed constraint for 9+ met: timer charges the final image of endless cycles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she reclaim her outlawed voice?—is signaled early and sharpened when the envelope converts passive vigil into active composition. Single meaningful tightening: reading the uncensored poem aloud collapses exile into resistance; future danger is implied, not declawed. Cost legible in perpetual timer resets—sleep, safety, anonymity forfeit. Sufficient for this length; no false escalation loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic cartography emerges through concrete images: scars mapped, blacked stanzas as wounds, new poems passed hand-to-hand. No moralizing; final image of timer endlessly ringing offers Conceptual Repricing—time itself redefined as ammunition. Ambiguity preserved: no guarantee the words will survive, only that they will be written. Emotional aftereffect is mournful yet insurgent, earned via prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elena’s perceptual bias—lightning “walks,” air “rarefies,” poetry “accumulates in locations.” Syntax mirrors her fractured discipline: long accumulative clauses broken by staccato timer beats. No head-hop; register shift to bureaucratic coldness when recalling Ministry edits is intentional, motivated. Voice remains distinctive under peak stress of first forbidden recitation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high yet purposeful; metaphors (lightning “like something searching”) stay coherent under storm logic. One paraphrase loop—“reset it again” echoed twice—dings slightly. No mixed vehicles; no filter-verb clusters. Momentum breathes with paragraph elongation during poem recitation, then contracts with timer click. Closure beat clean of figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing astronomical exile with darkroom temporality feels fresh; bus timetable as dead-letter drop twists mundane ephemera into resistance archive. Concept of “vigil in pause” reanimated from metaphor to procedural insurgency. Specificity of violet storm-light and timer-tick rhythm prevents generic dystopia overlay. Risk is present but not spectacle-driven; transformation test passed—story would collapse if elements swapped.</comment>
