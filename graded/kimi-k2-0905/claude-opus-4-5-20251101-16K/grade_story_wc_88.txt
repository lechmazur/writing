<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—killer reflex vs. newborn empathy—are dramatized in the lake wade; the tearful clutch of the journal earns the change. One sentence still slips into diagnostic self-explanation (“Now beauty caused physical pain”), slightly dampening embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: she takes the first step toward daily choice, cost coded in wet clothes and the granddaughter’s conditional future. Causal chain from microfilm hunt → lake → journal → decision holds; only the obit-cipher method is stated, not shown, a minor thinning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lake’s living light is handled as both cathedral and threat, guiding her barefoot path and mirroring internal tumult; the baseball’s aged leather anchors time-collapse. Spatial choreography stays crisp—boots off, water line, case on bottom—no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she keep choosing empathy?—tightens when the journal reveals Vance’s existence depends on it; the final step forecloses retreat. Only one beat of external jeopardy (cold water) keeps pressure largely internal, adequate for 760 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of mutable identity emerges through bioluminescent adaptation metaphor rather than statement; the granddaughter’s conditional photograph reweights every prior murder without sermon. Final line lets the labyrinth stay open, avoiding moral arithmetic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains a cool, slightly clinical distance that feels apt for a rewired assassin; diction tightens under stress (“living questions” around ankles). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; rhythm mirrors her measured gait into the lake.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; only one soft loop (“terrible, complicated beauty”) and no mixed metaphors. Opening fragment sequence mirrors cognitive reboot effectively. Final paragraph cadence ascends without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Time-travel graffiti via attic baseball and obit cipher feels fresh; assassin-to-empathy arc is familiar but recharged by conditional descendant. Risk taken in bioluminescent underworld pays off as adaptive mirror rather than scenic exoticism.</comment>
