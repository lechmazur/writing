<comment>Venn’s quiet compulsion to sort and hoard seeds is embodied in tactile ritual; the moment she chooses to scatter them instead lands as earned reversal. Interior contradiction—order vs. release—plays out in concrete micro-choices (building cairns, then dismantling intent). The final stance costs her the safety of stored futures and is foreshadowed by the moon-touched leaf; no epiphany feels unearned. Voice remains consistent, specific, and modestly scaled to her lived attention.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to plant rather than preserve crystallizes with visible cost—her “monument to the old self” must be abandoned. Causal chain holds: moon-speck → readable vein → decoded imperative → seed-scattering vow; each beat tightens options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift: who/where/when anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity; pattern of cairn-building taught early pays off in inverted final image.</comment>

<comment>Floating arbor is sketched via lived motion—spiral ladders, cloud-rain-smoothed stones—never catalogued. Plum-tree platform constrains her reach and frames the leaf-catch; cairn materials (ash-wood, seed husks) double as tactile tools that later charge the inversion. Sensory hierarchy obeys her seed-sorting gaze: smallest glints first, sky second. Final glowing cairn reuses established objects, re-weighting their meaning without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preservation vs. renewal—tightens once: readable leaf forecloses hoarding. Pressure is textural: each added cairn raised the illusion of control; the illuminated monument collapses that option. Cost is felt on-page: “she would build monuments to her old self—and let that version rest.” No coincidence resolves; the turning is authored by her interpretation and choice alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from seed logic: stored memory must rot into future soil. Subtext lives in gesture—cairns once anchored loss, now anchor her own obsolete identity. No moralizing; final line lets mossy delight stand as earned emotional afterimage. Ambiguity remains: green shoots are promised, not shown, keeping theme open yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Venn’s perceptual sieve: verbs like “sorted,” “spun,” “glint” mirror seed-scale attention. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short vows (“Tomorrow, transformation.”) under pressure. No head-hop; diction stays botanical, never academic. Voice modulation supports arc: orderly cadence loosens into scattering imperatives.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “root-bound islands drifted through pearl-grey clouds” packs world and mood in nine words. Figurative layer is selective—three metaphors total—each re-used at inversion (glowing veins echo lantern light). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Minor alliteration (“mossy delight spread through her chest like roots finding water”) reads purposeful, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating seed-ark built from funeral cairns feels novel yet inevitable; inversion of preservation into scattering reframes real ecological anxiety. Folklore of leaf-vein messages is made specific through her engineered micro-shrines, not generic mysticism. Risk taken: quiet lyric stakes everything on a single internal reversal that pays off. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing the concept.</comment>
