<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s motivation—witness without judgment—remains internally coherent and is dramatized through her refusal to intervene with seekers. Yet because no second character shares the scene, the “relationship as crucible” test is moot; her interiority is lyrically rendered but stays at one emotional altitude, so the arc is flat. The final “fold that knowing into the swan” is a micro-choice that shows cost (she forfeits certainty), satisfying the 9+ quick test for credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last paragraph crystallizes her eternal stance and the price of perpetual witness. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated returns to the swan and refuge until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early (“Beneath the forgotten city…”) and anchors hold; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in “she forfeits her own name” and the softening swan—visible attrition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb library, obsidian chamber, and origami swan are rendered with tactile specificity; each recurs and constrains action (she must travel the folds, must sit on obsidian to heal). Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and silence, matching the keeper’s perceptual bias. The final image of the root punching through stone reuses the setting to mirror internal surrender, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“witness without judgment”—is signaled in paragraph three. Pressure escalates texturally: collapsing shelves, softening swan, growing silence; each beat deepens the cost of endurance rather than narrows external options. The keeper’s agency is the decision to keep witnessing; the price is her dissipating self. No reversal, but the single meaningful tightening (swan’s latest softening) is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: impermanence as serenity, not loss. Subtext lives in gesture—she places the torn page into the swan, word becoming silence. Final image reweights earlier motifs (crumbling, folding, silence) without moralizing. One abstract line (“Change is neither loss nor gain”) flirts with statement but is earned by prior concrete cycles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the keeper’s phenomenology; perceptual signature is water-and-stone imagery, loose grammar mirroring her fluid grip on reality. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for drift, fragments at pressure points (“The river moves.”). No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. Patterned elision (“not quite”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (folds, silence, crumbling). One clause—“grips reality loosely, the way one holds water”—risks cliché but is immediately particularized by her shifting corporeality. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the thematic pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses decaying knowledge-archive with meditative non-intervention; origami-as-memory-device feels fresh, not trope. Risk-taking in static plot is justified by Accumulative closure. Specificity of “moss claiming the philosophy section” prevents generic ruin-porn. Final reconfiguration makes earlier cycles feel inevitable, earning the +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
