<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s quietly determined core is shown through embodied micro-choices (descending mines alone, singing while quenching bolts) that carry escalating cost; her meekness is never abandoned but pressed into service, producing credible Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete, e.g. ore “vibrating against her ribs like a second heartbeat,” avoiding label-speak. The child’s apple beat crystallizes impact without sentimental override. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single moment, keeping this just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each bolt placed layers density until refugee return reweights the stake; closure is a quiet Charged Poise—Mira wraps the silk and returns to the forge, cost legible in perpetual labor and azure dare. Causality holds: silk → mine knowledge → resonance bolts → arch stability → return. Orientation anchored by word 50. No meaningful tightening turns on-page; escalation is steady accretion rather than a single intensifying pivot, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard plateaus, crumbling mine walls, and sky-bright azure are filtered through Mira’s smith-eye: stone temperature, ore hum, rope-ladder strain. The silk acts as micro-setting, constraining cooling ritual and final stance. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across ladder, arch, and forge; environment directly shapes every tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent orchard isolation—signaled early; pressure accrues bolt-by-bolt with visible fatigue cost (“climbed down weeping”). No reversal or tightening beat inside a single scene; risk remains static, resolved through accumulation rather than decisive trade-off. Cost is cumulative tiredness and ongoing servitude, satisfying Accumulative lens but limiting escalation spike needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet, iterative resilience emerges from concrete particulars—quenching song, bruised apple, azure defiance—never asserted. Final image of silk-shouldered Mira returning to the forge reweights prior labor as indefinite covenant, offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity persists in her continued doubt. One soft echo: “coaxing resilience from rubble” skirts thematic statement but is embedded in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is metallurgical—temperature, vibration, temper color. Syntax breathes with ritual pauses, then compresses under fatigue. No dialogue to test, yet narrative idiom stays blacksmith-grounded. Final silk wrap reprises earlier sensory cue with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high information density: “ore only responded to emotional intention” collapses world rule and stake in one clause. Rhythm varies, sentences lengthen during ritual, fragment under exhaustion. No synonym loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (coal, sky, heartbeat). One mixed image—“sky blazed like a challenge issued to anyone watching”—slips toward abstraction, keeping below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Resonance-ore that answers feeling, silk carrying collective memory, and orchard archipelago synthesize into fresh premise without gimmick. Transformation test fails: swap smith for gardener and tale still functions, limiting ceiling. Risk lies in quiet accretive structure rather than world gimmick; specificity of quench-song and bruised apple provides fresh inflection.</comment>
