<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to portraits while knowing they are theft—drives every micro-choice; the final unmaking is earned through a chain of embodied, painful actions. The crestfallen state is shown via tactile compulsion (fingernail tracing threads, chest seizing) rather than labels. One flaw: the lighthouse-keeper’s daughter is named then erased, never becoming pressure on Maren, so relationship crucible is absent. Still, the solo arc is coherent and the cost is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: 78 blank cards and a heart “finally empty enough to fill,” cost paid in the physical act of pulling pigment thread-by-thread. Causal lens holds: because she stole faces, the deck bleeds; therefore she must unmake them. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (spiral stairs, porthole, curved shelves). One hairline slip: “necessary darkness” is named twice before we see it, a micro-forecast that slightly blunts the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library-between-levels functions as micro-setting: curved walls press inward, dust exhales memory, the single porthole knife of light times the beats. The tarot box’s velvet threads literally snag her fingers, constraining the first unmaking motion. Lighthouse beam as metronome is specific and irreplaceable. No world-rule inconsistency; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she release the dead she has imprisoned?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: walls close, colors bleed, threads tangle; the tightening is a single deepening that forces the redesign. Agency is renunciation; cost is the literal destruction of each portrait and the pain “like dying.” No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: art as necromancy consumes the artist until she chooses grief over possession. Subtext lives in gesture—unthreading pigment is simultaneous mourning and murder. Final image of “heart finally empty enough to fill” reweights earlier theft without moralizing. One near-miss: “necessary darkness” flirts with abstract label but is salvaged by embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices dust motes as “suspended souls,” feels walls “pressing with accumulated memory.” Syntax lengthens under sorrow, then fragments during unmaking—rhythmic control matches pressure. No head-hop or register drift. Free indirect thought (“Was that even possible?”) is clean and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences vary in length and opening, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. “Luminescent ache” risks purple but is earned by the literal beam stabbing the porthole. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Copy is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—portraits that cannibalize their subjects—feels fresh yet inevitable; tarot deck as portable portrait-gallery is a sharp specific. The lighthouse library between floors is a spatial metaphor for liminal grief that hasn’t been overused. Risk: dismantling art to free souls could feel abstract, but thread-by-thread unmaking grounds it. Synthesis of visual-art magic and bereavement is memorable.</comment>
