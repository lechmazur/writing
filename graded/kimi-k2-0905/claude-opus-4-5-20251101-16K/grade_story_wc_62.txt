<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Miriam’s interior contradiction—clinging to grief while craving design breakthrough—plays out in concrete micro-choices: nightly vigils in the greenhouse, fingers on the ribbon, sudden sketching. The inherited craft and poem-trading custom feed her motives without slipping into exposition. Earned cost is legible when she accepts that mentorship ends the moment she no longer needs it, sealing her solitude. Minor slip: “thundering calm” is named rather than fully embodied in final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral design crystallizes under the monarch pulsing, reweighting collective grief from list to migration pattern. Causal chain—ghostly prompt → archival retracing → poem memory → spiral sketch—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by word 60; single transition (storage visit) is legible. Persistent cost: grandmother’s absence will widen once visits cease, felt in sternum “weight” line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, cracked panes, and wing-filtered October light constrain nightly ritual and sketch timing; monarchs’ communal roost supplies the pattern metaphor. Ribbon roll acts as micro-setting, its measurements dictating letter spacing and spiral spacing in climax. Spatial choreography clean: dusk arrival, bench perches, ribbon unroll, walk-around memorial concept. Weather and dusk evolving across beats track causal need for light to sketch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find form for collective grief—signaled paragraph 3; pressure tightens when archival study yields no blueprint, forcing reliance on ghost advice and butterfly observation. One meaningful deepening: realization that collective grief is “one wound…many names” turns list into spiral, foreclosing linear design option. Cost visible: acceptance of perpetual mentorship absence once project ends. No external antagonist needed; tension stays internal-design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited memory-as-migration emerges through monarch blood-maps and dinner-table poem lines; no explicit thesis stated. Spiral memorial offers resonant answer: grief moves, not lists. Ambiguity preserved—reader left to decide if spectral visits are real or projection—while closure image of “remembering how to fly” reweights earlier wing motifs. Final paragraph avoids moralizing; insight earned via iterative sketching under dying light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Miriam’s stonemason perception: noticing fracture patterns, letter spacing, weight of chisel-ready stone. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“She unrolled the woven ribbon and began sketching by dying light”—then elongates in reflective final paragraph, mirroring migration departure. Diction grounded in craft lexicon (“measuring letter spacing,” “blueprints”) without jargon drift. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors organic to setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose shows high density: single sentences perform atmosphere, memory, and action (“orange wings catching October light like stained glass”). No paraphrase loops; each image advances pattern or stakes. Metaphors consistent—glass, wings, maps—without mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrase (“spectral mentorship delivered through the quiet language of presence”) reads earned by lyric tilt taught early. Final line cadence varies sentence length to create closing bell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of grave-carving craft, monarch migration, and ghost mentorship feels specific and non-templated; transformation test fails if swapped to generic artist or birds. Family poem-trading custom freshens standard ancestral-ghost trope by linking blood-memory of butterflies to dinner-table verse. Spiral memorial concept offers non-obvious synthesis of collective grief. Risk in lyric ellipsis paid off via coherent closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
