<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses—clutching the charred letter while insisting she came to understand, not to blame—play out in embodied beats (pocket-press, folding the remnant). The mismatch metaphor reframes her self-concept without therapeutic self-labeling. Marguerite’s watch-vines stance crystallizes her role as pressure-giver, not sage dispenser. Closure renunciation lands with visible cost: she pockets the fragment transformed, foreclosing blame forever.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (amber light, fermenting-grape wind, burned-paper smell) tightens the emotional stake until the grafted-vine parable reweights the premise. The final image—“pocketed, transformed”—delivers Charged Poise with felt cost: tomorrow’s bus is gone, blame is foreclosed. Orientation anchored by 110 words; no teleporting props. One micro-turn: letter as excuse → letter as relic of mutual incapacity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The amber pavilion’s honeycomb glow and thinning vines physically constrain Clara’s sightline and metaphorical vocabulary; the burned paper’s tactile edge recurs as micro-setting that charges the final pocketing. Marguerite’s cottage invitation extends the vineyard’s autumn scent into next-scene possibility, keeping spatial choreography clean. Weather (dusk wind carrying ferment) affects attention rather than backdrop. Environment, body, and object together shape the parallel that enables renunciation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she keep blaming Thomas?—tightens once: vineyard parable reframes the mismatch, foreclosing revenge-memory. Pressure is textural, not antagonistic; each sensory beat thickens regret until the stance crystallizes. No coincidence; the missed bus is deliberate, amplifying cost. Visible price: she accepts perpetual ache (“carry, transformed”) and loses tomorrow’s escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from graft failure → love failure without authorial thesis. Final image reweights “never meant to hurt” from excuse to shared tragedy. Subtext lives in gesture: Marguerite pointing at sick vines instead of saying “you two were doomed.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—some drink the bitter wine gladly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters scene through Clara’s synesthetic bias (taillights “dissolving,” columns “glowed like honeycomb”). Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at letter touch. Marguerite’s diction carries vintner precision without caricature. No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template runs. Figurative language is selective—honeycomb, bitter fruit—each serving metaphoric parallel. Information density high: “burned edge...pressed like a small wound” fuses tactile prop and emotional state. Zero paraphrase loops; opening line anchors voice and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Vineyard-graft parable as relationship diagnostic feels fresh; mismatched rootstock becomes lived metaphor rather than trope decoration. Risk lies in quiet ending—no bus chase, no screaming—yet coherent lens justifies renunciation over spectacle. Specific detail (Merlot on Chardon­nay stock) prevents generic “garden” symbolism.</comment>
