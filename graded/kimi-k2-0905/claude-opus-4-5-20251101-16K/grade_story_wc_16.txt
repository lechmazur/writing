<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sera’s interior contradiction—ambition versus remorse—is dramatized in embodied beats (testing fragments on her tongue, tears during the symphony). Cassius’s withheld trust is credible; his micro-choice to pick up the pen crystallizes a status shift with visible cost. The final “try” lands as Earned Stasis, foreclosing permanent departure. No diagnostic label-speak; voice distinction holds between the two speakers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each promise functions as because/therefore linkage that progressively narrows exit options until shared singing becomes the only path. Orientation anchored by ~120 words; no teleporting props. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the glowing ink well reweights the premise, cost legible in the suspended final note. Persistent constraint: the carriage still departs in three hours, keeping price alive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Archive functions as micro-setting: narrow aisles force face-to-face negotiation, crates block exits, lamplight on ink well constrains attention. Selective sensory detail (dusty shelf, low pure note) mirrors internal thaw. The glass object’s evolving glow tracks relationship temperature, charging the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of collaborative trust—signaled early and tightened by three-hour clock. Each successive promise eliminates the option of leaving, escalating emotional cost rather than external danger. Agency shared: Sera risks career humiliation, Cassius risks re-injury. Final harmony is not automatic; it is payment for vows just spoken, price visible in the suspended note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as covenant, truth as audible vibration created by mutual obligation. No explicit moralizing; final glow reframes earlier ash-on-tongue image. Subtextual reversal: what was archive of death now births living sound. Complexity preserved—trust is begun, not guaranteed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers close to Sera; perceptual signature filters world through philological metaphor (“tombstone for words”). Syntax lengthens during intellectual recall, compresses during vow exchange, mirroring heartbeat. Dialogue carries subtext: “I’m offering this” sidesteps apology, advancing goal. No register drift; diction stays within scholar lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening structure; no template cadence runs. Figurative language sparse except where motif demands (“syllables wove together”), avoiding purple clog. Information density high: single sentence often layers emotional beat, world rule, and prop state. Zero paraphrase loops; pronoun reference clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magical linguistics grounded in performative-speech philosophy, then reframed through musical covenant. Risk taken—reality reshaped by honesty—yet mechanics remain consistent and character-driven. Transformation test fails if names swapped, because Veridian promise mechanics are bespoke. No derivative-premise guardrail triggered.</comment>
