<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s pacifism is dramatized in the raid flashback and directly motivates the climactic self-sacrifice; the interior contradiction between suppressed rage and professed mercy is shown in the “shadow work” beat, giving her final surrender a felt cost. Sera remains a symbolic bundle, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira’s rising into the sky is a literal release that forecloses her own survival while opening the dimension for Sera—cost is visible in “the dimensional door sealed itself.” Causal chain holds: pacifist refusal → tear-stitching ritual → portal opens → self-release. Orientation is clear by line 30; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The recycled ship is sketched with tactile specificity—salvaged panels, ultraviolet tear-shimmer, groaning hull—guiding Mira’s floating gait and supplying the 2-minute collapse clock that forces her final ascent. The green world beyond the breach is minimally shown, but its grass under Sera’s foot recharges the theme of grounded renewal. Micro-setting (Kwan Yin tear against sternum) constrains her breathing beat and is carried into closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock the dimension or humanity dies—tightens when Mira realizes only merciful self-confrontation works; the moment she admits hatred is the single deepening that reweights options. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens: each tear she stitches increments risk as the hull buckles. Cost is legible in her deliberate re-weighting toward loss (“she would be heavy enough to carry the child…then light enough to release her”).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-through-shadow-integration emerges from the tear-alchemy ritual and the bodhisattva’s ethic; no moral is stated. Final image of Mira ascending as Sera laughs re-prices mercy as an origin that includes acknowledged darkness. Subtext in the raid memory (“they lowered their weapons, bewildered”) quietly reframes non-violence as tactical, not naïve. Avoids platitudes; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s somatic perception—feet barely touching, tear blazing against sternum—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens during stitching meditation, then compresses in the hull-crack countdown, mirroring pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is waived. Prose rhythm is controlled, with purposeful repetition (“she let herself hate…she let go”) that teaches its pattern and pays off in the final float.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Strong verb choice—“floated,” “stitched,” “blazed,” “groaned”—keeps momentum; figurative language is sparse and coherent (“grief crystallized into something almost luminescent”). One scaffold loop: “she weaved…she felt…she let herself” triplet in mid-scene costs immediacy but does not obscure causality at closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; final third is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity-modulating joy gene + ancestral tear-memory as dimensional key is specific to this world. Pacifist victory through self-forgiveness flips the usual “sacrifice=violence” trope. Bodhisattva relic re-coded as tech-spiritual conduit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in the floating ascension is earned and coherent rather than gimmick.</comment>
