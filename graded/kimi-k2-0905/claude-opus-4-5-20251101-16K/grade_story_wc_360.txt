<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vesper’s interiority is concrete—she “wore his anguish like a coat” and feels formulas settle in her chest—yet her final renunciation (“she couldn’t tell anymore if the feeling was borrowed or her own”) lands with earned, visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test. The borrowed-personality trait actively shapes every micro-choice at the press, not merely labeled. Secondary pressure from Lumen is thin, and the apprentice’s dialogue drifts toward thematic mouthpiece, preventing the last decimal needed for 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the final image of Vesper “absorbing whatever light it still held” crystallizes her endurance while foreclosing any return to self-ownership; the cost is legible in the same sentence. Causal chain holds throughout—each vanished star tightens her urgency, leading to the last pamphlet—under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors arrive by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The topaz workshop is not mere postcard: its crystalline facets multiply dwindling starlight, providing the literal illumination Vesper needs to work, while the halo fragment’s garden-origin cues her first discovery of empathy-math. Spatial choreography is flawless— “hung the page to dry beside a hundred others” tracks object state across beats. Environment constrains the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates through accumulative star-loss beats; each disappearance tightens Vesper’s通宵 sprint to “print emotional equations” before total darkness. Agency remains hers—she chooses to absorb the fragment’s last light, paying the felt cost of self-erasure. One more on-page resource loss (ink, stamina, paper) would have pushed this into 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy as cosmic mathematics is enacted, not declared, culminating in the final re-pricing—stars vanish because the universe forgets how to feel, and Vesper’s pamphlets are the last equation. The closing image reweights “lucid turbulence” into mournful clarity. No final-paragraph sermon; the resonance is purely visual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a lapidary rhythm—“crystalline walls…fractured amber patterns”—that mirrors the gemstone setting; syntax lengthens and contracts with press-lever cadence. Perceptual signature is distinct: Vesper notices “geometry of loss” and “parabolic curve” where another protagonist would see tears. Dialogue is minimal but Lumen’s diction still feels slightly writerly, keeping this just under 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers image and information—“she borrowed personalities the way others borrowed books” compresses world-rule, motive, and metaphor in one clause. Figurative language is precise and patterned, never muddled. Rhythm accelerates across the final third without syntactic monotony, carrying the closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of letterpress mechanics with celestial empathy-math is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; the halo fragment as transfer electrode feels discovered, not invented. Risky concept commits fully—no retreat to metaphor—and the closure reweights the entire cosmos. Specificity of “garden of equations” and “topaz workshop” prevents genre pastiche.</comment>
