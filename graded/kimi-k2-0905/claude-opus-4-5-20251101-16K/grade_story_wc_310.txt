<question>1</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is textured (“stellar doubt,” “quietly enthusiastic”) and her coin-toss micro-choices externalize contradictory impulses. Yet the final “permission to choose differently” is asserted rather than dramatized; the eight-heads moment should sting more. Coins-as-memory motive is strong, but no embodied contradiction under peak pressure keeps her just short of 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mira accepts the role of witness, coins gathered “reverently” while space collapses—cost is the unchangeable past she must carry. Accumulative lens taught early via static grammar and coin pattern; final image crystallizes meaning without exposition. Orientation anchored by word 45; no lens drift. Slight sag in mid-section repeat of “backwards prophecy” exposition is the only drag.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The ambered deck, crystalline dome, and metallic coin-clicks create a tactile micro-setting that constrains her only possible action: listen and remember. Sensory choices (golden light, hiss of compressed spacetime) mirror internal contraction. Exterior galaxy glimpses stay subordinate to her bodily radius. Setting directly charges the closing image; meets 9-band gate but occasional adjective clusters (“golden resin that ancient astronomers…”) nudge it back.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find purpose in a doomed cosmos—tightens when the prophecy names her as witness, foreclosing the hope of changing fate. Second coin toss (eight heads) delivers visible micro-loss: the lots say her revelation is false, raising the price of self-authored meaning. Pressure escalates under accumulative pattern: each static translation increases density of knowledge until silence becomes responsibility. Could use one earlier concrete obstacle to push her toward the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particularized reversal: prophecy that reveals only the past still demands ethical attention. Subtext lives in coin metallic whisper and static hiss—memory as resistance against entropy. Final image of “coins clinked softly… for the next casting” non-literally answers the thematic question: meaning is minted by chosen repetition of witness. Avoids explicit moral; ambiguity between chance and choice lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors astronomical lexicon (“wavelength align,” “stellar doubt”) without register drift. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into clipped “Seven heads. Yes.” No dialogue, so voice purity scores high. Occasional loftiness (“distill the dying static into memory”) slightly lifts out of Mira’s colloquial floor but stays within her professional idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; information density strong—one sentence often does description, interior, and world-rule. Two adjacent “had already” past-perfect loops near midpoint create minor drag; likewise “backwards prophecy” phrase repeated four times edges template cadence. Otherwise clean, vivid verbs (“scattered like fallen stars,” “compressed into something almost musical”) and no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph propels to resonant close without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Contracting-universe witness premise feels fresh; coin-divination as memory-archive is an inventive synthesis. Risky backwards-time prophecy is taught early and paid off in the self-referential message naming Mira. Specificity—Sumerian shekels against Byzantine solidus—anchors cosmic scale in tactile history. Not quite 9 because concept’s implication (why coins beat dice or cards) remains unexplored, but transformation exceeds familiar tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: first paragraph declares her role; Development: two tosses decide whether to listen and whether prophecy is true, narrowing tactics; Closure: coins pocketed for next casting embodies her chosen witness loop. Cost visible—eight heads denies cosmic validation, forcing self-authoring. Irreplaceable: only random lots fit her order’s ethos against logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Coins appear in opening pocket, scatter on amber floor twice, close in pocket again—each touch reweights meaning from decision tool to memory archive. Metallic whisper against static hiss links personal scale to cosmic. Removing them severs both decision engine and thematic resonance of civilizations preserved in miniature.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Backwards prophecy shapes every beat: static messages dictate past, compel her listening sessions, and ultimately name her, foreclosing rebellion. Concept transforms familiar oracular trope into universe-scale archival duty. Closure reprises the self-referential message, making the concept indispensable to stakes and emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Trait seeded early (“quietly enthusiastic about this work once”), reappears as restrained flame against stellar doubt. Enables her to keep climbing stairs despite immutable doom. Not dramatized in body—voice or gesture could embody it under pressure—so stays mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Action “distill” named in first paragraph; each static session translates noise into memory, culminating in final stance. Without this iterative distillation the prophecy remains gibberish and her purpose never crystallizes. Process is specific—she mentally flips reversed phrases—tying action to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Understanding static bursts is taught paragraph 4, demonstrated in mid-story translation, and final listening beat. Mechanics matter: flipping reverse phrases reveals self-referential instruction. Story collapses if she merely “hears” voices without interpretive labor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Ambered deck gives sole vantagepoint and preserves moments in resin, literalizing her memory mission. Spatial grounding constrains movement—only spiral stairs exist—heightening isolation. Setting recedes in final beats; stronger tactile use (e.g., warm amber under fingers) could push higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Post-contraction cosmos supplies time’s backwards arrow and the existential squeeze, legitimizing prophecy logic. Functions as atmospheric clock rather than ticking countdown; hence mid-band. Necessary for premise yet does not tighten scene-level options minute-to-minute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Goal declared early, reiterated in static messages, and achieved via acceptance of witness role. Friction visible: lots deny certainty, forcing her to self-author purpose. Dramatized in two coin throws and final pocketing—choice shows cost of persistence without cosmic guarantee.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>“Stellar doubt” saturates imagery—dying star, frost around flame, cold between stars—and modulates into quiet resolve without losing chill. Tone coherent across beats, charging final amber glow with suspended uncertainty. Removing it would flatten emotional temperature and thematic ambiguity.</comment>
