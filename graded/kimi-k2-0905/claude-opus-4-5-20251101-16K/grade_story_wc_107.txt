<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Vera’s grief-forged solitude and compulsive narration are vivid; embodied moments (tucking the bookmark, feeling the torch) ground her. The shift from frozen grief to “softening” is legible, but the single-scene frame keeps the cost mostly prospective—she hasn’t yet lost or risked anything concrete—so the arc feels more announced than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: drip, drip of thaw and glass builds to Charged Poise—she sets down the vessel, interior melted, future open. Orientation is swift; causality is poetic pattern rather than event chain, but the final image reweights the bookmark and torch with undeniable felt cost. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cracked ceiling ice, torch flare, and the bookmark’s leather texture are filtered through Vera’s maker-eye and constrain her ritual. The control room’s dead panels act as negative space that lets sound echo and glass glow; environment is not backdrop but crucible. Meets 9- gate: torch and bookmark charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she stay frozen or melt into risk—tightens once: she finishes the vessel, surrendering perfect control. No external antagonist, but internal pressure grows with each drip and flame leap; the price is prospective (fragile glass, fragile self) rather than concrete loss, yet agency is clear under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of thaw-as-vulnerability emerges through glass metaphor and ice drips; no moralizing line tells us. Bookmark, torch, and vessel form a quiet triad that reconfigures “abandon” from betrayal to release. Final image invites counter-readings—hope and peril—without forcing a verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s maker-perception; syntax lengthens and shortens with flame rhythm. Self-narration device is announced early and paid off in last line. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Distinctive, controlled, read-aloud musical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is dense but patterned—glassblower-as-surgeon, thaw-as-danger—taught by 25% mark and never muddies causality. No loops or scaffold; each sentence layers image or stakes. One mixed moment—“the thawing heart…requires containers”—leans therapeutic, but line is saved by immediate tactile follow-through.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic glassblower reclaiming a weather station feels fresh; embedding climate grief in craft specifics avoids trope drift. Self-narration as survival tic is a novel psychological detail. Risk is present but modest—no structural experiment—so stays below 9.</comment>
