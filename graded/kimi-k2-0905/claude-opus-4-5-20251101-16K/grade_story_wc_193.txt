<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“gut hollowed,” “warm and pulsing”), and the parallel-self texts give a concrete mechanism for interior contradiction. The final paradoxical promise is a micro-choice that visibly costs her the safety of certainty. Backstory is cleanly cued and tilted by present action. Flaw: the overseer appears once to assign the task, so status crucible is under-used; the diamond epiphany is slightly articulated rather than purely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant) taught by luminous density and cadence; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“the promise itself is already the diamond”—with undeniable cost (she must live the paradox). Orientation anchored within 120 words via who/where/when and fungal glow. One clean shard transition into the Deep Chamber; tightening occurs when she redefines the promise. Causality remains coherent; no late rule changes.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory triage—indigo pulses, salt-crystals of grief—mirrors her attention economy. The bolt recurs as micro-setting that constrains her final choice, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is tight: from workstation → rows → Chamber → exit. Occasional adjective clusters (“impossible colors that existed only at the corners of vision”) flirt with overwriting but serve the reality-fold premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate pressure into diamonds”—is signaled early and re-weighted by her paradoxical promise that collapses into knowledge instead of gems. One meaningful tightening inside the Chamber: quantum promises destabilize until she risks redefinition. Cost is legible: she forfeits certainty and must shoulder the burden of helping others. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: predatory promises (pyramid, quantum) versus self-authored paradoxical promises. Subtext lives in object handling (bolt as anchor) and glitch typography. Final re-pricing crystallizes without moralizing—“diamonds that looked exactly like hard-won truth.” Minor echo of thematic label “pressure into diamonds” in closing line, but it is reweighted, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: spartan, slightly sardonic diction salted with tech-mystic vocabulary (“reality-seam,” “quantum-locked”). Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—longer coils for contemplation, clipped fragments during paradox pronouncement. Glitch orthography is consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. One register climb (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by metaphysical stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: sentences couple sensory, emotional, and world-rule data (“grief crystallize into salt”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled; mixed metaphor check passes. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored. One filter-verb cluster (“she’d seen… she’d watched… she’d learned”) in reflective block is acceptable under BRR allowance and does not stall momentum.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of pyramid-scheme trauma with quantum-mechanical promise logic feels fresh and inevitable; neither strand would work without the other. Risky paradox resolution (promise kept & broken) is fully grounded in prior bolt-as-anchor motif. Specific detail (“glitchy text… letters flickering between dimensions”) prevents abstraction. Voice, world rule, and emotional arc cohere into a singular stance.</comment>
