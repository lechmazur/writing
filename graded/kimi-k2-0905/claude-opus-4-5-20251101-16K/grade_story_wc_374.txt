<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vera’s skeptical interiority flickers across beats, but the climactic acceptance turns mostly on external dialogue rather than a visible internal contradiction; her embodied emotion (silver glow) is evocative yet static, and the final “hope/wonder” is label-summarized, not embodied. The ring-passing lineage motivates curiosity, yet her micro-choices under pressure are thin; nevertheless, the earned shift from detached observer to weather-carrier satisfies at length with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing: Vera tastes her own starlight, reweighting the premise that weather is external; cost is felt because her anachronistic glow now signals belonging, not obsolescence. Accumulative lens holds: repeated sensory motifs (taste shifts, ring warmth, aurora spill) tighten until personal atmosphere crystallizes, one credible deepening within 700 words.</comment>

<comment>Lavender stalks, aurora river, and tin ring create a micro-setting triangle that guides attention and constrains Vera’s final stance; orientation anchored within 120 words. Weather-carriers’ spatial choreography stays legible; environment performs pressure rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn why weather clings to people”—propels the search; the final convergence forces recognition that she is also a carrier, foreclosing outsider stance with visible cost. Pressure tightens once via taste shift and ring warmth; luck complicates via their arrival but does not resolve. Meeting high-band cost clarity but without persistent constraint shaping later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of planetary consciousness speaking through human vessels emerges via sensory pattern, not lecture. The final image of tasting starlight reweights the tin heirloom and aurora into one silent answer. Some poetic phrasing nears abstraction yet stays anchored to Vera’s tongue; ambiguity lingers without confusion. No final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains silver-tinted perceptual signature; syntax modulates between reflective elongation and present-tense compression. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under aurora light. Diction occasionally over-glitter (“terrestrially cosmic” twice) but stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong sonic propulsion and synesthetic density; however, figurative layering crowds some beats (“aurora painting her luminescent skin in shifting hues” atop “purple stalks bending under waves of light”). No loops or scaffold, but two mixed metaphors mildly dull the penultimate beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Meld of obsolete bioluminescence, taste-based forest suffrage, and weather as contagion feels fresh and specific. The tin ring reframes compass logic from cardinal to need-based, a non-obvious reconfiguration. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure without obscuring causality.</comment>
