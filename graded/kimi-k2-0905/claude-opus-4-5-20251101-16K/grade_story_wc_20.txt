<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt-driven forging of the lantern crystallizes her arc; the embrace with Edris lands as earned renunciation of her perfectionism. Interiority is concrete (“she let herself be unsteady”), but the fourteen-year backstory block is summary-heavy, muting simultaneous contradiction under peak pressure. Still, the golden seams visibly externalize her flaw and its cost, satisfying the 9- gate for embodied change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mira’s past cruelty → lantern-making → light summons Edris → naming stakes reframed. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s glow reweights “balance” into acceptance, with the visible cost of her public vulnerability in the embrace. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Foundry micro-setting constrains every move: dormant furnaces dictate silence, rain on tin supplies the drum that times her hammering, amber forge-light becomes the final beacon. The cracked crucible fragments track spatially across the bench into the lantern, charging the closure image. Weather and iron smell are filtered through Mira’s alchemical priorities, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she mend what her rigidity broke—tightens once: the decision to pour gold into personal failures forecloses her lifelong creed of flawless equilibrium. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible: she offers the imperfect lantern and her own unsteadiness as restitution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “fractures made luminous” emerges from the lantern’s seams rather than any articulated maxim; the final image reconfigures naming itself as malleable metal. Subtext in the coin’s return and the rain’s hush carries regret without sermon. One minor echo risk: “learn that names can stretch” flirts with thematic statement but is saved by immediate bodily embrace that pays the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mira’s alchemical perceptual field—smell of wet iron, color of molten gold—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then compresses during the pour, mirroring her regained balance. Dialogue at the door is spare, adolescent, distinct from the narrator’s metallurgical lexis; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long reflective sentences broken by hammer-beat fragments. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances either furnace state or emotional charge. One mixed metaphor watch: “silver threads” of rain beside “golden rivers” survives because both are metallic and refract light, sustaining alchemical through-line. Clean proofing, strong verbs, zero filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi alchemy as literal craft-process rather than metaphoric sticker is fresh; coupling it with naming-as-alloy gives a memorable inflection. The “lantern made from failure shards” feels specific to this voice and world. Risk of sentimental trope is averted by keeping the lantern visibly lopsided and the reunion quiet rather than triumphant.</comment>
