<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mira’s contradiction—yearning to speak yet encoding silence—remains abstract; no embodied beat shows her throat “catching like thorns.” The caretaker is only foreshadowed, so relationship pressure is postponed. The renunciation (ghostly patience) is earned by forty-year pattern, cost felt in “endless, patient song,” but interiority drifts into lyric summary rather than micro-choice under present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the caretaker will tomorrow trace the spiral, reconfiguring Mira’s silence into sideways speech; cost is the irreversible ghost-state itself. Accumulative lens holds: each stanza thickens the mural-texture until the final lightning-breath crystallizes meaning. Orientation is lyric-taught early (floating monastery, disembodied POV) and pays off at closure; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The mist-stone courtyard is recurhandled: Mira drifts across it, presses iron into it, and will be read from it tomorrow. Flower press bolt plate is tactile, hidden, worn smooth—object-as-setting that charges the ending. Sensory economy favors wet-stone, iron-weight, lightning-flash, all filtered through ghost-perception. Spatial logic is consistent; no anchor drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the unsaid—tightens once: the caretaker’s arrival triggers tonight’s final engraving, foreclosing Mira’s own vocal future. Pressure is textural: each lightning beat adds another glyph, deepening density rather than causal chain. Cost is legible: the spiral costs the last of Mira’s dissolvable energy, leaving her “held breath” in wall-stasis. Sufficient for 600-word lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: sideways speech vs. stone silence. Final image reweights earlier “moisture stains” into love-letters, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the caretaker actually reply?—yet emotional aftereffect is palpable. No thesis statement; particulars carry resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively lyric-ghost: syntax elongates like mist, then snaps short at thunder. Perceptual signature—soundless lightning, whale-thunderheads, iron weight—remains consistent. Compression (“driftingly alert”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no contamination; free-indirect stays clean within post-human lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breath-matches lightning/thunder cadence; sentence variety strong. Figurative language is dense but patterned, justified by accumulative lens. Minor scaffold: “driftingly alert” appears twice without new pressure; not in closure zone. No mixed metaphors; props track. High information density—each sentence layers code, memory, and texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of graffiti palimpsest and ghost-code feels fresh; transforms familiar “haunted monastery” trope. Bolt-plate as stylus is specific, irreversible invention. Risk in disembodied POV pays off by crystallizing reader as future caretaker. Emotional specifics—thorns in throat, sideways leak—ground universality.</comment>
