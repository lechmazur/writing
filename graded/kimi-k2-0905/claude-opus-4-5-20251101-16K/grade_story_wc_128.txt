<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s “whimsically attentive” trait is shown through tactile beats—porters’ signatures, folded paper—but his pivot from passive curiosity to active foundation-builder is asserted rather than dramatized; the decisive choice to create the foundation is summarized in one paragraph, so the cost feels second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: misaddressed envelope → broker’s hunt → seamstress found → reunion → foundation; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights “silent contributors” with visible social cost (the locket photo now publicly honored). The leap from personal favor to institutional foundation is compressed into a single expository paragraph, muting the felt price to Marcus himself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Salt-air rooftop archive, basement camphor-rosin sewing room, and the non-existent Anchor Street anchor the emotional geography; the locket-as-micro-setting constrains the final museum placement. Sensory selection is filtered through Marcus’s cargo-eye—cranes, manifests, parking structure where a house once stood—so environment guides choice without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will compassion complete its cycle?”—tightens once when Marcus decides to deliver Vera in person; the pressure is social, not personal, so the cost accrues to the community rather than the protagonist. Escalation is linear (one deepening) and coincidence (wind-delivered envelope) starts, not solves, the conflict—acceptable under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the locket’s journey from private gratitude to public artifact; no character moralizes. The final image—photo labeled at last—reweights every earlier “invisible” worker without sermon, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly lashed to Marcus’s perceptual quirks—margins of manifests, mis-numbered streets. Occasional elevated diction (“charged the final image”) drifts above cargo-broker idiom but remains legible; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“hope and disbelief braided together”) and a filter-verb cluster (“he thought about…”) slightly dull peak immediacy but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The “misaddressed thank-you” hook refreshes the familiar “pay it forward” arc; maritime-archive rooftop and seamstress basement supply fresh social texture. Risk is moderate—institutional coda could feel pat—but specificity of cargo-culture details prevents generic uplift.</comment>
