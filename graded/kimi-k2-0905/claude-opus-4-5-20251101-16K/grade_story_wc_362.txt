<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—scientist clinging to a disproven faith—remains concrete through frost-reading micro-choices and the bodily laugh-tears beat. The renunciation of publication is earned by the prism vision that exposes her grandmother’s fabrication yet confirms real magic, paying visible cost (funding already lost, reputation forfeited). Only nit: “firmly grounded” is asserted once without tactile corroboration at that instant.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prism-scattered rainbows crystallize her new vocation—tend the garden, teach the next initiate—costing her the scientific proof she once sought. Accumulative lens holds: each frost pattern, pillar hum, and prism refraction layers emotion-density until the final image reweights the premise. The 120-word anchor clears (wagon, mist, quartz arbor). No因果 ruptures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quartz pillars and frost-rimmed glass constrain every act—she reads, kneels, drops the prism onto frost—charging the final rainbow splash. Mist-pool geography stays consistent; sensory economy favors crystalline touch and dawn chill over visual tourism. The prism’s micro-setting satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove emotion-imprinting—tightens when the prism reveals her life’s work rests on deliberate lies, forcing a stance shift: abandon academic vindication yet embrace real magic. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is the revoked funding and forsaken peer legitimacy already on-page. Accumulative escalation via frost visions and pillar hum suffices under textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Truth-grown-from-lies emerges through frost glyphs and prism visions, never sermonized. Final image of rainbow-drenched quartz reconfigures meaning without moral tag. Thematic echo penalty waived—no final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person dwells inside Vera’s selective perception—stones “remember,” frost “tells stories”—syntax lengthens during wonder, contracts at laugh-tears. No head-hop; prism and frost sensory filter remains character-specific. Distinctive diction (“crystalline prayers,” “truth dressed in lies”) modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with discovery—short clauses for stagger, longer for awe. Figurative control disciplined: crystals, frost, light motifs recur without mixed-metaphor clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances knowledge or image. One scaffold risk: “truth dressed in lies, lies that wore truth’s patient face” borders tautology but pays off as cadence capstone, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Emotion-imprinting via engineered quartz is fresh; frost-divination through car-window fractals feels idiosyncratic and inevitable. Grandmother’s deceit-turned-real subverts the “science vs. magic” template without late-rule cheating. Transformation test: swap prism for crystal ball, story collapses—specificity holds.</comment>
