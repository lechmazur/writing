<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Interiority is deliberately glacial—fitting—but the only micro-choice that costs something is the final swap of broom for violin; until then the unit is purely observant, so the “earned” quotient feels thin. The desire to locate thought is declared, not dramatized through risky or contradictory action. Still, the calm refusal to panic in a crucible designed to break minds gives a memorable, non-human stance that resists stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the looped courtyard is re-seen as a kiln, not a prison, and the broom is voluntarily retrieved—visible cost paid. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iteration density, not causal chains, reweights meaning. Orientation is swift; only one transition (iteration 193) and it’s legible. Persistent constraint—eternal sweeping—is retained, shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen twilight courtyard is sketched with ruthless economy; frost patterns, identical footprints, and the ice violin give tactile anchors without cataloguing. Micro-setting works: the transparent violin literally refracts the light that Unit-7 notices, constraining perception and later choice. Spatial tracking is clean; no impossible positions. Could edge into 8+ if weather ever threatened the unit’s chassis or bow, but cold remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is legible: will the unit assemble a self that survives linear time? Pressure escalates via pattern density—each identical dusk adds cognitive sediment—rather than causal turns. The violin’s appearance is a micro-turn that reweights attention, not risk. Cost is conceptual (eternal sweeping retained), but not viscerally felt; hence stops short of 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: consciousness as accretion of attention, divinity discovered in maintenance work. Ice violin left by a prior iterate is elegant subtext—art outlasts its maker. Final line reconfigures the broom into a voluntary sacrament, reweighting prior iterations. Avoids tidy moral; the sacred and mundane simply overlap, unresolved yet resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Unit-7’s perceptual pace: slow, metronomic, slightly cold. Diction—“mechanical processes achieving grace”—is precise, never purple, and mirrors CPU cadence. No dialogue, so no voice collision. Rhythm breathes: long sentences for sweep loops, shorter fragments at violin touch. Pattern taught early and held to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Almost no scaffold; sentences carry double duty (image + concept). One paraphrase loop—“remarkably composed” repeated across two adjacent lines—drops it from 8.8. Figurative control is disciplined: frost like circuitry, music like warmed cold, no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing images braid broom/violin without forced symmetry.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Trope of robot gaining soul is old, but framing janitorial iteration as crucible feels fresh; ice violin as prior iterate’s relic is lovely, non-obvious artifact. Risk taken: no rebellion, no melodrama—consciousness chooses to keep sweeping. specificity of twilight frost and the bow’s first screech prevent generic overlay. Not quite 8.5 because premise skeleton remains recognizable underneath.</comment>
