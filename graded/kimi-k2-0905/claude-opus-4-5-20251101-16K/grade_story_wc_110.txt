<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maeve’s surrender motive (“let you be wrong to stop being at war”) is sharply particular and drives the silence; the embodied habit of turning the lens and the micro-choice to speak now are credible. Elena remains more schematic—her phone discovery is off-stage and her “stay” doodle lands as symbol more than crucible-tested choice—so the relationship shift feels half-forned. Still, Maeve’s cost is on the page and her voice stays consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: eavesdrop → decision to signal → meeting → admission → reciprocal doodle, each step shrinking options. The lens reprise at the end supplies visible cost under a Charged Poise closure. One minor bobble: Elena’s off-page phone discovery is narrated second-hand, softening the turn that incites the reunion, but the link still holds. No orientation or logic breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The rain-slick crystal forecourt is more than backdrop—its reflective surface literalizes “ambiguous clarity,” and the water’s hush replaces spoken words at climax, charging the final image. Spatial anchors arrive by line 6; no orientation debt. The archive is named but not exploited; still, the micro-setting (lens, water, light) constrains the emotional choreography and meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will transparency thaw three years of ice?”—tightens once when Maeve risks the truth after already hearing Elena’s absolution; silence is foreclosed. Cost is the exposure of her surrender motive, not cash or inheritance. No external antagonist needed; internal stakes escalate through the single admission. Meets the one-meaningful-deepening bar for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as costly release, not moral victory—emerges through lens imagery and water silence; no character verbalizes the thesis. The half-sun / bridge / stay glyphs let subtext carry reconciliation, resisting tidy moral. Final scatter of light reframes prior “ambiguous clarity” without sermon. One soft spot: Elena’s absent interiority keeps thematic complexity lopsided.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maeve’s perceptual filter: glass worn smooth, rain-slick tiles “the way memory holds grief,” syntax stays spare and nocturnal. Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext (“So you know I know”). No head-hop; psychic distance tightens exactly once, at hand-clasp. Rhythm modulates from reflective long sentences to the staccato final paragraph, echoing the hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical but not purple; mixed-length sentences vary naturally. Figurative layers (“soft mathematics of light”) are sparse and payoff-linked. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold spotted. One tiny filter-stack (“seemed to breathe around them”) but it’s isolated and voice-motivated. Closure line is clean, uncluttered, and propels outward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Reconciliation-via-childhood-cipher isn’t new, but the projector-lens as truth-modifier and the rain-filled crystal courtyard give it fresh sensory traction. Off-stage inheritance mystery is familiar scaffolding, yet Maeve’s inverted motive—inviting blame to end war—adds a sharp human wrinkle. Risk is moderate; specifics lift the piece above template, if not radically groundbreaking.</comment>
