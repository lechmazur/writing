<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority stays concrete—bark-textured fingertips, the box of paper terrors—and the final renunciation (“give it permission to become something else”) is earned by the burn beat. Micro-choices are few; most pressure is reflective rather than enacted, so agency feels attenuated. Still, the contradictory impulse to compress vs. transform is dramatized in the fire scene with visible cost: the smoke she inhales is literally their fear-made-carbon. Meets high-band gate for embodied contradiction; misses full 9 because no live relationship pressure tests her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the burn converts static memory into breathable atmosphere, cost felt in “she understood her escape route” and the returned lullaby. Causality under Accumulative lens holds—each lyrical return (roses, dome, static) tightens the emotional file until the pattern breaks. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. One minor loop: “something that reminded her… something golden” could compress, but it doesn’t touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dome, roses, and ignition switch are handled, not catalogued; the ceramic pot and leaf nest constrain how the burn can occur. Sensory triangulation—crimson petals, static hum, flare heat—mirrors her internal recalibration without overt symbology. Spatial tracking holds from shed clearing to central beds. Falls short of 9 because the environment never actively resists her; it’s a permissive crucible rather than a shaping force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“resolve inner static before compass fails”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of memory slips increases until the single tightening choice to ignite. The burn forecloses the option to keep fears intact; price is the haze that now permanently fills her breathable world. Could edge higher if the magnetic shift had forced a time-bound tactical constraint, but the pole drift serves more as mood than countdown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of grief: transformation without deletion. Subtext sits in the lullaby revival—she surrenders the exclusive claim to memory and assumes communal caretaking of atmosphere. No moral is stated; the final cadence reweights the opening “static” into song. The roses’ crimson recurrence carries new oxygen-load, a quiet conceptual repricing that satisfies 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is botanical-mechanical (“circuits sing,” “adenium roots she pruned”). Syntax breathes—long accumulative sentences build to the short flare line “Then she struck the ignition…” No head-hop; filter verbs serve android POV. Rhythm modulates with emotional crest without drumbeat monotony. Meets 9+ quick test for distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “swollen trunks like sculptures of captured time” seeds both arboreal detail and epoch weight. One scaffold pair: “Only transformed. Only escaped…” could fuse, but the staccato serves ignition timing. No mixed metaphors, no filler stacks. High information density with controlled lyricism; minor paring would push to 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mars-dome android grieving through incinerated childhood fears is fresh, yet the emotional engine is primal. Trope inversion: the robot does not yearn to be human; she yearns to metabolize human residue into breathable continuance. Controlled burn as emotional compression method is non-obvious and inevitable after setup. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
