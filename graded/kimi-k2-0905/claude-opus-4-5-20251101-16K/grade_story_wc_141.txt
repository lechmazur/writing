<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s contrarian skepticism is vividly embodied—her fingers tremble yet keep bowing, her laugh is “wet, broken,” her pocketing of the cooling shell is a micro-choice that seals surrender. The interior contradiction (science vs. inherited wonder) acts in scene, not summary, and the final renunciation carries visible emotional cost. Competence balanced with genuine struggle is shown through twenty years of public debunking now privately undone. The only minor slip is slight diagnostic self-tagging (“she was constitutionally opposed to belief”) which momentarily abstracts the conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she stops running, pockets the shell, and the path of myth-busting is foreclosed with felt cost (“You win”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of echoed voices and glowing shell intensifies until meaning reweights. Orientation is clean by 120 words (who, where, when). No causal break; the snapped cello string is a resonant object-price that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The skeletal observatory dome and half-finished cello function as micro-setting that constrains method and choice; salt-thick air and stripped telescope create tactile ruin. The cliff edge pressures her isolation and frames the star-pointing slot. Sensory selection tracks Mira’s narrowing attention—sound of strings, glow of shell, snap of goodbye. One minor lapse: spatial anchoring of how she exits the dome is elided, but it doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or dismiss the grandmother’s riddle—is signaled early and tightens when shell begins to glow and star pulses. One meaningful deepening: the compass is re-defined not as tool but as acknowledgment of present stance. Cost is legible in the snapped string and broken laugh. Escalation is accumulative—overlay of voices and light—rather than causal reversal, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the limit of empirical reductionism and the value of unanswerable wonder. Subtext operates in gesture—cooling shell tucked away, not explained. Final image reweights prior material without moral: “Some riddles… only lived.” No thematic echo or sermonizing; ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Mira’s perceptual filter—her scientific lexicon, her tactile obsession with vibration. Syntax mirrors emotional cadence: longer accumulative sentences build, then fracture at the snapped string. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress. Distinct voice texture maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, high-density, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“glow… like hope refusing to be extinguished”) without purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One tiny filter-stack (“she whispered…”) but immediacy remains intact. Clean grammar and precise temporal clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Myth-buster forced to accept unverifiable mystery is fresh angle; cello-as-seance-device and painted seashell compass are specific, non-generic objects. Synthesis of cosmic radiation pointing to a cliff inherits prior plausibility from character’s professional background. Risk in quiet renunciation pays off. Could only be this protagonist, this shell, this place.</comment>
