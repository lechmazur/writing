<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s solitary vocation and “cathedral of solitude” are vivid; her refusal to falsify data shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the final beat—closing the ledger—reads more symbolic than pressured; no fresh contradiction is forced. The trembling hands after the tailing are a nice corporeal cue, yet her emotional plateau once home flattens too quickly, muting the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis: she keeps recording, accepting surveillance risk. Causal chain intact—pigeon → pattern recognition → decision; no teleporting facts. Orientation anchored by word 90. One minor quibble: the unseen follower’s report is told-not-shown, softening the final cost beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Courtyard’s stone bench, jasmine, and fountain ground every reflective beat; weather data becomes tactile setting. Micro-setting works—the broken message tube in her fingers reorients space. Environment never forces a tactical change, capping the score just below excellence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. administrative silence—signalled early. Pressure tightens when she links missing rainfall to covert containment; option to falsify is foreclosed by her choice to log honest numbers. Cost is present but intellectual; reader feels admiration more than danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—integrity as quiet resistance—emerges through meteorological minutiae, never sermon. Final image of “small stubborn flame” risks cliché yet stays saved by sensory surround (fountain, jasmine). Subtext that rain itself is stolen gives conceptual bite.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains calm, meteorological diction mirroring a recorder’s mind. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for reflection, clipped fragments for threat. No dialogue to test, but free-indirect motion is clean and voice-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, information-dense; lines multitask—“amber light pooled” sets time, mood, bodily focus. Few filter verbs; metaphors stay meteorological, coherent. Only micro-loop: “quiet felt almost sacred” echoed by “quiet courtyard” two graphs later.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Using storm data as forensic evidence of a hidden atrocity is fresh; character’s weapon is calibration, not heroics. Familiar trope of “buried government atrocity” lifted by scientific framing. Twist feels inevitable in hindsight—no late rule changes.</comment>
