<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority stays concrete—her heartbeat becomes percussion, the locust shell’s tumble triggers the epiphany—yet her contradictory impulses (risk vs. safety) are told rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation (invitation not theft) is seeded early but the cost is felt more abstractly than bodily; still, the embodied metaphor of “silver roots pulling free” keeps her above stock-epiphany territory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: grandmother’s map → orchard arrival → statue hesitation → heart-rhythm invitation → trees choose exile; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza’s concrete foreclosed, the city’s efficiency rule-set re-weighted by living silver. Cost is visible—“the city was still mechanical…something ancient had taken root”—a persistent constraint that will draw backlash.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensorial economy: “resonantly soft” is heard through chest first, “glowing purple” fruit against chrome, locust shell as micro-setting that charges the final ornament. Spatial choreography clean—sky-bridge height vs. plaza ground, statues’ stone feet cracking earth—anchors every move. Environment directly shapes tactic: marble guardians force musical instead of physical breach, qualifying for 9- gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rekindle wonder without theft—signals early and tightens when statues step forward; the micro-turn is the trees’ collective agency that redefines trespass as invitation. Escalation driven by Mira’s agency: each heartbeat-layer in the melody softens guardian hostility and narrows her option to retreat. Price legible: orchard uprooted, city rule-set destabilized, Mira’s future vigil under the silver branch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of trespass → invitation, paved-over wonder → self-transplanted magic; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of clockwork citizens “stuttering then steadying into something less precise but more alive” reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity embraced: city still mechanical, orchard now vulnerable—resonates beyond plot. Subtext in statue hesitation: their silence carries the question “what is theft if the giver chooses?”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—“sound traveled differently than sound”—with rhythmic cadence that mimics bow strokes. No head-hopping; marble guardians’ confusion is shown through external gesture. Diction within POV compass; “resonantly soft” repeated as purposeful motif, not template churn. Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” meta-comment is brief and earns its place at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does setting-work and emotion-work—“silver roots pulled free from enchanted soil with a sound like sighing.” No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (music = ripple = heartbeat). Rhythm accelerates during tree-uprooting march, then breathes at dawn plaza. Final line cadence mirrors opening “resonantly soft,” creating purposeful echo without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses steampunk clockwork with living orchard guarded by chess-piece statues—fresh synthesis. Inversion of heist trope: protagonist invites the treasure to walk away. Locust shell re-weighted from relic to ornament embodies transformation without metaphor overload. Risk taken in quiet victory rather than explosive rebellion; coherence maintained, stakes heightened.</comment>
