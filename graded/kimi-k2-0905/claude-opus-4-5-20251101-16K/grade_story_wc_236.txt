<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—bereft of scent yet hyper-attuned to emotional micro-clues—grounds every beat; the moment she decides to leave the screw inside the clock crystallizes her new hierarchy of values. The client’s grief is rendered through trembling knuckles and knotted hands, not labels. One flaw: the grandmother-backstory paragraph is abstract summary, muting a second layer of contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the screw’s retained presence re-weights time from measured hours to measured lives, cost felt in the client’s straightened shoulders and Elena’s trembling calm. Causal chain—find screw → recognize origin → re-interpret gift → leave screw—holds without gaps. Orientation is clean by line 12; lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught by drip cadence and held to last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fog and dripping clocks create a micro-climate that filters perception; the brass clepsydra on the bench functions as “setting” and directly constrains the fix-or-reveal choice. Sensory economy favors touch and sight, mirroring Elena’s absent smell. Only nit: street geography beyond the window remains a placeholder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the client receive a usable keepsake that still carries her daughter’s code—tightens once the screw is recognized. Elena’s micro-choice to leave the screw inside forecloses a “pure” repair and pays a credibility cost with herself (she breaks her own rule). Pressure escalates via accretion of clues rather than external antagonist, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—meaning hides inside brokenness—emerges through the screw’s migration from jam to jewel; no character sermonizes. Subtext lives in gesture: client’s fingers on blue cloth equal unsaid apology for unlived conversations. Final image of twin screws re-prices Elena’s own loss without declaring it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elena’s perceptual grid; diction (“maps emotional terrain,” “occluded views”) is hers, not authorial. Rhythm mirrors water drip: longer sentences for reflection, curt fragments for recognition beats. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts palpably when she turns the screw to the light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; strong verbs (“fractured,” “wedged,” “cradled”) minimize adjectives. No mixed metaphors or filler-stacks. One minor loop: “measured in drops rather than ticks” is conceptually repeated three beats later; trims 0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Midwife-screw-inside-clepsydra is a fresh, specific synthesis; the object literalizes “delivering time.” Risk lies in quiet Accumulative structure rather than dramatic showdown, but payoff justifies choice. Could edge higher with a sharper secondary surprise.</comment>
