<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sera’s tactile language gift is embodied in every beat; grief for her daughter fuels the search and the final kneeling moment where she “weeps” and draws the melody-map. The contradiction—mapping what she cannot see—drives all micro-choices and earns the ending renunciation. No interior label-speak; emotion is pressed through bark, ring, and silence. Cost is legible: the map she presses to her chest is both relic and farewell.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each note, tree, and silence layer tightens the stake until the stillpoint stills the compass needle and reweights grief into song. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Sera’s map now encodes loss as music, foreclosing further search. Causality holds: because she absorbs language, she can receive the forest’s final message; because the stars pause, the stillpoint is reachable. Cost is on-page: “quiet blaze burned through her—grief and relief…”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop; its bark, choir, and silence actively transmit memory and physically guide her cane-less walk. The platinum ring’s temperature shift anchors the final image. Micro-setting—her palm on earth—delivers the daughter’s last moments, constraining Sera’s choice to map song, not terrain. Selective, pressure-filtered detail; no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find the stillpoint to locate the daughter’s fate. Escalation is accumulative: each new note tightens the musical trail, raising the cost of failure. The forest’s final silence forces stance crystallization—she receives the emotional truth and must convert it into notation. Price is irreversible: the compass stops, the search ends, the map becomes song.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: cartography of land becomes cartography of loss; maps chart what cannot be walked. Subtext lives in gesture—ring going cold, parchment against heart—never sermon. Final image reweights “navigation” from geographic to emotional, offering no moral, only charged poise. Ambiguity lingers: transcendence or death? The forest keeps the answer ultrasonic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Sera’s tactile frequency; diction—“braille written by the earth,” “suspended teardrop”—is blind-mapmaker specific. Rhythm swells and stops with the musical trail, mirroring her breath. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Compression taught early (“words seep into her skin”) pays off at the silent stillpoint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lyrical elongation to the staccato “Then, silence.” No loops or scaffold; each image advances knowledge or pressure. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple drift yet vivid: “flames feeding on their own light.” Ring temperature, note progression, and constellation pause track cleanly. Final line lands with cadence punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Tactile language absorption plus ultrasonic forest synthesizes fresh mythos; the stillpoint as musical notation is non-obvious. Grief-mapping reframes cartography as elegy—risky, yet fully committed. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if Sera is sighted or forest is audible; concept is inseparable from character.</comment>
