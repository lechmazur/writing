<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—yearning for her father while accepting his necessary distance—are embodied in her tactile reading of wood grain and her refusal to follow him into death. The final renunciation is earned: she presses the desk once, then gathers the logbook to build her own threshold-less maze. Interiority stays specific to her perceptual lens (“featherly determined,” “fractured hush”). No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren forecloses the path of pursuit and accepts the cost of building alone. Causal chain holds—logbook + grain analysis → understanding → renunciation—without gaps. Orientation is taught lyrically early (prism terrace, balloons) and anchors by word 80. One reflective block stays under 20 % and tilts present stance. No teleporting props or outline sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting: its refracted starlight charges the final image and constrains her literal mobility, forcing interior transit. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual rainbows, tactile wood grain—filters through Maren’s architect-eye. Spatial choreography is clean: terrace turns slowly as she closes the logbook. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she follow her father through the “sacred threshold” or forge her own?—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: deciphering the logbook reweights the stakes from pursuit to renunciation. Agency is legible in the final beat when she gathers the book and chooses descent. Cost is felt: she forfeits reunion for creative solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of thresholds—maze entrances, cockpit doors, starlight refractions—without moralizing. Final image of building “a labyrinth without dead ends” offers non-literal answer to why some thresholds feel sacred: they are built, not found. Subtext operates in the silences between logbook numbers and wood grain strokes. Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the “fractured hush.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices landscapes as aerial labyrinths, reads emotion through carpentry pressure lines. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical cadences drift like the terrace, then tighten in the final paragraph. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. Filter verbs (“she intuited”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Psychic distance stays close-third throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: “featherly determined” compresses fragility and resolve; “fractured hush” marries sound and breakage. No synonym loops or template cadences. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight “almost like language” reprises the code motif. One mixed image (“snow” of silence over glass terrace) is minor and doesn’t touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The corn-maze-child on a balloon-suspended prism terrace fuses agricultural earthiness with aerial transcendence; synthesis feels inevitable. Fresh angle on orphan-grief: deciphering furniture grain as emotional Morse. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Transformation test fails if swapped—specificity of thresholds, wood grain, and refracted starlight are irreplaceable.</comment>
