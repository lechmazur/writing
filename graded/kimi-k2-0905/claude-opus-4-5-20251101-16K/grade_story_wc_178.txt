<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s frugality is embodied (lentil stew, copper-wire patch), her patience dramatized through silent vigil; the final choice to encode her own square crystallizes a lifetime of micro-choices with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“overwhelming sense of connection” arrives after physical alignment of tile and nebula, not abstract label. No contradictory impulses on-stage, but single-mindedness is credibly earned by prior austerity; closure forecloses the option of public acclaim in favor of hidden continuity, cost felt in the quiet descent to eat lentils alone. Meets 9+ test: renunciation is causally tied to established traits and carries on-page weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s private act revalues her life’s work from institutional recognition to trans-millennial covenant, cost legible in the final image of tile catching “ancient light.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard (basement discovery, deck alignment, encoding new square) layers density until cadence shift at nebula reveal reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“lowest chamber”), transitions clean; no causal breaks. Persistent constraint—political interregnum—shapes uninterrupted access yet implies tomorrow’s erasure, tightening final stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Steel-and-glass ziggurat, copper-wired telescope, and Babylonian stone constrain Mira’s resourceful ingenuity; tile’s grooves felt under fingertip charge the final placement on ledge. Sensory hierarchy honors astronomer: light, dust motes as galaxies, nebula hue—visual dominates but fits POV. Micro-setting (tile) functions as setting by altering tactics and charging closure. Weather not overwrought; dust and dying light evolve with scene, mirroring internal hush. Meets 9+ gate: tile/tool constrains choice and is re-imaged at end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—private covenant with the unknown—signaled early; pressure tightens when equinox clock narrows to 40 minutes, forcing alignment decision. No external antagonist needed; regime instability complicates but does not resolve. Escalation is accretive: each schematic layer deepens possible loss (tile buried, observatory defunded). Cost visible—tears, then conscious forfeiture of fame via hidden encoding. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (accidental chamber exposure) only opens possibility, never pays it off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—devotion transcends empire through mathematics—emerges from tile’s journey, not exposition. Subtext in “amber tears” light refracts both mourning and preservation. Final image of new square being drafted reweights prior material: knowledge becomes recursive relay, not progress myth. No moralizing; ambiguity remains whether anyone will ever decode again, yet cost feels absolute.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction—“patched robes,” “secondhand instruments”—mirrors frugal mindset. Rhythm lengthens during nebula moment (“stars emerging like scattered salt”) then compresses for final descent, matching breath of event. No dialogue, so voice carries full burden; succeeds. Perceptual signature consistent: numbers, light, thrift filter every observation. Meets 9+ test: distinct texture under pressure without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse, purposeful—“amber tears,” “salt”—never clouds lens alignment beat. High density: “reused her observation charts until the margins disappeared” performs characterization, stakes, and world in one stroke. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; copy clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of magic square astronomy with post-coup limbo feels inevitable yet unseen before; tile-as-data-drive is fresh tech-from-myth angle. Risk of quiet ending paid off by charged poise. Specificity—lentil stew, copper wire—prevents abstract drift. Could not swap setting or artifact without collapsing logic; transformation complete.</comment>
