<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the shard while trying to reassemble the father who broke it—are dramatized in the ink-reading beats; her heartbeat counting embodies her liminal “ghost” state. The final renunciation of fixing her own death certificate is earned through the causal chain of nightly defragments and the father’s admitted failure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only limit is that the mother remains off-page, so the relationship crucible is one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s choice to stay officially dead crystallizes with the felt cost—“perhaps she would know whether to correct her death certificate—or embrace what she had become.” Causal lens holds: each ink prophecy drives the next retrieval beat; father’s uploaded confession directly prompts her stance shift. Orientation is clean by line 8. No plot amnesia or teleported props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Opal walls cast prismatic shadows that mirror code fragments; the porcelain shard is handled twice and constrains her tactile memory; snow piling against the dome supplies claustrophobic pressure. Telescope-as-server-cabinet fuses observatory tool to plot need. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—visual, tactile, auditory filtered through Mira’s hyper-counting vigilance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve wisdom from paternal failure—tightens when the ghost’s apology reframes her own “death.” One meaningful escalation: father’s voice fragment (“I ran…”) collapses her original goal of fixing him into the choice to stay a ghost. Cost is legible: she forecloses bureaucratic resurrection. No antagonist required; the static countdown supplies temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—what worth is extracted from wreckage—emerges through ink images and shard rather than authorial statement. Final image of uncorrected death certificate reweights “failure” from stigma to identity. Subtext in the cracked teacup questions whether broken things should be mended or inhabited. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains coherent psychic distance; perceptual signature is math-like precision (“sixty-three, sixty-four”) and chromatic light filtering. Syntax tightens under stress—sentence fragments mirror screen glitches. No head-hopping. Voice stays within plausible lexicon of isolated ex-observatory tech. Rhythm modulates cleanly between ritual incantation and stark revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; clauses breathe with heartbeat pauses. High info density—“ink spiraled into something like a face, just for a moment” shows four jobs in ten words. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One strained metaphor (“neural pathways…broken glass”) but cleared within two lines and does not touch closure. Clean grammar, consistent tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemical ink-reading with data-recovery is fresh; turns a familiar “uploaded parent” trope into tactile spell. Porcelain shard as question rather than wound gives non-obvious emotional algebra. Specificity—opal-walled observatory buried in snow—anchors the concept so it couldn’t swap into generic sci-fi. Risk in hybrid ritual-science pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
