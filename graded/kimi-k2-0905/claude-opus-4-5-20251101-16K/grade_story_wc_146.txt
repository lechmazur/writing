<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tuner’s quiet magnetism is evoked more than dramatized; she chooses almost nothing on-page except to stay and speak one gnomic line. Townsfolk are sketched as a chorus; only the mayor receives a single beat of push-back. Interior contradiction and embodied cost are displaced onto the collective “they,” so the arc feels observed rather than individually earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causality is lyric-accumulative: each month of measured steps adds acoustic density until the solstice bells release the built pattern. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the town now “tunes itself”—with conceptual cost legible in the irrevocable absence of the tuner. One soft ellipsis: how the first returned exile hears the bells is off-stage, trimming the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobblestone rhythm functions as micro-setting: every tap recalibrates resonance and directly enables the climax. Ancient archway and bell tower are sketched with economical sonic detail; no visual postcard overload. Environment constrains the only tactic offered—walking as tuning—so the final image is charged by the same surfaces that began the map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: can shared sound forestall civic death? Pressure tightens once—silence → measured footsteps → restored bells—re-weighting the town’s options. Cost is conceptual (the tuner leaves forever) rather than viscerally felt by an on-page character, keeping the escalation just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through acoustic metaphor: collective rhythm versus individual exit. The bells’ return re-prices “balance” without moralizing; the closing line transfers agency to townsfolk, leaving resonant ambiguity. One soft echo of stated thesis (“restore shared balance”) is uttered by the tuner herself—partially earned, partially ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person folkloric voice sustains controlled distance and liturgical cadence; compressions like “the whole place had sung” teach the pattern early. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the promenade rhythm, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is spare and gnomic, consistent with mythic register; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length to mimic footfall rhythm; strong verbs (“swallow light,” “wove through”) carry dual duty. Only micro-loop: “tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap” is intentionally patterned, paid off at climax. Figurative layer is restrained; no mixed metaphors obscure causality. Clean copy, zero scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “acoustic town as instrument” conceit refreshes the familiar dying-village trope; specificity of cobblestone harmonics makes it memorable. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but coherence never wavers. Could swap tuner for any wandering artisan, so freshness hinges on sonic architecture detail rather than character uniqueness.</comment>
