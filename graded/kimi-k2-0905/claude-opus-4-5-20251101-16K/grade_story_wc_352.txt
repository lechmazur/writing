<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority—“prism-minded,” “latent blaze”—is vivid, contradictory impulses (fear vs obsession) surface under pressure, and her micro-choice to copy only restorative formulas renounces destructive power with visible cost. The thirty-year search is told, not embodied, so the opening motive feels abstract until the grotto; still, her embodied reactions inside (rising anticipation, calibrated trajectory through thresholds) track cleanly. No second character on stage, so status dynamics and voice-differentiation bullets are N/A; her competence is credibly balanced by the earlier near-fatal failure. Overall a strong, single-POV portrait whose only limit is the front-loaded summary rather than dramatized obsession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: doodle → spiral curvature → exact trajectory → dormant seeds → selective transcription → new philosophy. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses access to destructive codes and accepts guardianship cost, crystallized in the final “fire banked and ready.” Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 5 and again at grotto mouth; no penalty. One soft spot: the “forty minutes remaining” is told late and never tightens the ticking clock on-page, so time pressure is declared, not causal. Lens stays situational-threshold throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selective, sense-driven detail—gravity inversion lifting boots, quartz wall pooling like water, mist glowing from inside—creates tactile environment that constrains movement and steers trajectory. Spatial choreography is clean: seven nodes, seven threshold passes, no impossible positions. Economy dominates; only three named props (doodle, stylus, vellum) and each recurs with changed state. Micro-setting (crystalline seeds embedded in rock) functions as both obstacle and map, directly shaping her path; meets 9+ gate. Minor dilution: sunset sky is a postcard tag rather than charged return; keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore what time had unmade”—is signaled early; escalation arrives through each threshold: seeds of vigilance could collapse the passage if her angle drifts, tightening options. Protagonist agency drives every beat: she angles body, selects formulas, rejects destructive codes. Cost is legible: she forfeits omniscient power and embraces lifelong guardianship, a renunciation shown on-page. No clock urgency inside the forty-minute window is dramatized, only stated, so pressure peaks conceptually rather than temporally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge demands guardianship, not possession. The seeds of vigilance evolve from obstacle to philosophy, re-weighted when she decides to plant her own. Final image of “fire banked and ready” offers Charged Poise—her stance reframed without moralizing. No abstract thesis statements; insight is earned through the selective transcription beat. Slight deduction for thematic echo in the phrase “knowledge required guardianship,” which edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; prism-perception bias filters every description (“spectrums that revealed,” “overlapping truths”). Diction stays within lexicon of an archivist—cataloged, transcriptions, formulas—without register drift. Rhythm modulates: long, winding sentences mirror serpentine passages; shorter beats mark threshold crossings. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A; prose voice itself carries subtext and is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “gravity inverts” simultaneously signals world rule, stakes, and sensory disorientation in three words. Figurative language is sparse, precise, pattern-taught (“mist that filled these caves was clandestinely luminous”) and paid off in closing glow. No synonym loops, template cadence, or scaffold sentences; sentences start varied. Opening and closing lines are image-based, propulsive. One microscopic lapse: “latent blaze built within her chest” is slightly stock, but rescued by final reprise. Closure image untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemical cryptography with localized physics (inverted gravity as monthly tide) feels fresh and internally coherent. The margin doodle as map-and-key reverses the usual ancient-map trope by encoding moral philosophy inside geometry. Risk taken: entire story is interior, no dialogue or antagonist, yet pressure sustains. Specificity—quartz thresholds, spectral scripts—prevents abstraction; concept would collapse if relocated verbatim. No close echoes of famous scenes; imagery is singular.</comment>
