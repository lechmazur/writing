<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—clinging to empirical facts vs. the shock of personal relic—are dramatized in-scene through trembling hands and the decision to phone Jimmy. The final stance crystallizes credibly: he chooses bridge-building over appraisal, paying the cost of professional distance. One hairline slip: “confidence calibrated” interiority edges toward label-speak, momentarily softening embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cloth’s re-weighting from “provenance unknown” to shared story redefines Marcus’s purpose with felt cost—he abandons safe numeric armor. Causal chain intact: cloth recognition → phone call → offer to narrate, each step because/therefore. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 60 words. Persistent constraint: public disgrace still shadows, shaping the stakes of this new bridge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quarry trailer, limestone moan, and cigarette-stained weave are filtered through ex-roadie ears, constraining his emotional access until the cloth cracks the shell. The micro-setting of the cloth itself—texture, discoloration—literally charges the final image held to fading light. Spatial choreography clean; no floating objects. Environment does not merely echo mood but forces the pivotal micro-choice to call Jimmy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore meaning after public humiliation—tightens when the cloth invalidates his fact-armor, forcing an uninsurable emotional risk. One clear reversal: from appraising relics to offering himself as conduit of living history. Cost legible on-page: abandoning the protective pricing voice (“fourteen to eighteen hundred”) for unmeasurable story-sharing. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: legacy resides not in objects’ market value but in the human chain that carries fragments forward. Subtext operates through silence—wind echoing absent applause, cloth speechless until shared. Final image of quarry “holding its breath” offers non-literal answer: meaning is the echo we choose to pass on. No moralizing; ambiguity remains—will Jimmy accept the bridge?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual signature—amp serial numbers as lullaby, wind as ghost-crowd. Syntax modulates: clipped factual lists under calm, lengthened breathless clauses during cloth recognition. No head-hopping; Jimmy’s voice heard only through phone filter. Free indirect clean: “tasted like lies” carries his diction without filter verbs. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors emotional cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “Dust motes swam through the afternoon light” situates time, mood, and metaphor in eight words. No loops or synonym churn; each image advances. Metaphor vehicles consistent—sound as water, memory as echo—without muddled overlap. One minor scaffold: “He’d spent decades wondering” could compress, but artifact does not touch closure. Strong paragraph cut-test pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Roadie-turned-appraiser encountering his own relic is fresh angle on “after fame” trope. Specificity—UK JCM800 serial, Madison Square Garden 1987—grounds premise so it cannot swap names without collapse. Risk taken: quiet phone call instead of staged reunion, yet coherence maintained. Could edge higher if quarry setting offered one more unexpected constraint rather than symbolic echo alone.</comment>
