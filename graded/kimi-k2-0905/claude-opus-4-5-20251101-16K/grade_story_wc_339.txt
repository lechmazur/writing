<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quietly analytic nature is shown through her methodical cataloguing and refusal to share the impossible truth; the snow-globe cradled against her chest at ascent embodies the cost of that renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—her “analytical mind racing” is tied to the trembling hand photographing the log. The final refusal to surface with proof is a credible, earned stance that forecloses her professional path with intimate loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the impossible radio log reweights every prior loss, making “letting go” a non-linear endurance rather than release. The snow-globe lighthouse re-illuminates in the ascent image, paying the cost of unverifiable knowledge. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each artifact tightens the pattern until the final fold in time reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rust-sealed library, head-lamp beam, and oil-wrapped logs are filtered through a diver’s selective attention; pressure gauges and pulped books anchor era and depth. The snow-globe’s private storm is re-handled twice, charging the ascent image. Spatial choreography stays clean—bag, globe, ascent line track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost—tightens when the 1939 log names her mother’s 1999 ship; the impossible coordinates foreclose any normal rescue, forcing Elara to decide between evidence and secrecy. The price is legible: she surfaces with only the globe, abandoning professional vindication. One meaningful deepening suffices for 800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fold of time and the refusal to broadcast it: “nothing is truly lost, only displaced.” The lighthouse image migrates from heirloom to impossible glow, reweighting grief into simultaneous presence. No final moralizing—resonance is carried by the ascending globe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“quietly analytic,” “companionable death”) is precise to Elara’s temperament. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences in the library, shorter percussive fragments during the log reveal. No head-hopping; the final “impossible glow” stays inside her perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“paper cranes in the deep” crystallizes the time-fold without overwriting. Information density high: each sentence advances character, artifact, or pressure. Copy clean; no tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Amelia Earhart discovery frames a world newly hopeful that “the lost could be found,” then the story pivots to a subtler loss that can’t be exhibited. Temporal displacement via 1939 log of a 1999 ship feels fresh, inevitable once the globe’s twin existence is revealed. Risky temporal twist is fully committed to and pays off in the final image.</comment>
