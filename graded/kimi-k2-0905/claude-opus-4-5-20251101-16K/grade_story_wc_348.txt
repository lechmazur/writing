<comment>Elena’s synesthetic chemist-mind and grief are concretely anchored in sensory beats (foam = cello phrases, chrysalis = membrane not wall). The text-message renunciation carries visible cost (“pressed send before she could stop herself”) and is earned by the river-foam insight sequence. Interior contradiction is present but stays safely clear of therapy-speak. Capped at 8.7 only because the sister remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is second-hand.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: foam patterning, chrysalis, and braided streams build density until the final text crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration—“separation itself could be a form of connection.” Orientation fixed by word 80; no lens ambiguity at closure. Cost is legible in the haptic “loosened grief” and the un-answered phone buzz that keeps the price live.</comment>

<comment>Canyon is sketched with autumn copper light, split channels, and tactile stone, but the micro-setting triumph is the river-foam that literally constrains her scientific insight and therefore the send-button moment. Chrysalis serves as portable setting/prop that charges the final image. No spatial drift; weather and water chemistry stay consistent. One hairline slip: “three states away” is the only external locator and feels slightly grafted.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repair or reframe the severed bond—signalled in para 1. Mid-text deepening occurs when foam geometry reframes “divergent path” from failure to elastic network, narrowing her options to honest vulnerability rather than apology. Cost is the exposure of an unsolicited message with no guarantee of reply. Not quite 8.8 because external pressure (sister’s silence) is remembered, not enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated images of braided water, polymer chains, and chrysalis shell: separation as connective membrane rather than void. No moralising sentence; the closest—“separation itself could be a form of connection”—is presented as interior paraphrase of observed physics, not authorial thesis. Final image of unread text keeps ambiguity charged. Slight deduction for concept-stating line “The insight came quietly…”. </comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elena’s chemist-perceiver filter throughout; no head-hop. Syntax carries musical cadence (symphonic metaphors, sentence crescendos) that mirrors her cognitive wiring without purple overload. Filter verbs (“She thought…”) are minimal and justified. No dialogue, so voice distinctness evaluated solely through internal lyric coherence; it holds. </comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long polymeric sentences and tight fragment beats under pressure. Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per beat cluster, no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Strong paragraph cuts: removing any paragraph would collapse the causal-insight chain. Line-level craft supports the closure image without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of polymer chemistry, synesthetic perception, and riparian morphology feels specific to this character rather than trope-stitched. River foam as epistemic device is fresh; chrysalis re-read as permeable boundary rather than simple rebirth symbol offers non-obvious reweighting. Concept risks sentimentality but dodges via scientific framing. Not quite 8+ because “braided river” and “chrysalis” are familiar nat-crit emblems, slightly dampening surprise.</comment>
