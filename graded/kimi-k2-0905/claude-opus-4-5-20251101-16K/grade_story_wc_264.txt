<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s dreamlessness and freight-guard duty give her a crisp emptiness that justifies her archive-compatibility, but interiority stays abstract (“she felt…that time was not a line but a garden”) without embodied contradiction under pressure. No micro-choice in the closing beats visibly forecloses a path; she collects sparks, then watches dawn—same stance, no new cost. Reflection stays within 20 % and is anchored, so BRR is clean. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with a price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds luminous detail until the final “midnight endured / possibilities multiplied” reweights the premise. Orientation lands by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—reader feels the archive’s branching potential as conceptual cost—but the beat is pure image; no concrete constraint or price is shown that will shape next actions. Therefore caps short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Glowing dune, crystalline archive car, and frozen chess clock are rendered with spare, sensory precision; each recurs and guides Mira’s attention. The clock’s midnight stasis quietly charges the final “midnight endured” image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that an object constrain or charge closure. Spatial choreography across shards stays coherent. One line slips toward purple (“glowing dune…like a sleeping beast”) but density is otherwise controlled.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—cultivate hidden sparks—remains steady; no meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; Mira’s goal never faces an obstacle or resource cost on the page. Mosaic fragments accumulate texture but do not narrow her options or raise price. Consequently escalation plateaus; closure poise is aesthetic, not functional under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “salvaging possibility from ruin” emerges organically through luminous debris rather than thesis. Final multiplication of unborn stars reconfigures the opening “sky that hadn’t seen stars” with conceptual cost. No moralizing tag-lines; ambiguity lingers. Could ascend higher if a single spark rescue had cost Mira something tangible on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance that matches Mira’s dreamless hush; syntax is varied, rhythmic, and image-driven without filter-verb clutter. “Fractured lullaby” tone is sustained; cadence modulates between long, breathy sentences and sharp fragments (“Midnight forever.”). No dialogue to test, so voice distinctness is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains coherent across shards.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences braid observation with concept (“phosphorescent flowers pushed through sand that remembered nothing of roots”). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One tiny scaffold (“the flowers began to close, conserving their brightness for another night”) repeats an earlier flower beat without new pressure, warranting a −0.2. Otherwise line-level craft is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-burn quantum-archive locomotive is fresh, yet the core motion—“lonely guardian gathers last light”—echoes familiar eco-lyric SF. Specificity of seed-vault-in-Finland, child’s drawing in ash, and midnight-chess lifts the material. Final reprise of frozen clock multiplying into potential stars gives a non-obvious reconfiguration. Risk level is moderate; bolder tactical cost could have pushed higher.</comment>
