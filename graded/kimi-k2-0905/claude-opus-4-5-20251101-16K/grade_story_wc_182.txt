<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vera’s resourceful trait is shown once (pulling water/fruit from her satchel) but never tested again; the climactic decision to stay and transcribe is a conceptual leap rather than a beat-forged renunciation. The girl’s refusal is declared, not dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority stays competent but safe, never risking a raw contradiction that would cost something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Then we’ll remember together” reweights the rescue from extraction to co-preservation, but the cost (Vera’s open-ended captivity) is asserted, not felt. Causal lens is clear—each because leads to therefore—yet the final beat skips the concrete price (hunger, time, bodily danger) that would make the renunciation sting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The mountain-as-nautilus image is vivid and the gaps-as-doors motif constrains Vera’s search tactics, but spatial choreography blurs once they reach the 89th level: no sense of ascent fatigue, temperature drop, or dwindling supplies. Micro-setting (botanical diary) earns its keep by recharging the final moment, lifting the score into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the child—tightens when Vera redefines “rescue” as co-preservation, a single meaningful turn. Pressure stays coherent but static; no visible resource is spent or forfeited on-page, so the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. Sufficient for micro-form, yet shy of the 8-band threshold that demands a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as moral obligation versus abandonment. Subtext hums in the unheard symphony, a charged silence that reweights the ending. The refusal to moralize keeps complexity alive, though the absence of a tangible sacrifice prevents the resonance from fully cresting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance to Vera; perceptual signature is steady (“carefully resourceful,” linguistic precision). Rhythm modulates—short clauses under pressure, longer lyrical curls during revelation—without losing control. No head-hopping or register drift; the lyric lift at the end feels earned rather than pasted on.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; occasional modifier stacks (“philosophical treaties,” “particular exhaustion”) flirt with over-egging but don’t stall momentum. One paraphrase loop appears: “rescue succeeded not by extraction, but by choice” restates the prior sentence. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The “Library of Unlearned Lessons” is a fresh inversion of the infinite-library trope; locating it in physical gaps rather than shelves gives the concept bite. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending, no pyrotechnics—but the synthesis of time-travel fatigue, botanical mapping, and silence-as-symphony feels specific to this text rather than a prompt patchwork.</comment>
