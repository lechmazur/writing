<comment>Mira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her “mapping silence” is shown through bodily gesture and camera framing, not labeled emotion. The contradictory impulse to keep filming yet never load film crystallizes her self-punishing nostalgia and gives her a visible flaw that complicates the encounter. Micro-choices (kneeling, signing the harbor’s rhythm) earn the child’s reciprocity without therapeutic self-talk. Cost is legible: she trades lifelong anonymity for one transient bridge, a renunciation foreshadowed by the empty shutter click.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silent tableau layers density until the final shared gesture reweights solitude into communal song. Causality is internal but coherent—because Mira keeps returning to film silence, she is present for the mother and child; because she risks engagement, she forfeits invisibility. Closure is a Charged Poise: the empty camera click crystallizes the paradox of preserving what cannot be preserved, cost felt in her lingering kneel. No orientation drift; moonlit harbor anchors who/where within first 100 words.</comment>

<comment>The silvered harbor is not backdrop; its rocking boats and mirrored water literally supply the rhythm Mira translates into sign, constraining her final choreography. Moonlight as recurring object refracts through the camera’s vintage glass, charging the last shutter click with conceptual cost. The pier’s geography stays stable: fisherman far side, mother/child edge, Mira’s kneel marks a proximate shift that invites approach. Sensory economy favors shimmer, salt, and creaking rope—details that feed both camera frame and silent score.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can silence be made visible without film—tightens when the child demands demonstration, forcing Mira to wager her customs of solitude. Escalation is textural: each silent tableau (net-mending, sign conversation) raises the emotional tariff until her private lexicon must go public. Agency lies in endurance of exposure, not reversal; she pays with the irrevocable sharing of her technique. Cost is legible: the empty click echoes her earlier unfilmed life, now surrendered to communal memory.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without dictation: silence as fertile, collaborative music versus solitary archive. Subtext lives in gestures—the fisherman’s unseen net-speech parallels Mira’s camera-frame yet stays private, highlighting her leap toward shared codification. The child’s mimicry reconfigures silence from deficit to generative culture, reframing deafness as alternative hearing. Final image refuses moral; instead the moonlit shutterless click posits art as lived transmission, not artifact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual sieve, filtering moonlight through metal camera and salted knuckles. Syntax lengthens during reverie, then fragments when she signs, mirroring the shift from internal mapping to external address. No head-hop; mother and child remain unread except through Mira’s gestural translations. Dialogue-free design is coherent; when voiced signing occurs, it is rendered as italicized motion lines, preserving silence’s texture.</comment>

<comment>Prose carries read-aloud cadence: varied sentence openings, no template loops. Figurative language is selective—moon “spilling silver” appears once and recurs only via image echo, avoiding purple drift. Information density high: one sentence often layers camera action, sensory detail, and metaphoric charge. Minor filter-verb cluster in paragraph four (“she watched… she raised… she found”) dampens propulsion but does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the deaf-musician trope: composer turned cartographer of silence, using camera-as-frame rather than sound. Transformation is specific to sign-language choreography and moonlit harbor physics; swap setting or tool and arc collapses. Risk is formal—story hangs on gestural set-piece sans dialogue—yet coherence holds. Fresh inflection: empty film camera repurposed as both view-finder and moral wager against archival compulsion.</comment>
