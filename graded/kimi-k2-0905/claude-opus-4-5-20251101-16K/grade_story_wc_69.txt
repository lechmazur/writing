<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s “expectantly resigned” calm is shown through micro-choices—setting the rosette on the table, humming the first note—so her authority feels lived-in rather than lecturing. The three students remain types (baritone, soprano, bass) whose rift is told more than dramatized; their single chord is a first step, not yet a costly change. Because the reconciliation is tentative and unpunished, the arc is emotionally credible but stops just short of visible individual cost. Still, the collective decision to sing operates as an earned, if gentle, renunciation of silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine is clear: Eleanor summons the three → tells the lost-craft parable → invites them to sing → they obey. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 50, well under the 120-word threshold. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sustained chord reconfigures their stance with felt social cost—once enemies, now co-resonators. The lens holds as causal throughout; no ellipsis or coincidence intrudes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The velvet library is more than wallpaper: its acoustic hush and autumnal light mirror the “subtraction of noise” aesthetic, and the zither rosette works as micro-setting that literally sits between the factions. Spatial choreography is clean—chair, table, window, door—bodies track logically. Sensory detail is selective (amber light, worn fabric, low hum) and filtered through Eleanor’s musician ear. One minor slip: “grounds of Ashworth Academy” is named but never used; no choice is constrained by its geography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can these three sing together despite hatred—arrives early and tightens once: from refusal to a single sustained chord. The reversal is driven by Eleanor’s invitation and their joint assent; luck plays no part. Cost is present but soft: the implied social risk of singing beside an enemy in a silent library. A sharper forfeiture (a lost solo line, a family warning) would have pushed the score higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through subtraction imagery (falling leaves, vanished craftsmen, silence chosen over noise) rather than thesis statements. The final chord reweights the rosette from relic to living conduit—no moral is preached. Subtext operates in gesture: Marcus staring at shoes, Fatima’s jaw tightening; the chord itself is the argument. Complexity is honored: hatred is not declared solved, only momentarily out-sung.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Eleanor’s musician perception: acoustic metaphors, tempoed sentences, calm meter that mirrors “traveled stillness.” Diction never exceeds her lexicon; syntax tightens as she counts the silent beat before they breathe. The choral metaphor extends to rhythm—phrases often end on held notes (dashes, soft consonants). No head-hop; only one brief psychic-distance shift inward to the students that is cued by the chord itself.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only one scaffold-like echo (“learned art… learned things can be unlearned”) and it is purposeful, pattern-teaching. Metaphors stay coherent (autumn = subtraction = silence) and never crowd a single beat. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored; final sentence lands with percussive brevity. One tiny register lift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator jargon, not story language, but it appears only in meta-commentary, not the fiction proper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “choir heals racial rift” premise is refreshed by focusing on a lost lutherie craft and the negative space of sound. The zither rosette as both MacGuffin and metronome is a specific, non-obvious hinge. Autumn-as-subtraction metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight yet not predictable at entry. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric resolution rather than dramatic showdown—but coherence justifies the choice. Could push further by inventing a musical rule or ritual unique to this world.</comment>
