<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mireth’s interiority is rich—her tactile attention to lamp, bronze, starlight—but her contradictory impulses (yearning to leave vs. compulsion to stay) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The single micro-choice—accepting the next supplicant—repeats without escalating cost; her “infinite imprisonment” remains abstract. Earned stasis is credible, yet the emotional price is muffled because her own burden is never tested in a visible beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of her waiting, lamp low among calcified sorrows, crystallizes the infinite trade-off with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each woven burden adds density until the ending reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; fractal recursion is taught by ~120 words and pays off in the final stasis. No因果 reversals are required under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: its fractal ribs and gravity-facing orientation directly constrain the weaving ritual and the perpetual trap. Starlight threads and lamp-flame multiply across curved walls, guiding the tactile choreography of drawing burdens. Every sensory choice feeds the loom’s action; no external exposition intrudes. The environment is inseparable from the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mireth’s unending servitude—tightens through each distributed sorrow; the grotto’s infinite recursion makes escape literally one iteration away. One meaningful deepening: her own burden can’t be woven because she is both weaver and thread, foreclosing self-rescue. Cost is conceptual but legible in the closing image. Agency is renunciation rather than reversal, sufficient under Accumulative lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: sacrificial absorption of others’ pain creates a silent, collective monument. The calcified pebbles and shingled hush reweight the idea of shared weight without moralizing. Final line—“she waited”—offers resonant, non-literal answer to who carries the carriers. No thesis is declared; meaning accretes through iterated image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice carries a restrained, liturgical cadence that mirrors the grotto’s recursive architecture. Diction stays within Mireth’s artisanal lexicon—“fractal weaver,” “calcify,” “shingled hush”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is acute: she hears layered silence like roof-shingles catching rain. Rhythm modulates only once, at the final hush, crystallizing the poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; figurative language is selective, never clustering in high-pressure beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—each line advances atmosphere, loom-action, or thematic accretion. Occasional Latinate lifts (“boundary-lessly”) read as deliberate incantatory stretch rather than register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fractal weaving of burdens into stone feels fresh, integrating mathematical image with emotional labor. The grotto-as-whalebone-cathedral twists familiar cave-ritual into organic architecture. Risk lies in the recursive structure itself, taught early and paid off in infinite stasis. Conceptual commitment never retreats; specificity keeps the premise from sliding into allegory.</comment>
