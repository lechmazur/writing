<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. filial ritual—surface in the tactile handling of the sand grain and the decision to “outlast darkness.” Interiority stays concrete; the final pocketing of the grain is a credible, scaled renunciation with felt cost. The micro-choice to leave the silver-nitrate grid is motivated by her lifetime pattern of witness, so closure is earned. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible inactive, capping just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crater still whole at sunrise, the inspector still watching, the future loss now framed and irreversible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added sensory layer reweights the stake until the last silver edge darkens. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props or causal breaks. One persistent constraint—the impending dawn that will summon machines—shapes every tactical choice and final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The moonlit summit functions as micro-setting: altitude constrains breath, light, and time; the crater lip’s gradient dictates where papers can lie undisturbed. Cold stone under thigh, fogging breath, and silver nitrate’s chemical bite are filtered through Elena’s professional gaze. The sand grain recurs as handled object-as-setting, charging the final pocketing. Environment directly shapes the only possible tactic—passive witness—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“photograph the last wholeness”—tightens exactly once: when first light triggers the irreversible self-development of the papers, foreclosing any second chance. Escalation is Accumulative: each paragraph adds sensory density until the hush fractures into sunrise. No reversal is required; the deepening silence itself becomes the pressure that crystallizes her stance. Cost is legible in the final line: “for one more morning, the crater remained whole,” implying the next morning it will not.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of witness-objects—hourglass grain, silver paper, camera—each indexing time’s passage without sermons. Final image reweights “preserving what can’t be held” from archival duty to intimate ritual. Ambiguity is productive: the act neither saves the crater nor redeems industry, yet dignifies attention itself. No thematic echo or moralizing sentence appears; resonance is built solely from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elena’s perceptual signature: geological diction (“scree,” “photosensitive grid”) against the inherited lexicon of vigil. Syntax lengthens under moonlight, then fractures into short clicks of the camera at dawn, mirroring attention. No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters. Voice maintains modesty—she “imagined she could see,” never claims cosmic certainty—so psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm, no scaffold loops; clauses carry dual duty (action + atmospheric charge). Metaphors are sparse, physically coherent (“moonlight painted everything in silver and shadow”). One near-purple line—“melancholy that settled over her was soft, almost golden”—earns its place because it is the sole abstract note after concrete accrual, functioning as release. No artifacts appear in the final third, satisfying the 9+ line-level gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: the extinction of terrestrial craters as off-world mining begins, framed through antiquated photochemistry rather than digital nostalgia. Hourglass sand repurposed as relic and shutter-release talisman is specific to this voice. Risky structural choice—no antagonist, no dialogue—paid off via accumulative witness. Premise would collapse if names or places were swapped, passing the transformation test.</comment>
