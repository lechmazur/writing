<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“breath crystallizing,” “trembling fingers”) and the gear-as-grief metaphor tracks cleanly; the final acceptance is earned. Yet the turn hinges on an asserted epiphany—“she found something more”—rather than a dramatized interior contradiction, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each mirrored reflection deepens pattern until the ticking assembly reweights the stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost—the oil scent, the cold brass—signaling before/after legible on the page. No orientation debt; mirrors teach their rule early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Frozen library is not postcard backdrop: ice glare limits dexterity, cold forces haste, mirrors double risk of fracture. Gear oil’s metallic lightning scent and frost patterns on floorboards anchor POV attention. Micro-setting (the ticking mechanism in her palms) charges final image, meeting 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—tightens once: mirrors force her to confront incomplete legacy and attempt assembly. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but pressure stays coherent; cost is the irreversible knowledge that some locks open only with time, paid on page via the first tick.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from gear-to-grief transmutation: repair as inheritance, not restoration. Mirrors reweight meaning without moralizing; final tick reframes earlier prophecy scraps as self-fulfilling. Avoids tidy thesis, but abstraction (“some broken things must remain broken”) slightly over-articulates what image already shows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Vera’s perceptual filter: noticing frost before warmth, scent of father’s oil. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens during assembly; no head-hopping. Distinctive diction—“lunar-eclipse locksmith,” “escapement of time”—without register drift; rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Several sentences perform triple duty (advance, characterize, evoke) e.g., “springs coiled tight as secrets.” No synonym loops; only one minor scaffold (“the way ice formed around warmth” restates prior beat). Metaphors stay coherent under cold/light axis; closure image unobscured. Minor intensifier excess in “hauntingly bright” keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High-concept fusion—celestial locksmithing, frozen sky-library, ice-mirror epistemology—feels inevitable yet fresh. Clock-repair-as-grief could be familiar, but eclipse timing and mirrored self-assembly twist it into non-obvious shape. Specific sensory alloy (pine resin, rendered fat, lightning metal) secures memorable texture.</comment>
