<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her acoustic sensitivity shows in every line. The contradiction between her inherited storytelling bowl and her violin is embodied in gesture (unbinding strings, speaking half-stories). The final renunciation—playing fragments, releasing tension—carries visible cost and crystallizes her arc. Only nit: “acoustically perceptive” is stated once as label before it is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the chronic hush flips from unbearable absence to expectant listening; the unstrung violin and floating bowl image reweights all prior fragments. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each half-melody and half-sentence layers until silence itself becomes instrument. Cost is legible—she surrenders her tool and her compulsion for wholeness. One micro-turn (silence → resonance) tightens stakes once; enough for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks are not backdrop—they become the instrument she plays. Water depth, broken glass, hollow hulls constrain acoustics and enable the final echo-layering. The bowl’s drift among submerged branches charges the closing image with conceptual cost. Every sensory pick is filtered through Mira’s “echo-harbor” ear, making setting inseparable from POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: wrest beauty from the unfinished under chronic hush. Escalation is textural—each fragment played increases the density of silence until it flips to resonance. Agency is continuous—she tunes her playing to the wrecks’ replies, then surrenders her strings. Cost is felt: the violin silenced, the hush now an audience she must keep feeding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: fragments, shipwrecks, half-trees, half-told stories. Final image reweights “unfinished” from lack to generative space—no moral stated. Subtext in gesture: loosening strings = accepting incompleteness. Emotional aftereffect concrete—reader left in the same expectant hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly latched to Mira’s acoustic perception; every description is filtered through her ear. Syntax mirrors pressure—“sound fell flat,” “notes wandered”—and relaxes into longer cadence as echoes return. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene pressure; fragments shorten as hush resists, then lengthen when echoes answer. Metaphors are coherent—violin as “cradle,” silence as “audience.” No loops or scaffold; high information density. One mixed metaphor—“rust throats” beside “glass roof”—minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of playing silence to shipwrecks feels fresh; “echo-harbor violinist” and “sunken orchard” are specific, not quirky ornament. Fragment-as-form grows organically from character and theme. Risk of unbinding instrument pays off in resonant final image. Slight echo of “world-learning-to-listen” trope, but transformed through acoustic specificity.</comment>
