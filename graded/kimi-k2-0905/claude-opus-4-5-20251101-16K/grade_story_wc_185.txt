<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vela’s interior contradiction—grief for lost silence vs. sheltering the beings—drives every micro-choice; her sung “bloom” is an embodied renunciation that costs her the last residue of ancestral quiet, foreclosing retreat. Competence and flaw stay welded: she reads ice like scripture yet must keep singing tomorrow, exhaustion legible in the final charting stroke.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: patterned sensory intensification (screaming stone → weeping ice → steadied chord) tightens stakes without causal reversals; Earned Stasis lands as perpetual caretaking, cost felt in “Tomorrow she would conjure another bloom.” One transition, orientation by 96 words; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harmonic caves function as both sounding board and moral crucible: ice sheet, echo stone, and beings’ auroras constrain placement and tone of Vela’s song, directly shaping the final hush. Micro-setting—the frozen basin’s fracture triad—acts as the pivot her decision must physically obey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shared habitation versus unbearable noise—signaled in line 2; meaningful tightening occurs when chaotic fracture readings force Vela to wager the last relic stone and her voice, narrowing options to perpetual stewardship. Cost visible: “It would not last forever… the bloom would need tending.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through acoustic metaphor: peace is not absence but negotiated polyphony. Final image (“learning to storm together”) reframes prior screams into co-authored chord—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost of endless labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Vela’s perceptual filter—ripple ridges read as “stories of currents long stilled,” beings’ light translated as “attention.” Rhythm compresses under pressure (“thrashing like trapped lightning”) then widens into lyrical cadence for the bloom release, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty—sound, emotion, world-rule—without scaffold. Figurative layering disciplined: only two metaphors per high-pressure beat, vehicles acoustic. Reads clean aloud; zero paraphrase loops, zero filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inverts standard alien-invasion trope: refugees are weather systems, protagonist’s “weapon” is engineered quiet. Fresh synthesis of geomorphology + acoustics + caretaking ethics; “ripple-mark mapkeeper” and “hammered repose” coinages feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure paid off through coherent closure.</comment>
