<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—willing to absorb others’ grief yet quietly fearing her own erasure—surfaces in the final beat: “her own grew thin.” Embodied micro-choices (pressing the tooth, shifting harp timbre) reveal a hierarchy that privileges others’ joy over self-preservation. The luminous ache she shoulders is the visible cost that earns her stoic continuation. Voice remains singular; no stock phrases dilute her idiom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren elects to keep playing, knowing the repository inside her will only swell. The cost—self-thinning—is stated on-page and is the price every passage extracts. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the repeating ritual of confession-plus-laughter steadily reweights the collector’s burden until the final image crystallizes the stakes. Pattern holds from first chord to last silence; no因果 zig-zag is required.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is not backdrop; its seven-fold rebound literally amplifies the harp’s wrong notes, making confession audible and shaping Maren’s method. The crocodile tooth functions as micro-setting, a portable threshold that warms against her skin and gates passage. Spatial choreography stays clean—harp against wall, sunrise band creeping across floor—so sound reflection remains credible. Environment constrains every tactical decision; remove the acoustic warp and the ritual collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake is declared early: retrieve “joy they’d forgotten to claim” without being consumed. Mid-story deepening occurs when Marenrealises each laugh she restores also thins her own substance—“the luminous ache settling into her chest.” That tightening forecloses the option of endless collecting and makes the final stance a costly renunciation rather than noble routine. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; one meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: healing the dead requires resurrecting their joy, not merely absolving regret. The harp’s deliberate brokenness enacts this thesis—imperfection is the only conduit wholeness can’t provide. Final image of Maren waiting “patient as the tooth” reconfigures the premise: the healer’s vocation is endless, self-depleting, yet chosen. No moral is stated; resonance arises from the accrued weight of laughter-fragments she now carries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: sounds “returned sevenfold,” grief needs “companions other than itself.” Syntax lengthens during harp play, compresses in the ache-beat, mirroring emotional intake and expenditure. No dialogue appears; narration supplies all necessary subtext through imagistic indirection. Prose rhythm is controlled, never drum-beat, and diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech, preventing template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only one extended metaphor per beat—and each vehicle maintains internal logic. Occasional modifiers (“medicine wrapped in morning light”) flirt with excess but are brief and voice-aligned. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors intrude on the closure image; density remains high without purple swell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “lost soul collector who harvests laughter” is a fresh synthesis of psychopomp and bard, avoiding genre cliché. Ritual structure—confession then comic memory—reverses expected ghost-story beats, producing non-obvious emotional payoff. Crocodile-tooth key and warped harp are specific, irreplaceable tools; swap them and the magic system collapses. Risk in formal lyricism is purposeful, heightening resonance without obscuring causality.</comment>
