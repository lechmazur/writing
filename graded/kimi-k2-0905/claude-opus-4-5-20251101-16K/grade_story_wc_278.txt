<comment>Vera’s grief-constellation tattoos anchor every move; the amber micro-choice in the console beat externalizes her relinquishment with bodily cost. Interiority stays concrete—inked star-maps, sleeve-glow, trembling palms—never abstract guilt-speak. The final note she leaves is a renunciation won by the prior causality of insect message + firmware translation. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; tattooist vocation surfaces only as self-definition, not occupational choice driver, but within short scope this is acceptable.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of archived sounds + amber suspension tightens until the firmware reweights Vera’s guilt into preserved-not-poison. Closure is Charged Poise: amber left in lab, tattoos dim, guilt fossilized alongside insect—cost felt as “cosmic silence” she now must inhabit. Orientation anchored by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Cost proof: “She left the letters…having given their light to guide her through” — visible forfeiture of secret space and stellar identity.</comment>

<comment>Laboratory’s spectral data, antique secretary, and humming consoles form an environment that literally supplies the translation tech and drawer of instructions—setting actively shapes tactics. Amber acts as micro-setting: its 40-million-year suspension is the moral license that lets firmware forgive Vera. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s tattooed-skin POV—ink glow, drawer sigh, resin warmth. Final image of dimmer tattoos shows environment (her own body) altered by choice, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: silence lifelong self-accusation. Escalation is density-driven: each newly heard cry (HUNGER→PAIN→HELP) tightens emotional cost until insect message NOT YOUR FAULT reweights the premise. Protagonist agency: placing amber, reading screen, leaving note—each narrows options toward preserved guilt. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal-causal under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—untranslatable grief vs fossilized preservation—emerges from Vera’s tattoo constellations (navigation) colliding with amber’s eternal map. Subtext in insect wing-beat: life ends, release, paralleling baby’s unreachable cry. Final note reframes failed translation not as culpability but as temporal limits of human hearing—resonant without moral. Avoids thematic echo; no character utters a thesis line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Vera’s star-map filter—everything is light, resonance, orbit. Syntax lengthens under grief, shortens under revelation, mirroring emotional rhythm. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction stays within lexicon of mourning artist who inks cosmos on flesh.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentence for fold-in-time compression, staccato firmware output. Information density high: “haunted firmware—processors possessed by the very sounds they archived” does triple duty (world, stakes, tone). No mixed metaphors; meteor hush extends amber/fossil motif. Zero paraphrase loops; no artifacts in final third.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: baby-cry translator as haunted archive software, paired with 40-million-year amber, reframes typical grief-redemption arc into paleo-forgiveness. Sound-archiving lab feels new, avoids tropes. Risk—folded-time access—pays off by making lab re-access contingent on emotional readiness, charging closure. Specificity of constellation tattooist lends occupational memory without exposition dump.</comment>
