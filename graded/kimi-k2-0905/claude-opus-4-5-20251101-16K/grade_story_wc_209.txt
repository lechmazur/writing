<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her reckoning unfolds through tactile mural work and dawn vigils, not self-labels. The contradiction between public daylight persona and private nocturnal devotion is held in scene. The final renunciation—painting in the threshold hour—carries visible cost in sleep and solitude, earning her stasis. Voice stays consistent, though a mid-paragraph shift into grandmother’s history is slightly over-articulated (−0.3).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: postcard pattern → glass reveal → mural completion tightens meaning under one escalating question. Orientation anchors by line 3; cathedral spatial logic tracks. Closure is a Charged Poise: the amber pavilion mural crystallizes both inheritance and future duty; felt cost is the unending dawn vigil she accepts. Lens holds without ambiguity; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber panels and honeyed light are re-used to filter every beat; the etched-glass cathedral window literally constrains the final discovery and charges the mural imagery. Micro-setting (body/easel/postcards) is handled, not catalogued. Seasonal melt and slanted light evolve causally with Elara’s understanding. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible sight-lines. 9+ gate missed because no object/environment choice alters tactics at climax; mural content was pre-decided.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>comment>Dominant stake—“why darkness?”—signals early; each postcard reframes the question, deepening rather than repeating. Tightening occurs at glass-window reveal: knowledge gained forecloses ignorance and forces pre-dawn painting regimen. Cost is legible—sleep, social daylight world forfeited. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. One micro-turn: snow’s retreat parallels insight—elegant, not coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>comment>Theme emerges from recurrent nocturnal bloom images; no explicit moralizing. Final image of Elara reading postcards to painted flowers reweights “darkness” as trust rather than absence—Conceptual Repricing accomplished without statement. Subtext operates in silence: no dialogue, yet visitor tears imply communal recognition. Grandmother’s life becomes a lived answer, not a thesis—avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><question>8.8</question><comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly glued to Elara; perceptual signature consistent—amber light, botanical precision, cathedral geometry. No dialogue, so voice judged on narrative texture: controlled long sentences mimic contemplative dawning hush; shorter beats under starlight sync with breath. No filter-verb clusters. Register stable—no academic drift. Rhythm modulates with hour: languid pre-dawn, crisp at revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><question>8.6</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates fluidly between lyrical elongation and clipped observational beats. Metaphors (moonflowers “offering beauty to moths and moonlight”) are coherent, not mixed. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new layer of light or insight. Density high—one line often paints time, emotion, and setting simultaneously. Minor scaffold: “amber pavilion…amber light…amber walls” repetition intentional, pattern-taught, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.3</question><comment>Night-bloom premise is familiar; freshness comes via glass-window palimpsest engineering—specific, grandmother-invented, visually credible. Mural-as-answer synthesizes postcards, cathedral, and garden into one inevitable artwork; removal breaks closure. Risk in quiet ending without confrontation pays off through Charged Poise. Tone and occupation (muralist) are particularized; not interchangeable shell.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><question>8.7</question><comment>Vivid mural artist is inseparable: her pigment choices encode the revelation; dawn painting sessions are the story’s only visible acts. Early setup; middle choice—she paints walls instead of seeking daylight gallery fame; closure—mural becomes communion altar. Cost: lifelong nocturnal labor. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><question>9.2</question><question>Postcards appear first beat, guide each reframing of the question, and return in final ritual. Each card re-weights “darkness” meaning; grandmother’s handwriting literalizes inheritance. Without them, no trigger for glass inspection and no final spoken-aloud ceremony. High specificity—night-bloom queries unique to botanic/spiritual nexus.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><question>8.8</question><comment>Dawning hush is the literal hour of painting, the thematic threshold, and the tonal constant. Early signal; middle—she schedules life around it; ending—visitors feel it unconsciously. Determines pacing and color palette. Story would lose temporal engine and symbolic pause.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><question>7.9</question><comment>Quietly driven trait shows in pre-sunrise work while city sleeps, refusal of daylight gallery scene, and endurance of isolation. Enables discovery—only vigil reveals hidden glass etchings. Cost painted under eyes: “sometimes she wept.” Integral to momentum.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><question>9.0</question><comment>“Reckon” is the verb of the piece: she reckons with inheritance via sequential acts—examining cards, watching window, painting wall. Each beat is a calculative confrontation with grief. Final reckoning accepts endless dawn vigil as price. Synonyms would soften the deliberate, ledger-like quality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><question>8.4</question><comment>Hidden cathedral glass layers are the single mechanical reveal that converts question into answer. Setup—grandmother restored glass; development—Elara inspects; payoff—secondary etching seen only at exact angle drives mural iconography. Without it, no closure device. Specificity of palimpsest technique prevents swap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><question>7.6</question><comment>Amber pavilion filters all light and palette; dictates mural colors and visitor mood. Provides transitional space between secular city and sacred cathedral. Micro-setting interacts with sun angle to makes cathedral glass legible. Could not be green or white pavilion—amber is chromatic key.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><question>6.2</question><comment>Melting snow gives visible clock for insight progression—patch by patch, revelation by revelation. Supplies seasonal urgency: mural must finish before cathedral closes for tourists. Less integrated in final beat; time pressure eases once concept secured. Moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><question>8.9</question><comment>Desire to understand night-bloom motive animates every inquiry and painting session. Conflict: sacrifices daylight life; cost visible in fatigue and solitude. Drives glass inspection and mural content. Final realization reframes desire as acceptance rather than explanation. Story collapses without it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><question>7.4</question><comment>Umbral tenderness tone established in first paragraph and modulates—never gloomy, always gentle. Supports theme that darkness is nurturing, not threatening. Tonal consistency invites reader tear response. Slight static mid-section without further intensification keeps it from higher band.</comment>
