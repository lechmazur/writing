<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is consistently potter-specific, but the climactic “sharp gentleness” epiphany is declared rather than dramatized with bodily cost; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene to earn the moment. Still, her micro-choices (centering clay from triple-timeline earth, leaving vessels) visibly embody her stance, satisfying the 9− gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked pots become stronger, reweighting the premise that fracture equals failure. Cost is legible—she gives away the vessels and walks back into wasteland—under Accumulative lens. The Orientation Test is passed by word 80; no caps triggered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Environment-body-tool triad is crisp: wheel strapped to back, ash-colored ridge, phototropic leaves turning toward her soften. The lantern glass acts as micro-setting that reconfigures meaning at closure. One spatial slip: “across the wasteland” viewed from inside cottage strains coherence, but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—tightens when Mira realizes the oasis absorbs contradiction; option to abandon it is foreclosed by her decision to throw vessels. Cost (giving away labor, walking into wasteland) is present; pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping score sub-8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fired-clay metaphor: fracture as strength. No moralizing; final image of cracked yet sealed pots reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Ambiguity survives—three timelines remain true—inviting counter-readings without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mira’s potter-perception; perceptual signature vivid (“hands still carrying the calm of ten thousand centered pots”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. One filter-verb cluster around “she realized” beats, but rhythm recovers under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; strong verbs anchor motion. Minor scaffold: “the thrum intensified, and she understood” repeats prior beat. No mixed metaphors; figurative language sparse, tuned to potter lexicon. Closure image is uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Timeline-fractured oasis reframed through ceramic logic feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, no antagonist) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Could edge higher with sharper causal price.</comment>
