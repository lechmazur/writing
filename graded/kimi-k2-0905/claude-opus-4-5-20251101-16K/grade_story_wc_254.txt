<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vereth’s interior contradiction—reverence versus iconoclasm—drives every beat; the “tremor of certainty” is embodied in palm-on-quartz micro-choice that escalates to paraphrase. Cost is legible: sacred walls become permeable membranes, heresy embraced as necessity. Final warm pulse on stone shows earned change. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain: ban lifted → return → touch column → paraphrase verses → ice cracks → quartz glows → thaw begins. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: language act reweights reality rules; cost is sacrilege made irreversible. Orientation anchored by line 3; lens stable. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz constrain every move: the colonnade’s vibration literally enables the paraphrase; ice fracture externalizes linguistic breach. Micro-setting (warm quartz pulse) charges final image. Selective sensory triangulation—humming through bones, lantern-moth hush—keeps economy tight. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate sacred text—signaled early; escalation is causal: each paraphrased verse intensifies column glow and ice fracture, foreclosing retreat. Agency is linguistic act with visible price: sacrilege acknowledged by quartz response. One meaningful tightening suffices; coincidence absent. Cost legible in final warm stone and thawing crack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: language dissolves ontological boundaries. Subtext in quartz’s shift from cold to warm—institutional fear yielding to gratitude. Final image of thawing ice offers non-literal answer: truth needs fluidity, not walls. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—what emerges from lake remains unnamed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Vereth’s perceptual filter: “lantern-moth hush,” “frozen prayers” are poet-specific idiom. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for contemplation, clipped fragments at climax. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Patterned elision (“seventeen winters”) taught early, paid off in thaw.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“pours,” “cracks,” “breathes”) replace modifiers. Final line crack/thaw pair echoes opening freeze, creating cadence closure. No artifact touches ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cloud-shadow poet as linguistic hacker feels fresh; sacred-quartz-server conceit reframes censorship as data lock. Transformation test fails if poet swapped with generic rebel—specificity of verse-paraphrase mechanic is irreplaceable. Risk in lyric escalation rewarded: ice fracture as real-time progress bar. No derivative echoes.</comment>
