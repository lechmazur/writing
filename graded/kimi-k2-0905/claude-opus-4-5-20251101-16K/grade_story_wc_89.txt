<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s steady-handed calm under impossible pressure is dramatized through the embodied spice-circle ritual; the interior contradiction between clinging to humanity and letting it go is felt in her spread-wing final line. The renunciation costs her human body and bread-weight pleasures, a price legible on the page. Beast-whisperer backstory stays off-stage; only the “thirty years” label is given, so the trait never constrains present choice and keeps this shy of 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hybrid form crystallizes options—no longer woman, not pure phoenix—membrane-thin bond reforged with visible body-cost. Causal chain holds: fortune prophecy → spice conjuring → metamorphosis → shared essence, each because/therefore step foreclosing prior life. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never drift; world rule (phoenix amnesia) is stated early and paid off at the end. Persistent constraint—she can never be fully human again—shapes the final image, satisfying cost test for 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Silver orchard, moon-fruit, petal snow, and spice smoke create a selective sensory lattice that mirrors Mira’s narrowing perception under ritual stress. The grandmother-kitchen scent cue ties setting to emotional stakes, while the glowing fruit and suspended petals physically react to conjuring, integrating environment into action. No spatial drift; the single grove room stays coherent. Micro-setting (her own body becoming hollow-boned) charges the final image, meeting 9-band gate, but one over-ornate sentence (“vast as the cosmos yet intimate as a whispered name”) keeps it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reforge love across death—signals in line 6 and tightens once: human life vs. bond retrieval. The tightening is driven by her agency to light spices and complete metamorphosis, foreclosing mortality. Cost is visible on-page: body hollows, heart splits, humanity forfeited. No reversal or escalation loop; a single decisive intensification suffices for the lyric frame and lands cleanly under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of love’s persistence beyond erasure emerges through image pattern—ashes, smoke, scent—rather than statement. Final fusion reframes the fortune’s promise: survival demands becoming something unclassifiable, resisting tidy moral. Subtext in Ash’s first uncertain “Mira” shows memory-ghost pressure without exposition. Last-line cosmic note is earned by prior orchard eternities and spice-made memory, giving resonant ambiguity rather than platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptions; diction (“bread-weight,” “hollowing bones”) carries her tactile sensibility. Syntax lengthens then fragments under ritual stress, mirroring bodily dissolution without losing clarity. No head-hopping; phoenix Ash appears only in visionary smoke filtered through her senses. Distinct rhythmic control—sentence crest and hush—heightens cosmic intimacy without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or filler; each sentence advances image, motion, or stakes. Figurative vehicles stay internally consistent (flame, smoke, song) and never collide. Strong verbs (“twined,” “wrapped,” “splitting”) replace modifiers; opening anchors voice and closing line cadence recharges earlier silver motif. No artifact touches the metamorphosis beat or closure image; high information density maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Phoenix resurrection + beast-whisperer fusion feels fresh because the ritual uses olfactory memory rather than blood or rune tropes. Specific spice provenance (extinct mountains, eclipse bark) grounds myth in material rarity. Transformation stakes hinge on reluctance and sensory loss, avoiding heroic ascension cliché. Could edge higher with a sharper folk-or-cultural anchor, but risk-taking (scent-based conjuring, hybrid body) is coherent and meaningful.</comment>
