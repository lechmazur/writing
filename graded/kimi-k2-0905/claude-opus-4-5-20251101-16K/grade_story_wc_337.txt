<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s tremoring hands, prismatic reflection, and renunciation of sleep are vivid; yet her “brokenness” stays abstract, never colliding with an on-page choice that costs her anything during the ritual. Sela functions more as witness than pressure-source, so the relationship crucible is thin. The inherited-silence idea is strong, but the beat-to-beat stakes inside the sanctuary feel static—Mira never risks failure or refuses a step—so the change is Sela’s, not Mira’s. Earned stasis is hinted (Mira stays awake), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the net lies flat, the mother will sleep, and Mira re-affirms her sleepless vigil—cost is legible. Accumulative lens holds: each knot loosened adds silence to the prism walls, tightening the texture toward the final hush. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The single-scene default is met, but the tightening beat is incremental rather than a decisive turn that forecloses an option for Mira herself, keeping the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, bone-colored net, and star-fractured light are tactile and bias-filtered through Mira’s percipient fatigue. Spatial choreography is clean: cushion, bench, needle, net remain tracked. The micro-setting (net as centuries-old silence trap) directly constrains the ritual action and charges the final image when it lies “flat and soft.” Environment could wield even sharper pressure on Mira’s body (cold, thirst, bleeding fingers), but it already influences choice and closure enough to clear the 9− gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—“will the mother’s voices stop?”—is signaled early and deepens as each knot releases a heavier ancestral regret. Escalation is textural: the sanctuary hum thickens, the prisms pulse, silence accumulates. Agency resides in Mira’s steady unraveling, but because no knot resists or backfires, the risk plateaus; pressure intensifies in mood more than in tactical danger. One visible price is the absorbed hush itself, yet it is felt by the prisms, not by Mira’s body or options, so the tightening stays poetic rather than pivotal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—unspoken grief as inherited haunting—emerges through the net’s knots and the prismatic silence, never moralized. Subtext lives in gesture: the needle glowing “like a sliver of dawn” quietly equates restoration with recreated sunrise. Final image of Mira “accumulating silence” reweights the premise: exhumation is endless, rest is vicarious. Ambiguity is coherent; no tidy axiom caps the resonance, though the fisher-daughter chain could carry even more specific irony to push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Free-indirect style stays locked to Mira’s exhausted, reverent diction: “Silence is not absence. It is presence.” Syntax lengthens then contracts with ritual rhythm; no POV leakage into Sela. Dialogue is sparse, indirection solid (“They’re asking to be exhumed”). Perceptual signature—starlight fracturing into “a thousand silent colors” anchors Mira’s sensorium. Voice modulates under pressure; occasional elevated register (“vicarious rest”) is justified by the liturgical frame, keeping the 9− band in reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is dense but patterned: prism/light/net recur with coherent vehicles. No paraphrase loops; each released whisper adds new informational texture. A few adjectival floats (“accumulated stillness,” “ancient silence”) edge toward abstraction but never stall propulsion. Closure line is crisp, echoing “accumulating silence” to bind motif. Microscopic clarity stays intact; one more tactile detail in the final third could nudge 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “restorer of the dead’s forgotten faces” is fresh; tying it to knot-unraveling gives conceptual snap. Ancestral silence as breathable sediment reframes familiar ghost-trope into material craft. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversal—but the closure commits fully, no safety retreat. Could push revolutionary if the ritual invented one impossible physics rule that finally backfires on Mira, yet the current synthesis already feels specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
