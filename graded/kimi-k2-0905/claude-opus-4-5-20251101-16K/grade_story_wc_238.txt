<comment>Vera’s guilt-propelled exorcism is embodied (trembling hands, tear-blurred eyes) and her interiority stays concrete—“I lied about you” lands as a physically-felt rupture. The micro-choice to crank the generator again reframes her hierarchy of values, and the final resolve to “write one more column” is earned by the ghost’s refusal of absolution. Flaws: we’re told, not shown, her fifteen-year appetite for scandal, so moral turn feels slightly compressed, not inevitable. Still, the wound/scar paradox gives visible cost, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is tight: lie → guilt → séance → confession → pledge of restitution; each beat narrows her moral options. Closure (Earned Stasis) crystallizes when perfume bottle empties and orchard clock keeps ticking—apology accepted “imperfectly” with scar-cost legible. Orientation anchored by line 9; no lens ambiguity; no off-stage fixes. Only hairline slip: the “gossip-column exorcist” tag is asserted before we see it operate, a 0.1-level expositional nudge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Archive is sketched through lived action—copper wire across dusty boxes, rustling scores—while jasmine scent and generator hum give multi-sense texture. Apple orchard functions as environmental countdown, tightening stakes without authorial nudge. The perfume bottle recurs as micro-setting that constrains the ritual and reappears empty to mark change. Spatial choreography stays clean; no scene stalling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: salvage integrity by confessing to the woman she destroyed. Pressure rises because the séance can still fail, the orchard deadline is hours away, and Margot’s legacy hangs on Vera’s next column. The turning beat—Eleanor refuses full absolution—forces Vera from begging forgiveness to practical reparation; option-space narrows with felt moral cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of imperfect repair emerges through recurring “imperfect miracle” motif, culminating in the empty bottle that still smells faintly—scar as remainder. Subtext in ghost’s river/stone metaphors lets forgiveness be partial without moral sermon. Final image of reading forgotten scores quietly reweights earlier scandal, achieving Conceptual Repricing of artistic legacy. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether one column can outweigh years of damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Vera’s perceptual filter—“eyes watered,” “ragged breathing”—syntax tightens under crank-stress. Ghost dialogue carries subtext (river ≠ apology) and distinct winter-pond idiom. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts naturally at climax. Occasional elevated phrasing (“ephemeral grit of that waiting hour”) fits lyrical mode and is earned by earlier pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; openings avoid template. Figurative language is selective—“light like dawn through dirty windows” serves visibility beat, not ornament. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. One minor scaffold: “then she was gone, and the archive fell silent…” could trim “and,” but it doesn’t dull closure. Copy clean; prop states track.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing gossip hack with spiritualism feels fresh, and the “induced-current” séance is grounded in tactile copper coils rather than hand-waved magic. Orchard destruction countdown externalizes moral urgency without melodrama. Transformation of scandal-writer into post-mortem archivist grows organically from revealed guilt. Risky metaphor density mostly pays off; slight familiarity of “scar that heals” keeps it from 9-band.</comment>
