<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—guilt over the mis-sent signal vs. her refusal to freeze—drives every beat; the empty pen as tactile guilt keeps the flaw alive. The “confidently uncertain” stance is embodied in micro-choices (she rewrites, transmits, waits) rather than label-speak. No epiphany is declared; the shift to reframing is shown in the act of writing and the final tactile touch of the pen. Cost is visible: she accepts she may still be wrong and must live in the same pooled time she’s bent.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through pattern deepening (signals, bends, edits) rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira transmits the corrective signal, then sits back to wait—options narrowed, cost felt in the acceptance of perpetual contingency. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (Station Kepler-7, gravitational anomaly, her job). No teleporting props or logic breaks; the pen’s prismatic flash at the end recharges its earlier appearance.</comment>

<comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: it lets time pool, signals brush the present, and literally bends her choices. The empty fountain pen serves as portable setting-object; its prismatic nib catches anomaly-light and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—light halos, dry stylus, pooled time—filtered through her interpreter’s bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms or impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she mitigate the colonial deaths she set in motion? Pressure deepens as she moves from denial to reframing; the tightening is the decision to send a contextualizing signal rather than retract the first. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual uncertainty and the possibility of compound error. Agency sits entirely with her; luck neither saves nor damns.</question>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through particulars: interpretation = creation, history = conversation, not fixity. The pen’s empty nib and the anomaly’s bent light reweight each other without explicit thesis. Final image—she touches the pen and watches bent starlight—offers resonant, non-literal answer: meaning is harvested, not invented, and harvesters must live with residue. No closing moral or thematic echo; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Mira’s interpreter-brain: selective attention to signal noise, time eddies, prismatic light. Diction—“pooled,” “thresh,” “reframe”—is professional-astronomer diction without register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into the staccato of transmission code. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; internal monologue is clean and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence moves (light bent, signal sent, meaning harvested). Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Occasional template cadence (“She… She…” twice) but never in peak beats; final paragraph varies rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops; the pen’s return is brief and charged. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, strong verbs.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “interpreter as inadvertent historian” angle is fresh; bent-light anomaly as editorial office feels novel yet inevitable. Trope of empty pen transformed from cliché of lost art to emblem of interpretive humility. Risk taken with quiet, contemplative closure rather than set-piece rescue; coherence holds. Specific detail (solar-flare nib, pooled time) prevents generic anywhere/nowhere feel.</comment>
