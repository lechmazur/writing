<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s fear-to-motion gift is viscerally embodied in the ladder climb; the contradictory impulses (terror + ascent) play out in real time. Victor’s paternal mask slipping into predatory need gives a crisp status swing that re-charges the stake. The final rooftop run carries a felt cost—she is still trembling, still hearing whispers—so the arc lands as earned endurance rather than triumphalism. Only the “collection of fears” line drifts toward label-speak, blunting the otherwise sharp interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of the cast → blackmail signal → Victor’s arrival → ladder escape, each beat narrowing options. The plaster cast is introduced early, re-seen under starlight, and finally brandished as the decisive leverage; its smudged ink supplies the visible cost at closure. Orientation is clean within 80 words and the single-scene pressure tightens without loopholes. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the rooftop exit is set up by the balcony mention in the first third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted library’s missing roof funnels starlight onto the cast, turning setting into spotlight for the decryption beat; the groaning ladder rungs literalize her phobia underfoot. Sensory triage—cold light, flaking rust, whispered shell—mirrors her narrowed attention without tourist cataloging. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: bookcase back → moonlit aisle → ladder → skylight → rooftop, no impossible jumps. Environment constrains the final choice (only one escape route) and is re-seen in the last image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ownership of her own identity—locks in by line 4 and tightens when the cast becomes a live detonator. The mid-scene reversal: she weaponizes Victor’s sentimental trophy, turning his leverage into hers; this narrows his options from predator to cornered criminal. Cost is visible: trembling hands, rust flakes in palm, whispered shell as lifeline. One meaningful tightening suffices; no escalation loops or coincidence rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Vulnerability-as-power emerges through embodied action, not thesis: trembling voice still climbs, fear still runs. The seashell’s whisper reweights from childhood fantasy to maternal compass without exposition. Final rooftop line “I’m coming home” reconfigures “home” from Victor’s cage to an unknown future—conceptual repricing with felt risk. No closing moral, only an open after-image that invites reflection on what bravery actually costs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter: starlight as cold pressure, rust as tactile fear, shell-whisper as maternal cipher. Syntax shortens under stress (“I feel everything. And I still choose to move”) without drum-beat monotony. Victor’s diction—“You’ve always been scared of everything”—carries paternal warmth turned predatory, distinct from her interior cadence. No filter-verb stacks or POV leakage; psychic distance compresses exactly as she climbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “rusted library had no roof anymore—just stars” does world, mood, and stake in one stroke. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful; no mixed-metaphor clutter during the ladder beat. One paraphrase loop—“I’m scared” repeated twice in dialogue—is intentional emphasis, not artifact. Rhythm modulates from longer reflective sentences to clipped climactic declarations, mirroring ascent without syntactic stutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The stolen-child-receipt-on-a-cast is a fresh forensic twist on the identity-revelation trope; the sentimental villain who archives his own crime feels non-obvious. Seashell-as-maternal-beacon avoids generic locket cliché by remaining half-empty, half-whisper. Rooftop exit via phobia-ridden stuntwork inverts the fearless-hero cliché: she wins because she trembles. While the “orphan learns true parentage” spine is familiar, the specific objects and the vulnerability-as-power reframing give it memorable inflection.</comment>
