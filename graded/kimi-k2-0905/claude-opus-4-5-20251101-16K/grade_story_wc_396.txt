<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vela’s interior contradiction—lonely cartographer of empathy—animates every beat; the final renunciation (returning to mirrors, embracing solitude) is earned by the on-page cost of sending Sera away. Shadow-lacing and “too strange” remain abstract labels, never embodied in sensory or behavioral specifics, so the promised anomaly never fully individuates her. Sera’s single micro-choice (tears → purpose) is credible but thin; more pressure on their brief status dynamic would have sharpened both women. Still, motives stay coherent under the Accumulative lens and closure is internally paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Vela’s stasis reconfigures loneliness into vocation while Sera departs with new direction; the cost (perpetual isolation) pulses in the final shadow image. Causality is lyrical rather than plot-driven—each mirror-glimpse accretes until meaning crystallises, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift: lighthouse, orchard, client, mission all anchored inside 70 words. No reversals are required; the single deepening suffices and forecloses no options cheaply.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ice-road, salt-tinged apples, and vintage mirrors are tactile, POV-filtered, and constrain later choice (only through mirrors can the message surface). The lighthouse and orchard function as micro-setting that charges the final image of defiant fragrance. Spatial choreography is flawless across the single scene. While the world rules never test credibility, they also never risk a 9+ charge—no environmental hazard actually threatens tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“recover the unsaid goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens when forgiveness, not memory, becomes the revealed burden. Escalation is textural: each glimpse adds emotional mass until Sera’s stance crystallises; Vela’s price is the accumulated weight of others’ pain. No external antagonist or reversal is needed under the Accumulative lens, but the lack of any tangible obstacle keeps pressure literary rather than visceral, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—translation of loss into direction—emerges through apple-perfume and cracked crystal, never sermonised. The final image of fragrant defiance reweights the orchard from impossible ornament into emblem of chosen solitude. Subtext in “weighted breath before reply” gives silence more charge than dialogue. A hairline slip toward platitude (“this was what it meant to reconstitute”) denies a 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is controlled and distinct: frost-bitten apples, salt-stung glass, shadow-pulse diction all filtered through Vela’s calibrated detachment. Syntax breathes with mirror-glimpse cadences; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext (Sera’s sharp intake). The restrained lyricism never purples, sustaining atmospheric pressure to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no loops, stacks, or template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and pattern-coherent (“constellation of points… invisible threads”). Information density is high—each sentence advances image, motive, or meaning. Opening and closing lines perform double duty, anchoring voice and recharging motif. This is line-level control worthy of immediate publication.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Empathy-as-cartography mapped through antique mirrors on an ice-bound apple orchard is a fresh synthesis; the speculative frame feels inevitable, not contrived. Trope of mystical grief-counselor is personaliSed through Vela’s shadow-laced loneliness and earned stasis. No famous scenes are echoed; risk resides in quiet interiority rather than shock. Specificity could push higher, but the concept already resists swap-test substitution.</comment>
