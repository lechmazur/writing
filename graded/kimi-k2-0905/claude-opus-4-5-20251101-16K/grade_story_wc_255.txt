<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s yearning to “see like others” is embodied and particular; the refusal to spend the reed tongue crystallizes her shift from deficit to gift. Interiority is concrete (“she could paint the way light fractured against cloud…”) rather than therapeutic. The only drag is a late paragraph that explains what the courtyard scene has already dramatized; still, the renunciation lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed tongue is returned, the flawed sculptures reweight her perception, and the cracked pot/vine image charges the final beat with conceptual cost. Causal chain is intact—every beat is because/therefore—under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no caps apply. A micro-drag is the single explanatory paragraph, but it doesn’t touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass rejects become the environment that bends light into patterns she can “see”; micro-setting (imperfect glass) literally constrains her final perception. Sensory hierarchy obeys her color-blind bias: form, fracture, light-angle predominate over hue. Phoenix dawn and herb-code are economical anchors reused without clutter. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and sculptures track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeing beauty—tightens once when the warped sculptures reveal that imperfection is the very instrument of her sight. Agency is present: she chooses to keep the reed, renouncing the supposed cure. Cost is legible—the “unspent” heirloom now carries the weight of refused metamorphosis. One tightening suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete return of the reed and the cracked pot: flaw as generative vessel. Subtext operates in Vera’s plant-code silence and in Mira’s slow recognition that her limitation is already a lens. No moralizing line is delivered; the final image reweights the premise without assertion. Ambiguity lingers—she still can’t name colors—keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Mira’s color-blind perceptual signature: “greens…muddy browns,” “architecture of light.” Syntax lengthens under wonder then clips at the renunciation (“The concertina reed tongue remained…unspent.”). No head-hop; Vera’s interior is accessed only through plants, as promised. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates—long luminous sentences for the courtyard, then staccato final line. No loops, no mixed metaphors; “imperfect vessel nurturing perfect life” is precise. Information density is high: one sentence often layers glass, light, and emotional shift. A single near-repeat (“she had come…she had received”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of color-blind painter + phoenix-glass + silent plant-code feels non-obvious and specific to this world. Trope of “flaw as gift” is refreshed through the tactile glass rejects and the unspent heirloom. Risk in silent plant-dialogue is taught early and paid off. Removing any core ingredient would collapse the final reconfiguration; transformation is not skin-deep.</comment>
