<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s “earnest naivety” is dramatized through micro-choices—counting drops, soft-forging bronze, striking the bell—each aligning with her limited power and the cosmic stake. Interiority stays concrete (“she knew, with the certainty of the earnestly naive”) and her endurance costs her time, stamina, and social credibility. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-action, so the arc is linear rather than torn, capping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drip-counting pattern intensifies, bell-repair cadence aligns, and closure lands via Charged Poise—the harbor’s first ripple reweights all prior effort with undeniable conceptual cost. Anchors (who/where/when) appear within 60 words; no orientation debt. One shard, single POV, one transitionless scene meets scope default. The final sentence crystallizes options without forcing a causal twist, satisfying closure with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: its weeping cracks supply the literal rhythm that calibrates the bell and the final image. Dawn light progression is filtered through Mira’s hopeful bias; sensory hierarchy narrows to sound of drops and bell, then sight of silver flash. Spatial choreography is clean—bell fragments move from ground to rope to strike point. Environment constrains her lukewarm fire and dictates timing, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“fix what we broke”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when drip rhythms force slow, error-risky metalwork. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the first ripple: option space shifts from futility to possible recovery. Cost is visible in cracked bell-scar and her dawn-long labor. No second reversal or antagonist, but accumulative pattern suffices under chosen lens; could use one more tangible forfeiture to reach 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: lukewarm power, drip counting, scarred bell imply “restoration through persistent smallness.” No explicit thesis; final image of “something small and silver remembering how to live” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Ambiguity remains—cosmic imbalance is neither explained nor fully healed—inviting reflection without confusion. The refusal to grand-stand amplifies resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays snug to Mira’s perceptual filter: “sapphire glowing like hope made solid” reads as her metaphor, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens during meditative counting, shortens at silver flash, mirroring attention shift. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal diction, which remains consistent. One clause edges toward editorial certainty (“everyone knew”), a hairline slip keeping it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is loop-free, metaphor-controlled, rhythm-varied; only one near-repeat (“today was enough” echoing “today, at least…”) but it serves cadence closure. High density: “still, silent, empty of life since they’d pulled the last silver-scaled herring” performs scene-setting, timeline, and stake in thirteen words. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffolding—meets 9-band line-level bar.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Lukewarm mage” plus “sympathetic restoration via drip-counting” offers a fresh synthesis of low-magic eco-fiction. Bell-repair as ritual, harbor silence as cosmic ledger, and naïve persistence as viable agency avoid genre cliché. The concept commits fully—no late power upgrade or hidden mentor. Specificity of sapphire viaduct and herring scale flash feels idiosyncratic, not ornamental. Risk is present but modest, keeping it just inside high band.</comment>
