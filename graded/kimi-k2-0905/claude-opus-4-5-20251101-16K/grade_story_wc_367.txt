<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s long arc of inherited duty and nightly ritual is vivid; her laughter-as-prophecy and final three-degree tilt toward hope show interior contradiction under pressure. Grandmother chain and star-trap glass give her occupation texture. The only missing beat is a moment where her choice visibly costs her something on the page—tilt is enacted, but price is implied rather than burned into her body or future, keeping her just shy of 8+ earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens reconfigures possible futures and her laughter seeds unknown change, cost felt in the unknown (conceptual). Causal chain—ritual → star-capture → pattern choice → world nudge—holds under Accumulative lens; each night’s micro-adjustment accretes. Orientation clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. Slight waiver: cost is cosmic, not personal, so sting is abstract rather than embodied, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Emerald walls, black water, volcanic-crystal wick, and star-coiling optics are tactile and bias Mira’s astronomer-attuned eye. Lighthouse as micro-setting constrains every move: spiral stairs force ritual ascent, lens chamber limits star-capture geometry, tilt of glass decides futures. Weather and tech decay outside are filtered through her disdain for “wavelengths she barely understood,” keeping detail selective. Final image of hope bouncing inward forever is inseparable from the glass architecture—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—which future pattern to amplify—signals early; escalation is the tightening of optic focus and the narrowing of possible shadows. Agency is the calibrated tilt; cost is the unknowable ripple she unleashes, legible as conceptual risk. No coincidence; pressure grows because starlight must be bent anew each night. Could cross 8.8 if a concrete price (fatigue, social backlash, memory bleed) had been dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the moral weight of small, hidden steering—ancient tech vs. human hope—without authorial sermon. Motif of “light remembering its path” reweights from physics to ethics at closure. Subtext in her laughter: joy that foretells destruction also fertilizes possibility. Final image of hope “building strength” offers resonant ambiguity; no tidy moral, but would sharpen if an earlier seed (a village child’s fate?) had echoed back in the last line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays glued to Mira’s astronomer perception: “wind chimes caught in a gale,” “atmospheric pressure dropping.” Syntax lengthens during ritual, shortens during tilt, mirroring breath. No head-hops; diction remains coastal-ancient, avoiding digital slang. Occasional elevated phrases—“temporal mirror,” “conceptual repricing” level—slip toward academic, but they appear in reflective beats, not under peak stress, so voice cohesion holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic variety between spiral ascent and star-capture crescendo; information dense—each sentence layers glass physics, generational time, and cosmic stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors; “shadow-patterns cast upon curved walls” is precise. One scaffold risk: “light teaching itself where to go” is lovely but near-paraphrase of prior clause; doesn’t obscure causality. Closure image crystallizes without clutter, earning high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse as active time-prism steering post-digital humanity via pre-digital optics. Ritualized star-capture and accidental-prophetic laughter avoid stock mystic tropes by grounding in geophysics and hereditary muscle memory. Tilt-as-politics is a micro-gesture with macro-consequence, a non-obvious lever. Risky lyric ending pays off—image of hope bouncing inward forever feels inevitable yet unwritten. Deduction only for faint echo of “last paper texts” trope found elsewhere.</comment>
