<comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—grief for lost sound vs hunger to remake music—are alive in every tactile beat; the tuning-fork micro-choices visibly cost her skin-numb palms and dwindling daylight. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. Final smile is earned because the text has forced her to test the premise on her own body first.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each fork strike layers thermal data until the sunset amber crystallizes a Charged Poise—silence can “sing,” but only at the price of permanent exile from audible music. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no drift. Closure image reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: the frost-pane conducts vibration, channels heat, and supplies the literal surface Maren must press her skin against—pain is the price of data. Camera, forks, and frozen canes evolve state across beats; spatial choreography stays clean. Final amber light is inseparable from the thermal palette she’s learned to read.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can silence become music?—tightens through each fork strike that costs warmth, time, and skin. One meaningful deepening: the moment she admits the old self “drowned,” foreclosing return to orchestral life. Cost is visible on the page (numb palm, dwindling light), not merely claimed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from heat gradients: feeling replaces hearing, but only through continuous, measurable loss. Final image of frost-roses “breathing” infrared reconfigures the earlier drowning memory without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; resonance is earned via sensory particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a composer’s perceptual signature—precise frequencies, color-temperature synesthesia—without ever ventriloquizing non-POV knowledge. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for grief, staccato fragments during fork strikes. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens as fingers numb.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “She struck it against her palm and pressed it to a dormant rose cane” advances action, conveys winter dormancy, and sets up the thermal payoff. No synonym loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, pressure-matched; mixed metaphors absent. Clean proofing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: using precision tuning forks as deaf-accessible sonar to generate infrared “scores” is non-obvious and fully grounded in botanical science. Risk—telling a music story without sound—pays off because the final image redefines “song” as heat. Premise is inseparable from this character and this glasshouse.</comment>
