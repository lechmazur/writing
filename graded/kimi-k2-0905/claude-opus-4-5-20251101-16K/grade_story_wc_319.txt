<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—“she breathed the mist into her lungs and felt it settle in her bones”—but the piece never lets her make a micro-choice that actually alters the library, the pendant, or a visitor. Her “feral” state is shown only in posture, never in a consequential decision; the final raised-hand salute is beautiful stasis, not costly renunciation. Because the arc is pure endurance, the rating peaks at strong portrait rather than full dramatic agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared by repetition of “wait” and density of stillness; closure is a Charged Poise—hands lifted through mist—where cost is the lifelong surrender of motion. Cause-and-effect is present in the pendant’s gradual warming and the accretion of books, but no single beat tightens options; pressure widens rather than narrows. Orientation is waived: disorientation is taught in line 1 and paid off in the communal salute. Closure is legible and resonant under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen garden, ice-locked roses, and mist function as micro-setting that literally freezes choice; the guardian’s palms on the ice constrain her to stillness and supply the final image. Sensory triage favors cold and hush, mirroring the stake of suspended return. Spatial choreography is deliberately vaporous yet coherent—columns of books grow like stalagmites, distance tracked by gray silhouettes. The environment charges the ending; no other locale could host this poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“make friends with uncertainty”—is signaled early and deepens through accretion of stillness; no reversal occurs, but density of quiet intensifies until the communal wave crystallizes the cost of eternal vigil. Agency is purely receptive; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Enough for the lyric mode, but the absence of a narrowing beat keeps the score below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images of suspended boundaries—light fraying, pages bleeding, mist curling—culminating in the notion that home is a practice, not a coordinate. No overt thesis is stated; the final lifted hand reconfigures “dimensionally homesick” into solidarity at the edge. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged. The only drag is a hint of Echo in the phrase “friends with uncertainty,” but it is earned by embodied waiting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains a frost-bitten cadence—long sentences that exhale like fog, then fragment into crystalline pauses. Perceptual signature is consistent: the guardian notices temperature, silence, and dissolved text, never abstract exposition. Non-standard compression (“time pooled…rushed”) is pattern-taught in the first 25% and paid off in the final sentence. Voice modulates with pressure without ever slipping into generic omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—varied sentence lengths, no template cadence; figurative language is selective and apt (“eternal questions” in petals). One scaffold spot: “not as patience… but as practice” mildly paraphrases; otherwise density is high. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Line-level craft stays clear of the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ hygiene test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The frozen liminal library feels singular; the conceit of “interiorizing exteriors” reframes stillness as metabolic. Risk is taken—no plot twist, only accretion—yet coherence holds. Slight proximity to Borges or Valente is transformed through bodily cold and communal wave. Not quite a 9.0 because the core trope of guardian-between-worlds is recognizable, but specificity and sonic conviction push it close.</comment>
