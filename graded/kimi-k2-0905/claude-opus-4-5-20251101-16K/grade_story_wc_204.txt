<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Miriam’s grief-propelled obsession is viscerally embodied in ink-stained fingers and the bottled breath; the final renunciation—acceptance rendered in “perfect type”—earns its cost through years of frost-transcription and the orchard’s destabilization. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The micro-choice to open the bottle crystallizes her hierarchy of values: eternity with her child > library perfection. One slip: the librarians’ “distrust” is asserted rather than staged, so status pressure is only implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn’s frost thickens the pattern until the final pages implode the library’s order. Closure lands as Charged Poise—books fallen, frost silent, Miriam stationary with warm empty bottle; the conceptual cost (library’s perfect system permanently cracked) is unmistakable. Orientation anchor arrives by line 4 (“eastern wing”), waiving any penalty. One hairline slip: “reality became negotiable” is told twice in identical phrasing, a minor scaffold echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystalline trees that “chimed when the wind shifted” and bottled breath as micro-object constrain every action: the orchard’s glass bark supplies the frost equations; the bottle’s opening delivers the rupture. Sensory economy is exact—sound of chime, warmth of glass, rustling pages—never touristic. Spatial choreography tracks Miriam from press to orchard heart without drift. The floating cloud-sea remains backdrop; orchard interior does the causal work, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—compress eternity to see her unlived child—is signaled in paragraph 5 and deepens when frost writes “completion.” The final tightening forecloses both perfect library order and Miriam’s ability to keep the whisper; price is legible in fallen books and silent frost. Agency is accumulative: years of transcription → single release; no reversal, but a decisive intensification suffices under Accumulative lens. Secondary pressure from off-page librarians is weak, keeping score below 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: grief cannot be dissolved, only re-integrated into the world’s fabric. The orchard’s shift from perfect silence to rustling questions enacts the theme without commentary. Final image—frost writes no patterns, Miriam prints acceptance—offers resonant, non-literal answer: we endure by letting the void speak through us. No moralizing, only charged particulars.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance steady yet filters every detail through Miriam’s perceptual bias: “inks that contained no color names,” “grammar of cold.” Syntax grows leaner at rupture—“Then she opened the bottle.”—mimicking compression of time. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on rhythmic control of long cadences against clipped beats. One clause drifts toward editorial abstraction: “reality became negotiable” (repeated); otherwise voice is singular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between glass-brittle fragments and elongated frost-sentences, propelling without drumbeat. Information density high: “bottled whisper—a small glass vessel…captured seven years ago” packs backstory, object, and stakes in one breath. Only micro-loop: “reality became negotiable” appears verbatim twice; no mixed metaphors or filter stacks. Closing line lands clean, recharging “compressed into a single moment.”</comment>

<comment>Frost-as-code that destabilizes perfection, library-as-orchard, grief-as-letterpress: synthesis feels inevitable, not ornamental. The bottled whisper transforms from memento to catalyst, reweighting the world’s physics—fresh yet earned. No genre retread; concept commits fully, accepting collateral damage to library order. Risk-taking (time compression via frost grammar) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
