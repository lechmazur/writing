<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity and Cal’s compulsion to truth-tell give every beat direction; her decision to climb higher is earned by the riddle’s sting. Interiority stays concrete—“she smelled of hive smoke” anchors motive in sensory memory. Cal’s sad smile shows embodied cost of a lifetime without lies. No drift into diagnostic labels; the final pocketing of the matchbox crystallizes her hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sabotage → hive failure → tower leak → riddle → vault. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira carries “a reminder that miracles hide in plain sight,” reweighting routine vs. wonder with felt cost wrought by the city’s darkness and Cal’s thirty-year vigil. One scaffold slip—“the truth of that, I give you freely”—is redundant since Cal must give truth, but it doesn’t dull the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower’s copper struts, lacquer box reflecting “still water,” and hive smoke on clothes are selective, sensory, and filtered through Mira’s apiary-bred attention. Micro-setting charges closure: the vault beneath the tower is the literal foundation that will restore power, making environment a tactical resource. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography clean as she ascends. Nectar dusk evolves from honeyed light to “genuine darkness,” mirroring stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore power—signaled early; tightening occurs when riddle redefines sabotage as symptom, not cause. Cal’s truth-telling forces Mira to absorb cost of knowledge she can’t unknow. No false cliffhangers; escalation stays causal under lens. Price visible: city waits in darkness while she climbs; her endurance forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete paradox: routine blindness vs. wonder-keeping; no explicit sermon. Riddle and matchbox act as tangible subtext for pre-planned fragility. Final reconfiguration—“miracles hide in plain sight”—is earned by Cal’s three-decade invisibility and Mira’s choice to see. Avoids tidy moral by leaving sabotage culprit unnamed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close to Mira sustains perceptual signature: she notices hive smoke, copper reflections, algorithmic jargon. Syntax modulates—“like water through cracked clay” mirrors leak of charge. No head-hopping; Cal’s dialogue stays laconic, truth-forced, distinct from Mira’s inward curiosity. Psychic distance tightens under pressure: final paragraph compresses to one stark image of her ascent into darkness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “drone bees began falling from the sky like metal rain” does world-building, stakes, and sensory shock in one line. Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“needle threading gold”), and paid off at closure. One paraphrase loop—“they forget…they forget…”—is purposeful ritual refrain, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: apiary-mechanical bees as civic power grid; toll keeper as wonder-warden. Premise transforms eco-punk trope through Cal’s involuntary truth curse, giving personal cost to systemic failure. Riddle breadcrumb seeded 14 years earlier feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken with lyrical dusk-to-darkness arc succeeds under accumulative lens.</comment>
