<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to fragments yet fleeing the weight of ambition—are dramatized in the lagoon confrontation; the camera-wheel hand-off crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost, earning the Earned Stasis closure. Interiority stays concrete: “she simply gathered these fragments, held them in her chest like small coins” embodies rather than labels regret. The micro-choice to sit with whole regret at the end is causally prepared by the ghost’s refusal to relieve her, making the endurance credible. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV interiority remains sharp and character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s decision to carry whole regret reweights the premise and forecloses escape into fragmented time. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of scattered fragments coheres into one unbearable whole at the end; the carousel halt and upward-drip water teach the surreal rule-set early, paid off when she stops scattering herself. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and reiterated; disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. Cost is legible in final image: “she lifted the camera wheel toward [the light]” accepting the weight of unspent desire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above clouds functions as micro-setting that directly supplies the fragments Mira nets and the ghost she confronts; environment alters tactics—water resists then relents during negotiation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: “luminous and gray” sky, “chemical smell of developer fluid” in flashback. Spatial choreography is clean across the wade and shore encounter; no impossible shifts. The camera wheel as recurring object charges the final image when lifted toward light, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Mira will keep dispersing regret or accept its full weight—is signaled early and tightens once when the ghost refuses to take back ambition; this deepens rather than reverses, reweighting the stake under Accumulative lens. Escalation is driven by her agency: she initiates the hand-off, then chooses to sit with whole regret; cost is visible on page. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. Coincidence is absent; all turns arise from her prior pattern of self-scattering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cost of fleeing one’s own wanting. No explicit thesis; insight is earned through the camera-wheel reprise and final act of carrying regret. Final image reweights prior fragment-collection motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—peace may or may not follow—yet emotional after-effect is concrete. Subtext resides in gesture: the upward drip of water mirrors her scattered memories, never stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; rhythmic variation mirrors Mira’s fractured temporality: long spiraling sentences for lagoon stillness, sharp fragments when regret hits. Perceptual signature is distinct—time as “scattered like startled birds,” memories arriving “sideways.” No dialogue to evaluate; interior monologue avoids filter verbs: “she understood then” is earned, not explanatory. Diction stays within POV lexicon; non-standard grammar (fragments) is pattern-taught and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; high information density—single sentences do triple duty: “The carousel hadn’t stopped because something broke” advances plot, theme, and causality. Metaphors are coherent and fresh: “hours scattered like startled birds” extends avian motif without contradiction. Sentence rhythm breathes with emotional beats; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No overwriting in final third; closure image remains crisp. Minor scaffold: “she turned it between her fingers” is functional, not redundant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise—scavenger collecting lost voices above the clouds—feels fresh yet inevitable, grounded in photographer’s regret. Surreal carousel and upward-drip water are specific to this world, not generic dystopia. Transformation test fails: core emotional arc could survive relocation, but accumulation of fragment-stories into whole regret is uniquely rendered through camera-wheel object. Risk in nonlinear time is coherent and heightens meaning without gimmickry. Slight deduction for echo of “ghost of ambition” trope, though execution is personalized.</comment>
