<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s shift from dismissive skeptic to willing apprentice is embodied in the cold weight of the tooth and her trembling hand—micro-choice with cost. The contradictory impulses—scorn for her mother’s rituals vs. the undeniable artifact—coexist in the same beats rather than alternating summaries. Thomas-not-Thomas’s careful, borrowed-body movement shows rather than labels his liminal nature. The final seated moment beside the impossible fountain crystallizes a new hierarchy of values: wonder over certainty, with the price being the foreclosure of her old pragmatic life.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s acceptance of the tooth and request for “new maps” reweights her entire epistemic stance with felt cost—the cleft becomes a doorway she chooses not to close. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image (wooden figure, maze, moonflowers, tooth) layers density until the final cadence shift in the garden. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“collapsed root cellar”) and never wavers. No causal break; the fountain reactivating is an earned magical realist image that pays off the garden’s maintained state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hedge maze’s thorn arch and the moonflower-scented bench function as micro-setting that constrains entry and frames the final conversation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Maren notices perfume, herbs, fear—details that matter to her biography. The silent fountain’s sudden trickle is an environmental change that mirrors her internal realignment. Spatial choreography is clean: left-left-right path, circular clearing, seated dyad—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Maren will re-open belief—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the tooth’s cold weight forces a binary: dismiss or accept. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the bench: the revelation that love for both sons coexisted raises the cost of her former disbelief. Agency is hers when she closes her fist around the tooth and asks to be taught. Coincidence (the fountain restarting) complicates rather than resolves; it underscores that the garden is alive to her decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: a changeling’s tooth and a mother’s parallel loves reprice the idea that belief and love are not binary. The final image—doorway as cleft—offers a non-literal answer: certainty is the smaller cage. No moralizing; the resonance is in Maren’s whispered request. Subtext lives in gesture: the careful way Thomas-not-Thomas sits, implying centuries of borrowed bodies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual signature: “nostalgic innovation” surfaces unquoted as her own thought, preserving psychic distance. Syntax lengthens under wonder—“ancient and immediate, remembering and becoming”—mirroring her dawning awe. No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior is opaque, read only through Maren’s interpretation of his birdlike tilt. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“she noticed”) they serve immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: short declaratives under shock (“The tooth was cold, heavier than it should have been”) swell into lyric cadence at closure. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent: “cleft in her certainty” sustains across body and hedge without mixing vehicles. One minor scaffold—“something to navigate by instead of stumble over”—but it is character-originated and paid off in the final maps line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fairy-changeling lore is inverted: the “stolen” child is the gentle teacher, the human mother the flawed protector. The wooden substitute body and retained baby tooth are fresh, specific artifacts that ground the fantastic in tactile dread. Risk is taken by making the climax a quiet conversation rather than escape or battle; coherence is maintained. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, because the tooth’s biological impossibility and hedge-maze geography are irreducibly particular.</comment>
