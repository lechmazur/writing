<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s dawning self-recognition is shown through body (the warming bead) and micro-choice (hand to chest), but the internal contradiction—grief at losing her vs. joy at finding her again—is stated more than dramatized in the final beat, keeping the cost vivid yet not quite embodied. Ghost bride’s motivation is legible and fixes the plot, but she is observer/teacher rather than character under equal pressure, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is one-sided. Still, the arc of remembered lifetimes lands as a credible, earned renunciation of ghostly contact with visible price (bead dissolves, dawn returns), meeting the 9+ quick test for change with cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bead’s dissolution and first sunrise in centuries make the before/after legible and charge the final image with undeniable conceptual cost—immortality curse broken, new cycle starts. Causal chain holds: her appearances → memory surfacing → bead warming → full recognition → bead crumbles → dawn breaks; each step is a because/therefore linkage under the Causal lens. No plot amnesia; every ghost glimpse is paid off in the final beat. Cost is on-page in the last two sentences—bead gone, night ended—so 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<comment>Greenhouse as micro-setting directly constrains choice: fogged panes keep the ghost visible only in ephemeral cameos, mercury-starfruit trees supply the stage for final encounter. Sensory selection stays POV-tied—“breath of impossible plants,” “scent of night-blooming flowers”—and mirrors Elias’s narrowing attention under revelation. Spatial choreography is clean; veil and bead track logically across the single scene. The orchard’s alchemical rules (liquid-gold sap, crystallized starlight) integrate with theme of mutated love/death without exposition dumps, charging the final image of dawn on winter fields.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can the ghost repay the death-debt and free them both—signals early and tightens through each cameo, culminating in the bead’s destruction and dawn return. Escalation is one steady accumulation: glimpses increase clarity → knowledge widens → cost becomes visible → final choice to accept loss of ghost contact. Agency sits with Elias’s recognition; the tightening forecloses the option of endless ghost orbit and forces mortal life, price felt on-page. Sufficient for length; no reversals needed under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: love twisted into poison becomes medicine across centuries only when connection is chosen over immortality. Subtext lives in gesture—veil as wedding shroud and prison, bead as memory capsule—and final image of newborn child reweights earlier guilt into hopeful cycle without moralizing. No thematic echo sentences; the insight stays implicit in the dissolving bead and breaking light. Complexity remains: love can be both toxin and cure; ambiguity lingers in Elias’s tearful smile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with selective, alchemical-tinged diction—“cathedral of glass,” “spectral orchards”—that reflects his latent alchemist memory. Rhythm swells from languid descriptive cadence to clipped, breath-blocked final lines, mirroring recognition surge. No head-hop; ghost’s interior is inferred only through Elias’s perception, maintaining modesty. Distinct perceptual signature—attention to fruit metallurgy, temperature of bead—differentiates narrator from generic lyric voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: most sentences do double duty (description + symbolism, action + memory trigger). Only minor scaffold: “winter-cracked fields” recurs twice in close proximity; no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety is good; openings rotate among prepositional, participial, and direct subject starts. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates cleanly into the final short sentence. Artifacts do not touch closure; bead/dawn image stays luminous and precise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar gothic tropes—ghost bride, immortal curse, inherited journal—are reconfigured via alchemical botany and cyclical reincarnation logic that feels specific to this world. The “lovingly venomous” paradox is freshly embodied in fruit and elixir rather than abstract motif. Final inversion: immortality was never the gift, connection is—lands as non-obherent reweighting. Slight risk in dense lyric voice pays off by heightening mournful elation tone without losing clarity.</comment>
