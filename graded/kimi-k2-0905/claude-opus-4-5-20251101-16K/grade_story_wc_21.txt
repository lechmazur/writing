<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—her grief-hollowed body, sand beneath fingernails—but the diary-spirit “parley” is accepted without visible contradiction or cost. She moves from archivist to avenger in a single rhetorical leap (“Truth was meant to burn”), so the final choice feels announced rather than earned. No micro-choice on the page actually forecloses a live alternative; the zeppelin simply turns southeast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise—Maren pilots toward Alabama with Eleanor’s bones still underwater and Dawes alive—so cost is conceptual (history’s unpaid bill) rather than personal. Causality, however, is soft: the diary grants retrocognitive chat without established rules, and the debris-messaging beat is summarized, not shown. Orientation is swift, but the leap from decoded hymn numbers to zeppelin expedition skips a visible tactical beat that would tighten the because/therefore chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The floating archive, cathedral-shadowed over ochre dunes, is tactile and specific; every mention of “obsidian lagoon” re-infects the desert with menace. The final image—coastline through clouds—reprises the aerial viewpoint, charging the lagoon’s imminent disinterment with scale. Only the Mobile church pew lacks sensory anchoring, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—exhume Eleanor and expose Dawes—is clear early and tightens when Maren learns the minister still breathes. Pressure escalates by accretion of names, not by narrowing options or risking visible loss; the zeppelin’s course change is cost-free. No on-page obstacle complicates the south-east heading, so the stakes feel rhetorical rather than kinetic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—the archive as resurrection—emerges through image (salt hair, drifting bones) rather than thesis. The final communion “REST NOW” quietly reprices Maren’s vocation from custodian to gravedigger, letting silence carry moral weight. One sentence flirts with echo (“Truth was meant to burn”), but subtext elsewhere is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Maren’s fevered perception: “visions that scorched like desert sun” is voice-true for a sleepless archivist. Syntax lengthens under reverie, then snaps short at the turn—“Then she would pilot…”—mirroring decision. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; register never slips into archive-jargon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Line craft is dense and rhythmic; each sentence moves story or atmosphere. Only minor scaffold: “the truth emerged in fragments” tells what the list of names already shows. Mixed metaphor cathedral-shadow/dunes is coherent, not strained. No loops or artifact appears in the final third; closure image is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Retrocognitive zeppelin archive rescuing suppressed civil-rights evidence is a fresh synthesis; the debris-messaging conceit literalizes “speak to the past” without feeling gimmicky. The lagoon as clandestine graveyard reconfigures familiar Southern Gothic tropes through aerial viewpoint. Risk is present but not fully leveraged—Dawes’ exposure is conventional payoff.</comment>
