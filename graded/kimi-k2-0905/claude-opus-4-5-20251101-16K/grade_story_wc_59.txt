<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldric’s obsession is viscerally embodied—tattered robes, trembling hands, cracked voice—so his final choice to sing feels earned. The internal contradiction (perfectionist method vs. acceptance of flaw) is active in-scene when he cradles the misshapen bird. Cost is legible: he forfeits the sterile safety of pure science and embraces a living imperfection that will expose him to the gear-world’s scorn. Only the beard-length calendar and “weeks/months” lapse slightly abstract time, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bird’s broken-perfect song crystallizes a new rule—flaw is the price of wonder—and Aldric’s tear pays the cost. Causal chain (hypothesize → assemble → sing → flawed life) holds without gaps; each step forecloses retreat. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and tighten through fungal light and palace creaks. No lens ambiguity; accumulative cadence of “feathers memory / bones intention” reweights stakes at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hanging palace is not backdrop; its creaks sync with Aldric’s tremors, forcing him to steady the egg against sway. Bioluminescent fungi double as sole light-source and symbolic glow that bathes the hatching, binding setting to action. Micro-setting—velvet cradle, copper wires, distilled moonlight—constrains assembly tactics and reappears in the final image of trembling prince and bird. Spatial choreography is clean: egg lifted, placed, connected, sung to, without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove beauty can exist again”—tightens when the egg cracks into deformity, forcing Aldric to accept wounded beauty or renounce his life’s work. The meaningful turn is the sung note: it exchanges sterile control for vulnerable life, a cost immediately felt in his cracked voice and tears. Pressure escalates under accumulative lens: each apparatus click adds density until the discordant song reframes the stake. No coincidence; deformity is direct consequence of imperfect method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: beauty’s value rises when it carries wound. The phoenix-thrush’s bitterly sweet song is the non-literal answer, reweighting the premise that perfection was ever the goal. Subtext lives in the bird’s asymmetrical eyes—one sees the mechanical world, one the prince—implying split vision as survival. Final image refuses moralizing; the ache is the sweetness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aldric’s perceptual filter: he notices fungal hue, gear-heart metaphors, alchemical grime—never exposition the bird would know. Syntax grows jagged under pressure (“His hands trembled…”) then softens at the lullaby, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; diction remains within a prince-in-exile’s educated lexicon without academic drift. The repeated murmur “hypothesize” becomes rhythmic signature, paid off when he abandons it for song.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “Crystal resonators clicked into brass housings” fuses sound, material, motion in one stroke. Figurative layer is selective—no mixed metaphors—and peaks at the hatching without clutter. Minor scaffold: “He would show them. He would carry…” is future-loop filler just before close, but it does not touch the final image. Otherwise zero loops, strong verbs, varied paragraph rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Combines extinct-bird resurrection, anti-steampunk critique, and subterranean crystal palace in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet fresh. The flawed-genesis twist subverts the standard “perfect miracle” trope; deformity becomes the price of wonder, not a failure. Risky choice to make the bird’s song “bitterly sweet” pays off by charging the final image with unresolved tension. Specificity—distilled moonlight, three wings, fungal blue-green—prevents generic fantasy pastiche.</comment>
