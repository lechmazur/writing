<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—dealer of feeling who has never felt—drives every beat; the renunciation of the sale is earned by seventeen years of absorption shown, not told. The moment she whispers “I can’t sell this to you” crystallizes a cost she pays with her own evacuated identity. Felix stays a necessary hollow mirror; their status stasis (dealer/client collapsed) is exactly the reconfiguration required. Embodied emotion lands: tremor in fingertips, static discharge through bone, terror of totality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean CR: the rule-set of counterfeit commerce is repriced when Vera reclassifies herself as “vessel” and transfers authentic feeling to Felix—cost is the loss of her protective distance. Causal chain holds: absorption → saturation → refusal → transfer, each because/therefore legible. Orientation anchored by word 88 (“amber grotto”), well under 120. No lens ambiguity; the final image of two people learning “the weight of authentic feeling” reweights all prior half-truths.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The amber grotto is not backdrop; translucent walls funnel dusk into honeyed light that guides Vera’s eye to shelf choices and later refracts the static discharge, charging the final image. Micro-setting—blotter petal held “soft as shed skin”—constrains the pivotal transfer beat. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: Vera’s fingertips hover, petal passes to Felix, discharge arcs. Sensory hierarchy favors sight/touch aligned with her static-sense profession, never tourist-catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Vera’s need to feel the real—signals early via “half-truths” motif and tightens when absorption threatens her baseline. One decisive turn: refusal to sell, forcing her to surrender the accumulated charge. Cost is immediate and felt: she loses the emotional virginity she bartered for seventeen years. Escalation is causal under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of authentic vs. counterfeit emotion emerges from Vera’s accumulating theft and her final refusal to traffic the genuine; no authorial thesis intrudes. Subtext lives in the blotter petal: once a sampling tool, it becomes Eucharistic wafer of real grief. Final image—silent darkness with static still crackling—offers resonant, non-moral answer: to feel is to lose the distance that kept you safe. Complexity preserved; no sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively tactile, filtered through a woman who reads emotions as electrical hum: “sharp, clean frequency” vs. “softer, more malleable.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fragments at discharge (“I can’t sell this to you”). No head-hopping; Felix remains externally focalized. Compression taught early—“half-truths, always”—pays off in the final reclassification of self. Register stays within Vera’s sensory lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “vials of synthetic grief, crystallized joy she’d harvested last Tuesday” plants world-rule and character action in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—amber, cathedral, crime scene—without purple accretion. Final beat (“static-charged silence”) is lean yet sonic, propelling closure. Only hairline slip: “something worse, something better” skirts label-speak, but immediately grounded by darkness and weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of bootlegged emotions distilled onto blotter petals is fresh, yet the story’s real invention is the dealer who counterfeits because she herself is empty. Risk taken: no antagonist, no chase—just internal accumulation reaching critical mass—and it pays off. Cannot swap Vera’s profession without collapsing the entire causal scaffold. Transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious: the counterfeiter becomes the mint. Specific detail (static signature, amber refraction) grounds the fantastical in lived physics.</comment>
