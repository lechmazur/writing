<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (“to flee / to honor”) drives the final beat; embodied cost (red gauge, cold depth) stays on the page. Micro-choice to cradle the vial crystallizes value hierarchy. Only cap is late-appearing cost—no prior oxygen-deprivation impairment shown before six-minute mark.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: signal → descent → recognition → ascent. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no debt. Closure is Earned Stasis: she foregoes immediate air to secure vial, pays with remaining minutes—price legible in “She would carry the song back.” Lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Temple, kelp-wrapped columns, copper bracelet, and oxygen gauge filter through Mira’s urgent bias; spatial choreography clean. Micro-setting (vial against heart) charges closure. No environment-forced tactic shift drops it from 9 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover memory thread—tightens when skeleton ID’d; time countdown escalates every beat. One meaningful turn: overriding instinct to flee, she stays to retrieve vial, narrowing survival odds. Cost tracked via gauge color shift; felt price present but not physically incapacitating yet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: ephemeral = presence not permanence. Final image of glowing vial reweights entire dive without moralizing. “Presence would be enough” lands as CR, paying conceptual cost of her mother’s death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptions; sensory diction (“gathered hush,” “lonesome splendor”) consistent. Rhythm modulates—longer cadence in reflection, clipped fragments under red gauge. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences multi-task (action + image); no loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“descended,” “flooded,” “crystallizes”) carry weight. Only hairline slip: slight alliterative clustering (“lonesome splendor… scattered jewels”) that momentarily draws attention to language over peril.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory-capturing perfume vials in drowned temple feels fresh; trope of lost parent inverted—she salvages song, not body. Conceptual risk (ephemeral as enough) commits fully and pays off. Slight docking for echo of “memory water” tropes in genre.</comment>
