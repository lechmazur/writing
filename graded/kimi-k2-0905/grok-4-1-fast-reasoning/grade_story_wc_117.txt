<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-linked desire to spark wonder in Lila is concrete from the first paragraph and drives every beat; the locket hand-off is a credible, costly renunciation. Lila’s silence-to-whisper arc is embodied, not diagnosed. The only slack: “softly adaptive” recycles as character tag rather than forcing a visible tactical shift under eclipse pressure, muting interior contradiction at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the locket transfer reweights both griefs and future possibility while the corona glows, cost felt in Elias’s relinquishment. Causal chain holds: eclipse timing → music → shared gaze → object hand-off → first words. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens drift. Minor elasticity: the “softly adaptive” motif is declared more than it tightens options, keeping the cost whisper-small rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is evoked through wind-scented brush, root-arch ceiling, and eclipse chill that silences birds—details filter Elias’s therapist gaze and nudge Lila’s attention upward. The locket micro-setting charges the final image when corona-light ignites the curl. Spatial choreography is flawless; only the ridge’s prior geography is sketched broadly, but that never constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reignite Lila’s wonder—faces one tightening: totality’s hush removes all external sound, forcing the duo into wordless communion; the locket transfer then crystallizes risk of fresh loss for both. Cost is legible in Elias’s surrender of relic and Lila’s first fragile speech. No secondary reversals, but the eclipse progression supplies coherent situational pressure without coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges through sensory particulars—wind-breath, baby curl, eclipse hush—never thesis lines. The final image reframes prior grief as shared renewable light rather than private cargo. Subtext in Lila’s finger-tracing roots implies regrowth without comment. Avoids moralizing; only the phrase “ordinary magic” itself is over-explicit once.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elias’s wind-listening, sage-scented perception; diction is lull-soft yet precise. Free indirect slides cleanly—e.g., “his softly adaptive melodies” mirrors his own cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal rhythm flexes with eclipse chill. The repeated adjective “softly adaptive” edges toward template cadence yet remains motif-anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe with variable length, mirroring harp phrasing; no scaffold loops. Metaphors (dreaming roots, corona glow) stay consistent to arched shelter / celestial light logic. A few near-stack epithets—“softly adaptive” thrice—dull micro-rhythm, but none sit in the closure beat. Opening and final lines earn their keep by anchoring voice and recharging locket light.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Grief-therapy-via-eclipse isn’t virgin territory, yet the baby-curl relic and music-therapist vocation supply specific vocational detail rarely paired with totality. The “softly adaptive” motif risks self-conscious branding but is saved by harp literally modulating with wind. Could push further into therapist technique or ecological risk of sage ridge fire to deepen uniqueness.</comment>
