<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—dream vs empire—stays alive in every beat; the telepathic ivy scene literalizes her conflict under pressure. Embodied emotion (“mulberry ache” repeated) risks tinting into label-speak, but the bow tremor and stained saucer ground it. The final hybrid stance is earned: propagation via violin mingles dominion with melody, foreclosing pure solitude. Micro-choices (brush ivy → play → set bow) trace a value hierarchy with visible cost: her dream is no longer solitary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lattice holds: each beat (stain vision → ivy urging → violin play) tightens options until empire is redefined, not refused. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the observatory rooted in living vines images her fused fate, cost felt in the dawn-timed crescendo. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) planted by line 3. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Velvet observatory, midsummer humidity, and enchanted ice violin constrain tactics (ivy needs warmth, violin won't melt) and charge the final image. Selective sensory layering—steam “like spectral fingers,” crimson drapes—mirrors emotional heat without cataloging. Spatial choreography clean: ivy creeps, plants quiver, roots anchor floors. Micro-setting (coffee-stained cup, transparent strings) functions as prop chain that alters choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dream vs empire—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates via solstice deadline. Propagation act at climax narrows option set: she must share dream or lose it. Cost legible: dawn-crescendo ruptures her pure-artist identity; plants colonize observatory, sealing exit to solitary path. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reliance on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from propagation metaphor: power rooted, not hoarded. Subtext in ivy’s colonizing whisper reframes empire as ecosystem, stated nowhere. Final image—observatory alive with vines—offers non-literal answer: legacy equals composition circulated, not throne occupied. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “mulberry-tinged hush.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lush, lyrical free indirect style stays inside Elara’s perception; diction (“velvet,” “spectral,” “mulberry ache”) forms a coherent idiolect. Syntax mirrors synesthetic pressure—long, sliding clauses under midsummer humidity, clipped fragments at bow lift. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens with stress. Patterned repetition (“mulberry ache,” “propagate”) is taught early and recharged at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong ear: sentence rhythms vary from humid coils to avalanching crescendo. Information-dense; steam, stains, and telepathy lines each do double duty (atmosphere + propulsion). Sparse scaffold; only “mulberry ache” risks loop but functions as pulse. One mixed metaphor—“crushing weight snuffing dream”—minor, doesn’t tangle closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar binaries (art vs power) inverted through vegetal telepathy and ice violin; synthesis feels fresh. Specificity of provenance research and coffee-stain divination grounds speculative premise. Risk in lyric density pays off: propagation-as-politics is non-obvious yet inevitable after ivy motif. No derivative echoes; voice and world cohere into singular stance.</comment>
