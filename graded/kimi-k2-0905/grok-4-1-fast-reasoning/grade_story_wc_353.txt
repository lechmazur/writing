<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elowen’s contradictory impulses—obsessive quest to re-voice the world vs. surrender to its hush—stay live in scene (he kneels, traces, hesitates, then strums). The final renunciation (pocketing the chip, walking away) costs him the grove’s nascent sound, a price felt in the closing hush. Micro-choices under pressure (threading silver, bowing quartz) reveal his hierarchy: music > self > silence. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove sways, birds land, sculpture vibrates—silent yet musically alive—cost is the unrepeatable moment Elowen leaves behind. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of stress-crack → note → empathy builds to cadence shift. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 90 words; no penalty. No plot amnesia or teleport; porcelain and sculpture states track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (porcelain dome, cracked elder heartwood) actively constrains the strumming technique and amplification; failure to wedge it would silence the piece. Sensory economy favors bone-conducted thrum over aerial sound, reinforcing silent-world rule. Alder root-curl and moss-draped trunks evolve from postcard to orchestrational stage as branches sway in response. Spatial choreography holds: sculpture, insulator, and Elowen’s body remain triangulated across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—music vs. silence—tightens when the first bone-felt thrum proves the risk works; live option to abandon disappears once cracks sing. Escalation is accumulative: each strum layers drought/rain memories, deepening the cost of eventual silence. No coincidence; pressure is coherent environmental empathy. Price is the unrepeatable moment and the grove’s new, unhearable repertoire—felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal: silence becomes the only medium through which music can eternally exist, revaluing stillness itself. No explicit thesis; final image of pocketed shard reweights prior motifs (insulator, crack, bone-thrum) without moral. Subtext in siskins’ silent wing-tracery = audience that can never applaud. Complexity lingers: is the sculptor’s gift liberation or exquisite torture?</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is synesthetic—cracks = notes, root-curl = slur—consistent with “symphonically minded” POV. Rhythm modulates: long suspensive clauses build anticipation, then fragment at climax (“Then, he began to strum.”). No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs anchor in body (“hum in bone”). Diction stays within plausible artisan-musician lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences weld tactile action to metaphysical import (“porcelain insulator vibrating the stress cracks into motion, empathy flowing from wood to his veins”). No paraphrase loops or template cadences; sentence openings vary. One mixed-metaphor alert (“quiet thunder”) but it reads as intentional oxymoron rather than sloppiness. Rhythm breathes with escalating strum pattern, accelerating sentence pulse to match.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—soundless world where music is sculpted from tree trauma—is non-obvious synthesis of eco-fiction and solarpunk mysticism. Risk of preciousness is offset by concrete fracture-reading lutherie. Transformation test fails if relocated: stress-crack scores and porcelain resonators are specific to this grove-science. Final reconfiguration (silence as eternal song) feels inevitable yet unspoken. No close echoes to famous scenes.</comment>
