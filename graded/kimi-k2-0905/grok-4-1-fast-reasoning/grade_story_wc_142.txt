<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “orderly intuitive” label is repeated but never dramatized as a visible cognitive mechanism; the stone chip functions as lucky talisman rather than revealed flaw. Interior contradiction is asserted (“dual allegiance tore at her”) instead of acted out in a single beat where grid-loyalty actually collides with carnival-loyalty. The closing smile feels unearned because no micro-choice shows her paying a specific, irreversible cost—rafts re-lash, but she sacrifices nothing on-stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the carnival endures, privatization is stalled, and the stone’s warmth implies communal cost was real. Causal chain holds: graffiti coordinates → raft shuffle → yacht blocked, each step because/therefore. One soft spot: the yacht-spray climax is narrated mid-drift without showing how Elara physically reaches the hull without being intercepted—an ellipsis that slightly blurs agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Bioluminescent lanterns ignited the waterways” and “gear-spokes traced a cipher” anchor sensory specificity to plot function; the raft lattice becomes a living map that constrains tactics. Spatial choreography stays clean across raft-to-raft moves; no floating rooms. Environment directly shapes the final image—stone pressed into wet paint—earning the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the carnival from privatization—is signaled early and tightens through each graffiti cipher that forecloses legal protest. The binary-pulse mask mural embodies visible price: stall-owners risk eviction by swapping deeds. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded wall raises communal exposure, narrowing Elara’s safe moves until the hull-tag leaves her literally exposed on open water.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: coded art as communal immune system, gentrification as slow tide rather than villain. Final image reframes earlier chaos as necessary camouflage—“the carnival pulsing stronger, orderly yet wild”—a conceptual repricing that honors dual allegiance. No tidy moral; the cost is the perpetual vigilance embodied in the fading murals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “neon-lit frenzy,” “gears’ spokes traced a cipher.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for carnival sweep, staccato clauses for stealth painting. No head-hop; only minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) feels academic but brief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can paint, advance plot, and foreshadow (“vines’ twists hid coordinates”). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Occasional stacked modifiers (“perpetual carnival afloat on vast interconnected rafts”) flirt with density overload but never stall the closing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival-as-pirate-utopia is familiar, but the graffiti-cipher logistics and raft-shuffle blockade feel freshly engineered. The stone chip’s evolution from relic to shared talisman rescues it from token symbol. Risky compression—794 words covering weeks—pays off because pattern is taught early and closure recharges it.</comment>
