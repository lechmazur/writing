<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s serene therapist persona is embodied through tactile micro-choices—cradling vinyl, uncorking vial—showing decisively kind drive. Interior contradiction is thin: she never doubts or hesitates, so the “flawless goodbye” feels gift-bestowed rather than wrested. Cost accrues to Harlan and Lena, but Elara’s own emotional price stays off-page, softening earned edge. Still, her calm agency cleanly motors every causal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: blood-work verdict → Elara activates plan → daughter summoned → shard returned → Harlan dies at peace. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Harlan’s final smile reconfigures regret into peace while vinyl rests on his chest, a visible conceptual cost. One minor orientation ripple—Lena’s arrival is telegraphed, not blocked—but the lens (Causal) holds. No teleporting props or memory holes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass-walled aerie and wildflower distillate constrain Elara’s toolkit; scent directly reweights Harlan’s memory, charging closure. Visual dominates, but tactile handling of vinyl and vial keeps environment participatory. Spatial choreography stays clean: cushions, door chime, chest placement all track. Setting could use one more sensory filter (temperature, altitude thinness) to hit 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye”—tightens once when Elara places shard in Harlan’s hand, forcing father-daughter convergence. Escalation is single-pulse rather than narrowing; pressure feels accumulative-textural (lyric hymning) more than causal trade-off. Cost is legible but borne by Harlan/Lena; Elara’s risk remains off-page. Sufficient for length, yet a hair below high-band price-proof.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via hymning ordinary relics into sacred anthems—no authorial thesis. Final image of vinyl-as-key reframes earlier kitchen-table and swing memories, offering resonant non-literal answer. Sentiment flirts close to sweet, but grounded detail (cracked grooves, yeast scent) keeps it honest. Could use one thornier implication to reach 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “pulsing stillness,” “golden threads,” syntax breathes with therapeutic cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative diction stays consistent, Anglican-with-poetry. Patterned repetition (“hymned the mundane”) is taught early and paid off. Minor risk of lit-fic glaze, but rhythmic control justifies it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentences vary; only one paraphrase loop (“pulsing stillness” echoed twice) costs −0.2. Metaphors (vinyl=fault lines, sunlit threads) stay coherent and scene-anchored. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold clutter. Density high: single sentence often layers scent, memory, and motion. Closure line breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh inflection: music-therapist who literally sings memory triggers to hospice patient aloft in cloud sanctuary—conceptually bold yet emotionally grounded. Vinyl shard as sacrament feels novel, not gimmick, because causality keeps it tactile. Risk that serenity verges on ethereal tourism, but specific sensory hymns ward off abstraction. Synthesis makes ending feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
