<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s “affectionate detachment” is vividly dramatized in the static-charged petal beat; Mira’s agency is mostly reactive, so the full-change cost lands on Elias yet feels slightly predetermined rather than freshly wrenched. Interior contradiction flashes, but the climactic subsuming beat is narrated more than embodied. Still, the pair’s status dance under pressure is crisp and the final pocketed petal image crystallizes his earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: amber static, scent notes, and grief-crystal imagery tighten into a single cadence shift—petal darkening—whose cost (Mira’s grief calcified, Elias’s residue) is legible. No causality breaks; every beat adds density or reframes the half-truth trade-off. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grotto’s hum, spent petal, and Elias’s aloof exit reconfigure meaning without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amber veins, static crackle, and resin glow are inseparable from the emotional tech; the grotto itself is the instrument that charges the petal and constrains the transfer. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elias’s perfume craft—scent first, touch second, sight last—keeping detail purposeful. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, petal, and amber outcrop track cleanly across the beat. Setting passes 9+ gate: environment directly shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will counterfeit calm truly replace grief?”—tightens once: petal’s static test → absorption → darkening forecloses raw grief. Cost is visible (petal’s color shift, Mira’s luminous stillness) and persistent (Elias carries residue). Agency is Elias’s micro-choices of calibration; no coincidence. Meets 8.5 band: price charges final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative scent-crystal pattern: engineered serenity cannibalizes authentic sorrow yet remains necessary. Subtext sits in Elias’s pocketed, darkened petal—an unspoken relic of the grief he profits from. Final image avoids moralizing; the grotto’s eternal amber hum lets the reader feel the ethical cost without dictation. No thematic echo penalties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is perfumer-precise yet emotionally compressed: “affectionate veil,” “whisper of oud,” “static smoothed into a steady hum”—diction stays inside Elias’s vocational lexicon. Rhythm tightens under pressure, fragments and participle opens vanish at climax. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“Thank you for the half-truth that feels whole”)—reads as intentional stylistic restraint rather than omission.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary, no template churn. Figurative layering is high but patterned early (amber = resin = stasis) so it pays off, not clutters. One near-mixed metaphor (“storm’s prelude” beside “lover’s parting touch”) is minor. Information density strong; each sentence often does two jobs (scent + emotion, static + insight).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Half-truth emotion market is fresh; static-charged blotter petal as diagnostic tool is specific and memorable. Synthesis of perfumery + alchemy + static physics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal twist—heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
