<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The feral library guardian’s longing is vividly embodied (claws in frost, pendant pulse), but the “interiorizing” tactic is asserted more than dramatized; we watch the narrator declare “I drew him inward” rather than feel the contradiction or cost of swallowing the cultist’s essence. Homesickness propels the wait, yet the turn to friendship with uncertainty is lyrical declaration, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Still, the wild, book-scented voice is specific enough to lift the score into the solid 7 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the garden folds into the guardian’s being and a portal home yawns—visible cost is the frozen garden now grafted inside the body. Causality, however, is lyric rather than tight: “uncertainty yields paths” is poetic fiat; the pendant flares because the text needs a portal, not because its rules were foreshadowed. Accum/Textural lens holds—density and image-pattern reweight the stake—so the ending is legible, but the missing because-chain keeps it shy of 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen garden is tactile—rime-matted fur, drip-Morse from thorns—and the misty limbo doubles as macro- and micro-setting, constraining movement and perception. Spatial choreography is clean; the guardian’s body, the pendant, and the cultist’s ghost stay trackable. The environment literally melts into a door, charging the final image; without this cold haze there is no boundary to breach. Gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—homesickness versus surrender to uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when the pendant flares into a literal door. Escalation is imagistic, not causal: each “interiorizing” beat adds density rather than narrows option, but the final fold/portal does foreclose exile. Cost is conceptual (garden now inside) rather than felt, keeping it at the 7-floor for accumulative designs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of boundary imagery—light’s edge, mist’s veil, pendant’s pulse—culminating in the body-as-threshold. No overt thesis; the final image reweights exile into hybrid belonging. Ambiguity lingers without confusion. Minor dock for “befriending uncertainty” edging toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush, feral, library-inked: “stacked infinities,” “whispering tomes,” syntax sinewy with en-dashes and compressed clauses. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent—every noticed detail is scent, texture, or spatial relation a beast would track. Rhythm swells and contracts with foggy suspense; pendant/cultist diction never breaks the spell. One hairline slip: “dimensionally homesick” dips into prompt-label cadence, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; clauses layer without scaffold. Metaphors occasionally stack three-deep (“veins in marble” over “fractal patterns”) but never stall the beat. No loops or paraphrase churn; information multiplies in single lines. Read-aloud rhythm propels; minor purple tinge in “stacked infinities” keeps it sub-8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Feral librarian exiled in frost-limbo” is fresh synthesis; trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Interiorizing mist/thorns into bloodstream literalizes homesickness as body-horror transit. Risky lyric structure pays off by making exile a digestible器官. Specific detail (“drip-Morse from thorn-tips”) prevents abstract whimsy.</comment>
