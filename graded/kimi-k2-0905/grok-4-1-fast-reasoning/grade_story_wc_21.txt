<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s obsessive need to recover erased voices is vivid, but his interiority alternates between lyrical label (“searing pull”) and embodied specificity. The parallel-era possession gives him a crucible, yet the emotional stakes feel externally choreographed by the vision rather than internally earned; the final resolve lands but we don’t feel the cost in body or relationship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The diary-triggered retrocognitive plunge is a clean causal hinge; the lagoon vision supplies the Decisive Change with visible cost (spectral parley, debris oath). Transitions stay legible across the two-shard float/vision arc; closure re-enters the zeppelin with a re-weighted mandate, satisfying CR. Orientation anchors arrive before the 120-word drift, so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating library, dune basin, and obsidian lagoon are economically seeded and return in the final image; the zeppelin’s resources (letters, diary) materially enable the plot. Sensory triage is POV-tilted (archive dust, sun-brand, volcanic glass), embedding world-rules through touch rather than exposition. Spatial choreography keeps the spectral ring and debris circle coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recover censored truth—tightens when ghosts demand proof; the debris-oath sequence visibly narrows options and links failure to eternal entrapment. Escalation is situational-pressure rather than causal domino, but the single deepening is meaningful and paid for with spectral recognition. Cost is legible; lacking a second reversal keeps it shy of 8-plus threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of archival erasure vs. living memory emerges through gesture (beach debris writing) rather than thesis; the lagoon’s re-sealing sands re-price the cost of remembrance. Final image of zeppelin shadow trailing justice-winds offers resonant non-verbal answer. No moralizing paragraph intrudes; ambiguity over who can bear the truth lingers legitimately.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person focalization sustains a scholarly, faintly archaic register congruent with an archivist. Syntax thickens under retrocognitive stress (“vertigo seized him…”) and thins to clipped fragments during debris assembly, mirroring pressure. No dialogue to test vocal distinction, but narrative voice stays idiosyncratic; perceptual signature (yellowed letters, brass key) threads cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density; most sentences advance either retrocognitive rules or sensory stakes. Metaphors stay internally coherent (lagoon “like reluctant flesh”), no register drift. Rhythm accelerates through parley without template cadence; a couple of near-loop phrases (“truths… long buried / hidden toll”) shave fraction. Closure line breathes cleanly, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Merging civil-rights archive with hallucinatory dune resistance and spectral debris parley is non-obvious. The obsidian lagoon repurposed as both sacred crucible and mnemonic trap reframes familiar “buried uprising” trope into specific conceptual stakes. Risky retrocognitive frame is taught early and paid off; the synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
