<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s wilting-under-lies trait is embodied early and governs her route; the mentor-reveal supplies credible internal contradiction and cost. Interiority stays concrete (“skin paling…color returning”) rather than therapeutic. The final choice—to share the vault quietly rather than weaponize it—grows from her established valuing of small candors, paying off her flaw without tidy redemption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The map-assembled quest supplies a causal spine; each stop (bazaar, farm, vault) tests the honesty-currency rule with visible bodily stakes. Closure lands cleanly: the mentor’s recorded confession is the Decisive Change, and the cost is the irreversible loss of the lie that had protected her. Orientation is anchored within the first 60 words; the drive lens (Causal) is held without slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city is not backdrop postcarding; its weeping vines, rusted sorters, and bazaar water scams force her physiological honesty-test. Zinc plate fragment recurs as tactile object, edges matched under lamplight, constraining her path. Final image—vault of iridescent leaves—reweights the setting as archive rather than scenery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—locate vanished truthful talk while her body penalizes every lie encountered—tightens with each honesty-test beat. Escalation is micro but legible: her collapsing knees at the padded ledger, then revival when the worker speaks plain. Agency remains hers: she chooses to keep descending and ultimately to broadcast the vault quietly, paying with exposure of her mentor’s lie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme (candor as survival currency) emerges through bodily consequence, never slogan. The closing inscription “Conversations lost are those unspoken true” is earned because we have watched unspoken lies literally sicken her. Vault-leaves as natural gilding invert her artificial gold-dust art, reweighting value without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lush yet controlled third-limited diction (“colossal crystal lung,” “Braille confessions”) stays within a calligrapher’s perceptual palette. Rhythm modulates: short clauses when she wilts, longer flowing sentences inside the vault. No head-hopping; the child’s whisper is rendered as Elara hears it—external fact that saves her.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Sentences carry double duty (“her fingers tracing zinc ridges like Braille confessions” reveals texture and her vocation). Occasional overwritten flourish (“crystal lung beneath the toxic sky”) but never in the closure beat. No loops or scaffold; information advances with each line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The honesty-as-vital-substance premise feels fresh, and the postal-zinc fragments give tactile steampunk specificity rather than generic dystopia. Risk taken: a quiet ending where the protagonist simply tells a small crowd, yet the vault image reconfigures stakes. The wilting-leaf curse could have read gimmicky but is grounded in bodily cost and mentor reveal.</comment>
