<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s compulsion to inscribe her pain into legacy is embodied early (“her motivation burned”) and visibly crystallises on her arms under stress; the quill’s micro-choices mirror this drive. Interiority is concrete and war-specific (“thoughts flickered… half-remembered charms”) rather than diagnostic. The flaw-to-triumph arc is tidy—no lingering consequence or moral ambiguity—so the final choice feels rational rather than costly. Yet interior contradiction, bodily stakes, and the transformation of scars into narrative manacles all track cleanly under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: childhood superstition (crow quill) → experimental rune ink → scar-shedding ritual → earned guild re-entry. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible price: crystal shards re-cast as flexible “narrative threads” that still glow, a permanent, wearable reminder. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive by line 3; spatial logic of floating platform remains coherent. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; every beat advances knowledge or narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tea-platform’s hum against the void, blue brazier flame whispering to stone, and prismatic crystal weight on arms all constrain gesture and attention, charging the final image. Atmospheric details are filtered through Elara’s rune-scholar gaze—she notices moss-veined edges, slate-grey suspension stone, verdant froth—never tourist-catalog. Weather is literal pressure: storms paused outside the breath-frame, echoing internal truce. Micro-setting (body + tool + tea service) functions as crucible; removal would collapse ritual logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exile from guild—signalled in opening paragraph; tightening occurs when crystals sharpen into manacles, forcing completion of the rite. Protagonist agency drives each beat: dip quill → trace sigil → endure pain → shed flakes → weave constellation. Cost is repeatedly legible—flaking skin, aching lungs, permanent glowing threads—so escalation stays visceral. No external antagonist needed; internal/external pressures braid cleanly within the “breath between storms” window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: pain → inscription → public narrative ownership, avoiding abstract moral. The crow-feather-to-rune alchemy reweights superstition into scholarship, offering conceptual repricing without sermon. Final image (descending platform, quill waiting) invites reflection on cyclical storytelling rather than closing with a moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: glowing threads may still single her out—legacy and stigma coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is scholarly-lyric (“steam curled like forgotten sigils”, “crystals bloomed along lengths”). Syntax lengthens during ritual calm, fragments under pain: “Pain lanced, but not destruction.” No head-hopping; diction fits runic apprentice lexicon. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is earned by final reweighting image. Rhythm modulates with ceremony tempo; read-aloud cadence holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver world (floating tea-platform), tool (crow quill), interior conflict (scars itch), and ritual stakes in one sweep. Figurative language is selective—vehicles (sigil-steam, firefly-flakes) cluster round ritual beats without drowning causality. No loops or synonym churn; pronouns track cleanly across crystal transformations. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant froth”, “crystalline burden”) is justified by ceremonial register; doesn’t obscure action sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rune-ceremony trope is refreshed by forging childhood superstition (crow-feather etching) into adult arcana, a synthesis that feels specific to Elara rather than genre checklist. Floating tea-platform and storm-breath time-lock are bold world choices that heighten tension without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if elements swapped: quill’s child-trimmed tip and matcha-ink are irreplaceable to ritual logic. Risk-taking (lyric time suspension) pays off via on-page closure cost.</comment>
