<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is specific—thumb on the dent, knight-logic pacing—and his exile motive is viscerally tied to the pawn lesson that “exposed the court’s hidden fractures.” The final rearrangement of king to dent is a micro-choice that visibly costs him any chance of return, earning Earned Stasis. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, only recalled, so the internal conflict is slightly under-dramatized. Still, the correlation tactic is inseparable from his tutor identity and carries a felt price at the close.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: silences accumulate into a magnetic resonance map that reweights the covenant. Closure lands in the charged image of king aligned to dent, stone warming, fields weaving—“a promise half-reclaimed”—with undeniable conceptual cost: exile unbroken, phase still coming. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the “covenant-deep quiet eclipsed by betrayal” is told more than shown, a minor causality blur that keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The worry stone functions as micro-setting: its dent dictates the final board alignment and literally shapes the closing move. Twilight nexus is sketched with selective sensorial strokes—“compasses spun wild,” “obsidian monoliths humming”—that guide the correlation task rather than stall momentum. Spatial choreography is clean; the knight-leap pacing across scree is tracked. Weather and scale stay subordinate to the stone/board dyad, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“phase looms, covenant fraying”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when each mapped silence makes the pact’s fracture legible. Escalation is textural: each silence correlated warms the stone and raises the hum, foreclosing the option to abandon the task. Visible price: every chess rearrangement burns time and exile-deepens; the final alignment leaves him walking into unchanged night. No false reversal—luck never intervenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the motif of “beauty in the difficult”: pawn sacrifice, dented stone, covenant scarred yet shimmering. No moral is declared; the final smile is oblique, the cost unhealed. Subtext lives in hush and warmth rather than exposition. The eclipsed covenant’s partial renewal is felt as atmospheric repricing, not lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “knight’s calculated leap,” “Braille of perseverance.” Syntax mirrors chess precision—short, angular clauses under pressure. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses during the final board twist. The lyric repetition of “twilight,” “phase,” and “dent” is pattern-taught early and paid off in the resonant last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “He drew his chessboard… placed the worry stone at its heart” advances action, anchors object, foreshadows closure. No filler, no loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes—long cadence for melancholy, staccato for compass twitches. Opening and final lines are image-driven, propulsive. Hairline slip: “quiet ache for what was lost yet a spark of possibility” edges toward abstract, but is instantly rooted in stone touch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing magnetic leyline physics with chess correlation via silence translation is fresh; the dented basalt stone as Braille key is specific and memorable. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into gimmick, yet each silence maps causally onto board/stone. The exile motive personalizes global stakes, resisting allegory. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
