<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his bark-dry skin, “pragmatic rasp,” and refusal to genuflect to scanners mark him as individual. His micro-choices (sweeping circles, binding vines, selecting the most-shattered marble) dramatize a hierarchy of values that culminates in the visible cost of a 1.9 orb he never upgrades. The contradiction between empirical failure and lived success is held in scene, not summary. Secondary auditors exist only as status foils; relationship pressure is therefore thin, capping this at 8.6.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterned polishing, orb-by-orb, intensifies density until a cadence shift (cracked 1.9 → 9.3) reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fountain ejects an unblemished marble that re-sets the luck metric and forces the council retreat. Cost is legible in Elias’s cracked skin and decades of 1.9 public shame. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The maze is rendered through touch—vine binding, leaf snap under boot, moss fur on the cache—so setting constrains every tactic. The cracked marbles operate as micro-setting; their fracture planes decide which orb gets polished and thus which luck value the auditors read. Spatial choreography is clean: auditors follow Elias inward, exit via now-uniform bloom. Environment charges the final image when the fountain yields the 9.3 sphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove gardens know gardeners before demolition”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the 2.4 aggregate scan threatens eradication. Agency is accumulative: each polish beat increases visible cost (time, arthritic fingers, public mockery) until the 9.3 emergence forecloses demolition. No coincidences resolve; the final shift is earned by iterative polishing, not luck. Persistent constraint (1.9 orb) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “measurable luck is still malleable through devotion.” Subtext lives in gesture: a cracked marble buffed to illusory wholeness becomes the vehicle that re-prices reality. No character articulates the thesis; the fountain’s final marble does. The ending image crystallizes the paradox without moralizing, inviting reflection on false binaries of fate/care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is horticultural: sky “bruised with dusk,” roses “thrusting defiantly,” scanner hum “coldly.” Syntax lengthens during ritual, then shortens under auditor challenge, mirroring Elias’s breath. No head-hopping; auditors’ interiority is guessed through Elias’s lens only. Compression is taught early (“vine dresser,” “orb scanners”) and stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density lines: “clusters of crimson roses thrusting defiantly from tendrils shriveled by neglect” performs image, stakes, theme in one stroke. Rhythm modulates—ceremonial anaphora vs. clipped auditor rebuttal—without algorithmic pattern. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final third is clean; closure image is unmarred by prose artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of horticulture + quantified luck feels inevitable yet fresh; no genre template matches. The cracked-marble-as-luck-override is a specific inflection that would collapse if swapped. Risk is taken with accumulative rather than causal escalation, but coherence holds. Echoes of “luck metric” culture are transformed through tactile garden ritual.</comment>
