<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thorne’s guilt-driven interiority is convincingly embodied—kneeling, fingers tracing foam, pocketing the shell—yet the “symphonically minded” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory musical impulse undercuts his epiphany. The decisive shift from rigid polymers to dissolving foam-polymers is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he forfeits prestige and risks failure. Micro-choices (sketching in dirt, trembling at the bench) reveal value hierarchy, but the wife’s voice is imported summary rather than dramatized memory, softening the contradictory layering required for 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emptied chrysalis and clarified river reweight “divergent path” into convergent stewardship; cost is legible in the risked career and the river’s visible renewal. Causal chain—grief → foam insight → polymer reform → ecological atonement—holds without plot amnesia; the Orientation Test is passed by line 3. Minor ellipsis: we infer lab trials rather than witness them, but the jump is motivated and paid off by downstream success. Persistent constraint: his tainted legacy could still discredit the new polymer, tightening the final image.</comment>

<comment>Braided ravine is more than postcard: its foam constrains the scientific breakthrough and the chrysalis provides the talisman that charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean—boots on pebbles, silt retrieval, upstream departure—anchoring time at dusk→stars→dawn. Sensory hierarchy respects crisis: narrow focus on iridescent bubble lattices widens only after insight. Environment directly enables the polymer blueprint, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—personal/ecological atonement—tightens once: the insight that his polymers killed the river forces a public reversal that could ruin his reputation. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scope; no second reversal is required. Cost is visible: he stakes credibility on foam-derived emulsifiers and their downstream success. Agency stays internal-scientific, aligning with Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure deepens through pattern recognition rather than external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: “translate separation into connection” is never declared aloud; it is performed by foam lattices and chrysalis husk. The final image—butterflies returning to new chrysalises—offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior guilt. Subtext in the empty shell (absence as proof of transformation) avoids sentimental moral. Complexity is preserved: redemption is partial, ecosystem still fragile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays stable; perceptual signature is chemist-sharp—“ephemeral lattices,” “iridescent films,” “harmless monomers.” Rhythmic control mirrors symphonic ambition: long sentences build, then fragment at epiphany. No head-hopping; register stays within scientist lexicon without jargon dump. Minor filter verb cluster (“had loosened,” “had chased”) in backstory paragraph dulls immediacy but recedes before climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is selective and pattern-taught: river/foam as musical score sustains through closure. Mixed metaphors avoided; “bruised purples” is the lone cliché but serves dusk palette. Information density high: one line can anchor time, body, and metaphor. Paraphrase loops absent; only minor scaffold—“the pieces fell into place”—is earned by prior patterning. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure; no drumbeat cadence.</answer>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: polymer chemist + braided ravine + ephemeral foam = biodegradable emulsifier; premise is not stock eco-fiction. Chrysalis reprise transforms familiar metamorphosis trope into material proof of atonement. Risk taken with lyric, almost procedural science beats pays off in credible lab payoff. If names/places swapped, core insight still works, yet the foam-chrysalis pairing is particular enough to feel inevitable.</comment>
