<comment>Elara’s skepticism flickers only in the single rhetorical question about sorcery; otherwise her interiority is cosmic lyricism that could belong to any luminous pilgrim. The lack of micro-choice under pressure—everything is patient waiting—means no hierarchy of values is tested. Cost accrues to the city, not to her stance; she is unchanged, merely the witness who lifts a lid. The arc is city-centric, not character-centric, so at this length the motivation feels observational rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breadcrumb adds density until the final image reweights the stake (“memories cascaded…fountains gurgling anew”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—time restarts and the city reclaims its past—visible on page. The price is felt by the city, not Elara, so cost is social rather than personal; still, the before/after is legible. Orientation is taught early (“city of forgotten fountains…migrating geese paused”), so no penalty; lens stays coherent.</comment>

<comment>Fountain network serves as both map and puzzle; each dry basin micro-setting constrains route and supplies the breadcrumb objects. The geese shadow is a recurring environmental clock whose stretch marks the accrual of sidereal time. Sensory detail is selective—glass shard star-glint, condensation droplet iridescence—woven through action rather than catalog. Final image of reborn waters charging the mosaics reuses the celestial-tile motif, so setting charges closure under 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate memories—signaled in paragraph four and slowly deepens as each breadcrumb recovers a lost fragment. Escalation is accretive, not perilous; pressure is the widening texture of recovered past. No live option is foreclosed for Elara; she risks nothing tangible, so cost is civic, not personal. Consequently the tightening is aesthetic rather than tactical, sufficient for band but not for 8.5+ which demands a visible price that alters her next move.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Theme of cosmic patience emerges through recurrence of sidereal imagery rather than direct statement; the refusal to force the box enacts the concept. Final reconfiguration—city remembers itself—reweights earlier images of cracked basins and dry lips without moralizing. Subtext whispers that memory can only return on stellar, not human, timetable. Slight abstraction keeps it from 8.5+ but the resonance is earned and non-generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence of heavy caesura and luminous compound phrases (“bruised autumn sky…captured starlight”). Perceptual signature is cosmological rather than psychological, fitting an accumulative design. No dialogue, so no register clash; syntax stays within poetic latitude. Filter-verb count is low; immediacy survives the adjective load because each modifier is tethered to star or water imagery, reinforcing pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with deliberate enjambement across sentences; paragraph lengths visually mirror the slow accrual. Occasional stacked modifiers (“imprisoned hues of crimson, azure, and gold”) flirt with density penalty but pattern is taught early and pays off in final flood of color. No synonym loops or template cadence; scaffolding is minimal. One mixed metaphor—“temporal adhesive”—is forgiven at closure because it is reified by the key of solidified water.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time city + memory aquifers + sidereal patience synthesizes familiar tropes into a fresh configuration; the stained-glass box as mnemonic reliquary is particular. Risk is lyric stillness that could flatten tension, yet accretive structure justifies the gamble. Transformation test passes: replacing fountains with, say, libraries would break the water=key logic. Not quite 8.5 because the protagonist’s passivity is safe; still, the cosmic clock angle feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
