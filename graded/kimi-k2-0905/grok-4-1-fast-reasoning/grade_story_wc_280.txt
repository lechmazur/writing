<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elena’s synesthesia and stage-trauma are vivid, but her “despair” is asserted more than dramatized; the pivot from passive nostalgia to active singing feels sudden because the coin’s agency overshadows hers. Reginald’s pleading is clear, yet his own entrapment remains abstract, softening the cost of the pact. Interior contradiction is present (gift=curse) but not sharpened into a micro-choice until the final note; earlier beats lean on spectacle. Still, the ending’s Earned Stasis—she pockets the coin and books a gig—makes the renunciation legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The tarot-coin pickup at ~180 words cleanly triggers the ghost encounter, satisfying causality under a Causal lens; closure (Elena exits under dawn, timelines “mended”) lands with visible cost—the garden’s secrecy and her perpetual debt to Reginald. One soft spot: the orchard’s physics-rules (fruits ripening “impossibly”) are taught only at spectacle level; because they don’t constrain her final choice, the miracle feels convenient rather than priced. Orientation is secure by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic color-sound mapping is relentlessly POV-filtered, turning setting into a sensory instrument: “verdant greens swirl with night’s chill blue” guides her deeper into the maze. The stage-boards, coin, and glowing apples each get tactile handling that charges later beats; the coin’s warmth bridges beats and becomes the final talisman. Spatial choreography inside the maze stays clean—no impossible moves. For 9+ gate: the coin-as-tool does constrain her final tactic (she pockets it to keep the channel open), satisfying the constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she perform again or stay ghost-bound—is signaled early; pressure escalates when echoes force her to sing, tightening options under the Causal lens. The cost is lyric rather than practical: she trades permanent nostalgia-symbiosis with Reginald for renewed art. One deepening only; no secondary reversal, but the orchard’s applause illusion suffices for this length. Price is present but muted—she gains more than she loses, muting the brink tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through sensory recurrence: synesthesia turns nostalgia into a usable fuel, reframing “gift as curse” without moralizing. The final image—coin flip in dawn light—reweights earlier motifs rather than stating a thesis. Ambiguity is fruitful: eternal encore may be parasitic or collaborative. No final-paragraph sermon; the refrain “Encore whenever despair calls” is voiced by the ghost, not the narrator, preserving subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elena’s synesthetic register; diction stays inside a magician’s lexicon (“spotlight,” “greasepaint,” “fanfares”). Rhythm swells with the song, then contracts into short sentences at exit, mirroring breath. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal cadence is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory verbs (“tasted like vanilla spotlights”) keep immediacy. Patterned elision (echo mechanics left vague) is taught early and paid off at closure, acceptable under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence openings; information density is high—one sentence often layers color, sound, and motion. No scaffold loops, but two adjacent “echoes” lines paraphrase the same idea (−0.2). Metaphors stay coherent within stage-lighting logic; no mixed vehicles. One tense slip: “fruits ripening impossibly” uses participial simultaneity during a static beat—minor. Closure line is clean, image-driven, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic stage-magician meets vaudeville ghost inside a living tarot orchard—specific synthesis, not checklist mash-up. The “echo as encore” mechanic freshens both ghost and time-loop tropes; the coin’s fool motif re-enters as lived metaphor rather than symbol bolt-on. Risk-taking (lyric causality, spectral pact) heightens emotional stakes without losing clarity. Could push higher if the orchard’s logic carried a sharper price, but the fusion feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
