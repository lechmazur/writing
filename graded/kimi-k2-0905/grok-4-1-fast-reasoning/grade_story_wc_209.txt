<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession with night-blooming flowers is dramatized through embodied, painterly perception; her micro-choice to scrape the cathedral glass day after day shows a hierarchy of values (art > comfort) with visible cost (raw fingertips, lantern-lit isolation). Interiority stays concrete—“tender ache in the umbral half-light”—never drifting into label-speak. The final tear-stained stillness is earned by the causal chain of postcard clues and glass unveilings; her decision to paint the lovers’ mural forever renounces daylight acclaim, paying the price of permanent nocturnal vocation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each postcard and glass layer adds density until the pattern (flowers = hidden love) breaks open. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is fixed in the first 60 words; no penalty applies. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cathedral’s final image of moonlit lovers reweights all prior blooms into a single conceptual cost—vulnerability’s bargain with darkness. That cost is visible on the page: “tears tracing silent paths” and the pavilion mural that will never see sun, foreclosing mass acclaim.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber pavilion’s autumn glow is a micro-setting that constrains choice: it supplies perpetual twilight for night-flower sketches and becomes the final atelier where Elara seals herself away from spring sunshine. Cathedral glass functions as tactile tool—each scrape alters tactics (what she can paint next). Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: an artist notices “etched vines,” “incense-aged stone,” “lantern alone.” Spatial choreography is immaculate; snow retreats in measured beats that mirror glass unveilings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—is signaled in line 4 and tightens through each glass layer discovered. One visible price: last-snow mud ruins her boots, yet she keeps scraping, narrowing options to nocturnal art only. The deepening pattern (postcard → glass → mural) reweights the stake from curiosity to vocation. No reversal is needed; accumulative pressure suffices under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: vulnerability chooses darkness to invite rare fidelity. Motif of “umbral tenderness” recurs only thrice, each time reweighted—first as mood, finally as life covenant. The cathedral’s lovers literalize the idea, letting image preach instead of narrator. Final line “Night flowers bloomed within” offers charged poise, not moral, leaving ambiguity intact.</comment>

<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at psychic distance 2–3, always filtered through Elara’s painter’s eye: “swirls of her latest mural,” “ink-black sky.” Diction stays within her lexicon—no academic register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long breathless sentences during glass scraping, then short fractured fragments at tear-stained dawn. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Every sentence performs at least two jobs: “snow clung stubbornly to the branches outside, the pavilion evoked eternal fall” layers weather, setting, and metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is specific—moonlight as “kiss,” pavilion as “lover’s whispered secret.” Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines are sonic anchors: “traced the vivid swirls” vs. “Night flowers bloomed within,” forming lyrical bookends.</comment>

<grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Familiar “artist chasing secret” premise is refreshed by the glass-archaeology method and the horticultural riddle of nocturnal pollination. Cathedral window as palimpsest is a fresh constraint; each scrape is a beat, not exposition. Risk is taken: quiet lyric escalation instead of plot reversals, yet coherence holds. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
