<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s pacifist-archivist contradiction is vivid—war relics in hand while bandaging silence—but the diary is addressed more than handled; one embodied beat of him touching/clasping it under pressure would push this to 8+. Interiority is concrete, but the climax choice (tuning the clasp) is explained more than felt in his body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer of silence thickens until the 432 Hz burst reweights the stake. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—diary open, firework exhale—cost felt in the moth-wing sigh. Causality is present but secondary; pattern taught early by starlit gadget choreography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting is tactile: rusted tools, violin-string tuner, glow-worm bulbs all constrain tactics—no brute force, only resonance. Final image of clasp “like a surrendered flag” recharges earlier dove etching. One line-level over-tell (“cool air scented by pine and distant gunpowder”) barely dents specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the pre-firework hush—tightens when tuner fails incrementally, then clicks. Visible price: sweat on brow, operatic voice cracking; conceptual price: the coming boom will obliterate the very silence he sought to bottle. Escalation is density-driven, not causal reversal, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-through-quiet emerges via listed silences rather than dramatized scenes, but final “world’s withheld breath as our own” reweights prior catalog. Avoids sermon by keeping insight in Elias’s idiom. One abstract label (“true empathy bloomed”) is forgivable in 700-word span.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias sees starlight as silver filigree, hears metal as Morse code. Syntax swells into operatic cadence under pressure, matching theatrical sincerity. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; one filter-verb cluster (“he noted how the silence pulsed”) could trim.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric density risks purple overload, yet rhythm breathes with tuner dials and held-breath pauses. Mixed-metaphor watch: “velvet hush” beside “crystalline quiet” survives because both serve synesthetic catalog. Minor scaffold: “intuitively descriptive” appears three times; trimming one would tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: battlefield medic turned silence-archivist who picks locks with Earth’s heartbeat. Risks gimmick but stays grounded in tool detail and embodied cost. Image of clasp as “surrendered flag” transforms familiar dove symbol; not fully inevitable but memorable.</comment>
