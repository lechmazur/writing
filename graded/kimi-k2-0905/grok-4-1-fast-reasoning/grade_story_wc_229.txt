<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrically specific—“screaming tenderness,” “garden at night” scent—yet the turn from bellowing to whispering relies on a distilled epiphany rather than on-page contradictory impulses. Mira remains an off-stage idealized object; her return is felt but not tested under pressure, so the relationship crucible is implicit, not dramatized. The earned cost is present—the spent vial, the reopened arms—but the beat that proves his flaw is summarized, not lived in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vial’s spent perfume and Mira’s arrival reweight the “whisper > shout” premise with undeniable emotional cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—Mira’s walk back is magically scent-drawn—but the pattern is taught early and the final image crystallizes options with felt tenderness. Orientation is immediate; only one transition (dawn mist to stair climb) and geography stays coherent. The vial’s rule-set is consistent; no late loopholes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn-cool after heat, is evoked through Elias’s skin and nostrils—paint mimics “deep sea’s heart,” mist “curled like smoke.” Spatial choreography is clean from lantern room to hidden garden lee to cliff path. The vial functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its cork pop and perfume exhalation charge the closing embrace. Scale matches stakes: lighthouse beam stays off, keeping focus on intimate radius.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once when Elias uncorks the vial, foreclosing the horn option. Pressure is lyrical rather than causal; the scent-thread is an externalized coincidence that complicates, not resolves, but the stance crystallization (Elias kneeling, recorking) carries visible emotional cost. No secondary reversals, yet the single deepening sufficies for length. Cost is felt, not logistical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the inverse power of gentleness, distilled from garden-night perfume and lighthouse silence. No explicit moralizing; the beam igniting over the reunited pair offers non-literal repricing of prior violence. Recurring scent motif reweights from desperation to invitation, echoing the inversion. Ambiguity lingers: will whispers stay enough when the next storm hits?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature—synesthesia of color, scent, vibration—without head-hop. Diction (“cobalt,” “night-blooming cereus,” “nocturnal perfume”) is specific yet within his keeper’s poetic lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with breath/sea sync; no template cadence. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual (“You... whispered?”) and distinct from narration’s lushness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is strong; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught early (“lighthouse’s bellowing horn”) and paid off in the final silent beam, so density reads as accumulative texture rather than overwrite. One mixed metaphor (“pink fingers of dawn stroked the cobalt paint”) is minor. Line propulsion stays high; paragraph cuts are taut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—lover wins beloved back via magical object—is refreshed by inverse emotional physics: softer = stronger. Lighthouse-as-chemical-apparatus for scent diffusion is a fresh inflection. Garden-at-night perfume as carrier wave for “vibrations of intent” marries natural and supernatural without gimmickry. Risk is moderate but coherence high; ending feels inevitable yet not derivative.</comment>
