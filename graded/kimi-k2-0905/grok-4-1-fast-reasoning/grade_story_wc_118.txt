<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thorne’s lone, obsessive ear-to-wall stance is embodied in every paragraph; his interiority (“gasped… the walls hummed”) is concrete, particular, and contradictory—he both fears the void and feeds on it. The final renunciation—mounting the tapestry and settling into dreamless stone—pays off the diaries’ foreshadowing with visible cost: he forfeits escape. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the micro-choice to display, not burn, the fragment crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. 9+ gate met: contradictory impulses in-scene and earned refusal with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Thorne’s decision to weave the dragons into the archive reconfigures the silo from prison to compass, cost legible in self-condemnation to perpetual dreamlessness. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of absorbed grief tightens until the tapestry reprises. Orientation anchored by 120; no lens ambiguity. Causality is intact, but the axis-as-chronicle revelation is 80% reflection-fed; a single on-page probe beat is the only live causality. The −0.3 non-closure cap applies for the slight outline-like sequencing of diaries-to-tapestry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tilted silo is not backdrop but pivot: bookshelves lean, dust spirals upward, and the vault’s warp enables the cache discovery. Micro-setting (fireplace choking ash) constrains the recovery method and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays with Thorne’s perceptive bias—vibration, bronze hush—never tourist catalog. 9+ gate missed only because the axis itself is never allowed to alter his bodily tactics on-page; environment shapes mood more than choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect the stories before the void claims him”—tightens when the tapestry offers a last story that could burn or endure. Escalation is textural: each echo layers grief until displaying the fragment becomes the irreversible act that forecloses escape. The price (permanent dreamlessness) is felt, but the axis anomaly never narrows live options; it’s thematic backdrop, not tactical obstacle. One meaningful deepening satisfies lens; no reversal, but renunciation counts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of absorption: walls absorb voices, diaries absorb fire, Thorne absorbs the dragons’ warning. Final image reweights the axis from curse to chronicle without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence—laughter, screams, and secrets are only ever implied by bronze quiet. Ambiguity is purposeful: dragons as mythic guardians or psychic projection remains credibly double.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is consistently perceptive, compressed, lyric: “bronze quiet,” “dreamless void,” “skewed sky” all issue from Thorne’s idiom. No dialogue, so distinction bullets waived. Patterned elision (“half-remembered regrets… echo-layered”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses spiral like dust, then snap to short declaratives at the mountings; no syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: “fingers trembling, he sifted… dragons… scales… gold” packs noun-verb without modifiers. Mixed metaphors avoided; “cosmic spindle” is single coherent vehicle. No loops or scaffold;只有两个模板化短语“the bronze quiet”在结尾处重复以产生咒语效果，已提前教授，故豁免。Closure beat无修辞杂乱。</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silo-as-library + tilted-axis + dragon tapestry is a fresh triangulation of retro-futurist ruin and mythic warning. Dragons reinterpreted not as monsters but as enforcers of planetary balance, embodied in cloth rather than CGI. Risky accumulative structure pays off: the story inhales echoes until the final image exhales coherence. Removing any pillar collapses the concept; hence high irreplaceability.</comment>
