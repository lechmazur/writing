<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “gently systematic” trait is embodied in wire-wrapping beats and diary sketches, but interior contradiction is thin; no moment shows him tempted to abandon or doubt. His calm under death-sentence is asserted, not dramatized; we see no visible cost in stamina or emotion until the final sink-against-oak, too late to test character. Closure is Earned Stasis, yet the price feels atmospheric rather than personal; the diary’s open pages flutter, not his body. Competence balanced with struggle is missing; work proceeds without error or adaptation, flattening credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice hums, pilgrims arrive, meaning reweights. Causal chain—diary → wire → pillars awaken—holds, but “architectural secrets” revelation is delivered in visionary summary, not decisive act; tension plateaus rather than tightens. Six-month deadline is declared early yet never narrows tactics; time pressure is ambient, not causal. Cost is conceptual (human guardianship restored) rather than viscerally felt on page; still, the final image reconfigures stakes cleanly under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Living stone pillars veined with quartz that pulsed faintly” is tactile and specific; copper wire harvested from shipwrecks grounds method in world. Temple orchard functions as micro-setting: every wrap of wire alters architecture and possibility. Spatial choreography is clean—string lines, chalk, shed, oak ladder—no floating props. Final lattice charged image satisfies 9+ gate by constraining pilgrim touch and reweighting meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore interspecies respect—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete opposition (axe-wielders, sceptics) appears to test it. Escalation is textural: each copper coil adds luminous density, not narrowing options. Protagonist agency is iterative, not decisively tested; no reversal or trade-off beyond fatigue. Cost is atmospheric (gut pain, breath) but does not alter tactic; tension accumulates without tightening knot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard transformation rather than assertion: copper-oak-stone unity literalizes respect. Final lattice image offers non-literal answer to “how bridge rift?”—touch the warm wire, hear the hum. Avoids moralizing, but visionary flash of ancient councils is thematic echo rather than earned insight. Complexity lingers: no guarantee pilgrims will heed; ambiguity feels purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical, stable at reflective distance; perceptual signature in botanical precision—“roots drawing mineral life”—and wire-spiral diction. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for calm, staccato “By noon, ten branches gleamed” for pace. No dialogue, so voice rests on description; occasional elevated register (“arboreal entities”) drifts from caretaker lexicon but stays consistent. Copper, quartz, hum recur as patterned chant, paid off in final lattice glow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong information density: “wire spiral-tight, leaves trembling” does three jobs—touch, sight, consequence. Metaphors stay coherent: stone as petrified giants, quartz veins as pulse. Repetitive stems (“brazen calm,” “gently systematic”) become template cadence; mild loop penalty. No clarity break, but rhythmic monotony dulls peak beats. Closure line “endless growth” edges toward platitude, not image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses biomineral architecture with eco-spiritual renovation; copper-wired oaks as conduits feels fresh, not checklist. Transformation test passes: this specific lattice could not exist without Elias’s diary decoding stone-oak symbiosis. Risk in summarizing vision rather than dramatizing, but coherence holds. Slight proximity to Avatar-lite tree-network trope, yet island quarry-shipwreck detail localizes it.</comment>
