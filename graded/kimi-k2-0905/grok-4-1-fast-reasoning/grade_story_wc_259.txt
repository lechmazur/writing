<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to “pierce the veil of history’s lies” is vivid, yet interiority lapses into abstract summary (“anguished joy surged”) rather than embodied contradiction. The key renunciation—shattering her veil—lands, but the prior beats show methodical adaptation more than irreconciable impulse, so the cost feels announced rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds: each ritual failure adds density until the pattern-break triggers closure. The final image (saffron threads in rainbow light) reweights the premise, but the pagoda’s rule-set is revealed late, so the Conceptual Repricing is resonant yet lightly prepared; cost is felt yet not persistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Archive is richly textured—bioluminescent fungi, fractured obelisks—while sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis. The pagoda’s bronze facets and dying-slight refractions constrain the purification ritual, charging the final rainbow burst; micro-setting succeeds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—“grasp why paradise soured”—tightens through iterative shocks that bar patterned thought. One meaningful deepening: randomizing life rhythm splits historian from historian-self, foreclosing safe scholarship. Cost is visible (veil shredded, memory atoms scattered) yet could be sharper on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: nostalgia as addictive toxin masquerading as balm. The saffron veil’s shift from symbol of sorrow to scattered threads reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Final image offers charged poise, not lesson; ambiguity lingers, satisfying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lush, cadenced third-person hovers close to Elara’s perception; diction stays within historian-register. No dialogue to test, but internal voice avoids filter verbs. Occasional elevated phrases (“cataclysmic hush”) flirt with register drift yet serve tone; rhythm modulates with stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally strong density and forward propulsion, but stacked metaphor runs (“dust motes danced like fleeting regrets… frozen scream of light”) dilute peak beats. No loops or scaffold; pronouns clean. Final third carries mild purple tinge, barring 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Nostalgia-as-quantified-particle is fresh; pagoda that refracts memory atoms而非light offers vivid conceptual twist. Saffron veil/“patternless mind” synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric escalator structure holds, rewarded.</comment>
