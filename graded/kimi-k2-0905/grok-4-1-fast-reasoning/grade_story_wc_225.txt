<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is embodied in the bone pawn he never stops turning; every micro-choice—plucking a crimson strand, aligning it with the pawn’s edge—externalizes the interior contradiction between love and betrayal. The “fierce repose” crystallizes a credible endurance that forecloses self-loathing; the cost is the admission that desperation, not malice, rigged the board. No second character is on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; the crucible is strictly intra-personal and sustains pressure. The only minor slip is a hair of therapeutic self-labeling (“forgive oneself”) voiced internally, but it is earned by the mirror’s unvarnished image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the village is frozen, therefore Elias can decode the tapestry; because he deciphers his own opening cheat (e4-d5-Nf3), therefore the labyrinth forces him to replay the crime. The closure is a Decisive Change—time thaws—paired with a Conceptual Repricing: the pawn becomes queen, guilt transmutes to grace, and the cost is the irreversibility of that knowledge. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Elias sought refuge”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. One micro-turn (mirror revelation) is all the length demands; no escalation break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen village is not postcard scenery; its suspended raindrops and ajar doors physically permit Elias to enter the hall and handle the tapestry. The bone pawn recurs as micro-setting—handled in six beats, final promotion charges the closing image. Platinum corridors are rendered through tactile thread-plucking rather than visual catalog, satisfying economy. Spatial choreography is immaculate: square → hall → altar → tapestry border → mirror, each move legible. Weather never restarts until the final thunder-crack, so environment causally links to interior thaw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled in line 3 (“weight of that betrayal”). Escalation is woven: each decoded thread tightens the noose of memory until the queen-sacrifice fork reenacts the original moral crash. The visible price is the pawn’s transformation; once promoted, the object can never revert, foreclosing the fantasy that the past can stay unplayed. Agency is strictly Elias; coincidence is absent. One tightening suffices for 700-word scope, and it lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid of chess notation and labyrinth thread; no explicit moral is stated. The final image—pawn becomes queen—reweights the entire tapestry as a playable board, turning the metaphor material. Subtext resides in the fray: unraveling is both destruction and liberation. The story invites counter-reading: perhaps self-forgiveness is just another gambit, but that ambiguity is earned, not imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “his fingers fidgets productively” renders the grammar slip as idiosyncratic motor habit. Syntax mirrors chess logic—short, diagonal clauses that fork like knight moves—then widens into labyrinthine hypotaxis during contemplation. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. The diction never exceeds a tutor’s lexicon except when “winnow” appears, justified by the agrarian-etymology motif taught in the text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm alternates between staccato pawn-click sentences and longer woven threads, propelling without drumbeat. Metaphors stay inside chess/labyrinth domain—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold pair (“woven hush… deepening hush”) is intentional motif-repetition, not artifact. Information density is high: each sentence advances decoding, memory, or setting. Closure sentence is clean, image-driven, no explanatory filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Frozen-in-time village plus chess-notation tapestry fused into navigable labyrinth is a fresh synthesis; neither trope is stock. The bone pawn’s promotion as grace-transmutation avoids familiar redemption cliché. Risk is moderate—concept could collapse into puzzle-box cleverness—but emotional cost keeps it grounded. Specificity of the actual tournament gambit (Nf3) prevents generic substitution.</comment>
