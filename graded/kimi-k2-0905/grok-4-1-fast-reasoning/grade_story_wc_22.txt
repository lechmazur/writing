<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thorne’s grief-forged vocation and quiet defiance are embodied in every motion; the coat-pocket pods and Eldari whispers make his interiority singular. The micro-choice to scatter north where “blood pooled deepest” crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ bar is missed, but the renunciation of further battlefields carries visible cost. Interiority never slips into label-speak; instead, “ancestral dice” tactile detail keeps emotion grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jetty’s blooming boards become a living bridge reconfiguring sea/soil relations, with petals drifting into the ink-black sea as undeniable social/ecological cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density intensifies from bleached coral bones to luminescent vines, cadence shifting from dirge to renewal song. “Submerged concord” is re-weighted on-page when Thorne’s Eldari incantation revives the pact. Persistent constraint: the coachman must leave, carrying only lightness—garden’s future is unguarded, cost felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jetty as micro-setting constrains every action: narrow planks force single-file scattering, amplify hoof-clatter, frame vast horizon. Bleached coral battlefield and salt-fed blooms evolve causally with reef-collapse rule taught early. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (cracking pods, creaking boards) and sound (avian Eldari) over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate—reader tracks Thorne’s kneel at jetty root, scatter along pilings, final mount without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with garden—signaled in first third. Tightening occurs when spectral tern’s call narrows scatter to “north, where blood pooled deepest,” foreclosing random dispersal; Thorne’s compliance costs him last seed stock. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each seabird directive adds density, nutrients, luminescence. Cost is visible—pods gone, future garden unprotected—yet lacks a second reversal, keeping score sub-9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: coral death → battlefield exposure → garden resurrection, no moralizing. Subtext in avian Eldari fragments shows nature archiving extinct human languages. Final petal drift reweights premise—renewal is unguarded, fragility itself the cost. Avoids thematic echo; no character states thesis aloud. Ambiguity lingers: will vines survive next tide? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close adheres to Thorne’s perceptual signature—salt-tang, dead-language cadence, seed-rattle diction. Syntax lengthens during Eldari incantation, then compresses at scatter beat, mirroring ritual breath. No head-hopping; seabird speech is filtered through his linguistic ear. Register stays within coachman’s plausible lexicon; “ancestral dice” and “salt-crusted wood” feel idiosyncratic, not thesaurus-churn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes—clause lengths mirror hoof-clatter vs prayer-murmur. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors (“desperate finger tracing infinity”) are precise, not stacked. Information density high: one line can fuse sensory cue, world rule, and emotional tilt. Copy-clean; no typos or tense drift. Peak beats remain vivid without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct-language ornithology + reef-collapse ecology + battlefield gardens, all grounded in coachman vocation. Risky accumulative structure pays off—closure image of petals drifting into black sea feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Transformation test fails if names swapped—Eldari/bird dialect specificity is irreplaceable. No derivative premise here; submerged concord subverts typical eco-vengeance arc into mutual renewal.</comment>
