<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation (“ghost whisperer”) stays mostly interior monologue; we see calloused fingers but no diver reflexes under pressure. Child/locket motif supplies credible micro-choice that salvages “purity,” yet motives arrive pre-formed rather than emerging through new, stressful decisions. Interior contradiction is implied, not dramatized in-scene; still, the salvage yearning threads cleanly to the final locket grip, earning a modest cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shrine hush and “borrowed starlight” fade let ghosts exhale, reconfiguring stakes without tidy victory. Causal chain (globe → dream-cameos → locket) holds; however, dream-mechanics are exposited rather than tested mid-scene, muting cost visibility. Orientation anchor (“candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice”) arrives within 30 words—no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of cameo images reframes meaning; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glacier shrine functions micro-setting: ice walls, candle drip, viscous globe pool constrain ritual motion and refract silver light onto the final image. Sensory hierarchy privileges cold, flicker, sticky glass—mirroring Elara’s careful patience. Idioms stay restrained; no anachronism. “Borrowed starlight” and “shattered vow” risk poetic overlap but remain character-filtered. Setting details evolve with candle melt and globe re-solidification, cleanly charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve untainted relic—established early; pressure tightens when cameo clues foreclose wrong assumptions, pointing to sabotage. No time-lock or immediate bodily risk; cost is conceptual (ghost unrest) and moral (exposing mate). Escalation relies on pattern density, not causal reversals; sufficient under Accumulative lens but never threatens Elara’s safety, keeping visceral stakes moderate. Final locket extraction pays price of eternal stewardship, felt but off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—corruption versus innocence—emerges through locket twins and sabotage reveal; no explicit sermon. Motif of “windows of connection” recurs via dream-cameos, reweighted when globe reseals, offering resonant but quiet answer. Subtext operates in averted dream-eyes and translucent finger tremors. Final “borrowed starlight” fade avoids moral tag; complexity stays intact. Mild abstraction in “purity” could sink lower, but concrete locket object grounds it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited keeps psychic distance steady; perceptual signature favors chill, glassy, star-metaphors consistent with glacier night. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for ritual invocation, clipped fragments at “snarling defiance.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Diction “viscous pool,” “thread by thread” shows control; elevated phrasing stays consonant with ceremonial POV. No head-hop; filter verbs serve lyricism, not hedging.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence starts avoid mechanical “She…”. Figurative layering heavy but thematic (ice, star, glass) and patterned early, so forgiven; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances ritual or reveal. Minor scaffold: “cameo” x5, “borrowed starlight” x2; repetition serves litany effect, not loop. Typos absent; pronouns clean. Final line lands crisp, recharging “borrowed starlight.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Arctic ghost-whispering, dream-cameo forensics, and melted snow-globe seer feels idiosyncratic yet internally inevitable. Premise twists maritime ghost tale into psychic detective yarn; not derivative. Transformation test fails if Elara swapped with generic medium, indicating sufficient specificity. Risky lyric density could alienate, but commitment holds to end. One fresh inflection: globe re-solidifying around innocence—image not seen elsewhere.</comment>
