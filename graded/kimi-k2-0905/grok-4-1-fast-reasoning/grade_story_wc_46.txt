<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s earthbound vigil and her vow to lost kin anchor every beat; the interior contradiction—“yearning sky yet choosing ground”—is alive in each micro-choice (polishing, presenting the gem). Emotions stay embodied in salt-stung fingers and weighted glass, never slipping into label-speak. The final renunciation—sharing light while remaining rooted—carries visible cost as she hands over the captured starlight and stays ashore. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV interiority is coherent and specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard adds density until the glass’s prismatic bloom reweights the stake. Orientation is fixed by line 4 (“serpentine grotto… coastal cliffs”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the village square glows without fire, Elara’s grounded stance crystallized, her sky-longing forever foreclosed. Cost is legible—“earthbound feet steady on the damp stone”—the price of guardianship now irreversible. No causal chain is broken; pattern is taught early and pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine walls and mist actively constrain polishing technique and hide the village from flame; the glass itself becomes micro-setting that refracts starlight onto the crowd. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt, damp stone, frosted edges—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: cliff → grotto → village square, no impossible moves. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism; mist thickens as memories surge, then parts for dawn’s reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—signals in paragraph 5 and tightens when polishing risks failure. One meaningful deepening: the glass’s glow must suffice in place of torches; this narrows options and carries visible price (no flame ever lit). Escalation is textural: each lyrical pass of sand increases radiance until the single reversal—village accepts cold light. Agency remains Elara’s; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from particular动作: starlight transmuted to cold gleam mirrors grief transmuted to guardianship. No moral stated; final image of villagers circling the grotto refracts the opening solitude into shared wonder. Subtext lives in gesture—handing over the gem is surrendering her last winged hope. Ambiguity lingers: she is still earthbound, now gladly, cost felt but not sermonized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“zephyr of celestial petals,” “salt-kissed gift”—diction never exceeds her star-watcher lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with polishing strokes, then exhales at dawn reveal; no template cadence. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely through narrative texture, which is consistent and distinctive. Patterned repetition (“memories resurfaced”) is taught early and paid off in final line, justifying lyric returns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Its surface yielding to reveal an inner reflectively vibrant glow” advances both polish progress and metaphor. No loops or synonym churn; “reflectively vibrant” is mandated element, not filler. Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass veins, starlight petals—no mixed logic. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, bookending mist and bloom without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—lonely craftsperson gifts village—reshaped through specific ocean-glass alchemy and fireless light. Fresh inflection: polishing as ritualized grief, pearl of stillness as anti-flame. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when final crowd scene recharges earlier solitude. Could not swap coastal grotto for generic cave; salt, tide, and serpentine rock are integral to glass genesis.</comment>
