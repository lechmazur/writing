<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s observant trait is dramatized in the ledger cross-examination (strong micro-choice), but the interior contradiction between filial loyalty and investigative drive is told more than shown; the pen-nib heirloom is handled twice but never truly endangers or costs her anything, so the “earned” aspect feels light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: journalist call → drive to observatory → ledger confrontation → contradiction exposed → Thorne confesses; closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (Thorne’s shame, Elara’s legacy pivot). Orientation anchored by word 60; chronology inversion is flagged and paid off; no prop teleport or knowledge cheat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s glass dome and amplified wind are used to pressure dialogue acoustics and mirror tightening regret; the brass telescope and starfield serve as tactile tools during the proof scene, satisfying micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clean; only lapse is no sensory shift under peak pressure—all visual.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>8.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—clear father’s legacy—tightens when ledger claim threatens to confirm public scandal; Elara’s agency drives the contradiction test, foreclosing Thorne’s blackmail option. Cost is legible: Thorne’s collapse, Elara’s acceptance of father’s moral complexity. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth revealed via contradiction—emerges from the ledger chronology flip rather than assertion; playful/solemn modulation stays intact, but final aphorism (“truths hide in contradictions”) drifts toward explicit thesis, muting resonance a notch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual filter: star-wheel mocks, ink scent, nib warmth; no head-hop. Distinct diction—“orbit this claim with logic’s gentle gravity”—marries scientific idiom to playful cadence; syntax remains controlled under pressure. Dialogue indirection strong: Thorne’s evasion met with Elara’s mock-courteous “eclipses” line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Rhythmic variety good—short percussive beats during ledger snatch, longer lyrical coils for star regret—but metaphor density peaks in paragraphs 3 & 4 without pattern payoff; one paraphrase loop (“orbits of regret” echoed inside three sentences) and a filter-verb cluster (“she’d always cherished…felt like…”) dull immediacy. Closure image clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Freshened “heiress investigates parent’s scandal” by staging the interrogation inside an echo-dome observatory and weaponizing astronomical data as blackmail; proof-by-contradiction method rendered as literal star-orbit ledger timeline is elegant. Risk: solemn-playful tone occasionally flirts with cute, and “rosewood pen nib” edges precious, but specificity of telescope timestamps keeps it from sliding into gimmick.</comment>
