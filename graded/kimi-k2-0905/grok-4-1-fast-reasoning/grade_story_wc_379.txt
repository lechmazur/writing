<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena’s curator trait is shown through her sorting eye and thrift-store cue, but her interiority stays at a general “quiet/calm” register; no contradictory impulse undercuts her calm, so tension stays external. The “sandstorm calm” label is repeated instead of dramatized bodily cost; tears from neighbors act as proxy emotion. Micro-choices (turning the dial, handing over the locket) align with motive, yet the climactic act feels procedural, not costly. Closure earns communal healing, but Elena’s personal stake/risk remains abstract—no path foreclosed for her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: locket clue → story clues → dial code → mailbox opened; each beat advances knowledge. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. Escalation is soft—pressure is collective, not personal; the mailbox release is satisfying but low-cost for Elena. Closure lands as Charged Poise: courtyard hush vs. city din, emptied mailbox now “filled by heard hearts”; social cost (exposed letters, public tears) is legible. Lens stays situational/accumulative; pattern coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Courtyard imagery is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered: dew-kissed jasmine, palpable birdsong, rusted mailbox. Sensory hierarchy shifts with emotional temperature—dawn hush vs. helicopter thump. The locket and mailbox function as micro-settings that constrain final action; environment guides social choreography. No spatial drift; bodies track cleanly from fountain to oak to gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving communal listening heals—announced early; personal risk to Elena is muted, muting pressure. One meaningful tightening: sirens/news vans intrude, forcing Elena to redirect circle back to stories. Cost is social, not personal; neighbors pay emotional price, but Elena’s options never narrow. Agency is facilitative (she decodes, opens, offers locket), not self-endangering; tension plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—stories as social glue—emerges through communal act, not thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: locket passed hand-to-hand, mailbox yawning open. Final image reweights “sandstorm calm” as collective shelter against outside chaos; no moralizing line. Ambiguity lingers: will healing survive the day’s scandal? Complexity honored; no character forced into redemption caricature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Elena’s selective curator-eye; perceptual signature steady. Lyric compression (“sandstorm calm,” “birdsong wove through palm fronds”) is patterned early and paid off in final hush. No head-hopping; neighbors’ voices stay external, filtered through Elena’s ear. Distinct cadence between storyteller cadence and narrative description; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: short fragments under dawn hush, longer cadences during story circle. Figurative language dense but controlled; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “sandstorm calm” phrase repeats four times; same image, no escalation—minor drag. Otherwise propulsive; each sentence advances communal decoding. Copy clean; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar “mystery object unlocks community secret” trope refreshed via oral-story scavenger-hunt mechanic; clue-to-trail structure feels organic to courtyard culture. Specific 1952 flood code roots plot in local memory, not generic past. Risk taken: collective protagonist, but Elena’s interior kept reserved; limits personal freshness. Locket-as-listening metaphor integrated, not bolted on. Overall, particularized enough to transcend template.</comment>
