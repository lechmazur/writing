<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to sow seeds is stated early and never contradicted, but interior contradiction is thin; we hear “patiently strategic” three times rather than see clashing impulses. The embodied emotion is strongest when she snaps the chain against the nail—one sharp physical cost that crystallizes her finesse. No credible misstep or blind spot complicates her escape, so the liberation feels competent rather than crucible-forged. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy (vault first, fight second) is legible and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: chained → free, seeds in hand, Wall down. Causality tracks: piano-key cipher found because she daily scanned prizes; floorboard opens because she pre-looped chain; hatch shut because bullets arrive—each because/therefore tight. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (dream-like carnival husks) is taught in line 1 and pays off when the same plush bear stops the arrow. Cost is visible—chains abandon her wrists in the final image—so lens (Causal) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The redemption booth operates as micro-setting: cracked glass cases become shrapnel, dangling toys become projectiles, ticket measurements become the cipher grid—environment repeatedly constrains tactics. “Cotton-candy ghosts” and “iridescent glowbird fletching” give olfactory and iridescent specificity without catalogue overload. Spatial choreography is flawless: chain length, counter edge, hatch hinge all tracked through motion. The carnival husks mirror the larger civic decay, charging the final image of seeds with conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get seeds before Wall falls—is signaled in para 4 and escalates as Wall bombs start mid-story, tightening the literal countdown. Elara’s agency drives every turn: she deciphers, kicks board, slams hatch—no luck rescues her. Cost is present (chain galls, lost months, plush avalanche bruises) but not irreversible; she exits lightly scathed rather than bearing a persistent handicap. Still, the tightening is clean under Causal lens and the final image forecloses return to captivity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative defiance emerges through concrete particulars: plush bears crushed by tyranny, seeds that survive drought, Wall rubble that fertilizes escape—never sermonized. The piano-key cipher quietly reweights “play” into guerrilla cartography, letting motif accrue rather than declare. Final image of discarded chains reconfigures bondage as mulch—an oblique, potent answer. No overt thesis line, but a hair’s-breadth from pseudo-profundity when “plant resilience” is repeated; hence held below 8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person cinematic-close hovers just outside Elara’s skin, filtering every notice through her tactical priorities: “rusted chains” before color, “coordinate grid” before music. Rhythm flexes—clipped clauses under arrow-fire, longer sweep when Wall roars—without losing lucidity. Diction stays inside a rogue agronomist’s lexicon: “bioluminescent vials,” “drought-proof maize,” never grad-school purple. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat; voice is singular, muscular, and taught by line 2.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “splintered prize counter,” “arrow with strange fletching” replace generic nouns. One paraphrase loop—“staggering grace” appears three times—earns −0.3 but never muddies causality. Metaphors stay coherent: “concrete behemoth” for Wall, “forgotten dreams” for plush toys—no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with sonic snap; high information density achieved without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic carnival seed-heist is fresh angle; piano-bench-cipher repurposes nostalgic junk into resistance toolkit. Glowbird-fletched arrow supplies one irreplaceable specificity—elite hunter badge—yet could swap color without breaking arc, capping score. Wall-fall as literal timer while micro-puzzles unfold inside midway game booth feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present but safe; no structural gamble that could misfire.</comment>
