<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulse—yearning to escape yet clinging to enigma—surfaces only in summary; no embodied beat shows him torn while acting. The pivot from observer to “shadow puppeteer” is declared, not dramatized with micro-choices under stress. Final cost is social applause, not private loss, so the key-change feels gift-wrapped rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: cookie prophecy → discovery of specs → encoded bait → beam trap → arrests. Closure lands as Decisive Change with public exposure, though the personal price is thin. Orientation is swift; lighthouse/tavern anchors appear by line 20. One minor causality wobble: spies instantly trust altered coordinates without skepticism, softening the trap’s credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fog-soaked tavern, iron spiral, sweeping beam—each detail is filtered through Elias’s habitual solitude and later weaponized. The lighthouse mechanism itself becomes the decisive tool, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography holds as Elias moves bar→stairs→lantern→bar→stairs without drift. A single overripe phrase—“familiar enigma of solitude wrapping him like a well-worn fog cloak”—slows the opening, but the rest is taut.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake crystallizes: escape stagnation by exposing the smugglers. One tightening beat—embedding film slivers into cookies—narrows options and raises personal risk. Cost is hinted (loss of anonymity) but never felt on-page; applause replaces consequence. Escalation is linear, not recursive, yet sufficient for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of authorship versus control emerges organically: the man who once dispensed accidental prophecies rewrites fate as deliberate script. Final image—lighthouse beam as stage light—reconfigures his identity without moral sermon. Open-secret motif recurs but remains thematic garnish rather than pressure engine. Avoids tidy maxim; resonance lingers in the minor-key “wind whispered approval.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature leans toward cryptic compression (“ink and dough,” “muted life now resonated”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for fog-bound rumination, staccato for beam Morse. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom is consistent and purposeful. One filter-verb cluster—“he saw his chance,” “he felt sharper”—slips in the peak beat, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold loops or template cadence. Figurative language is spare and targeted—beam as “conductor of maritime fates.” High information density: each paragraph advances bar, stairs, or beam. A single mixed metaphor—“key turning in his soul’s rusty lock”—clicks but doesn’t stall momentum. Clean copy; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing fortune-cookie writer with espionage microdots is fresh, yet the spy-uses-tavern trope is familiar. Specificity of baking film into cookies and transposing lighthouse beam into Morse trap lifts the concept. Risk is present but safe: spies act exactly as Elias predicts. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight because the beam’s control is seeded early.</comment>
