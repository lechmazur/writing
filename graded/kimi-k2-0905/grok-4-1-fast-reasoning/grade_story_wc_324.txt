<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “persistent curiosity” is repeatedly named but never embodied in contradictory impulse or visible cost; the hearing-aid insertion is the sole micro-choice, and it reads as plot trigger rather than revealing a hierarchy of values. Clara’s suicidal stance is declared, not dramatized through gesture or interiority, so the relationship crucible never pressures Elara into a costly decision. Motivation stays flat: protecting “vulnerable voices” is asserted, not tested against competing goods. The ending’s “incidental heroism” is retroactively labeled instead of lived through a renunciation that actually costs Elara anything.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece lands a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara chooses life after hearing the relayed assurance—so closure formally exists, but the cost is felt only by Clara; Elara’s stake evaporates. Causality under the inferred Accumulative lens is loose: the hearing-aid pulses merely appear, never constrain tactics, and their quietus is unearned. Orientation is clean within 120 words, yet the single-scene default is stretched by repetitious mist-and-hush lines that stall rather than tighten. Because Elara neither pays nor forecloses anything, the closure lacks the required visible price under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vividly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias—marble arches “like forgotten sighs”—and the photograph plus hearing aid function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: bench, balustrade, and railing positions track cleanly across the encounter. Weather (twilight, mist) affects Clara’s suicidal timing and Elara’s visibility, thus constraining approach. Sensory hierarchy narrows to sound (aid) and touch (tarnished brass) under crisis, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Clara’s life—arrives late and is signaled abstractly (“come to end it all”) rather than through tangible preparation or visible means, flattening visceral urgency. Pressure escalates only once, when the mother’s message is relayed; Elara’s agency is passive conduit, not active trade-off. No credible loss (time, social credit, physical risk) alters Elara’s tactics; the hearing-aid battery dies afterward but never limits her. Because coincidence (finding the aid) initiates rather than complicates, escalation feels atmospheric, not causal under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of “listening as salvation” emerges through image (photo, aid, mist) rather than moralizing, yet the final paragraph’s “quiet savior” and “legend grew in whispers” nudge toward overt thesis, triggering the −0.4 thematic-echo penalty. Subtext operates best in Clara’s silent tracing of the smiles, implying forgiveness without stating it. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: Clara’s choice to “stay—for her” reweights the prior argument. Complexity is present but blunted by Elara’s lack of personal stake, leaving theme one-sided.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara with clean psychic distance; no head-hop. Diction—“reeling hush,” “veil at dusk’s edge”—creates a textured, consistent lyric register that modulates with intensity. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct: Clara’s cracked “You found it” contrasts with Elara’s measured cadence. Perceptual signature is strong—Elara notices heartbeats, mist curls, photo edges—anchoring voice in professional bias. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; rhythm mirrors breath under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally lean, but “reeling hush” recycles eight times, creating a template-cadence artifact that dulls the closure image; a −0.5 penalty applies. Mixed metaphors—“shadows pooling like forgotten sighs”—are tolerable, yet “mist parting like a hush held breath” layers abstraction atop abstraction, muddying immediacy. Sentence openings vary, but paragraph breaks every 1–2 lines fragment momentum. Information density is high when the hearing aid is handled; elsewhere, mist descriptors pad rather than advance. No typos or pronoun drift, but the looped phrase keeps the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” conceit is fresh, but the story never exploits its procedural quirks; any empathetic medium could replace Elara. Photograph-plus-hearing-aid dyad offers a novel resonance machine, yet the pulses remain unexplained, blunting conceptual payoff. Risk is moderate—suicide averted by ghost tech—but the beat is familiar from prior fictions. Specificity of Echoheart Sanatorium and brass aid lends verisimilitude, yet the emotional arc is generic reconciliation. Transformation is partial: names and setting feel unique, but plot beats are interchangeable.</comment>
