<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and stargazer identity are vivid, but “awkwardly confident” is asserted more than dramatized—she never trips, hesitate-talks, or pays a social price. Interiority stays lyrical (“the galaxy itself urged her onward”) rather than concrete and contradictory under stress. The stone-circle beat gives her a cosmic zap that re-ignites the rebellion, yet the cost is off-loaded to unseen fighters; her own stance change feels gifted, not earned through visible flaw or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands: the opera glasses convert stone-circle hum into rebel beacon, a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost—her private vision becomes public target. Causal chain, however, is thin: why does she place palms on the slab, why does the hum need amplification, why do distant fighters instantly trust an untraceable signal? Orientation is fine (who/where anchored by line 3), but the lens stays lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Repair bay is sketched with bruised skylight, rusted hulls, grit-strewn ferrocrete—selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s barefoot chill. Stone circle’s alien etchings give a micro-setting that directly powers the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking holds as she moves from bench to gantry to slab without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find meaning to restart rebellion”—is clear early. Escalation is a single mystical jump rather than narrowing options: the stone circle instantly flips lull to mobilisation without intermediary obstacle or trade-off. Agency is present (she activates the slab and glasses) but price is externalised; no personal option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—chaos can birth pattern—emerges through star-maps, cracked welds, and alien etchings rather than lecture. Final image of barefoot visionary broadcasting cosmic hum offers resonant reconfiguration of science-faith tension. Avoids overt moral, though “meaning bloomed eternal” flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cosmic register: “bruised skies bled,” “thunderous serenity.” Syntax swells and contracts with Elara’s awe, no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is stargazer-poetic, never committee-voice, and stays stable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Strong imagistic density, but metaphor pile-ups (“molten amber,” “velvet night,” “thunder cloaked in serenity”) risk purple overload in peak beats. Some template cadence (“barefoot soles… barefoot stargazer… barefoot and unyielding”) audible. No paraphrase loops or grammar slips; momentum breathes with paragraph variety.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Stargazer-activates-prehistoric-beacon inside derelict spaceport is a fresh mash-up of Clarkean monolith with grassroots revolt. Opera glasses as analog amplifier feel specific and new. Execution leans on lyric oracle rather than character-driven innovation, so transformation feels lightly miraculous rather than earned.</comment>
