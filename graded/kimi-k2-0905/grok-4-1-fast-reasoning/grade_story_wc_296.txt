<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Thorne’s contradictory impulses—guardian of lost things vs. self-eraser of his worst deed—are dramatized in the blood-onto-seed beat; the interiority stays embodied, not diagnostic. The moment he hesitates before cutting his palm shows the flaw that powers the climax. Cost is visible: he limps out with seed-husk in flesh and a stripped psyche. Voice remains singular; no committee drift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: failed spell → sucked into vortex → seed counters spiral → blood feeds plant → ice shard melts → confession released. Each because/therefore link trims options until the final shard-break costs him his self-myth. Orientation anchored by line 5 (“tumbled through a rift”). Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: “unguarded soul” stated while he bleeds.</comment>

<comment>The lake-bottom orchard is delivered through motion—roots coil around his boots, frost cracks under knee-pressure—so setting constrains tactics. The ice shard functions as micro-setting that finally melts under the plant’s acid, directly enabling the confession. Sensory hierarchy obeys Thorne’s druid priorities: runes before taste, spiral math before color. No exposition dump; world rules learned by how the seed eats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—face the erased murder—signaled in paragraph 3. Pressure tightens exactly once: when the vortex contracts and demands flesh; the plant’s circle-by-circle devouring externalizes escalation. Cost is visible blood and psychic fracture; that price reshapes the final gait. Under causal lens each spiral is a because/therefore ratchet, not decorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—“what mirrors refuse to show”—emerges from the ice-shard image and Thorne’s peeled guard, never abstract assertion. Final line (“he knew their deceit now”) reweights earlier mirror motif without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: he is neither hero nor monster, just exposed. No echo of prompt language; insight paid for in blood and wilted vine.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays strictly in Thorne’s perceptual funnel: “runes of forgotten pacts” is druid-filtered, not tour-guide. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed fragments when vines bite, longer clauses when guilt surfaces. No head-hop; “spectral voice” is externalized memory, not omniscient intrusion. Rhythm mirrors spiral tightening without algorithmic drumbeat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (action, metaphor, world-rule). No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors; “branches arching like drawn swords” is single clean vehicle. Micro-loop check clean—no paraphrase adjacent lines. Final third free of prose artifact; closure image (“seed remnants and an unguarded soul”) lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar “face your past” arc is retooled through flesh-eating horticulture and an underwater apple-legion—specific enough to prevent swap-test failure. Ice-imprisoned younger self is fresh twist on confessional trope. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the warlike serenity motif modulates rather than repeats. Synthesis feels inevitable after seed-planting causality.</comment>
