<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s quiet deliberation is the only trait that repeats; her interiority never cracks under pressure, so the promised “obsession” never manifests as visible irrationality or cost. The final smile is too tidy—no contradiction lingers, no bodily price paid—so the change feels administrative rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: key-turn → automaton awaken → map → descent. The resonance of “closing loops” reweights the stake at the end, giving a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: the isle’s approval hum seals her new burden. One soft spot—the backward-looking spoon lore is dumped in two sentences and never pressures present choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Environmental specificity is superb: levitation crystals moan, star-ink reservoir, brass spirals that bite skin. The observatory itself becomes tool—telescopes ignored, pedestal becomes altar—so setting actively funnels attention and choice. Micro-setting (key teeth = interlocking shadows) charges the final image and would break if swapped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened twice: first gap closed → vision of vault; last map reveals rift. Cost is conceptual (she gains guardians’ burden) but not visceral—no risk to body, reputation, or time—so pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Still, agency drives every beat: she inks, aligns, re-loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme of “relearning harmony in bent reality” emerges through rune-mending, not lecture. Final image—key pocketed, observatory humming—performs conceptual repricing: knowledge acquired is weight carried. No moral finger-wag; ambiguity lingers about whether shadow vault should be visited at all.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s selective gaze; perceptual signature is tactile-mineral (“star-ink,” “filigreed bronze”). Syntax lengthens during ink-work, shortens at key-turn—rhythm breathes with action. No dialogue, so requirement waived; internal diction credible for scholar (“ley-nexus,” “umbral gardens”) without drifting into encyclopedia.</comment>

<question>7</question><<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is high-density: one sentence often does setting + metaphor + interior (“brass rod spiraled with micro-etched runes, its teeth shaped like interlocking shadows”). Only loop: “quietly deliberate” appears four times, templated cadence; does not touch closure. No mixed metaphors; sensory verbs stay concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spoon-bending as cosmic rupture, noon-shadows as symbiotic garden, rune-mending as ethics of repair. Clockwork automatons re-inked instead of fought is non-obvious choice. Risk—lyric density—heightens rather than obscures clarity; closure keeps image legible. Conceptual integrity intact: world rules never soften to rescue heroine.</comment>
