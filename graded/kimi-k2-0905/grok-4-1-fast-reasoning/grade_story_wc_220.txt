<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s longing for Mira is viscerally anchored in the waxed leaf, but his shift from corpse-tracker to life-hunter is asserted rather than dramatized; the single moment of shared hand-clasp is too slight to bear the weight of “meaningful change.” Mira’s body-hunter turn is intriguing yet arrives as exposition, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites. Interiority leans on lyrical repetition (“wild hush”) that sometimes substitutes for embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: cylinder → riddle → trek → reunion, each beat clearly triggered by the last. Closure lands as Charged Poise—together they step onto catwalks with new shared vocation—visible cost is the forfeiture of solitary certitude. Orientation is clean by ¶3; lens is Causal throughout. Minor slack: the revelation that Mira now “finds survivors” is delivered, not tested, so the Decisive Change feels slightly under-costed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Scrapyard terrain is sketched with economical sensory hits—fuselage-bone shack, rad-mirages, catwalks over abyssal rifts—each detail double-duty as externalized emotional state. The waxed leaf functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it literally powers the trek and is finally re-pocketed, charging the closing image. One minor spatial drift: the “greatest fissure” appears without prior scale cue, but choreography recovers instantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—threads every beat; escalation is steady (leaf → riddle → trek → reunion). The tightening moment is the rift-edge recognition: live option of finding Mira forecloses solitary death-tracking. Cost is present but abstract (shared hauntedness); no concrete tactical loss is dramatized, keeping pressure heartfelt yet not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through mutual recognition emerges organically via the leaf, riddle, and final mirrored vocation. Subtext is strongest in the wax seal mirroring the query—preservation vs. forward motion. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance lies in catwalk lights “winking kinship,” a quiet reweighting. Occasional lyric echo (“wild hush” ×11) borders on motif-for-its-own-sake but never capsizes meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-limited clings tightly to Elias’s tracker sensorium—smell-of-decay, nose-to-earth—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under trek pressure, longer lyrical curls at twilight. “Intuitively descriptive” diction stays within POV lexicon, though the phrase itself repeats as self-conscious tag. Dialogue is sparse and natural, Harlan’s rasp distinguishable in a single line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—most sentences advance image or motive—but figurative layering is relentless (every second sentence contains metaphor or coined adjective). Mixed-metaphor risk: “wind-whispers through jagged seams mimicked lost heartbeats” offers three concurrent vehicles yet lands cleanly because the sonic layer fits setting. Repetitive stem “wild hush” becomes a drumbeat; filter-verb clusters absent. Strong read-aloud rhythm; minor trim would sharpen peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-war scrapyard + phonograph-cipher + bloodhound-romance is fresh, avoiding clichéd wasteland tropes by foregrounding scent-tracking and micro-engraving. Riddle-as-invitation elegantly reverses usual “message in a bottle.” Some phrasal tics (“wild hush”, “tinted”) flirt with mannerism but feel authored rather than algorithmic. Overall, specific sensory welding of tech and heart lifts the piece above genre median.</comment>
