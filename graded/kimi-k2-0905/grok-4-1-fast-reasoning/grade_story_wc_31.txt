<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief and refusal to accept Lira’s loss are concrete—key tag in pocket, boots sinking into silt—but interiority drifts into poetic abstraction (“luminous vow burned brighter”) that blurs contradiction. The final reunion is touching yet feels externally granted; the key-tag glow and coalescence arrive without a visible cost exacted from him. No micro-choice after entering the library tests his resolve or forces trade-off; he simply receives. Lira’s transformation is revealed, not struggled for, so the arc lands sentimental rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure image (paired lantern release) is present and tonally resonant, yet the Decisive Change is soft: the reunion is magically bestowed, not seized through a costly last-fork choice. Causal chain frays when the spectral librarian hands him the color-sound answer and Lira re-materializes without Elias having to risk or forfeit anything on-page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; location and ritual time are anchored. Drive lens is Accumulative: pattern of ascending lanterns and glowing script layers density until final glow, but the lack of a tightening trade-off keeps the reweighting mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s strength: lantern-gold on black waves, bioluminescent fungi breathing like hearts, brass key warm against salt-soaked chest—tactile, selective, immersive. The meteor hush is more than mood; it muffles waves and footfalls, shaping Elias’s stealthy approach. Spatial choreography stays clean: railing climb, knee-deep water, bulkhead door push. The sunken library acts as micro-setting that supplies the decisive book and spectral guardian; environment directly enables closure. One minor slip—"ink-black sea" leans cliché—but overall sensory economy is exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover Lira by “discovering the color of sound”—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus once inside the library. Elias faces no escalating obstacle, cost, or reversal; the librarian simply delivers exposition and the book opens to reveal the answer. No option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no tangible price exacted. Escalation is therefore thematic (learning the answer) rather than causal or tactical, keeping tension static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of love-as-light, vows-as-lanterns emerges organically through recurring ascent imagery rather than explicit moral. The library of luminous contracts literalizes the idea that promises outlive flesh, letting reunion feel mythic yet understandable. Subtext in the spectral librarian’s “hides behind truth” line is intriguing but unpacked only at surface level. Ending image of dual lanterns rising avoids sermon, offering quiet resonance, though earlier poetic overlay slightly blunts conceptual edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly anchored to Elias with painterly, lamplighter-specific diction—“struck his final match,” “pier lamps’ flicker behind him.” Rhythm swells and contracts with scene movement: long clauses for ceremonial hush, clipped fragments for breathless deck climb. No head-hopping; spectral librarian’s dialogue is filtered through Elias’s perception. Voice achieves a dreamy consistency that matches the tale’s mythic register without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: information doubles (lanterns blot sky + cast ripples), metaphors stay coherent, no synonym churn. Few minor flights—“lanterns bobbed overhead like approving specters”—tip toward ornament yet serve atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies, openings avoid templates, paragraph cuts tight. No scaffold or paraphrase loops; closing line is crisp image. A handful of elevated phrases slightly exceed working-class lamplighter lexicon, registering minor register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mythic grief-quest fused with sunken-ship library is fresh, avoiding typical ghost-wife tropes by making her transformation into archived light the point. Color-of-sound concept feels mystical yet grounded via synesthetic pages. Risky lyric compression is mostly earned, though resolution could carry more cost. Specificity of lantern ritual, brass key tag, and bioluminescent fungi prevents generic drift. Conceptual integrity holds; premise commits to its own strange logic.</comment>
