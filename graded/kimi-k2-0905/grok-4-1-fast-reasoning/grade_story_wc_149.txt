<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s regret and hunger for transcendence stay vivid; each micro-choice (eating the pear, clutching the bead) is tied to visceral sensation. The ghost bride’s motivation is legible—repayment of cross-lifetime debt—yet her agency is mostly off-stage, so the relational crucible test fires only at the end. Internal contradiction is handled through euphoria/pain duality rather than alternating labels. Closure renunciation (his death/merging) is earned by the pattern of prior ingestions and visions, so the cap for unmotivated choice is waived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each cameo and fruit-eating thickens texture and reweights the stake until the final charged poise. Orientation is immediate—alchemical greenhouse, endless night, lone alchemist—well inside 120 words. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the lovers united across the veil, cost paid by Elias’s mortal death, final image of the pulsing greenhouse. No prop teleport or causality break; bead drops early and loops back in final runes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting details (frost-laced panes, luminous pear, venom-apple vine) are filtered through Elias’s alchemical gaze and constrain his choices—what he can eat, what he can transmute. The greenhouse itself acts as a micro-setting crucible: spatial choreography stays consistent as he moves from potting bench to frost-pane to floor collapse. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—taste of poisoned wine, hum of runes—never a static postcard. Final image reuses the same glass panes now glowing with unnatural bloom, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias accept lethal transcendence to reunite?—is signaled with first pear ingestion. Escalation is textural: each cameo tightens the euphoric poison’s grip and peels another life-layer, narrowing his worldly options. Visible price—bodily collapse, spectral kiss—alters tactics: by final cameo he no longer fears death but welcomes it. The tightening is single but meaningful under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of debt-as-love emerges from iterated images rather than thesis statements; the bead’s return in the final floor-runed circle reweights earlier memories. Subtext lives in gesture—icy bridal kiss as both promise and poison—never explained. Mournful elation tone is maintained without final-moral slide. The closing image of two ghosts ghosting together offers concrete residue, not abstraction, satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: spiraling runes, luminous fruit juices, winter-cracked hush recur with obsessive cadence that mirrors alchemist mindset. No head-hopping; POV stays latched to Elias except for brief legitimately external ghost sightings. Compression and elision (“days blurred into nights”) are taught early and paid off in final timeless union. Dialogue absent by design; voice distinction therefore judged on narrative idiom alone and remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure—long narcotic sentences in calm, staccato fragments at collapse. Figurative language is dense but patterned (venom/wine, ash/veil) so does not obscure causality. One paraphrase loop (“over the hush of winter-cracked fields” repeated) is forgivable as mantra. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closing rune-etcheon floor image is precise and propulsion stays high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Alchemical-ghost-romance premise feels fresh because cross-lifetime debt is enacted through literal poisoned fruit rather than exposition. Specificity of venom-apple vine and carved bead prevents generic swap-out. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens dream-logic without breaking clarity. Slight proximity to “lovers reunited in death” trope keeps it from 8.5+ band, but transformation through alchemic imagery earns high 7s.</comment>
