<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to find “honest origins” stays legible throughout; her tactile micro-choices (kneeling, re-inking, tracing coordinates) embody the indexer mindset. The interior contradiction—steady resolve vs. flicker of doubt—surfaces only once; more layering would lift this to 9+. Closure cost is present but quiet; she seals the vault having forfeited the mythic comfort she once catalogued.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: stamp falls → she catches → ink hypothesis → coordinates → vault opens → truth costs myth. Each because/therefore linkage narrows her options until the final renunciation of the founding lie. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the city’s guilt is now hers to carry in stillness. No orientation or lens ambiguity; blackout even pays off as the literal condition for phosphorescent ink.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Sunken-library setting is never backdrop: brine-etched shelves, moss-slick floor, and water murmur constrain footing, supply blank vellum, and dictate silence. The stamp itself becomes micro-setting—its brass weight, corroded handle, and warming pad alter her posture and tactics. Final image of sealing the vault inside that drowned hush recharges the “reclaimed stillness.” Meets 9+ gate: environment directly shapes the last gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she prove myth or human fault?—tightens the moment she fingers the stamp. One meaningful deepening: the ink that glows only in darkness flips her method from light-dependent to shadow-reliant, foreclosing retreat to old indices. Cost is legible: she trades collective comfort for isolating truth. Could edge higher if blackout clock visibly taxed her stamina or breath.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus consoling myth—emerges through the shift from catalogued legend to signed blueprints, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: the hush she once drowned in now “envelops her like a balm,” reweighting silence from menace to earned refuge. Final image reframes prior shelves of “dead lists” into living accountability. Avoids moralizing; the city’s guilt stays implicit in her sealed vault.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person voice maintains calm, cataloguing rhythm true to an indexer: “cross-referencing indices with mechanical precision” mirrors sentence structure. Lexicon stays within plausible drowned-scholar range—no stray corporate diction. Peak stress compresses syntax (“Stamping it revealed hidden latches”) without losing control. Distinct perceptual signature: she “reads” by touch and warmth, not sight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “shadows clung to sodden shelves like forgotten regrets” packs setting + mood + metaphor in one stroke. Varied sentence rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she sensed…”) mid-scene costs a hair. No mixed metaphors; submarine logic stays coherent. Final line lands with crisp, image-driven snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fantasy trope of drowned city is inverted: catastrophe born not of gods but geotechnical hubris, revealed via librarian cataloguing tools. Stamp-as-epistemic-key feels novel yet inevitable once glyph is tactile-read. Risk taken: entire plot hinges on ink that activates in darkness—rule taught early and paid off at vault door. Specificity of “Veritas Primordia” and engineer-signed scrolls anchors freshness.</comment>
