<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet vigil and single consequential act—placing the tickets—are micro-choices that scale to the stake. Mira’s thaw is shown through bodily gesture (palm pressed to crystal) rather than label-speak, earning the shift. Interior contradiction is light: Elias desires transparency yet eavesdrops, but the text never forces him to pay for that hypocrisy on the page. The relationship-as-crucible works, yet the cost is felt more by Mira than by Elias, muting full catharsis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: crystal echoes and ticket-images layer density until the hush itself re-weights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—two silhouettes in embrace, crystals whole—whose conceptual cost (shared solitude exposed) is legible. Orientation is taught early via “crystal whispering forecourt after rain,” waiving any anchor penalty. One minor causality fuzz: the lens’s scavenged origin is mentioned once and never exploited later, but it does not break the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The forecourt’s mirrored crystals function as both mirror and loudspeaker, constraining Elias’s tactics (he must hide within their_echo) and charging the final image (wholeness reflected back). Rain-polished facets narrow Mira’s movement—she fears literal reflection—and the wet surface forces tactile contact when she steadies herself on the niche. Spatial choreography is pristine: booth, niche, crystals, bodies track without drift. Sensory economy favors hush and glint over visual excess, keeping density high.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust via transparency—is signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is textural: each ticket-image deepens density until denial becomes impossible; the lens’s hologram projects a literal “mirror” Mira must face. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible—her self-image fractures—visible when she murmurs “I hid to protect, but it froze me.” A sharper external price (e.g., Elias risking his registrar post) would have pushed the band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the triad of echo, mirror, and blank ticket: honesty is the only sound that silences itself. Subtext resides in silence and deferred gaze; no character states the moral. Final image reweights earlier motifs—crystals whole, couple silhouetted—offering a quiet CR that “resonant hush” is relational, not atmospheric. The piece resists tidy redemption: mistrust is paused, not cured, sustaining ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elias’s sensorium, filtering everything through auditory obsession (“subtle comings and goings of souls”). Syntax elongates then contracts to mimic breath-held listening: “registering only… registering only…” Patterned repetition is taught early and paid off in the final hush. No dialogue means voice distinction is judged through perceptual signature alone—achieved. Diction stays inside Elias’s quiet lexicon; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Rain had polished the crystals to a mirror sheen, amplifying whispers into a symphony too soft for words, perfect for secrets” fuses setting, stake, and atmosphere in one breath. Rhythm modulates: longer susurrus clauses build hush, then staccato placements—“Slipping from his booth”—advance action. No mixed metaphors; crystal optics remain consistent. Minor paraphrase loop on “mistrust… mistrust” two sentences apart (−0.2), but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The doodle-on-concert-ticket conduit feels fresh because it weaponizes ephemera (tickets) as memory projectors, melding scavenger tech with lyric ghosting. “Ambiguously clear” is not a gimmick but an operational rule: the lens warps doodles into half-grasped truths, forcing viewer honesty. Risk is taken by abandoning speech for an entire love story—yet the hush earns its own grammar. The synthesis of crystal acoustics and para-cinema optics is specific to this piece; template swap would collapse it.</comment>
