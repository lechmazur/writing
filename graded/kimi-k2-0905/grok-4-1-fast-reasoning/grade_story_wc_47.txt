<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—public shame vs. private need to graft meaning—are shown through her quiet act of offering the pendant; Kai’s parallel pain is sketched quickly but credibly. The pendant transfer is a micro-choice that visibly forecloses retreat for both, paying a small interpersonal cost on the spot. Interiority stays concrete (“amber warm as trapped sunlight”), avoiding label-speak. Voice convergence under stress is minimal; the relationship crucible functions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant exchange crystallizes a new shared fragility; cost is felt in the final image (“amber glow reflecting their shared fragility”). Causal linkage holds: because Elara etched the icicle message, Kai arrives; because she proffers the heirloom, a new pact forms. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “honeyed hush” is repeated without new causal bite, but it does not touch the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moss-wrapped server rack micro-setting constrains movement and acoustics, forcing intimate proximity; the thaw-etched pattern literally guides Kai to Elara, charging the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (Elara notices drip-fractals because she seeks coded messages). Spatial choreography is clean: pendant passes from her palm to his chest in one continuous beat. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism—moss as resilience is shown, not stated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—can shared vulnerability become mutual armor?—tightens once: the pendant proffer narrows retreat for both. Escalation is quiet but legible under Accumulative lens: each drip melts until the invitation is complete, density increasing rather than causal reversals. Cost is visible on-page: Elara permanently relinquishes the talisman that “held my grandmother’s dreams.” No coincidence; the tightening is driven by her earlier etching act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: frozen data bones colonized by moss = trauma colonized by tender regrowth. Final image reweights premise: viral exposure outside vs. intimate graft inside. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic. One hairline slip—“viral now but private once” skirts meta-commentary, yet sentence is saved by POV irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Free-indirect texture is consistent: “she studied one such pattern… invitation in subtle curls” stays inside Elara’s coder-perceiver mind. Rhythmic control under pressure: short declaratives at transfer (“Take it”) echo code commands. Dialogue carries subtext: Kai’s “like code from a forgotten drive” reveals identity without exposition. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath “honeyed hush enveloped everything” vs. clipped “She stepped closer.” No synonym loops; “drip” recurs but each time carries new physical consequence. Mixed-metaphor risk “silicon bones” is allowed by SF setting logic. Information density high: pendant history compressed in three lines that also reveal motive. Minor filter verb stack “she studied” could trim, but beat remains immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise—post-digital ruin as healing greenhouse—is fresh synthesis. Icicle-etched invitation reverses the usual “message in a bottle” with biological code. Pendant-as-graft literalizes the theme without allegory. Risk is quiet rather than pyrotechnic, but coherence and specificity make the turn feel inevitable.</comment>
