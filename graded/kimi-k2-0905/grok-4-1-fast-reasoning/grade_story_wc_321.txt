<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “resiliently positive” trait is stated repeatedly but never costs him anything or collides with contradiction; interiority stays performative (“his ardent heart swelling”) rather than embodied. The parallel-Elias beat supplies the only real internal friction, yet the merger diffuses rather than tests trait integrity. No micro-choice shows him tempted toward despair or paying a visible price for optimism, so the arc feels label-secured rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: sideways clock → grotto → fading hull → hourglass → radio fix → timeline merge. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias pockets the empty hourglass, accepting permanent transient existence—cost is conceptual but legible. However, the grotto rules, hourglass mechanics, and pattern-radio method are declared mid-stream rather than seeded, so the resolution feels ex-machina even though emotionally coherent. Orientation is clear by word 60, no teleporting props; one causal micro-hole—how empty glass suddenly flows is elided.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory selection is vivid and POV-filtered: salt spray, luminous whispering rocks, starlight through fissures. The ferry itself becomes a micro-setting whose dissolving edges directly constrain action. Spectral grotto is atmospherically rich, yet its physics (how hull scrapes crystal without breaching) stays fuzzy; because no tactical choice depends on that physics, credibility holds. Final image of pocketed empty hourglass reuses setting detail as symbolic constraint, meeting 9+ gate but not quite charging tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep his beloved ferry intact”—is signaled early and escalates as the hull turns translucent. One meaningful tightening: parallel passengers overlap, forcing Elias to act before complete fade. Cost is conceptual (accepting permanent transient life) rather than visceral; no credible loss of tool, stamina, or social credit occurs on-page. Escalation is coherent but relies on invented pattern-radio logic that isn’t foreshadowed, slightly blunting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of “transience as home” emerges through recurrence of fade/merge imagery rather than assertion. Subtext arrives in final pocketing of empty hourglass—emptiness becomes talisman, reweighting earlier glow. No moralizing sentence distills the theme, but “permanent transient” is named twice, a light echo. The insight feels earned yet leans on conceptual rather than lived cost, keeping it shy of high-band resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><<comment>Third-person tight stays consistently with Elias; perceptual signature is upbeat-maritime: “we’ll sync the steps.” Syntax swells and contracts with fog/light imagery, supporting mood. No dialogue that requires differentiation, so voice-distinction bullet is N/A. Occasional lyrical lift (“starlit whispers”) fits romantic temperament; filter verbs minimal, diction within POV reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentences do double duty; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are kept in check—e.g., “sideways time” is repeated but pattern-taught. One coherence slip: “phantom sands ignite in spectral flow” blurs physics of empty hourglass, but image is brief. Closing paragraph compresses into lyrical cadence that lands cleanly; no artifacts touch climax, permitting mid-7 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>“Vanishing commuter ferry” trope is refreshed by treating it as timeline split rather than ghost ship, and by using radio harmonics instead of ritual to knit worlds. Specific detail—constellation routes etched in glass—gives fresh mechanics. Risk is moderate; concept commits fully, no retreat to safe realism. While plot bones echo regional urban legends, the overlay of sideways-time tech and optimistic deckhand voice supplies non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
