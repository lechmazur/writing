<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is sensuously concrete (“callused hands,” “tranquil blaze kindling in his chest”) and his contradictory fear of cosmic annihilation vs. hunger for stillness is on-page throughout. Micro-choices—pressing the paper wing into soil, tracing silence rings—are visible under pressure and foreclose the apocalypse at perceptible cost: he dissolves the wing and the prophecy both, ending in earned hush. No secondary character is present, so relationship/status tests are N/A. The only restraint from 9-band is that his flaws/limits don’t actively sabotage him; the struggle is more ritualized than psychologically perilous.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: because the prophecy infects his dreams, therefore he maps silence; because the crane geometry channels flow, therefore hush smothers code. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside 50 words; no disorientation debt. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the origami wing dematerializes, signalling that tranquil stillness now replaces cosmic noise. One minor causal fuzz: we are told worlds “collide in silent ruin” but never shown what that would tangibly mean to Elias’s haven; the threat remains abstract, keeping score just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brook, mossy stone, and indigo-dyed paper are tactile, olfactory, visual, and used; the water’s slowed flow literally mirrors the imposed silence, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting constrains the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—folds pressed into soil, rings traced outward, phosphorescent ripples—no impossible shifts. Cosmic layer is evoked via sensory overlap rather than exposition dump. A sliver off top because “moonlight wove silver threads” edges toward familiar visual cliché amid otherwise fresh imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing prophecy-driven cataclysm—is signaled in paragraph two and narrows to a single decisive tactic: mapping silence through origami geometry. Escalation is micro but efficient: whispered secrets hush, brook glows, prophetic echo dims—each beat raises the cost of failure. The price paid (wing dissolved, ritual finished) is visible, though cataclysm remains off-page abstraction, capping intensity just below the 8.5 gate. Agency is entirely Elias’s; no coincidence rescues him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “smoothed hush” emerges through action, not assertion: silence is literally mapped, water stilled, code quieted. Final image reweights earlier motifs—origami motes merge with brook, showing peace as active construction, not void. No moralizing sentence spells this out; the concept resonates via sensory reversal. Subtle counter-reading remains: absolute silence borders annihilation, giving thematic complexity without forced ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, elevated register is consistent with ritual-occult POV; patterned repetition of “tranquil blaze,” “whispered secrets,” and “smoothed hush” teaches its cadence early and pays off in the luminous final line. Syntax modulates from long sweeping sentences to fragments under pressure (“Flow accelerated.”). No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within a mystic scholar’s believable lexicon. Tiny hairline: occasional triple adjectives (“terrestrially cosmic vibrations”) flirt with excess but never break rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High figurative density but patterned and justified; metaphors extend origami → river → starlight without mixing vehicles. Near-zero scaffold: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn. Sentence variety is musical, propulsive. Indigo paper, midnight herbs, phosphorescent ripples supply concrete specificity. One soft register drift: “conceptual repricing” is an academic phrase sneaking into otherwise incantatory diction, but it does not recur in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of origami witchcraft + fluid dynamics + prophecy silencing feels fresh; not a trope checklist but an organic synthesis. Quiet-brook apocalypse aversion inverts epic fantasy bombast. Specificity (indigo-midnight dye, moss stone as altar) makes the magic irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring causality. A half-step short of 9+ only because the cosmic threat stays abstract, slightly dampening conceptual boldness.</comment>
