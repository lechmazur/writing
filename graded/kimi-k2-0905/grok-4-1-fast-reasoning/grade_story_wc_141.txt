<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—skeptic who crafts talismans—survives the text; the cello/seashell dyad externalizes it. The “gloomy cheerfulness” tag is embodied in the laugh amid ruin, paying a visible cost (shell paint flakes, compass spent). Micro-choices (aligning shell to f-hole, bow dancing faster) escalate with stakes. Motive stays constant but not static—each retelling tightens the noose of self-made meaning. The ending’s renunciation (myths cherished because busted) is earned by the causal chain of hums; still, the absence of any second character limits relational crucible and caps the score short of 8 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of humming voices layers density until the final cadence reweights the stake from “disprove ghost” to “affirm seeking.” Closure is a Charged Poise: shell silent, compass spent, Elias descending with lighter step—cost is the spent talisman and the irreversibility of fabricated meaning. Causality inside the hum sequence is causal-mini (each voice summoned because of shell-cello resonance), but global drive is accretive. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 30. The −0.4 non-closure cap reflects slight over-reliance on lyric summary between hums, dilating micro-turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory, cliff, salt-crusted stones, and failing-light dome are selectively sprinkled, never catalogued. The half-finished cello and flaking painted shell function as micro-setting, constraining the only possible climax (resonance requires both). Wind and perpetual dusk mirror interior tone without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean—boots crunch, bench splinters, shell aligns to f-hole. Environment never dominates page space yet charges the final image; gate for 9 not met because no environmental detail literally forecloses a live alternative path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the universal riddle”—is repeated but abstract; pressure concretizes when each retelling dissolves a prior certainty. Escalation is textural: density of voices tightens the moral cost of manufacture. No visible external price (no broken string, no blood), so 8.8 gate remains shut. The irreversible silence of the shell supplies a conceptual cost, satisfying minimal legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “truth is the direction, not the arrival.” Subtext lives in gesture—bow grazing strings “lightly” yet yielding wail—showing gentleness birthing force. No final-paragraph sermon; riddle’s answer is sung, not stated. Particulars (fisherman, Hale, mentor) keep universality anchored; ambiguity lingers without confusion. The “ephemeral compass” motif recurs with shifting meaning, earning resonance rather than checklist points.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked on Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is wry, salt-stung, cadence-heavy: “gloomy cheerfulness,” “cheerful in its mournful lilt.” Syntax mirrors pressure—crescendo of clauses before shell flakes. Diction stays within coastal, myth-buster lexicon; no academic drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice carries all subtext successfully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ear-test rhythm breathes—sentence length varies, paragraph cuts tight. Information density high: one line can do image + causality (“shell’s paint flaked under vibrating pressure, colors blurring like memories”). Mixed-metaphor risk in “echoes reimagined, proving myths as self-made compasses” but coherence survives. A few template stems (“Elias… as…”) recur; not pronounced enough to obscure closure. No filter-verb stacks in climax; propulsion maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of ghost-busting with lutherie-mysticism feels fresh; no close genre echo. Stakes reverse—myth buster ends by embracing self-spun myth. Shell-cello resonance as séance instrument is non-obvious synthesis. Risk in dense lyric pays off: final image reweights all prior hums. Minor deduction for abstract riddle phrasing that flirts with pseudo-profundity, but specificity of flaking paint rescues it.</comment>
