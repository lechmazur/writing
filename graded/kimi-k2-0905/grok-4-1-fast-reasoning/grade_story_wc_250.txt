<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s mute grace and Umbra’s slow thaw are rendered through incremental, embodied beats—mirror-tilt, shutter-click—so motive stays legible without speech. The spiral-calm trait actively shapes tactics (she never rushes, never protests), generating visible cost when she exhausts the final pattern and withdraws in silence. Interior contradiction is light: only a hinted ache of surrendered voice, but it surfaces through the mirrored starlight rather than label-speak. Closure turn is her choice to stop weaving, accept that darkness now carries its own faint stars—an earned renunciation that leaves her vigil unbroken yet altered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shutter configuration adds luminous density until starlight re-weights the void. Orientation anchored by line 3 (cobalt dock, post-rain night), no drift. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: final galaxy-spiral pattern projects undeniable cost—Elara’s spent focus, Umbra’s softened silhouette—without need of spoken epiphany. Cost is legible in the hush that follows, mirrored perfectly in the now-still puddles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dock-plank puddles, warped shutters, and the dental mirror’s polished arc function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice—she needs reflective water and slatted canvas to project constellations. Weather-stripped wood and salt-damp metal are returned to tactile life with each shutter snap. Spatial choreography is clean: reader tracks her movement from boathouse mouth to canal edge to final retreat. The mirror’s reused state (healer relic turned star-conduit) meets 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: will the void learn to cradle light? Pressure escalates through pattern intensification rather than causal reversals—each spiral tightens Umbra’s options until he must either absorb the star-warmth or retreat. Visible price: Elara’s tempo accelerates, breath implied in finger-cramp precision; Umbra’s shadow-fringe frays into twilight—loss of pure oblivion as identity. Agency remains hers; coincidence absent; closure keeps new equilibrium at cost of perpetual vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: value of stars lies in their ability to exist inside darkness, not above it. No moralizing statements; final spiral galaxy image re-weights premise that void and light are co-dependent. Subtext carried in light-touch, shutter-shadow vocabulary; silence itself becomes the argument. Ambiguity preserved: Elara’s empathy could be futile repetition or quiet cosmic pedagogy—reader left in charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice stable throughout: archaic cadence (“spiralingly calm”) taught early and repeated without variance, reads intentional. Perceptual signature skews to reflective surfaces—puddles, mirror, wet planks—mirroring Elara’s star-redirecting obsession. No dialogue, hence no head-hop risk; single POV maintained. Register stays within canal-keeper lexicon; metaphor chain (moth wings, heartbeats, galaxies) is controlled, not purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High figurative density is pattern-taught and pays off at closure; rhythm modulates with accelerating clause fragments under weave crescendo, then relaxes into short terminal sentences. No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold in repeated “spiralingly calm,” but it functions as mantra, not artifact. Final line is clean, echoing opening diction (“cobalt dock after rain”) to create circular resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of mute protagonist, dental-mirror starcraft, and tactile shutter-code is highly specific; removing any node collapses the concept. Familiar trope (star vs. darkness) is inverted: light is injected into darkness to teach the void its own worth. Fresh inflection at climax—darkness reaches toward light and is warmed, not burned—reconfigures both figures without spoken word. Risk in near-allegorical abstraction is buffered by relentless sensory grounding.</comment>
