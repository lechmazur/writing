<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The “half-masked line walker” is sketched more as a ritual functionary than a psyche: we get his declarative motive (“preserve the echo”) but no interior contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. His choices—conjuring clearings, peripheral gaze—are described in cinematic slow motion rather than felt stakes. The promised trait “strangely honest” is announced repeatedly yet never complicates or costs him anything on the page. At this length, one audible interior fracture would have been enough; instead the character stays a graceful mask.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece layers quiet images (clearings, dunes, pavilion murmurs) until the final hush certifies preservation. Causality is loose—no concrete obstacle ever endangers the rite—yet the because/therefore linkage (“lest the parapet’s motion unravel the rite → peripheral gaze → consecration”) is legible and pays off in a Charged Poise final image. Cost is present but diffuse: the walker’s blurred sight and cooled mask imply permanent perceptual shift. The orientation anchors arrive late (~150 words), but the delay is functional, teaching the reader to accept disorientation as method, so the −0.3 orientation penalty is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies, veils, dunes, and glowing parapet veins track cleanly across every beat. Sensory selection is POV-driven—“half-mask warmed,” “dune-glints”—and the murmuring pavilion itself becomes a tactile instrument that syncs breath with ritual. The kinetic parapet is not just backdrop; its golden pulses physically accept the echo, charging the closure image. World rules stay consistent: peripheral vision is taught early and obeyed throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the echo survive?—is announced early but never seriously threatened; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is a gentle thickening of stillness rather than a narrowing of options. The sole micro-turn (parapet shudders once) is quickly steadied, so cost feels symbolic rather than tactical. Still, under an accumulative lens, the deepening cadence does reweight the stake, satisfying the 8.2 floor for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through sidelong attention—emerges organically from ritual action rather than assertion. The final line’s “edges, not centers” offers a crisp conceptual repricing that retroactively charges every peripheral glance. No moral is stated; the reader is left holding the afterimage of a new epistemic rule. Ambiguity is purposeful: the echo is safe, yet its future reception remains contingent on the same oblique gaze.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, oracular, yet internally consistent: long breathed sentences mimic pavilion murmurs, while curt declarations (“This parapet resists all but sidelong truth”) puncture the hush precisely. Diction stays within the walker’s ritual lexicon; no filter verbs dull the immediacy. Compression is purposeful—“conjured clearings dissolving like mist”—and the pattern is taught by line 3, repaid in closure. Minor risk of incantatory monotony, but rhythmic control heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is almost immaculate: high information density, no scaffold loops, metaphors stay coherent. Occasional stacked epithets (“whisperfield calm,” “kinetic parapet”) flirt with purple but serve the liturgical cadence. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, the latter recharging “edges, not centers” as an after-echo. One mixed metaphor (“echo amplifying softly”) is a hairline slip that keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of desert mysticism and ophthalmic ritual feels fresh, not borrowed; no prior story combines peripheral vision with sand-dune consecration. Specificity anchors the novelty—golden veins in living stone, a mask that warms like a battery—so the concept cannot survive transplantation to another mise-en-scène. The risk of near-beatific stasis could have capsized into indulgence, yet the piece stays committed to its quiet register. A hairline deduction for echoing familiar “prophet in pavilion” tropes, but transformation is strong enough to reach the 8+ band.</comment>
