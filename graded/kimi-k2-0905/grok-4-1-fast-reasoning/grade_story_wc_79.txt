<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is vivid in her workshop and in her risky climb, yet her interior contradictions stay summary-level; we see resolve, not simultaneous dread or guilt. The final stumble is earned, but the micro-choice that tips her from mapper to doom-bringer happens offstage in the whistle sequence, softening the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Causal: each whistle question tightens possibility until the shell cracks and forecloses escape. Closure lands with visible cost—the city adrift, Elara whistle-silent—meeting RR/Charged-Poise. One causality hiccup: the gate’s original rusting is blamed on the earlier expedition only in the retro-vision, not seeded in present action, so the rule feels retrofitted at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tortuga Spire’s fused turtle districts, phosphorescent brine, and sun-bleached haze are tactile and bias-filtered through Elara’s cartographer eye; the spiral vortex she straddles literally guides her final act. The turtle-shell-as-setting constrains the whistle’s sonic path and thus the plot, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover watchers’ judgment—tightens with each whistle query that narrows to catastrophe. Escalation is coherent but single-arc; the mid-crack lurch is the only visible price, and it lands more on city than on Elara’s body, muting personal cost visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of forbidden knowledge versus collective safety emerges through shell glyphs and watchers’ gaze; no explicit moral is stated. Final image of watchers’ faint smile reconfigures prior dread, but message stays at cautionary rather than surprising depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Elara’s perceptions; sensory diction—“molten gold,” “phosphorescent brine”—reads like her trained cartographer precision. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal cadence modulates under stress, with short bursts mirroring whistle code.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence shapes, high density. A few luxuriant compounds (“sunwashed dread,” “silent storm amid the sunwashed haze”) verge on writerly, but they pattern-teach the tone early and stay consistent; no mixed metaphors, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The city-turtle fusion plus sonic glyph interface is fresh, and the expedition-as-catalyst twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail keeps the premise from sliding into gimmick; the reed-whistle code and shell-light response are memorable, not ornamental.</comment>
