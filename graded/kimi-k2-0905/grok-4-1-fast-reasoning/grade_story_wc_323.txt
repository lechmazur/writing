<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s “balanced curiosity” is asserted often but never tested by a contradictory impulse; she stays calm instructor. Kai’s want is clear, yet his only micro-choice—practicing the hologram—lacks visible internal friction or cost, so the arc feels instructional rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: relic → geometry lesson → virtual rift. Closure is a soft Charged Poise—Kai departs with talisman and new knowledge—yet the cost is only Elara’s hinted melancholy, not dramatized on Kai, so the “before/after” feels mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Benthic city is sketched with bioluminescent fish and pressure-seal thrums; the vaulted chamber and hologram orb anchor the scene. Spatial choreography is clean; the chain link’s micro-setting role constrains the final pedagogy, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Single stake—master starlight navigation—tightens once when geometry lesson forecloses ignorance. Escalation is informational, not perilous; no visible price or lost option occurs on the page, so pressure stays conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of “wonder tinged with cosmic solitude” emerges through recurrent “somber marvel” refrain and Elara’s final shadowed gaze. Subtext is thin—no ironic gap or re-weighting—yet the mood is coherent and avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains aquatic rhythm and controlled diction; perceptual signature is instructor-level analytical calm. No dialogue to test voice distinction; free indirect style stays stable. Minor template cadence in “somber marvel” repeats but serves mood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, information-dense, largely loop-free; only “somber marvel” phrase recycles four times, a micro-loop not in closure beat. Metaphors (chain petals, star wheels) stay coherent. No scaffold sentences or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of pre-cataclysm anchor chain with alien multidimensional geometry feels fresh and specific; the pedagogical scene is an unusual climax. The concept’s internal logic is followed through, transforming a mundane object into cosmic navigation key without gimmickry.</comment>
