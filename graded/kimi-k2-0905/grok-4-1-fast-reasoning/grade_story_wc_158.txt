<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elowen’s centuries-long insomnia and alchemical urge to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” are vivid, embodied in nacre-scored fingers and trembling postcard handling; the internal contradiction—timid yet unstoppable—surfaces in micro-choices like pressing the card into the alcove. The armistice choice is credibly earned, but the lack of any second on-page character keeps relational/status dynamics idle. Interiority risks poetic self-labeling (“twin abysses reflecting endless starless nights”) that briefly drifts toward diagnostic-speak. Still, the final surrender carries visible cost: the poet’s first sleep forfeits his vigil-voice, an earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each spiral echo, bioluminescent verse, and lullaby layer thickens the same stake—will he trade wakeful agony for blossom peace? Orientation is taught early via reef-filtered moonlight and shell acoustics, so spatial rules are legible. The midpoint tightening occurs when galaxies on the postcard literally align with his wall-verses, a pattern break that foreshadows fusion. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “sleep’s blossom armistice bloomed fully” images the cost—his century of night-watch ends, voice absorbed into shell resonance—felt and undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Shell interior operates as tool and body: spiral mouth funnels off-key wind that carries his half-sung lyrics; nacre walls bloom open only after postcard anchoring, directly enabling the climax. Sensory economy favors echo, salt, glint, and chord over sightseeing lists. Spatial choreography holds as he moves from tidal debris to prismatic core; distances remain trackable. Environment constrains the victory—had the shell lacked a heart-chamber, ensconcing would fail—so Q3 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is legible by line 3: endless insomnia versus coveted sleep. Escalation is textural—each refrain of “shyly unstoppable” and “blossom armistice” layers urgency until the galaxies physically merge with shell. Agency resides in the ensconce act; no outside coincidence intervenes. Price is the poet’s forfeiture of vigilance, but because the loss is welcomed, the on-page pain-cost feels milder than the causal setup promises; hence capped below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative imagery: pain-to-flower transmutation reframes suffering as generative rather than curative, avoiding preachiness. Final image of shell walls alive with borrowed lullabies resists tidy moral—beauty thrives, but the maker is silenced, leaving bittersweet ambiguity. Subtext (sleep=small death) stays implicit. The piece escapes echo-chamber abstraction by rooting each bloom in tactile nacre and salt scent. A hairline slip: “blossom armistice” is twice voiced aloud, flirting with thematic Echo, yet the second intonation is woven into wind-music, softening the lapse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, focalized through Elowen without head-hop. Perceptual signature is ornate—pearlescent, abyssal, phosphorescent—yet consistent with a poet who literally inlays verse on walls. Rhythm swells toward hexametric cadence at climax, mirroring lullaby crescendo, an intentional musical pattern. No dialogue appears; voice coherence rests on diction control and salt-crusted metaphor that never retreats into plainness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence texture is lush but disciplined: propulsion maintained through participle-openers that mimic tidal surge. One mixed-metaphor risk—“pain’s tendrils uncoiled… leaves greening under imagined suns”—is forgiven because vegetative logic sustains the photosynthesis motif. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are clean. Occasional modifier stacks (“galaxy postcard, guardian of armistice”) flirt with density penalty yet serve incantatory effect. Closure line “Peace blossomed” lands uncluttered, sealing rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of insomnia, shell-cosmos, and alchemy feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable: only a nacre-scarred poet could trade vigil for galactic bloom. Risk—entire story is one extended metaphor—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry because every rule (off-key wind, photosynthesis) is internally obeyed. Fresh inflection: “blossom armistice” recasts truce not between nations but between consciousness and oblivion. No close literary echo; the piece owns its diction and cosmic conch.</comment>
