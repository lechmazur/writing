<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s calmly inventive vigilance is dramatized through tactile beats—aligning quill prongs, pocketing the crystal—each micro-choice tethered to her quiet revolutionary motive. Interior contradiction is light; the voice risks over-articulate self-explanation (“her motivation burned quiet”) but body-tool choreography mostly compensates. Earned stasis is present: she replaces the smudge, accepting continued risk. Cost is felt but not sharpened to a wound; still, the stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blackout → dial decode → crystal retrieval → faint vein-pulse, each step tightens insurgent possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara melting into shadows while the fort “waits for ignition”—the conceptual cost (perpetual danger, no triumphant shout) is legible. One transition (garden→vault) is clean; orientation anchors within first 120 words. Persistent constraint (her sentinel access) shapes every tactic; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Phosphor veins, tilted gnomon, and bronze prongs act as micro-setting that literally guides hand-position and code-entry; environment is not backdrop but interface. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and glint—apt for a lock sentinel. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms. For 9+ gate, the sundial-as-tool constrains the final tactical choice, satisfying the test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ignite silent revolution—signaled in first third and escalates via each decoded angle. Tightening is present: each prong-lock narrows option space until the blue spark publicizes the flaw in the blackout. Cost is conceptual (exposure risk) rather than visceral; still, tactics are altered. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisible resistance emerges through concrete recurrence of half-painted dials and winking hushes; no explicit thesis. Final image of the fort “poised for ignition” reweights prior whispers into shared insurgent memory. Subtext in gesture—passing quill holder without full sentences—carries alliance. Ambiguity is purposeful: victory is only nascent, not moralized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—slant of light, click of bronze, ciphered angles. Diction is controlled, lightly elevated but consistent with a sentinel who thinks in precise degrees. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for twilight awe, clipped fragments when spark jumps. No head-hops; filter verbs minimal and purposeful. Voice is distinct without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene temperature; no template cadence detected. Metaphors (“thief in velvet gloves”) are spare, never stacked. High information density—each sentence layers light, code, motive. Only minor loop risk: “winking hush” echoed four times; yet it re-weights at closure, earning its recurrence. No clarity or causality obscured; prose propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lock-picking poetry meets revolutionary astronomy inside a sundial. Specificity of angular code (47° NE, 23° W) converts abstract intrigue into tactile thriller. Cradle of sparks transformed from lore into literal igniter-crystal node. Risk taken with lyric repetition but paid off in final hush. Not derivative; template-proof.</comment>
