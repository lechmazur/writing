<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s muteness-as-vow is vivid and embodied; the halo fragment extraction and silent “song” dramatize contradictory impulses (preserve silence / release sound). The final endurance—leaving the oasis with the fragment’s pulse in his bones—earns a resonant renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: “interpret every silence as possibility” drifts toward label-speak in a peak beat, blunting full 9+ entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restored carousel glows while Elias walks away, carrying the fragment’s whispered futures—cost is the irrevocable split between maker and miracle. Causal chain holds: wrong turn → oasis → fragment → silent song → renunciation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift (misting hush lifting at dawn) reweights stakes. One hairline scaffold—“quietly persistent” repeated in adjacent sentences—stops short of true flaw.</comment>

<comment>The warped-glass greenhouse inside a flatbed, spring weeping from the undercarriage, and moss-wrapped pony neck are irreplicable micro-settings that constrain tool use and body posture. Halo-light refracting through dew charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track Elias from gaping door to sunken oasis to restored ring without drift. Environment literally shapes tactics—vines part for chisel, mildew scent masks approaching dawn—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can silence birth living art?—tightens when the fragment demands voice; the misting hush deepens, forcing a wordless song that costs Elias his pure muteness. Escalation is textural: each carousel bone unearthed increases luminous pressure until dawn’s ray forecloses concealment. Price is legible: he forfeits sole possession of the miracle, leaving it pulsing in the train. Slight reserve: external coincidence (fog bank) initiates without later complicating, capping 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: creation requires surrendering the very silence that defines the maker. Subtext lives in gesture—cupping light to chest instead of speaking—and in the final image of wheels turning under star-bells, implying future carousels will carry his absent voice. No moralizing; the resonance is felt, not stated. One abstract phrase—“futures yet unspun”—leans toward pseudo-profundity, nudging down from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s carpenter gaze: noticing grain, splinters, tool weight. Syntax lengthens and softens inside the misting hush, then tightens into chisel-strokes as dawn breaks—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (“callused hands,” “wood and whimsy” hum). The lyric repetition of “whispering gleam” is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final star-chime, earning high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, forward motion (“vines cascaded from cracked skylights, wildflowers nodded…fed by a spring that wept”). No paraphrase loops; each image adds new physical logic. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure—“broken thing yearning to gleam whole”—without purple drift. A single participle opener simultaneity (“Gently, he pried it free, the misting hush deepening”) is forgiven for breath. Clean copy, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing angelic relic with derailed circus train feels inevitable yet unseen; the carousel resurrection inside a rolling greenhouse is a fresh synthesis. Risk—wordless aria as climax—pays off by redefining song as vibration, not voice. Specific carpenter detail (chisel angle, grain response) grounds the miracle. While angel-halo trope is familiar, its fracture into artisanal stewardship transforms the cliché, meriting high originality.</comment>
