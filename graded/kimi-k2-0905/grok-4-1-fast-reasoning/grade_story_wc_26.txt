<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s vigilance and grief feel embodied in her tactile orbit-tending and river-stone pocketing, but her interiority slips into thematic abstraction (“preserve the shape of hope”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The metamorphosis choice is signaled early yet the on-page cost is reported rather than lived: we are told she “mourned the human warmth” instead of feeling the chill ascend her spine. Still, her perceptual signature—night-shift librarian of shared dreams—remains specific enough to lift her above a cipher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked stone and part-ethereal guardian reconfigure the library’s future, the cost legible in her luminous regret. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—orb deterioration and ritual response—but the “comparison archive” is introduced late and functions as off-stage backstory rather than a visible tactic that shapes her choices. The midpoint transition from noticing to ritual is smooth, yet the external antagonist (shadow) remains a diffuse entity whose threat is asserted more than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystal-paned aerial library, mist-etched orbs, lavender dusk—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s custodial eye. The river stone’s earthly coolness contrasts the lofted ether, grounding theme and final image. Spatial choreography is limpid; no impossible moves. Micro-setting (stone-as-tool) constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save collective hope from shadow corrosion—tightens once: Elara decides to sacrifice corporeal warmth. Pressure is coherent but static; the shadow’s escalation is described (“had grown since sharing began”) rather than dramatized on-page. The meaningful turn is her ritual commitment; visible price is her partial humanity, reported not tasted. Sufficient for a lyric short, yet short of visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: shared dreams as communal trust corroded by mass exposure, hope’s shape maintained only by an individual’s partial self-erasure. Subtext lingers in the cracked stone and “luminous regret”—a quiet indictment of utopian sharing. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the image reweights earlier blooms. Complexity acknowledged; no false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic dusk perception; diction (“softly deliberate,” “luminous regret”) forms a rhythmic signature without monotony. No dialogue to distort. Filter verbs are few; metaphor density is high but patterned and paid off. Psychic distance tightens at ritual climax, then widens to eternal patrol—an earned stance shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong cadence control and sentence variety; only minor scaffold loops (“luminous regret” twice, “softly deliberate” thrice) but they serve motif. A few stacked modifiers (“golden auras clinging to their forms”) flirt with purple yet remain readable. No simultaneity errors or buried leads. Dense information per sentence; trims near-flab.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Post-shareable-dreams library above clouds is a fresh conceptual lens; the “comparison archive” of secret pre-sharing footage provides a clever epistemic method. Stone-as-anchor and librarian-as-dusk-sensor are specific, not borrowed. Risk of ornate whimsy is held in check by grounded grief. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Her dusk noticing frames the opening and final patrol; it enables discovery of the shadow and justifies her ritual authority. Two beats: noticing color shift, then noticing orb flicker. Closure: she becomes eternal dusk sentinel—cost visible in regret. Setup, development, payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stone handled in pocket, placed at nexus, cracked after ritual; earthly coolness opposes ethereal heights and reappears in final image. Three distinct beats; reweights hope’s permanence. Story would collapse without its tactile covenant.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Shadow unbound shapes the corrosion threat and motivates the ritual. Introduced late (middle third) but directly causes the metamorphosis choice and is bound by stone. Swappable name but concept drives stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Softly deliberate” modulates her gait and decision; visible in orb-tending and ritual placement. Trait forestalls rash heroism and charges the final eternal patrol. Three mentions spaced across beats, each tied to action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metamorphosis is the decisive turn: human to part-ethereal guardian. Foreshadowed by library’s dream-shift, executed on-page with pull felt, cost named. Story ends in its afterglow; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Comparison archive is signaled mid-story and rationalizes her knowledge of aura decay, but mechanics remain off-stage summary. Enables stakes clarity but does not constrain tactics; never shown in action. One-beat use only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blooming library supplies orb-tools, altitude isolation, and ritual nexus; micro-setting of stone placement alters outcome. Early anchor, mid-use, final resonance. Removing it collapses premise and climax space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Post-sharing era is backstory premise rather than ticking clock; time depth surfaces via footage comparison but does not tighten scene-level choices. Sets world rule, then steps aside.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hope-preservation desire seeds childhood memory, drives orb patrol, and justifies self-sacrifice. Friction: must surrender human warmth to save hope—cost dramatized in final regret. Three referenced beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminous regret saturates diction, imagery, and final stance; modulates from soft dusk to cracked stone sorrow. Tone charges closure image without overt statement. Consistent across every paragraph.</comment>
