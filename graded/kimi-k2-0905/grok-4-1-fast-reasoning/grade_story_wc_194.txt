<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific—his fingertip feel for the crank, the visceral certainty that “the dynasty must end.” The lone flaw: the moment he crystallizes that resolve is slightly over-articulated (“truth’s guardian unbound”), nudging toward label-speak that dulls the embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: papers burn, name dies, Elias walks into darkness—cost is the manor’s last breath and his own erasure. Causal lens holds: crank-turn → acoustic cipher → hidden panel → fire → exile, each beat a because/therefore linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sepia room is lived-in: floorboards confess, brass horn flares like a “trumpet of fate,” dust motes line up along nodal tracks to point at the panel. Details are filtered through Elias’s engineer-ear; the gramophone and crank are handled so tactilely they become micro-setting that literally unlocks the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dynasty’s guilt vs. Elias’s need to end it—tightens when the violin overtones reveal forgery and murder. The price is legible: he forfeits identity and heritage in the hearth, a felt loss that reconfigures his future to exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as acoustic guilt: music meant to immortalize the Voss name instead encodes its crimes. Final image—manor exhaling “last dynastic breath”—offers a non-moralizing answer: legacy is vibration that can be silenced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight sustains an elegiac, percussionless rhythm that mimics the slow grind of the crank. Diction stays within Elias’s antiquarian ear (“nodal lines,” “symphonic deceit”) without slipping into purple; every clause is tuned to acoustic imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long breathy cadences to staccato fragments that echo mechanical whirs; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layers (“golden shadows stretched long”) stay physically rooted in sunset optics, avoiding mixed-metaphor clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar gothic-ancestral skeleton is re-fleshed through acoustic physics: standing-wave cryptography as confession. The risk—using wave mechanics in lyric mode—pays off when nodal dust literally outlines the hidden panel, making the concept inseparable from plot.</comment>
