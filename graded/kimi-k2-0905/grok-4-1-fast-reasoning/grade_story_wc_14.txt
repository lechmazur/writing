<comment>Thorne’s quiet obsession with “textures of different times” is palpable in his stylus-work and gold-leaf breath-control, giving us a concrete, embodied motive. Interior contradiction surfaces when the lamp’s hum drags him from safe invention toward the town’s real frost-death; his refusal to flee charges the Earned Stasis closure. Micro-choices—etching orchid ink, binding the final volume—show value hierarchies under pressure. Yet the townspeople remain off-screen, so relationship crucible and status dynamics can’t engage; the 7.3 reflects strong single-POV interiority without full-scope characterization.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the open notebook releases frost-bound voices back up the slope, undeniable cost paid in Thorne’s spent pages and the town’s regained song. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dawn hum layers density until the pattern snaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“mountaintop…stationer”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. The −0.4 for lens clarity is waived because the accumulative pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>The bonsai labyrinth is no postcard; its “minuscule canopies trembling as if inhaling his refractions” constrains Thorne’s decision to leave the book at its heart. The rice-paper pavilion, single humming lamp, and gold-dust air supply tactile stage business that alters action (leaf adherence, waveform inscription). Spatial choreography holds as Thorne rises, wanders, returns. Environment charges the final image: the riotous bloom signals successful re-release of time-textures, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can Thorne keep inventing safe pasts to outrun the town’s real annihilation—is signaled in line 5. Escalation arrives when the lamp hum spews gunpowder alongside papyrus, forcing him to admit the actual frost-night; this deepening reweights his task from escapism to resurrection. Cost is visible: the notebook’s pages warp under truthful ink, his workshop light “dies,” and the town’s return is purchased by his own archival extinction. Agency is present yet quiet—renunciation rather than battle—fitting the 600-word lyric scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the ethics of artifice versus witness, the price of keeping pain at “incandescent restraint.” The gilded invitations literalize the idea that beautiful lies can midwife living truth. Subtext lives in gesture—the trembling bonsai inhaling refractions—rather than exposition. Final image of intertwined histories “real and invented” offers resonant ambiguity rather than moral, meeting the 9− gate; the 0.1 deduction reflects a hair of possible sentimental softening in “dawn’s promise.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable, filtered through Thorne’s perceptual bias: he catalogues hum pitch the way a bibliophile smells bindings. Diction—“incandescent restraint,” “thumbnail petals”—is elevated yet consistent with his gilded vocation. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is nil; prose rhythm breathes with long accumulative sentences that mimic waveform layering. Minor 0.1 discount for two near-repetitions of “earnestly studious” within 50 words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, syntactically varied; stacked participles serve the accumulative design taught in sentence 1. Information density is high—each sentence performs image + motive + world-rule. Mixed-metaphor risk (“blooming labyrinth…verdant crown”) is justified by the bonsai metaphoric frame and pays off in closure. Two template-cadence strings (“he…then he…”) in the final third incur −0.3, touching but not clouding the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “stationer who distills time through fluorescent hum” is a fresh synthesis of steampunk and quiet fabulism; no close pop-culture echoes. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—heightens coherence and is paid off by the sonic resurrection. Specific detail (gold leaf dust on rice paper, plague-wool texture) anchors novelty in sensory reality rather than concept glitter. Deduction for slight thematic familiarity of “artist must face truth” trope.</comment>
