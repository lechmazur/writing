<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is richly textured: the lens fragment’s heft vs shimmer mirrors her own liminal identity, and every micro-choice (trading the grave-pebble, whispering “Release the overlooked”) is concrete, costly, and specific to her. Contradictory impulses—longing to anchor vs need to let go—play out inside a single continuous beat, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses her childhood tether. The −0.3 non-closure cap applies because the cost, while felt, is framed as triumphant release rather than visible forfeiture; still, the choice is causally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the holographic annals reframed in mid-air reweight the market’s—and the reader’s—sense of history with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds throughout: each painting-detail discovered → lens warms → histories unbound. Orientation is taught early (“eternal instant” signals frozen-time lyric mode) and anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5, so no orientation penalty. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; escalation is a density shift rather than a reversal, but the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dangling market is not mere décor: its aerial walkways force Elara to move stall-to-stall, the swaying lanterns supply the mist-screen for the final projection, and the jeweled spider-web layout mirrors the fragile web of erased histories she restores. Sensory Hierarchy is POV-true—she notices brass astrolabes and writhing shadows because they once awed an eight-year-old sneak. Micro-setting (lens fragment) physically constrains her gaze and ultimately charges the final image. No slips touch closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Single dominant stake—honor the silenced—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when each painting detail narrows her path to unfastening the lens. Agency is continuous: she chooses to scan, whisper, and finally unclasp; the cost is the forfeiture of her private anchor, felt as “power unbound.” Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is the accrual of unveiled histories that forces the final release; coincidence is absent. Enough for high-band, but the price is more conceptual than viscerally forfeited on the page, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from specific reversals: a pebble traded for glass, then glass released for collective memory—history’s value is re-priced without a moral stated. Subtext lives in gesture (the lens finally “firmly hers” vs earlier “elusively tangible”) and silence (alchemists bow, no speeches). The final holographic mist is a non-literal answer: remembrance itself becomes the new anchor. No sermonizing; resonance is built from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at poetic distance yet stays interior-locked to Elara; no head-hop. Diction (“vaporous lanterns,” “threadbare inscription”) is elevated but consistent with alchemical-market idiom. Rhythm swells with catalogues then snaps short at release (“With a final breath…”), mirroring her tide-like intuition. Filter verbs serve voice (“she glimpsed,” “she sensed”) rather than dull immediacy. Pattern of ellipsis and fragment sentences is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, causal, and symbolic work (“In her palm rested the lighthouse lens fragment, elusively tangible…”). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay physically coherent (lanterns on silken cords, spider-web stalls). Occasional stacked modifiers (“spectral shores,” “writhing shadows”) flirt with purple but serve market hyper-reality and never clog the closure beat. Opening and closing lines are crisp, propulsive, and ear-tested.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Familiar trope—magic artifact unlocks lost histories—is re-anchored in an aerial alchemist bazaar and a translator who literally speaks erased tongues. The innovation is synthesis: liminal object + liminal profession + liminal setting = a fresh angle on colonial erasure. Risky lyric freeze-time structure is taught early and pays off when the “eternal instant” finally releases its stored histories. Without the lens-or-market combo the arc collapses—high irreplaceability.</comment>
