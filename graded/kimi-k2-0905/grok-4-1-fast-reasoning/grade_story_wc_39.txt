<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is richly lyrical and consistent; his “translator” compulsion is embodied in the jar-ritual, not told. Micro-choices (winding the box, tipping essences) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The final penny-and-tears beat shows earned cost, yet the grandmother’s instant tear feels slightly easy—more external confirmation than internal contradiction confronted. Flaws (solitude, self-doubt) compel action but stay safely sentimental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern taught early (jars, dunes, sounds) and closure lands via resonant reconfiguration—waltz reborn, lineage re-connected. Orientation anchored by 70 words; no penalty. Escalation is density/texture: each new jar layer sweetens the stakes until the market beat reweights meaning. Cost is conceptual (he gives away the sound of his own loneliness) and felt, though the grandmother’s grief payoff is off-stage of Elias’s body.</comment>

<comment>Sensory economy is superb—sound, salt, beeswax, splintered crate—each chosen to pressure the alchemy. Loft-as-body micro-setting constrains the finale: he must leave it to test redemption. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. The music box as recurring object recharges at closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—validation that his sound-translations matter—tightens when he risks the market confrontation. One meaningful deepening: sour waltz → lush waltz via his essences, foreclosing solitary perfectionism. Cost is social exposure (possible ridicule) and the literal giving away of his hoarded sounds; price is legible. Coincidence limited to storm-luck; it complicates, does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: memory as renewable currency, art as inheritance. Subtext in the grandmother’s silent tear charges the final image more than any statement. No moralizing; the penny exchange keeps meaning porous. The wistful joy is earned but flirts with sentimentality—still, ambiguity (whose memory is it now?) rescues it from trite closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-distance stays stable; perceptual signature is sound-centric, thrift-store diction, rhythmic cadence mirroring wave/metronome. No head-hopping. Syntax modulates: long breath for dawn hush, staccato for market pitch. No register drift; poetic lexicon justified by poet POV. Filter verbs minimal and voice-driven (“the air hummed”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sense, metaphor, and forward motion. Mixed-metaphor risk (“melody frail as spider silk…edges jagged like broken glass”) stays coherent within poet’s perception. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts clean. Minor purple puff (“rose-gold light,” “auroras within the glass”) but it pays off in closure glow. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—sound-alchemist poet bottling memories—is fresh yet emotionally ancient. Jars-as-archive marries scavenger lifestyle to generational bridge; not a checklist gimmick. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure; payoff legible. Could echo Jack Vance or Mieville but voice feels singular. Grandmother reprise is mild coincidence, not structural cheat.</comment>
