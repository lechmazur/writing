<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thorne’s quiet articulation and copper-veined embodiment of language-loss give him a vivid, consistent interiority; the moment he pockets the diamond his contradictory hunger for preservation vs. self-ruin is staged in scene. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is NA. The final relinquishment—pouring the last textures into the gem—carries visible cost as his veins dim, earning the closure renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because language dies → Thorne seeks echo-tunnel → uses cursed diamond → risks madness → converts bird-pattern into sonic lattice → preserves tongue. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; single transition (years blur) is legible. Closure is a Decisive Change: the tunnel now permanently contains the language; cost is the flock’s dispersal and Thorne’s spent glow—felt on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bone towers, copper-lit skin, and the echo-tunnel are tactile, selective, and constrain every move; the diamond’s flaw even refracts light like a “trapped scream,” charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as Thorne climbs, positions the gem, exits. Environment literally amplifies his voice—setting is antagonist and archive simultaneously, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save textured language—signals early; pressure tightens when only Thorne remains and the curse threatens madness. One meaningful escalation: realizing bird-flight can pattern the chaos, he risks self-annihilation to complete the transmutation; option to retreat is foreclosed once the diamond drinks the final “zhar’keth.” Cost is his dimming veins and the dispersal of the flock—visible, felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic erasure vs. embodied memory emerges through sonic imagery, not statement; the diamond’s curse-turned-archive reframes imperfection as necessity. Final image—tunnel now “guardian of the dead tongue’s living essence”—offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in starlings’ “released syllables” quietly equates freedom with linguistic dispersal, sustaining ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Thorne’s perceptual filter; syntax grows sinuous under pressure (“grit became gravelly bass tones”) then relaxes at closure. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through rhythmic, texture-laden narration that modulates with emotional intensity. Pattern-taught elision (“years blurred”) is brief, legible, paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the echo-tunnel sequence; metaphors remain concrete and internally consistent. Occasional stacked modifiers (“sinuous passage bored through the canyon's heart by forgotten waters”) flirt with density but serve atmospheric build-up and never clog the climax. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; opening and closing lines frame and recharge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “last speaker” trope into sonic alchemy: using starling murmuration as a modulation matrix for echo-etching is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable once taught. Bone towers, copper-veined skin, and cursed diamond synthesize into a singular mythic vocabulary. Risky lyric compression succeeds without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
