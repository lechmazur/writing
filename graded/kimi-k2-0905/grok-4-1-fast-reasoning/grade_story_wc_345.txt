<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The four survivors are sketched in one-line labels that never deepen; interiority is collective (“they”-mode) rather than individual. Lir’s altruism is asserted by chalk, not dramatized choice, so the ghost never feels like a character with stakes. The family’s final cohesion is declared, not tested under contradictory pressure, so the arc is smooth but not crucible-forged. Because no single psyche is followed, embodied emotion and micro-choice are diluted across the group.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bell-ringing yanks the nebula down and rewrites the orchard’s fate before our eyes, cost paid in shared labor and Lir’s dissolution. Causality is folkloric—ghost arrows → bell ritual → planetary healing—rather than psychological, but the pattern is legible and taught early. The Orientation Test is waived because the floating-arch geography is re-used to anchor the final image. One soft patch: “strangers became family” is narrated summary, not dramatized turning beat, slightly blunting the causal chain.</comment>

<comment>Thalia’s bramble-fruit, floating arches, and lavender sky are vivid, but operate more as painterly backdrop than choice-constraint until the bell is hung beneath the grandest arch. The butterfly garden watering bell itself is a perfect micro-setting that finally charges the image, earning partial 9+ credit. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the hauling scene. World-rules (nebula as renewable resource) remain consistent, though the exact physics of “butterfly wings lassoing nebula” is accepted as fairy-tale logic.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the blighted orchard—is signaled early and tightened by each chalk command. Agency is collective rather than individual, but the final bell-pull is an unmistakable narrowing of options with visible physical effort. Cost is present (bruised hands, swallowed pride, Lir’s disappearance) yet feels light because no one risks personal loss or moral trade-off. Escalation is linear, not spiral, but sufficient for lyric-fable mode; coincidence is mythic, not cheat.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of collaborative trust over isolation emerges through ritual action rather than statement, avoiding overt moralizing. The nebula-as-respite concept re-weights from distant mirage to down-payment they physically draw to earth, supplying a non-literal answer. Subtext stays in gesture—hands steadying the bell, chalk arrows on pavement—so reflection is invited, not dictated. Ambiguity lingers on Lir’s origin, keeping the parable open.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The omniscient fairy-tale voice sustains a lush, cadenced diction (“nebula of respite shimmered like a promise of balm”) that matches folklawe atmosphere. Patterned repetition of “strangers became family” and “reexamine” teaches its litany early and pays off in the bell-chime cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom remains consistent and purposeful. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily peeks above the fable diction, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense, with high information-to-word ratio; metaphors are congruent (orchard = thorned hope). One paraphrase loop: “strangers became family” is echoed four times without new angle. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beat. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively between long lyrical coils and short bell-clap fragments, supporting momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Combining alien orchard, cooperative ghost, and butterfly-powered nebula harvest yields a fresh fairy-tale synthesis rather than stock SF trope. The chalk-message mechanic is a novel oracle device that externalizes plot without exposition. Risk is moderate—lyric omniscient voice, collective protagonist—but coherence stays intact. Transformation is high: remove any core ingredient and the fable collapses.</comment>
