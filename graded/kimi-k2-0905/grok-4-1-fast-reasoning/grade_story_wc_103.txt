<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with “time’s texture” is palpable in every tactile gesture; the retrocognitive assaults are embodied, not labeled. Yet the interior contradiction—desire to grasp time vs. paralysis by memory—stops short of altering present tactics until the final beat; we see no micro-choice that risks anything before the halo fragment is pressed to the photograph. The earned cost arrives only at disintegration, so the arc feels back-loaded. Still, the quaking skin and crumbling photos make the stakes visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fragment’s demise scatters the photograph’s spectral hold, reweighting the premise that fading images equal temporal prisons. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of hyperbolic imagery and retrocognitive loops tighten until the lattice snaps. Cost is legible in the line “pixels of past evaporating,” a visible forfeiture. One minor warp: the “method” of hyperbolic rotation is asserted rather than demonstrated, but it does not break causality.</comment>

<comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but active agent: vines “breathe” in sync with Elias’s pulse, saddle-curved paths force his gait, the halo pillar positions the decisive press. Sensory hierarchy obeys his designer’s eye—sap like “veins of forgotten epochs”—and every detail bends back to the hyperbolic motif. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we never lose his body on swaying spans. Environment constrains the final choice and charges the image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—break memory’s retrocognitive choke—signals early and tightens through each resurfacing photograph. The middle beat (pressing fragment to photo) narrows options: continue looping or destroy the portal. Cost is visible—photos crumble to dust, fragment flakes into “luminous motes,” foreclosing return. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, so escalation just clears the 8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of clinging to curated memory: time’s texture can only be felt once the archive is allowed to die. Subtext lives in the shift from “fading inks pulling him backward” to “time’s texture ripple through his skin,” a reconfiguration that needs no moral. The garden’s approval whisper avoids anthropomorphic cliché by remaining unattributed. Ambiguity lingers—does he now remember her less?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual warp: hyperbolic jargon, horticultural precision, and synesthetic tremor. Syntax elongates then fractures under retrocognitive flood, mirroring the “quivering lattice.” No head-hopping; even the garden’s “whisper” is filtered through his designer’s ear. Register remains elevated yet anchored in his lifelong craft, earning high-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each figurative layer (sap-veins, pseudospherical helices) advances the central metaphor rather than decorating. Rhythm breathes—long horticultural clauses contract to “fragment hummed, then shrieked.” No scaffold loops; every sentence either advances stakes or textures time. One strained simile—“coarse as unraveling twine”—slips in the climax, keeping the score just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as emotional topology feels inevitable yet unseen: a mathematician’s grief made vegetal. Retrocognitive photographs as temporal black holes repurposes a familiar trope through tactile erosion. Risk is high—lyric horticulture plus non-Euclidean theory—but coherence never buckles. The final dispersal of light-motes reconfigures the entire metaphor, yielding fresh insight: memory must die for time to be felt.</comment>
