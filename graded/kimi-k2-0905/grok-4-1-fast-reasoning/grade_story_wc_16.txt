<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully reckless” trait is dramatized through the quill strokes and ritual breaths, but Thorne’s interiority is missing; his sudden softening feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned. Still, her micro-choices (lifting the stopper, capping the well, pocketing the droplet) chain motive to action with visible cost. The silence fracture and trust motive stay legible and personal, satisfying the single-POV default.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the symphonic burst reweights their stance, the glass ink well dims as persistent constraint, and the fingertip talisman forecloses future silence. Causal linkage holds: each promise unravels a knot → sound reveals memory → trust crystallizes. Time/place anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Archive vault, dust, brittle codices, and the glass well create tactile micro-setting that literally constrains every quill dip. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s linguist bias: phonemes, glyphs, harmonic tones over visual panorama. Spatial choreography stays clean—Thorne’s crossed arms, her fingertip talisman—tracking bodies across the pedestal. The setting’s hush and wraith threat pressure the cautious exuberance tempo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore trust before paths diverge”—is signaled early and tightened by each vow; the final symphony makes the cost audible. Escalation is accumulative: knot-by-knot loosening raises spectral murmurs and Thorne’s skepticism, not external peril. Agency remains Elara’s; no coincidence resolves. Price is felt: the ink’s glow dims and she carries a future-silence talisman.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: language as covenant, sound as fiduciary bond. The glass well’s dimming and the fingertip relic reweight the premise—trust is not spoken but inked, portable, and perilous. Subtext in Thorne’s silence and the boy-memory chord avoids moralizing. Final image offers resonant ambiguity: bonds bend, never break.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person close clings to Elara’s arcane perceptual signature—spiraling phonemes, ossified tongues, silver symphonies—without head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Not risk… restore”) and lyrical during crescendo, mirroring musical reveal. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext: Thorne’s gravelly brevity vs. her precise vow-craft. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within linguist lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long vowel-laden sentences for wonder, staccato for peril. No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphors (glyphs like brambles) stay consistent to language-forest logic. Information density high: one sentence can anchor object, emotion, and world-rule. Minor scaffold: “carefully reckless” repeated three times—acceptably thematic, not looped within adjacent lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magical ink well + extinct phonemes + fiduciary sonic magic is non-obvious and inevitable once declared. Risk—lyric overwrite—heightens stakes without clutter because pattern is taught early. Vorathil pact-tongue and boy-memory chord are specific to this world. Transformation test fails if names swapped, proving premise-locked originality.</comment>
