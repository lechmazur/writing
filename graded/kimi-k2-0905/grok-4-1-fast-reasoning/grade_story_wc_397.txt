<comment>Liora’s obsessive need to “catch” the death-sound drives every move; her loosening grip on reality is shown through tactile attachment to the parasol tip and fearless volunteering on the ice. Contradictory impulses—yearning for death’s whisper yet reviving the near-dead woman—collide on-page, forcing a micro-choice that nearly costs the sound. The snapped lace’s drift-away crystallizes her renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak; Tomas’s secondary pressure is cleanly legible.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each trawl beat thickens the sonic texture of endings until the final hush lands as Charged Poise. The parasol tip’s loss and the almost-heard sigh tighten the pattern, reweighting the stake without causal reversal. Orientation anchored by word 30; no ambiguity. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—she forsakes her old life to become witness, the sound now “etched in her bones.”</comment>

<comment>Drift-ice marina is rendered through diesel brine, groaning hulls, clinking floes—details that filter Liora’s narrowed attention under hypothermia. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting; its brass cools her palm, then snaps to mark transformation. Wind direction and ice pressure directly shape when/where bodies surface and who can lean close enough to listen. Final auroral glow recharges the same cold cathedral, locking the hush as sacred.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—hear the ending sound—is signaled in paragraph 2 and intensifies with each trawl; the near-miss with the elderly woman narrows options to pure witnessing. Agency stays active: Liora chooses to lean in, then chooses to stay beside Tomas, forfeiting further trawls. Cost is the heirloom’s loss and the lifelong burden of the sound now inside her. No coincidence resolves tension; wind only delivers when she stops chasing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening as sacred vocation emerges from ice, wind, and snapped lace; no thesis stated. Subtext in Tomas’s rasping lung and shared silence replaces exposition. Final image reweights “fold in patience” from abstract concept to lived vocation—she becomes the hush’s vessel. Ambiguity lingers: is this grace or curse? Resonance arises from concrete particulars, not moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Liora’s hypothermic perception: “gripped reality loosely,” “windborne solace,” syntactic compression mimics narcosis. Diction stays within her dazed lexicon; no elevated register drift. Perceptual signature—sound over sight, cold as moral fact—remains consistent. Dialogue sparse, natural: Tomas’s “Endings don’t rush here” carries subtext of mutual suicide pact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; opening anchors voice and stake, final line resolves by image. No paraphrase loops; “windborne solace” recurs with reweighted meaning, not redundancy. Metaphors (lace like forgotten promises, floes like chimes) stay coherent, never mixed. High density: one sentence often advances atmosphere + interiority + plot. Only micro-slip: “changed” used twice in first/last paras—intentional echo, not artifact.</comment>

<comment>“Euthanasia tourist” reframed as acoustic pilgrim; trawl net as stethoscope—fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Storm-shattered ice shelf as hospice upends disaster trope. Risk of loose-reality narration paid off in credible perceptual drift without losing reader. Specificity of Victorian lace tip in polar wasteland creates indelible image; removal would collapse transformation metaphor.</comment>
