<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is clear and intensifies through the decoded letter, but interiority slips into grand abstract labels (“dappled resolve,” “encrypted compassion”) rather than embodied contradiction. The trembling moment is visceral, yet the emotional calculus flattens into tidy communal harmony immediately after. A visible cost is present—ancestral guilt, abandoned dam plan—but the beat is summarized, not dramatized, softening the renunciation’s bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chain becomes a bridge, the volcano breathes unflooded, and Elias accepts perpetual vigilance. Causal linkage holds: adhesive analysis → decoded plea → redesigned sluices. Accumulation of “breathing” cadence tightens stakes. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation is taught early and repaid in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Volcano-amphitheater breathes, steams, and guides hydraulic design; the antique chain is handled, measured, re-purposed on-page. Sensory hierarchy is machinist-biased: runes, brass links, mineral solvent. Spatial choreography is clean across tiers and vents. The setting charges the final image—waters pulse through stone lungs—passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—flood control vs. sacred relic—tightens when tremors threaten aquifers; one decisive deepening occurs at the decoded parchment. Escalation is accumulative: each volcanic exhale layers urgency. Cost is legible: ancestral pact nearly drowned the site. Agency is Elias’s redesign, but the clans’ instant consensus softens the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: engineering art can serve rather than suppress natural memory. Subtext lives in the chain’s repurposing and the volcano’s sigh. Final image—chain coiled, waters redirected—reweights progress as caretaking. No sermonizing; resonance is visual, understated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is machinist-tinged: brass links, solvent brew, hydraulic valves. Rhythm mimics volcanic inhalations, taught early and held to final sentence. Diction is consistent, slightly elevated but within surveyor- engineer lexicon. No dialogue, so voice test is prose-only; it passes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density; sentences layer action, perception, and metaphor without scaffold. Occasional ornamental stacking (“dappled resolve,” “slyly heartfelt”) nudges toward purple but stays readable. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Final line is crisp, image-driven, earns its cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hydraulic engineering + geologic sacred + cryptic ancestral plea. Volcano-as-organ breathes new life into eco-engineering trope. The encrypted-compassion concept is novel, though the adhesive-cipher mechanics feel hand-wavy. Risk is moderate; reward is a quietly resonant reconciliation rather than cataclysm.</comment>
