<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s isolation and monomania are vivid, but his interior contradiction— thrill at power versus fear of being consumed—arrives as abstract label (“he wondered if the dawn would blind or burn”) rather than an embodied, stake-shifting choice on the page. The beat where Mira sabotages and is instantly re-flipped by shadows is the sole moment that exposes cost to Elias, yet his reaction is summarized, not dramatized, so the renunciation/embrace feels only half-earned. Still, his perceptual lens (scavenged radios, storm-lit cobalt) is consistent and character-specific, keeping the score in high-mid band. Tightening the final cost into a visible micro-choice would push it past 8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is present: a Conceptual Repricing—Elias broadcasts the ultimate verse while shadows recede, revealing a bruised horizon and a unified flock—so “before” (isolated crackpot) / “after” (acclaimed prophet) is legible with social cost implied. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm imagery and radio fragments intensify pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (stormlit observatory above clouds). The weak link is motivation-to-cost on the final beat: the story tells us “he wondered” about devourer/be devoured, but offers no on-page constraint or price at that precise moment, keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<comment>The cobalt portico functions as micro-setting: its glass panes refract lightning, guide his graffiti of verses, and ultimately crown him in silhouette—charging the final image. Storm altitude and rust-flaking mechanics are filtered through Elias’s scavenger eye, giving tactile specificity. Spatial logic is clean: followers clamber up exterior spires to reach the observatory. Environmental detail evolves with events (frequencies fracture the glass, lightning etches runes), satisfying the 9+ gate that setting constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—control of allegiance via radio prophecy—signals early and tightens when Mira’s sabotage fractures the broadcast, forcing Elias to rely on shadows’ direct intervention; this narrows his moral option space. Cost accumulates under Accumulative lens: each lyrical fragment adds density until the horizon reveal reweights the stake. Visible price (loss of radio, dependence on capricious shadows) is legible, though personal bodily or emotional toll is only hinted. Sufficient for high band, but not the razor-edge of 8.8+ where that cost would need to scar Elias on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of power versus parasitism emerges organically from imagery (shadows “giggling with whimsical malice”) and the final image of a prophet crowned by light that may “blind or burn,” avoiding explicit moral. Recurrent “cobalt” and “variant allegiance” accumulate new meaning when the same glass that framed his solitude now frames his ascendancy. Subtext in follower kneeling contrasts with earlier isolation, creating resonance without statement. The ambiguity is purposeful, but a shade more concrete consequence for Elias would nudge it to 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature—“stormlit,” “gritty lullaby,” “illicit hunger”—syntax grows clipped under intensity. No head-hopping; Mira’s betrayal is read only through Elias’s glimpse of “eyes flickering.” Patterned lyric elision (“days blurred into weeks”) is taught early and paid off in final cadence. Voice modulation between whimsical grandeur and scavenger grit is consistent, earning 9-territory; minor 0.3 reserve because the closing line’s pyre/dawn couplet edges toward aphorism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is strong; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with escalation. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—storm and radio metaphors interweave without mixed-logic violations. A few scaffold stems (“frequencies that danced like fireflies in a gale…allegiances that twisted like storm winds”) create template echo; not severe enough to obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb clusters. Copy is clean; tightening two adjacent similes would lift it to 8.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing pirate-radio mysticism with cloud-city prophet myth feels fresh; the variant-allegiance mechanic turns familiar rebellion trope into fluid, almost quantum loyalties. Specificity of “cobalt glass portico” and scavenged drone guts anchors the fantastical frame. Risk in lyric compression pays off by forcing reader to assemble causality from imagistic shards. Not quite 8.8 because core beats (sabotage→reversal) follow conventional pattern, but the atmospheric synthesis is memorable.</comment>
