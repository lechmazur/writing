<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias’s spiritual ache and trembling vulnerability are embodied through ritual handling of the lantern glass; micro-choice to press forehead to orb externalizes interior cost. Still, his janitorial identity remains symbolically ornamental—no on-page professional constraint shapes tactics. Earned stasis feels slightly undercosted: solitude is confirmed but prior abandonment is summarized, not dramatized, softening the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Elias’s tear-streak reconfigures strength-through-vulnerability with felt cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds—star-tracings layer meaning until the final image crystallizes. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives within 120 words; no penalty applied. One minor causality gap: lantern glass is introduced as relic, yet its sudden use requires no discovery beat, shaving 0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frost-etched domes, stardust trails, and the orb’s amber pulse ground every beat in tactile specificity. Micro-setting (glass sphere) constrains the final stance—forehead contact becomes pivot of revelation. Spatial choreography is clean across the dome sweep. One 9-gate tick missed: environment never endangers or depletes resources, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—tightens through star-empathy exercise; each traced meteor forecloses denial of fragility. Pressure accumulates by lyrical density, not external jeopardy. Cadence shift at colossal final star deepens cost. No concrete price (fatigue, glass fracture, station risk) materializes, holding score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges via star-surrender parallels without didactic intrusion. Final image reframes prior abandonment as luminous trajectory, supplying resonant non-literal answer. One near-trope echo: cosmic janitor trope feels familiar, muting full freshness. Otherwise subtext operates in silent tears and glass-veined light, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric third-person glides in tight psychic distance; diction (“primal elegance,” “stellar fury”) stays within Elias’s poetic lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with meteor cadence; no filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing brushes register ceiling but remains consistent. Voice distinctiveness peaks at tear-comet line, securing 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Metaphors are lush yet coherent—mixed stacks absent. Two adjacent near-repeats (“flourishing stillness” concept rephrased within 30 words) incur −0.3 loop penalty. Otherwise sentences propel with varied openings and strong verbs. Closing beat stays clear of figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cosmic-janitor trope gains fresh traction by pairing menial labor with spiritual cosmology; lantern-glass lens reframes meteor mapping into elegy. Stillness-as-strength thesis is non-obvious synthesis. A tighter operational constraint (glass could shatter, station lose power) would have pushed risk further. Within-band originality solid, not groundbreaking.</comment>
