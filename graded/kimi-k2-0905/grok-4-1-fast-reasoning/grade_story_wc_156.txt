<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “methodically playful” trait is shown through paint-chip and coin-tilt micro-choices that visibly cost him control; Lena’s skeptic-armor cracks via embodied pulse-sync rather than label-speak. The final alliance is earned because every coin-reflection beat tightens her stance. Interiority stays concrete, though the triple “awakening” exposition slightly over-articulates what the body has already shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: coin-hum ➔ fractal sound ➔ Lena’s pulse shift is legible and irreversible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her softened gaze forecloses lifelong debunking with visible cost (certainty surrendered). One scaffold loop (“methodically playful” repeated three times) nicks propulsion but does not break linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Waveform fern and silver-grooved nickel act as micro-setting that literally bend sound and choice; without them the climax cannot occur. Sensory selection stays filtered through Elias’s restorer eye—he notices flaking pigment before leaf color. Spatial choreography is clean: coin, fern, woman, wall track across the beat without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Lena’s certainty vs. wonder—tightens when the nickel’s reflection removes her option to dismiss. Agency is hers: she stays, steps closer, forfeits prior identity. Cost is felt (her gasp, softened eyes) though not as sharp as the garden’s full sonic price could have shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of epistemic stance rather than exposition: debunker becomes apprentice. The hobo nickel’s labyrinth reweights from con-artist symbol to gateway of legitimate mystery. Final image (“murals brighter for the exchange”) offers quiet CR without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature (“paint breathes anew”). Distinctive synesthetic diction—“sonic sculptures,” “overripe echoes”—is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; Lena’s interiority is inferred through embodiment, not ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ear-test rhythm varies: long breathy sentences for dilation, staccato noun phrases for coin-flash. One paraphrase loop (“methodically playful” ×3) and a single mixed metaphor (“glass under sonic pressure”) dull edge but occur before climax; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden as restorative crucible feels fresh; hobo nickel acoustics turn a street-con object into epistemic tool. Risk—lyric dilation inside a single pause—pays off because garden rules are taught early and the final alliance is irreversible. Could tip toward gimmick if coin physics were unexplained, but grooved-light pattern grounds it.</comment>
