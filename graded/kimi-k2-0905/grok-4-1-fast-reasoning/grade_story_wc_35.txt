<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elaris’s guilt-caravan backstory is anchored in sensory memory-flash, his tremoring hands over the sill externalize the internal cost, and the final self-absolution is earned by the iterative tasting-heating-absorption ritual; the “sandpaper” metaphor, however, is reiterated rather than deepened under pressure, keeping the flaw from compounding but preventing the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The causal lens holds: dream-call → rain-pool → dig → pavilion → absorb → dawn-release, each beat a because/therefore linkage that tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion thaws in imperceptible drips, his step lightens, the cost (caravan forgiveness) is felt. One minor scuff: the coral’s rule (amplifies remorse) is revealed in the same beat it is solved, a late-rule hitch that nicks perfection but does not break the chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The rain-slicked mud, “metallic tang,” and ice-veined coral walls are filtrated through Elaris’s synesthetic palate, guiding his shovel and later his flame; the desert-after-rain micro-setting literally softens the sand so the stairwell can yield—environment as enabling constraint. The final image of dawn on wet walls reprises the metallic taste now cleansed, recharging the opening anchor with earned lightness. This meets the 9-gate test: setting charges the final image while remaining causally active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—erase his own remorse via culinary alchemy—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates through each tidal-pool absorption that visibly costs breath, fog, and chest-lead. Agency is continuous: sample → heat → inhale → soften grief-of-others → lighten self. The last pool emptied = live option foreclosed; price is cumulative bodily toll and the pavilion’s thaw—cost legible on page. Escalation is steady but single-thread; no secondary reversal keeps it just sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as remorse is not erased but transmuted—salt-cured into quiet acceptance—through communal ingestion, an insight grown from iterated tasting rather than stated. The coral lattice as emotional freezer offers fresh metaphor; the final dawn-light on polished memory avoids moralizing, achieving resonance. Minor abstraction in “lessons learned” softens edge, holding it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person omni stays tight to Elaris’s synesthetic lens: “tasting the air’s metallic tang,” “flavors erupted: a mother’s grief over lost children.” Rhythmic compression under stress—“Pool by pool, he progressed”—mirrors iterative absorption. No head-hop; diction remains culinary-desert fused. One template cadence in “coral branches arched overhead, encasing ice that gleamed…” slightly flattens music, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description + causality: “rain-softened dunes yielding to a concealed stairwell” moves both setting and plot. Metaphors (“patterns like veins of forgotten seas”) stay precise; no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb clusters or synonym loops. Final third is clean; closure image (“dawn breaking over Kharidun, his steps lighter”) is uncluttered, propulsive, ear-tested. A single over-adorned “captured moonlight” is hairline, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The memory-tasting chef uncovering a subterranean coral freezer for frozen regrets is a bold, non-obvious synthesis; the culinary alchemy of liquefying remorse into vaporized grace transforms the trope of magical grief. Specificity—neural-path tidal pools, salt-cured guilt—anchors freshness. Without these exact elements the plot and closure collapse, satisfying transformation test. Risk earns +0.2 within band.</comment>
