<comment>Elias’s puzzle-designer mind is vividly drawn; his perceptual filter (“orthogonal approaches”) is character-specific and drives every beat. Interiority stays concrete—he smells, touches, maps—but never tips into diagnostic self-talk. The final vow feels earned because the seed-mapping and UV-ink beats dramatize his need to protect creative space. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; he pivots intellectually, never emotionally torn, so the “cost” is conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: seed arrival → Braille-map suspicion → UV-ink reveal → legal armour grant. Each pivot is logically triggered by tactile discovery, not author sleight. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the seed becomes “his finest room yet,” reweighting threat into opportunity with visible gain (flash-drive files). Minor slack: the “Genoa postmark yet no customs stamp” clue is dropped but never causally resolved, leaving a tiny teleporting-info burr.</comment>

<comment>Willow-and-brook micro-setting is filtered through puzzle-designer eyes: seed = map overlay, soil = volcanic ink, petrichor = solvent cue. Every environmental detail is recruited into Elias’s decoding loop, so place actively constrains tactics rather than decorating. Night chill, damp stone, boot-level water all double as sensory cipher surface. Only 120-word orientation anchor is met; spatial choreography stays clean.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save venue from paving—signalled early and tightened when seed-map implies surveillance. One meaningful turn: UV ink exposes untouchable covenant, flipping sabotage into sponsorship. Cost is present but light: a conceptual price (future obligation to build corpse-flower room) rather than tangible loss. Escalation stays causal-under-inference; no coincidence rescues.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: innovation as biosensor, rot-as-rebirth, encryption via nature. No thematic bumper-stickers; the corpse-flower’s stench-to-bloom arc reconfigures without moralizing. Final image—sprouting leaf—offers quiet CR that reweights “destruction” into genesis. Ambiguity lingers: ally remains unnamed, keeping theme open rather than closed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lean, tactile, synesthetic: “petrichor… evoking puzzle solvents.” Syntax mirrors puzzle-box mind—short clauses that pivot like combination locks. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within inventor lexicon. Rhythmic control peaks at closure: “Innovation’s silence roared triumphant” compresses oxymoron into charged poise without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often triple-jobs (anchors setting, advances clue, textures mood). Metaphors stay physically coherent; “storm-born silence” sets tone without mixed vehicle. One scaffold tic—“orthogonal approach” counted four times—teaches pattern early so repetition reads deliberate, not loop. No artifacts touch closure; final line is taut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: escape-room logic + botanical cipher + postal forensics in 750 words. Corpse-flower seed as USB-decode device is non-obvious yet prefigured by scent-ink room history. Risk—lyric elliptical structure—pays off in Charged Poise ending. Loses top decimal because UV-ink trick is minor variant of standard spy reveal, not full paradigm shift.</comment>
