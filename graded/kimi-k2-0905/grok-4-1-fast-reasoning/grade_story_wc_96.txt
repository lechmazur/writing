<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s monthly “molt” gives a vivid, embodied contradiction—poet vs. architect—that drives every on-page choice; the moment he shelves Rilke beside Whitman while ash drifts off his coat shows interiority in action. Mira’s first whispered question instantly pressures his reflexive reinvention, turning the library into a crucible where status shifts (ex-librarian vs. ex-street poet) are legible in gesture and book-handling. The friendship’s cost is felt when next-month’s self already “looms,” implying future loss, but the beat where he tucks “blooming resistance” into the tin could use one more micro-choice that actually hurts. Overall, motives escalate cleanly and personalities stay particular, yet the arc leans on summary toward the end rather than a final embodied decision that seals the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlight shards through eaves → tin of seeds → garden of words: causal chain tightens under an Accumulative/Textural lens, each shard adding density until sprouts punch concrete. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the single time-skip (night-to-dawn) is sign-posted with “Hours bled.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tin now holds maps, the “sky” is reclaimed, and prisoners read in flower-light—undeniable social cost even if emotional cost is oblique. One minor slack: the riot threat stays off-stage; if guards had once kicked over a half-built shelf, the escalation would feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted-eaves/“broken teeth” and star-poked vault set an immediate tactile ceiling; later, mildewed pages and “soil pilfered from the exercise pen” keep the world practical. The library itself acts as micro-setting—every shove of a book-stack rewrites floor space and possible barricades—so environment directly shapes tactics. Recurring moonlight fractures act as lantern and clock, charging the final image of flowers “defiant against frost.” Detail never stalls plot; it is discovered through stacking, prying, sowing—lived-in specificity that meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—poet must turn prison entropy into generative beauty—faces a credible loss: future personality “looms,” implying the friendship may not survive the next molt. Mid-scene deepening occurs when seeds convert abstract hope into illegal action; options narrow because discovery = seg box. Price is visible (patched roof, dented mugs, frost-bitten sprouts) and alters later tactics (tin becomes map cache). One tightening short of 8.8: a single guard interaction—torch beam across frost-blooms—would have crystallized jeopardy on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme blooms wordlessly: anarchic decay → ordered shelves → illicit garden; no character lectures us on “resistance.” The tin’s false bottom migrating from seeds to maps enacts the conceptual re-pricing; meaning, not morals, is reweighted. Final line “we rebuild the sky” risks echo but earns resonance because it is etched onto the very object that once held seeds—an image, not a sermon. Ambiguity remains—will the next molt sunder the poets?—inviting reflection beyond the plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Compressed lyric diction (“luminous fracture of gravel and melody”) stays inside a poet-narrator’s lexicon; syntax swells and contracts with moonlight phases. No head-hops; POV keeps to Elias’s perceptual filter—Mira is observed externally until dialogue allows her glass-sharp eyes to reflect stars. Rhythmic control peaks at “patting soil pilfered from the exercise pen,” where monosyllables mimic stealth. Minor tic: “molting” metaphor repeats but its pattern is taught early and pays off, so the echo reads intentional, not monotonous.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence openings vary; high-pressure beats drop modifiers for punch: “Guards passed indifferently.” No mixed metaphors; moonlight stays consistently shard/lantern without violating physics. Information density strong—one line can layer ash-dust, book title, and political back-story. Two adjacent “bloom/blooming” uses are near-looped but spaced enough to avoid scaffold penalty; they actually escalate motif, not redundancy. Read-aloud cadence propels without purple drift; final line lands clean, recharging “sky” motif introduced in title-line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: prison-library-as-greenhouse merges carceral futility with seed-bank futurity; monthly personality molts give an emergent, non-contrived structure. Specifics feel inevitable—Rilke/Whitman shelf-bridge, tin-maps, frost-petals—none swap-able with generic symbols. Stakes hinge on sub-rosa literacy, not typical escape tunnels. Risk in lyrical compression pays off: moonlit “luminous fracture” becomes literal when wall cracks sprout flowers, transforming lyric into lived resistance. Near-echo of “From anarchy's bloom” to classic protest poems is acknowledged but re-coded through tactile object (tin lid), satisfying proximity test.</comment>
