<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elar’s interiority is vivid—grief as luminous agony, the need to fold that grief into cranes—but the “crafty” trait is asserted more than enacted; we see artisan precision yet little cunning. His contradictory impulses (rise to the isle / fall into abyss) are felt, and the final renunciation of weight earns its cost. Still, the absence of any second character mutes status dynamics and secondary pressure, keeping this just shy of 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cranes burst skyward, literally converting luminous torment into harmless sparkles—an undeniable before/after image that reweights grief itself. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural: each added crane intensifies density until the final release. Causality is lyric but coherent; every fold is a because/therefore of grief’s transmutation. Cost is visible in the emptied basilica glow and Elar’s lighter stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating island, glass basilica, dream-quartz veins, and origami cranes are never mere postcards: the helix staircase physically embodies descend-while-ascending, the lantern facets constrain how dream-light fractures, and the tea-mist anchors time. Spatial choreography is flawless across the basilica’s nave and vented skylight. Environment directly shapes tactics—gems harvested from misty roots, glass walls amplifying projection—charging the final aerial release. Micro-setting (the lantern’s captured heartbeats) functions as pivot-object, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute grief or be consumed by it—tightens through each polish-stroke and fold; every crane is a visible price paid. No external antagonist needed: pressure is internal, coherent, and escalates as the lantern’s glow grows unbearable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the first crane seals a shard of torment, foreclosing the option to stay paralyzed. Cost legibility peaks when the final crane lifts his shadow’s outline, leaving Elar lighter—stakes satisfied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief is not erased but folded into something that can fly. The cranes’ final scatter reprises Lira’s paper art, reweighting loss as fragile luminescence—an answer delivered in image, not moral. Subtext resides in silence after the glass stops humming: acceptance is the space left behind. No platitudes, only the particularity of one man’s lantern-lit meditation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, ornate, yet internally consistent—“luminous torment,” “radiant agony”—taught by first paragraph and paid off in the sparkle swarm. Syntax lengthens under grief-load, then shortens at each crisp crease, mirroring emotional compression. No head-hops; perceptual signature is Elar’s artisan-eye noticing facets, veins, dew. Register stays elevated but plausible for a crafter who speaks in light.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, cadenced, yet propulsive; sentences vary from incense-long to crease-short. Figurative density is high but patterned—light, paper, flight—never muddled; no mixed metaphors. Information density strong: each sentence advances image, memory, or action. Minor scaffold: one “luminous” appears three times in 30 lines; does not dull closure, but keeps this from 9-band apex.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of dream-recording lanterns + origami grief-folding feels inevitable yet fresh; no genre template matches this precise alchemy. Risky lyric escalation could have collapsed into purple haze, instead crystallizes into aerial release. Specificities—tea-essence whetstones, paradoxical helix staircase—are irreplaceable; swap any part and the whole fractures. Emotional specificity transcends gimmick: the cranes are not symbols but working artifacts of mourning.</comment>
