<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven hunt through the archive is visceral; the bottle-clutch and lace-cuff singe register embodied cost. The apology is not a speech but a kneeling inhale of ozone and fruit-rot—perfectly character-specific. No interior therapy-speak; her self-loathing is shown via synesthesia of scent and spark. The fractured Theo-mosaic nods forgiveness, yet the powdering glass in her fist forecloses any tidy absolution—earned stasis with splinter evidence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bottle’s dissolution reconfigures both their shared past and her future column in one crackling image. Causal lens holds throughout—because she uncorks, therefore currents arc, therefore Theo coalesces enough to nod. Cost is visible—shattered glass, scorched paper, perfume lung-burn—paid on the final line. No orientation debt; archive/orchard anchors arrive by line 5 and tighten, not slacken, toward the saws’ growl.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The player-piano’s copper guts and the wax-sealed bottle function as micro-setting that literally conducts the haunting; removing either breaks the reconnection physics. Dust-motes as “lost souls” is baldly symbolic, but the image is immediately re-filtered through Elara’s professional gaze, saving it from cliché. Orchard countdown outside the fence keeps spatial choreography legible and time-tracked. Archive air is tasted as much as seen—myrrh-static grit on teeth—so sensory hierarchy obeys crisis-narrowed perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology before chainsaw dawn—signals in para 1 and tightens each beat: every spark risks archival fire, every second risks Theo’s dispersion. Micro-turn at bottle uncork: static jumps from prop to piano, shifting her tactic from plea to conduit. Cost is dramatized—burned lace, powdered glass, scored yellowing folios—altering her next column’s raw material. Escalation is situational-pressure rather than causal twist, but coherent under that lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from scent-as-time, electricity-as-memory—no abstract thesis stated. Final image of “apology’s perfume lingers” reweights the gritty archive into fleeting grace without moralizing. Metaphor-advice motif loops back when Theo echoes her own poetic idiom, showing mutual contamination rather than redemption. The orchard’s imminent felling externalizes irrevocable loss, letting theme live in specific ecological murder rather than generic regret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice owns a gossip-columnist’s perceptual signature: every noun is half-snark, half-reverence—“spectral tea,” “poltergeist paramours.” Syntax crackles like the piano wiring—comma splices carry charge, then snap to em-dash fragments under spark contact. No head-hop; Theo’s dialogue is reported as trembling harmonics she interprets, keeping focalization clean. Diction stays within her tabloid lexicon even at peak stress—“grit-glazed grace” is flashy yet plausible for a woman who types hauntings for coin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with tension—long perfume exhale, then staccato static bursts. No template cadence; sentence openings vary from participial to noun-fragment to spondaic command. Information density high: one sentence can deliver scent chemistry, memory punch, and foreshadow conductor piano. Minor mixed metaphor—“currents to carry scents across chasms”—survives because it’s diegetically attributed to Theo’s youthful woo, not authorial slippage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gossip columnist + archival ectoplasmic engineering = genre-cross not seen before. Risk of static-haunting is taken early and paid at closure, not gimmick. Specific detail—copper-vein piano, bergamot-myrrh lightning—anchors the conceit in tactile reality. Orchard demolition as external ticking clock repurposes ecological grief into intimate reconciliation, achieving universal through singular.</comment>
