<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—monk-collector vs. healer—is shown through tactile micro-choices (mounting the tear, syncing breath), not labels. Mira remains an archetypal wounded conduit; her only autonomous beat is the final whisper, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin. Elias’s shift from hoarding to carrying love is legible, but the cost is poetic rather than embodied—no forfeiture of the camera, tear, or identity. Still, the camera-wound-breath triad keeps motives coherent across beats.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unused love is re-priced from hidden treasure to circulating breath, with conceptual cost—Elias forfeits the safety of “storage.” Causal chain holds: sparks → locate Mira → camera/tear reveal blockage → shared breath dissolves it. One soft spot: Mira’s wound recovery is near-miracuous; the text signals no altered-world rules, so credibility wobbles. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; lens stays situational-poetic throughout.</comment>

<comment>The viaduct’s blooming iron and drifting petals are more than postcard—they funnel spatial choice (where to plant the camera), supply the violet halo that reframes Mira’s image, and mirror the “blooming” of stored love. Fog acts as exposure filter for the camera, forcing longer breath-timing; environment literally shapes method. Micro-setting (tear, camera box, rusted beam) doubles as tool and altar, constraining every tactical placement. This tactile reciprocity lifts the description above atmosphere into necessity.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—liberate stored love—tightens when the camera projection reveals Mira’s knotted reservoir; that visualization forecloses Elias’s solitary treasure-hunt and forces shared breath as the only tactic. Escalation is single but meaningful: the knot dissolves on-screen, color returns to her skin, love starts moving. Cost is conceptual (love is now expended, not hoarded) rather than physical loss; still legible under poetic lens. No reversal or foil, yet the deepening re-configures both quests into one live circuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: love kept static becomes wounds; love exhaled becomes healing—never stated, only demonstrated through the projection’s before/after. Subtext lives in the inverted camera image: what was private/internal must be externalized, inverted, shared. Final image of Elias packing the camera while carrying “love freely” crystallizes the re-pricing without moralizing. Some symbolic convenience in wisteria petals “blooming” exactly as Mira’s chest blooms, but the echo feels earned by prior visual anchoring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at mid-psychic distance, tightening to body-sync breath level during healing—clean control. Diction stays within Elias’s artisan-monk register: “spiritually curious,” “pinhole,” “pearlescent,” never academic. Rhythm lengthens during breathing instruction, then shortens for packing exit—purposeful modulation. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but perceptual signature (seeing sparks, reading wounds as light-blockage) remains character-specific and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; only two paraphrase loops (“foggy lucidity”-adjacent phrases) trip the ear. Metaphors stay coherent—camera, breath, bloom all share translucence/flow logic. No filter-verb stacks; sentences open with concrete noun or motion verb. One mixed vehicle: “bottled within” immediately followed by “knotted reservoir” slightly jars containment metaphors, but occurs mid-scene, not at closure. Otherwise high density, variation, and rhythm control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Camera obscura as healing interface, past-life monk turned spark-pilgrim, love-as-photon: synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable. Trope of mystical gem pays off when tear becomes literal aperture, not talisman. Risk of preciousness is skirted by mechanical specificity—mounting, projection, breath count. Emotional core (healing others by expending inner reserve) escapes generic template because method is irreducibly visual and procedural. Could swap wisteria for any vine, so slight deduction; still, conceptual marriage of optics and compassion is memorably non-obvious.</comment>
