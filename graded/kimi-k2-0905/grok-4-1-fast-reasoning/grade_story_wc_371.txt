<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s quiet, observant guilt and micro-rituals (breaking the relic-loaf, nettle-pour) are embodied and specific; the moment he offers bread to Mira without speech crystallizes contradictory regret and hope. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but the late backstory dump (“Their parents had run that bakery…”) tells summary lore that should have been dramatized pressure earlier. Forgiveness lands as credible Earned Stasis because prior avoidance is visible in every careful footstep; still, the single beat of reconciliation feels slightly rushed for 725 words, nudging the score down from 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens through sensory returns (birds gone → bread scent → frost silver) rather than causal reversals; closure is a Charged Poise where shared bread reconfigures sibling distance. Orientation crisp by 40 words; spatial choreography across courtyard/tea-house retains legibility. One minor causality fuzz: how Elias kept a loaf oven-fresh for “months” is hand-waved, but it is a delivered miracle, not a plot cheat, so the closure cost holds. Final image of winter-pruned vine crystallizes new cooperation; no soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ivy-choked palace, solar brazier hiss, and frost-rimmed leaves filter every beat; the secret tea house itself constrains the reunion—only one entrance, shared steam veil forces face-to-face honesty. Tool-as-setting (chipped pot, scarred table) is handled, not catalogued. No headcount or geography confusion; weather shifts from brittle dusk to night exactly as the bread disappears, guiding emotional temperature. Slight over-reliance on visual vs. other senses, but selective detail keeps momentum; qualifies for 9-band gate under micro-setting rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can sibling complicity in creeping loss be redeemed? Escalation is textural: each bite of dwindling bread heightens guilt, narrowing options to confession or permanent rift. Agency sits in Elias’s decision to share the last relic—an active surrender of exclusive remembrance. Cost is the hollowing of the loaf itself and the admission of inaction; no external coincidence rescues them. Tension plateaus rather than spikes, keeping it from 8.8+, but the tightening is honest under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of sacred ordinariness emerges through composted royal ruins and reclaimed bakery relic; no character states the thesis aloud. Subtext in Mira chewing “thoughtfully” while tracing table-knots conveys shared childhood pattern without exposition. Final image reweights weeds as potential, not decay—conceptual repricing achieved. Micro-turn from hoarding to sharing bread reframes guilt into mutual stewardship. Avoids sermon yet risks symbolic convenience of “last loaf”; still, the specificity of its scent anchors abstraction, satisfying 9-band threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Elias’s heuristic gentleness: syntax slows, verbs (“threaded,” “unwrapping”) echo cautious movement. Free-indirect slips into Mira only after she enters, flagged by exterior cue (“voice roughened”), maintaining distance control. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Mira’s city-wind rasp vs. Elias’s soft replies. No head-hopping; POV modesty observed—narrator never claims knowledge of Mira’s interior until her spoken confession. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for foraged calm, fragment (“Footsteps crunched—”) for disruption. Clean 9-band voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Varied cadence avoids template; sentence openings rotate across participial, prepositional, tactile. High density: single sentence can layer scent-memory, body-motion, and world-state (“Its scent rose, earthy and nostalgic…”). One paraphrase loop detected: “normalized into oblivion” echoes earlier “normalized its end”—minor, but knocks 0.2. Mixed metaphors absent; frost “etching the leaves silver” stays physical. No filter-verb clusters. Copy-clean except one comma splice after board-up list. Overall propulsion intact; closure image unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of guerrilla gardening with sibling grief recovery feels non-obvious; palace-as-planterbox reconfigures ruin porn into quiet resilience. Vanishing-bakery-as-slow-apocalypse is topical yet grounded in single family’s dough. Specific detail (“solar-heated brazier,” “nettle tea”) prevents metaphorical swirl from floating free. Risk: lyric repetition of “creeping normality” could read as prompt echo, but phrase is earned by relentless minor losses on-page. Transformation test passed—plot dissolves if replaced with generic ruin. Fresh yet inevitable.</comment>
