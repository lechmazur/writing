<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s brightly-attentive trait is shown driving the anomaly hunt, but her interiority stays corporate-bland (“heart pounding in the sterile hum”) and the lie arrives as a single beat without prior contradictory impulse; cost is declared rather than dramatized in body or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“nothing truly vanished”—with felt cost (job forfeiture) and the 2519 pulse reweights the premise; causal chain is crisp until the corporate-purge alarm, which appears as coincidence rather than therefore linkage, slightly denting lens purity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “digital mausoleum” cubicle and the mission-patch texture function as micro-settings that constrain access and later charge the final image; spatial anchor arrives by ~100 words, though wider orbital geography is only named, not sensed.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—where do deleted files go?—tightens when the forged audit request forecloses back-out option; escalation is steady under an Accumulative lens as 2519 traces densify, but price is narrated (“cost her job”) rather than shown in a beat that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of persistence beneath erasure emerges through the repeating 2519 pattern and patch image; final unsung song offers resonant non-verbal answer, avoiding overt moralizing, though the “nothing truly vanished” line flirts with thesis restatement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Corporate-archive diction is consistent and selective (“sensed absence,” “corporate purgatory”) with syntactic compression under pressure; no dialogue to test, but perceptual signature stays sharp—Elara notices pixel glitches and thread texture first.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly lean, but minor scaffold loops (“echo of forgotten songs” used twice) and one mixed metaphor (“glitch in the matrix of loss”) dull the final third; high info density elsewhere and strong open/close cadence keep artifact damage contained.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing cold-case space tragedy with social-network afterlife is fresh; 2519 as breadcrumb and consciousness-backup twist feels inevitable in hindsight; risk in compressed lyric structure pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
