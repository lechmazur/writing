<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thorne’s interiority is vivid—his obsession with “small gestures” is embodied in the word-walk ritual—but the penumbra’s severance feels more metaphysical than earned; no prior flaw or cost links the shadow to his archival drive, so the final renunciation registers as conceptual rather than painful.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each spelled word thickens the gallery’s absent light and tightens the noose on the penumbra; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—chess pieces now cast the shadow he renounced, a visible cost that reweights his archive and the emptied board.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Whispering gallery” and “luminous absence” are never mere décor; the curved acoustics physically amplify his word-walk and the missing pawns echo the emptied streets, so the setting’s geometry and vacancy actively constrain tactics and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sever the penumbra to chronicle the overlooked—tightens once: the spelled words progressively pin the shadow until it is absorbed by the chessmen; the cost is conceptual but legible (he trades his own partial self for archival purity), satisfying the single deepening required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: history’s value lies not in crowns but in the chamberlain’s tilt, the guard’s flicker; the final image reframes those micro-gestures as the true pieces on the board, an oblique answer that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is dense, cadenced, and consistent—“benevolently ruthless purpose,” “nomadic penumbra”—with metaphoric diction that never drifts into abstraction; the lyric register is taught early and paid off in the final absorption of the shadow, no head-hopping or register slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates with the ritual pacing; occasional stacked modifiers (“luminous absence bathed the curved dome in a glow that revealed nothing”) flirt with excess but never stall propulsion; one paraphrase-loop instance (“whispers roared silently, a luminous gale of absence”) keeps the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crisis-actor-turned-survivor who becomes historian of shrugs and finger-twitches, using a pawnless board to trap his own penumbra, feels non-obvious and inevitable; the synthesis of chess, architectural acoustics, and micro-gesture archive is fresh without gimmickry.</comment>
