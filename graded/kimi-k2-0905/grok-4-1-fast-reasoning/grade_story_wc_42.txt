<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“luminous ache,” “heart pounding,” “sage intuition flaring”), not labelling. His tuning of the chronometer grows from decades-old tool empathy and loss of apprentices, giving the final micro-choices a felt cost. Internal contradiction is dramatized: reverence for mechanical eternity vs hunger for ephemeral starlight. The closure renunciation (leaf cradled, clock breathing with fragility) is earned and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning hand’s surrender to lunar/leaf cadence reweights the meaning of escape velocity for both man and dome; cost is the irreversible mingling of organic and machine time. Causal lens holds: moonquake therefore deranged chronometer therefore observation at risk therefore leaf therefore micro-notches therefore ticking normal. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity; who/where anchored before 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lunar vacuum, micrometeorite-scuffed lens, and hydroponic bonsai trays are concrete, POV-filtered, and guide Elias’s tactile choices. The bonsai leaf becomes micro-setting that constrains calibration; its papery fall timing literally sets the gear notches. Environment mirrors mood without overt symbolism: star-smear during viewport buckle underlines stakes. Spatial choreography tracks steady during quake and repair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save tonight’s once-in-eon pulsar capture. Pressure escalates under causal lens: quake → spin anomaly → observation doom → Elias must restructure the hand. Tightening beat: only the leaf’s 0.2-sec fall is precise enough to counter 2.38 km/s orbital spin; that trade-off costs him the purity of eternal mechanism. Cost legible: clock will never again be changelessly constant, observatory now bound to terrestrial rhythm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>The ephemeral vs eternal tension emerges through objects (leaf, gears) and surfaces without abstraction: the insight that escape velocity is harmony of opposites is earned, not asserted. The closing image of cradled leaf veins re-weights the earlier star-capture desire, quietly answering the thematic question. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance invited through concrete particulars. Luminous ache modulates but never collapses into sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: compressed cosmic metaphors (“hypnotic vortex of escape velocity”) sit beside tactile tool action, reflecting an astro-technician’s awe. Rhythm accelerates during quake then breathes during leaf-listen calibration. No head-hopping; free indirect is clean (“He positioned his ear…”). Diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon; no corporate spill-over. Purposeful elision (no dialogue) is coherent under lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no algorithmic cadence. High information density—single line often carries sensory, emotional, and technical data. Figurative language is patterned: moon/pearl, vortex, papery sigh—each revisited and paid off, so density is earned. Minor loop: “luminous ache” repeated thrice; residual charge just avoids artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: escape velocity literalized as a chronometer trapped at lunar escape speed, then re-tuned by organic leaf time—concept as plot engine, not theme sticker. Bonsai-in-dome and camera-sage are specific world details that would not transplant intact. Risk of lyric cosmic prose paid off: clock hand’s surrender feels inevitable in hindsight. No trope recycling without transformation.</comment>
