<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s urbane poise and calligrapher precision are vividly embodied in silk-scarf and finger-detail; the internal contradiction—thrill of control vs. fear of raw truth—is dramatized in the stick-reversal beat. The renunciation carries felt cost: he whispers “half-lit no more” while pocketing the stick, foreclosing the bar circuit. Minor over-articulation of ethical motive (“to probe the razor edge...”) keeps it from 8+. Serenity trait is shown, not labelled, and shapes the final quiet exit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias reverses the stick, reads his own inverted tale, and accepts the permanent forfeiture of subversive puppet power. Causal lens holds: because the troupe walkout exposed a cruelty, therefore he dismantles the method. Cost is visible—he severs puppet strings in memory and walks into meteor dark stripped of former thrill. One scaffold loop (“half-lit epiphanies” phrase recurs seven times) slightly dulls the final image but does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dome’s concrete curve and meteor hush are continuously filtered through Elias’s perception—breath amplified, lantern glow catching reversed script. The stick functions as micro-setting: its flipped inscription physically constrains the reversal choice. Spatial choreography is clean—cross-legged center, pacing the floor, hatch exit. Weather metaphor (“meteor hush”) is tethered to interior silence, not decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling vs. weaponized mockery—tightens when a line wounds a grieving patron, forcing the choice to abandon subversion. Reversal of the stick is the single meaningful turn; options narrow from bar pulpits to campfire honesty. Cost is legible: he forfeits nightly adrenaline and the identity built on it. Escalation is efficient but single-cycle; no deepening pressure after midpoint keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: the same calligraphy that wounds can heal if its direction is reversed. “Half-lit epiphanies” motif evolves from barroom unease to dome clarity, reconfigured at closure without sermonizing. Final whispered line offers resonant non-literal answer—full dawn—yet leaves moral complexity intact. No final-paragraph thesis statement; image carries weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with calligrapher perceptual signature—“looping,” “ink-stained gloves,” “narrative gold.” Syntax mimics graceful ink strokes, then shortens under reversal beat. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Meteor-hush refrain functions as rhythmic pattern, taught early and paid off in final whistle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers metaphor, body, and choice. “Meteor hush” refrain risks incantatory loop but serves as pressure meter. One mixed metaphor—“vast curve swallowing the meteor hush”—barely perceptible. No filter-verb stacks; props tracked cleanly. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors tide of reflection then clipped exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher + puppeteer + decommissioned radar dome as confessional. Inversion of hero-villain script via physical stick flip feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken with lyric repetition pays off in charged final whisper. Not quite 9 because premise could transplant to another artist type with minor edits.</comment>
