<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior monologue glints like fish-scales—precise, cold, self-contradictory—and every micro-choice (shaking the globe, decrypting the note, surrendering coordinates) nails her erotic of detachment. The “physics of letting go” is dramatized, not announced, as she trades salvage for entropy while Elias watches. Cost is visible when she releases the globe: the gesture forecloses fame, riches, even future dives. One decimal short of 9 because the sister-ship backstory is asserted, not mined for flaw or mistake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shaken snow globe reweights the entire quest—Earhart frozen in eternal stasis becomes the mirror in which Elara accepts her own drift, paying with the literal loss of proof. Causal chain holds: find → decrypt → quantify → relinquish; each step tightens options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of ascending “nothing but the next unraveling” crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when locked by line 10.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library is not décor but a hydraulic antagonist—warped shelves, gelatinous pages, silt that swallows footprints—every detail constrains movement and attention. Micro-setting (snow globe on captain’s desk) becomes the fulcrum on which the entire thematic lever pivots. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s scientific gaze: brine chemistry before nostalgia, pressure before poetry. Missing the 9+ gate only because spatial choreography of the larger wreck is sketched in silhouette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—intellectual ownership of history vs. surrender to entropy—tightens once yet decisively when the decrypted note forces the choice: surface with evidence or release it to silt. Agency is continuous: cross-referencing logs, sampling glass, logging coordinates, then deleting them by letting the globe settle. Cost is legible: she forfeits renown, funding, possibly oxygen time. Escalation is single-point but sufficient under Accumulative lens; luck complicates (globe intact) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the irreversibility of observation: to see is to collapse Earhart’s waveform into surrender, just as Elara collapses her own ambition into particulate snow. Subtext lives in gesture—hand brushing glass, flakes resettling—never in exposition. The final image answers the opening question (“what threads bind us to the plunge?”) with a visual rebuttal: threads are untangled only to be re-knotted by gravity and memory. No moralizing, only a cold, elegant repricing of value.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays soldered to Elara’s scientific perceptual signature—anemones “furred,” inkwells “silted,” brine measured in densities. Syntax lengthens during analysis, fractures into staccato under pressure (“bubbles trailing like forgotten prayers”). No head-hopping; Elias remains refraction, not POV. Register drifts once—“quantum surrender”—but is earned by prior physics chatter and paid off in the globe image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with depth: clauses swell and contract as pressure meters tick. Metaphors are spare, physical, never mixed: “velvet shadow,” “gelatinous archive.” Information density high—one sentence can deliver setting, back-reference, and emotional torque. Only a single paraphrase loop (“threads bind… untangling threads”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusing Earhart, Titanic’s sister, and an abyssal library risks collage gimmickry, yet each stratum is soldered by the entropy theme, yielding a fresh archaeology of loss. The snow globe re-visions the clichéd “found object” into a closed system that dramatizes release. Risk—scientist talking to death—pays off because Elias never replies, maintaining empirical modesty. Conceptual integrity absolute: no surface twist, only deepening cold.</comment>
