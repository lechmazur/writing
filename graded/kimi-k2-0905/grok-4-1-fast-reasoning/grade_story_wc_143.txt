<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through the risky climb and the meticulous photo setup; the interior contradiction between scientific awe and personal mortality is felt in the oxygen countdown. The final endurance costs him time and risk, earning his quiet triumph. Voice leaks into generic “space-age twilight” abstraction once, blunting the full 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: curiosity → forbidden climb → oxygen drain → chemical-SOS → dawn rescue. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grain’s micro-etchings reconfigure the mission’s meaning while the rover light confirms survival cost. One minor causality bump: the suit’s sudden “faster than calculated” drain is declared, not foreshadowed by exertion detail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lunar summit is viscerally anchored—gloved rungs, fogging visor, velvet pad on vacuum-exposed basalt—each object constrains camera angle or flare timing. Micro-setting (the grain on black velvet) becomes the charged final image. Light progression from ghostly silver to gold is tracked via Elias’s visor and shutter, never as postcard filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmit existence of the last grain before oxygen expires—tightens with each chemical timer. The middle beat (first flare seen by base) meaningfully narrows options: rescue is possible, yet dawn still demands he outlast alone. Cost is visible on-page: fogged visor, flickering gauge, numb fingers uncapping vials.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence vs. artifact endurance emerges through the grain outlasting probes and the inspector risking flesh to archive it. Final micro-etchings reweight the nightwatch from obsolete machine to poetic witness—earned, not stated. One near-theme-echo sentence (“last whisper of the nightwatch”) is saved by its placement inside suit recorder, i.e., in-character.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter—crater dust “like forgotten dreams” is his romantic overlay, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens under oxygen anxiety, then fractures into short flare counts, mirroring breath. No head-hop; scientific register stays within 1972 astronaut lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent effort, then tightens into staccato chemical steps. Figurative language is sparse and mission-apt: “frozen tear” for the grain, “clawed shadows” for rim rock. One scaffold loop—“last” repeated three times in four lines—dulls momentum slightly but does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: 1972 lunar inspector + chemical Morse + single grain as archival relic. The hourglass conceit reframes familiar “last footprint” trope into micro-artifact that outlives its maker. Risk in hard-SF chemistry detail pays off without exposition dump.</comment>
