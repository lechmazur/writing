<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lir’s interiority is vivid—“acoustically perceptive” is shown through the bowed hulls and slivers-of-sound ritual rather than told. His reckless empathic listening is a believable flaw that costs him the safety of silence and forces a public offering of his own unfinished memory at climax. The shift from collector to catalyst is legible; the price (exposure of private grief) is felt. Secondary survivors are sketched with defining fragments rather than full arcs, acceptable at length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the chronic hush audibly cracks when Lir releases his father’s half-sentence; shipwrecks vibrate, glass answers—an unambiguous before/after in Accumulative/Textural mode. The lens is taught early (“Sounds dulled to whispers… Lir attuned”) and holds to the final note. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words (“sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks”). Cost is visible: the bowl empties and the violinist’s own unfinished memory—long hoarded—becomes the last echo, leaving him lighter yet lonelier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The half-flooded greenhouse and bioluminescent plankton are not spectacle; they amplify acoustics and dictate the ritual’s stage. Shipwrecks literally act as organ pipes; shattered panes tinkle only after the music, tying setting to closure. Micro-setting works too: the mendicant bowl’s shimmer refracts firelight, cueing the listener shift. No spatial drift; bodies orbit the bonfire with clear vectors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim audible beauty from the hush—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates as each offered fragment tightens the communal need. The meaningful turn is Lir’s decision to spend his own unfinished memory; this risks the silence returning if the ritual fails, a felt trade-off. Pressure accumulates: hush “thickens,” flames shrink, listeners wait. Agency remains his throughout; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme—value of the unfinished—emerges through image (budding yet barren trees, half-drawn sword) rather than sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: survivors drop voice-slivers like coins, converting grief to currency. Final image (single trembling bud) reweights “unfinished” from lack to promise. No moral is stated; the crack in hush suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Lir’s acoustic filter: “echo-harbor violinist,” “violin weeping” remain within his poetic idiom. Sentence rhythm lengthens and softens during music beats, mimics bowing. Compression is taught early (“chronic hush settled”) and paid off. No dialogue or head-hop; voice coherence under stress is flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose carries incantatory repetition (“unfinished,” “unbind”) that serves ritual cadence, not loop artifact. Metaphors stay coherent (hush as mourner, ship ribs as organ pipes). Dense lines do triple duty: “bowl’s contents shimmering: a child’s unfinished giggle…” advances plot, character, atmosphere. Minor filter verb clusters (“Lir heard… Lir knew”) are voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing post-catastrophe quiet with sound-collecting luthier feels fresh; the hush as antagonic vacuum is non-obvious. Ritual of trading unfinished sounds is a memorable social invention. Yet premise nods to “last artist preserving culture” trope; specificity of acoustic ecology and bowl mechanism transforms it enough. Final bud image supplies new inflection.</comment>
