<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s “wisely adventurous” tag is shown more than told: she deciphers the mural riddle instead of fleeing the drones, and her final refusal to seize the throne is earned by earlier interior hesitation. The flake’s warming pulse gives her a concrete, embodied cue for emotion. Minor slip: the phrase “heartbeat from yesteryear” drifts toward stock poeticism, blunting the otherwise sharp interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is pristine: flake → mural → trapdoor → stair → throne, each beat because/therefore. Dawn’s first ray as the final key is seeded by the chrono-implant warnings, paying off with visible cost—she gains stewardship but forfeits personal rule. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city-wide orchard bloom reframes power as caretaking, not conquest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Neo-Eden’s chrome smog, bioluminescent tunnels, and prismatic nano-mist are filtered through Elara’s cybernetic gaze, never touristic. The hidden orchard’s perpetual-twilight petals constrain her pace—she must wait for dawn’s exact ray—so setting directly shapes tactics. One hairline slip: “gravity-boots” is later “grav-boots,” not quite nailed down.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—claim or refuse the throne—tightens exactly once, at the summit vision where stewardship replaces conquest; the price is the forfeiture of absolute power. Corporate drones complicate but do not resolve, satisfying coincidence rules. Sunrise acts as a live clock that forces the final micro-choice under the skylight, cost fully legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of restoration-over-dominion emerges from the orchard’s eternal bloom and the throne’s final orchard-projection; no character sermonizes it. The murals’ warning “Wisdom ascends; folly tumbles” is re-priced when Elara chooses ascension as service, not rule—an elegant, non-literal answer to the central question.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical: “synthaural nostalgia,” “chrono-implant pulsed warnings,” diction always inside Elara’s perceptual range. Rhythm swells with cascading clauses during orchard entry, then shortens at the stair-climb, mirroring breath. No head-hop; compression like “hours blurred” is strategic, taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (“she pried open the revealed trapdoor” = action + object state change). Metaphors stay consistent—paint sloughing like molting skin mirrors the city shedding its past. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates from languid orchard to crystalline stair beats without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The crystalline throne granting orchard-vision instead of empire is a fresh inversion of the usual power-macguffin. Synth-wave nostalgia and nano-mist waterfall feel specific to this world, not cosmetic. Risk: the “stairway of ascension” nears archetype, but is salvaged by the stewardship twist that reframes ascension as service.</comment>
