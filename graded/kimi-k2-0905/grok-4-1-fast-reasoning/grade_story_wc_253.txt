<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The porcelain-mask vacancy is viscerally maintained; every micro-choice (licking the blood, tying the ribbon) embodies her detachment. The internal contradiction—needing to “cultivate lightness” while frozen—drives every beat. The final renunciation (no tears, next branch) is earned: she has paid with the husband’s life and her own emotional nullity. Only the tiniest reserve: we never feel the pulse that insists on tomorrow’s performance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the new talisman in her hand reweights the rule-set—she can keep carving hollow artifacts forever, cost now legible as eternal void. Accumulative lens holds: each shaven curl thickens the emotional density until the final image crystallizes the stake. Turbine hum + bouquet + blade pattern is taught by 25 % and recurs to tighten. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The turbines’ drone is not backdrop but metronome that paces every cut; the dried petals’ dust mingles with pine shavings to become the new talisman. Micro-setting (knife, thumb, ribbon) constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices only what can be weaponised or narrated. One hairline slip: “another farmhouse mirrored hers” drifts toward postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she lighten grief without feeling—tightens when the knife slips: blood proves the body still bills her. Each whittle deepens the pattern (void → artifact → void) under Accumulative pressure. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive: the bouquet’s last petal falls, foreclosing the option of authentic mourning. Cost is visible in the bleeding thumb and the eternal tomorrow she announces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of turning atrocity into art: the performer’s narration is both mercy and murder weapon. Subtext lives in gesture—licking blood like tasting a line before editing. Final image reweights “remade hush” from ambient noise to self-imposed silence she must keep feeding. No moralising; the ambiguity is the residue left on the reader’s tongue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is a porcelain mask speaking grand opera: syntactic arches (“Behold the whittle begins!”) mirror the turbine blades. Diction stays inside her lexicon—she would say “titans” and “flora and forge.” Rhythm accelerates with the knife, breathes at each “Behold,” never breaks character. The blank face never leaks into explanatory interiority; performance is the only diction we get.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “petals dusted the table, mingling with shavings” shows texture, stakes, and time in eight words. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the turbine/flower/blade constellation. One mixed vehicle (“curve of inevitability”) is forgiven in the rush. Final line lands with metronomic certainty, no drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest angle: post-mandate emotional lobotomy treated as solo theatre. Whittling miniature turbine blades from the very pines they shadow fuses world, character, and theme into one recursive artifact. Risk of high-flown diction is embraced fully, becoming the character’s only lifeline. The concept could not survive relocation to another setting or voice.</comment>
