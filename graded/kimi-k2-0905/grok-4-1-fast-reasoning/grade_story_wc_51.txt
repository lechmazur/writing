<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—collecting intangible weights—remains abstract; we never see a micro-choice where a specific burden’s mass alters her next weave. The interior contradiction (panic vs. vocation) is asserted, not embodied in gesture or breath. Final calcification reads as imposed ritual, not earned character cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands: calcification converts infinite recursion into stone monument, visible cost in her coalesced form. Causal chain holds: lamp orientation → starlight conduit → crystallization. Orientation clear by line 5; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—fractals overgrow—sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bronze grotto’s metallic veins and starlight needles constrain the only viable path for lamp alignment; setting actively shapes the climactic action. Micro-setting of the soot-blackened wick reappears as tactile anchor post-transformation. Selective sensory hierarchy—drip muffled under layered hush—mirrors escalating silence without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape boundary-less trap—signaled once recursion tightens. Escalation driven by her re-orienting lamp: each micro-tilt narrows options until crystallization forecloses infinity. Cost legible: loss of boundary-less diffusion, replaced by fixed stone skin. No reversal, but single deepening suffices for 700-word textural arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: measurement of human weight demands the measurer’s own fixation. Subtext in final pool—meltwater at her feet—implies next season’s fresh burdens without stating. Avoids moral; resonance carried by image of fossilized fractals glinting with starlight. Could sharpen if one burden echoed personally earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice distinct: “shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie” create singular texture. Syntax elongates then fractures under recursion, mirroring content. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays filtered through Elara’s metallic, mathematical sensorium. Register stable, no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work. Rhythm modulates—long breathless coils vs. clipped “calcify” imperative—without algorithmic pattern. One paraphrase loop (“shingled hush” echoed thrice in 50 words) but does not stall closure. Metaphors internally coherent; no mixed vehicle collisions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fractal-weaver who calcifies infinity into stone atlas feels fresh; combines math, myth, and metallurgy in one image-set. Risky second-person abstraction (“boundary-lessly”) taught early and paid off in stone boundary. Would edge 9+ if a single burden’s specificity recoiled on her own past.</comment>
