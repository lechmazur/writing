<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger to “conquer the labyrinth of self” is vivid and under constant test; every timeline he re-enters forces a micro-choice (accept tyranny, solitude, fear, etc.) that exposes contradictions in his identity. The embodied cost—absorbing the shadow-self on the viaduct—reifies the interior split and lands as earned renunciation. Interiority rarely slips into label-speak; instead, memory corridors, mirror-minotaurs and gravity phasing externalize the psyche. Only a hairline slip: the beat-by-beat emotional layering thins slightly during the procedural-description stretch, keeping it shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is decisive and costly: integration of the shadow collapses the maze and resumes suspended time—before/after legible, price paid on-stage. Causal chain holds: tablet + viaduct initiate → successive retraces tighten stakes → final confrontation forecloses option of remaining fragmented. Mosaic structure taught early (“splintered possibilities”, frozen droplets) and transitions stay legible. Minor non-closure accumulation: one paraphrase loop inside the labyrinth tour does not touch the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glowing post-storm viaduct, suspended rain, wet stone and reflected halo light are filtered through Elias’s gravity-attuned senses; every sensory pick threads into mood and choice. The viaduct’s pulsing glow literally feeds the tablet and gates the corridors, so the macro-setting constrains tactic and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean—hover, skim, press, land—no impossible positions. Idiom remains consistent and concrete, not tourist-catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wholeness versus eternal fragmentation—signalled in para 1 and escalates as each retrace deletes one possible life forever. Agency sits with Elias: he chooses which selves to merge or reject; the “periodically eternal” reset sharpens urgency every seventh heartbeat, tightening options without gimmick. Cost is visible: darkening glow, sweat, and ultimately the surrender of a discrete shadow-self. Pressure plateaus briefly in the mid-labyrinth exposition, keeping it just below the 8.5 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-unity through painful integration emerges from concrete maze-battles, not assertion; no moralising coda. The “periodically eternal” conceit and procedural corridors literalise obsessive re-running of regret, inviting reader reflection on personal loops. Final image—tablet dimmed but internal darkness/brightness balanced—offers resonant reconfiguration without spoon-fed meaning. Subtext in silence after “Begin” and in mirror-minotaur charge enriches multiplicity theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Poetic yet precise diction—“raindrops suspended mid-fall like crystal beads”—establishes rhyth mic control; compressions (“darkening brightness”) are pattern-taught and paid off. No head-hopping; single POV remains tightly anchored to Elias’s sensory frame even during time jumps. Psychic distance modulates credibly: panoramic hover narrows to heartbeat count under threat. Voice stays distinct and internally coherent through peak beat of shadow absorption.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—information plus image—propelling the read; variable rhythm mirrors motion from weightless glide to jagged dodge. Occasional stacked modifiers (“procedural generation etched into the clay—algorithms of fate weaving new paths from chaos”) border on surplus but never obscure causality or dull the final image. No filter-verb clusters, no synonym loops. Proofing clean; pronoun reference exact despite timeline leaps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses mythic labyrinth, glitch-world procedural generation, and lyric time-freeze into an inseparable imaginative whole; trope recombination feels organic. “Periodically eternal” rune and suspended raindrops offer fresh metaphoric tech for recursive memory. Risky structure—lyric-mosaic inside fight-scene pacing—heightens stakes without losing coherence. Could flirt with 9+ but one prior-published echo (minotaur in mirrored maze) tempers absolute novelty.</comment>
