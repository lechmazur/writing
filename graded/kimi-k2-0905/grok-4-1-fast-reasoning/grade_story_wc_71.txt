<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrically specific—he “watches the bay’s houses transform” and “seeks the hidden rhythm”—but the contradiction between creeping-loss obsession and later communal savior turn is asserted rather than embodied in scene. Embodied emotion peaks when he pockets the orris shard (“weight as more than stone”), yet the climax relocates the locket without dramatizing a micro-choice that costs him anything personal. The shift from detached observer to ritual orchestrator feels convenient; no prior flaw or limit foreshadows the risk or price of this new agency. Still, his perceptual signature is sustained, and the final smile carries a faint earned residue of stewardship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the returned locket-and-shard ignites the bungalow’s “blaze flaring brighter,” reweighting community connection under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds—each collected object thickens texture until the return ritual crystallizes meaning—but orientation is soft: “quiet bay” and “spring’s soft swell” drift 70 words before we anchor in Elias’s gait. The decisive change occurs on the page with felt conceptual cost: houses once “hollow shells” now “pulse with shared silence,” a social repricing that makes the prior isolation legible. No teleporting props or retro-patches; the orris shard’s veining is the persistent constraint that shapes every sanctification beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Elias’s synesthetic bias—“cherry blossoms drifted like forgotten sighs,” “streetlights daydreamed”—so sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The bay’s geography stays schematic, but micro-setting (porch, hyacinths, worn table) constrains choices: objects must be displaced before they can be returned. Weather is soft spring mist, never urgent enough to alter tactics, so environment mirrors rather than pressures. Final image of reignited porches recharges the early “hollow shells” motif, earning a modest glow of specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why houses breathe—signals early and tightens when Elias decodes the “shard of hush” as the missing communal pause. Agency is accumulative: each sanctification deepens texture rather than narrows options, culminating in the return ritual that reweights social silence. No reversible loss or tangible price is risked by Elias himself; the cost is conceptual—community exposed to its own displaced tokens. Escalation is present but gentle, a cadence shift rather than a crucible; pressure plateaus at lyric recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: houses live not through noise but through the hush they cradle—an insight distilled from concrete returns rather than preached. Subtext operates in gesture (placing locket on porch at dawn) and in the tactile silence that follows. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line lets the bay “whisper its eternal fire,” a resonant non-literal answer. Complexity is preserved: creeping normality is neither evil nor reversed, only re-inhabited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed with patterned elision—“streetlights daydreamed,” “shard of hush”—taught early and paid off in the final “hushed blaze.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices slow fade, ivy creep, violet scent with connoisseur precision. No dialogue to distort register; free-indirect style stays clean. Rhythm modulates from languid observation to incantatory listing of objects, mirroring the shift from noticing to making.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud cadence is musical, but metaphor density borders on purple: three layered vehicles in one sentence (“cherry blossoms drifted like forgotten sighs… violet hush of early evening”) slows propulsion. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or mythos. Tense and pronoun references remain stable. The final paragraph risks list-like litany—“Marbles, cups, ribbons multiplied”—but the anaphora serves ritual pulse, so artifact is waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses hauntology and community ecology through perfumery chemistry—an angle not stock in either genre. Risk-taking in lyric montage (four shards) is taught by 25% and holds coherent lens. The “shard of hush” as crystallized silence is a fresh conceptual object whose rules are internally consistent. Transformation test fails only if relocated to another geography, because orris root’s violet earthiness is irreplaceably tied to this bay’s salt air.</comment>
