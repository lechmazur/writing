<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s mute longing is embodied in tactile loom-work and the amber bead, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“wistful,” “latent sacrifice”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice until the final weave; the trade of voice is backstory, not on-page conflict. The climactic surrender feels inevitable yet abstract—her “essence fray” is stated, not shown through bodily or emotional specificity—so the cost is legible but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tapestry lifts, Elara dissolves, and the amber bead remains—an image that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each weave thickens pattern until the final cadence shift releases the message. The Orientation Test is waived; delayed anchors serve the lyric design and payoff. One scaffold loop—“hush of time’s unraveling tapestry” repeated near opening and close—slightly dulls the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bamboo forest, rotting orchard, and amber bead function as micro-setting: the bead’s captured light literally powers the tapestry’s flight, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective—emerald clatter, sweet rot, moon-dyed thread—filtered through Elara’s spinner perception. Spatial choreography stays coherent within the single grove; weather (dew-weight bamboo) cues the final dawn. One minor slip: “crate at the orchard’s edge” appears without prior spatial anchor, but the lyric mode absorbs it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—send message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens once: the puzzle-edge frame forces a final, irreversible weave that consumes her life. Under Accumulative lens, density increases via glowing threads and flaring amber until options collapse into the single lift-off. Cost is visible—“her life force dimming, body slumping”—but the beat is compressed into one clause, muting visceral price. Still, the foreclosed path is legible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of art as mortal messenger emerges organically: the loom devours its maker to birth a bridge. Subtext resides in the bead’s stoic glow—light from dead suns powering reunion—without authorial commentary. Final image reframes prior decay as necessary fuel, offering resonant ambiguity rather than moral. One near-echo—“hush of time’s unraveling tapestry” risks thematic over-statement, but the repetition is patterned, not preachy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“clack-clack hymn,” “raveling silence”) is textured and spinner-specific. Rhythm modulates: long vowel-heavy sentences stretch in wistfulness, then fracture into blurring hands under climax. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. Occasional elevated phrasing—“entropy’s pull,” “conceptual repricing”—skirts register drift yet feels motived by mythic pitch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; most sentences dual-task (advance image + emotion). Two adjacent “raveling” phrases create mild synonym churn; another scaffold pair—“stoically sparkling” repeated—edges toward template cadence but serves as bead-signature. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay coherent. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“strung,” “flared,” “soared”) propel momentum. One simultaneity glitch: “As warp met weft, the latent sacrifice stirred” compresses cause/effect but remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of jigsaw edges with mythic loom magic feels fresh and inevitable: puzzle borders literalize the frame that holds entropy at bay. Rot-orchard within bamboo is a specific, non-generic liminal zone. The sacrifice-of-voice trope is refreshed by the bead’s fossilized sunlight powering the weave. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final charged poise, transforming prior decay into propulsion fuel.</comment>
