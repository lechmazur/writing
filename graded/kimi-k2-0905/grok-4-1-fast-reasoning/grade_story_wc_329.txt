<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s pulse-and-music motive is concrete and embodied; the locust shell presses to her chest, the violin is weeping triumph. Contradictory impulses—fear of statues vs hunger for beauty—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final uproot is earned by the covert heart-rhythm signalling and the shell’s talismanic pressure; cost is felt as gears clatter “like defeated bones.” Only minor slip: “unyielding motivation” drifts toward diagnostic label; still, the interiority stays particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: patrol pattern knowledge → heart-rhythm signal → split bark → uproot → statues freeze. Closure lands with visible cost—shell cracks, metal roots tear free, her violin “weeping triumph” recharges the opening motif. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 30; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (shell’s fragility) shapes the final gamble.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard is not postcard; it constrains—lantern eyes sweep, gears fuse into xylem, bark splits under bow pressure. Sky-bridge silk and starlight function as micro-setting that enables stealth descent. Locust shell’s “brittle curve” is tactile and charges the final crack. Persistent object (violin) and body (callused fingers) meet the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs mechanical order—tightens when statue tilts head, then again when statues converge; each beat is protagonist-driven via music pulse. Escalation is causal: softer the signal, harder the risk. Cost is legible—shell shatters, gears scatter, bridge hums with “tarnished wonder reborn.” One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular pulse/image: rust blossoms unrust, metal husks shed, “tarnished wonder reborn.” No moralizing; the final image reweights the premise without thesis statement. Subtext hides in shell hollowness and violin sigh—transformation implied, not declared. Some risk of symbolic convenience (shell = rebirth) but the object is handled across beats, earning its resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “fingers trembled not from cold but from fire,” “violin weeping triumph.” Rhythm compresses under statue threat—“ba-dum, ba-dum”—then elongates at release. No head-hopping; distance stable. One register drift—“mechanical blight” edges editorial—but cadence overall supports pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: “gears fused into xylem” collapses world-rule and stakes in four words. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “resonantly soft” repeated three times in 50 words; still, the refrain is pattern-taught and pays off in final pulse. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action; no loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of biological metamorphosis (locust shell) with mechanical orchard feels fresh; not a trope checklist. Heart-rhythm signalling as covert insurgency is specific to this world. Risk taken in lyric escalation rather than combat set-piece, and coherence holds. Transformation test passes—remove shell or pulse motif and the story’s logic collapses.</comment>
