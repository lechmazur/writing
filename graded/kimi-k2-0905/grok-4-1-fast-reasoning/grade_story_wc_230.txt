<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's compulsive truth-telling and rational mycologist bent are shown through sensor-mapping and soil pH probes, not labels; the glass-eye insertion is a brutal micro-choice that visibly costs him pain and split sight, earning later silence. His need for “psychological safety” propels every beat; the occlusion’s immediate trade-off—relief versus deceit—grounds the final charged poise. Internal contradiction is alive as he wonders if he has healed or only “draped fractures in silken deceit,” keeping moral ambiguity unsentimental. No stock phrasing; the eye’s “storm-trapped moon” gleam is his perceptual lens, not decorative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the antique eye’s persistent glint reweights all prior confessions into optional silence, felt cost legible in “had occlusion truly healed…?” Causal chain holds—probe snags pouch → textbook rite → insertion → immediate lie test—each step tightening social options under storm pressure. Orientation is cleanly anchored inside 120 words via ravine, orchard, nightly storms, and Elias’s sensor kit. One minor elastic: the textbook’s “veritas nerve” is introduced late, but the mad-doctor scribble is cued by the pouch discovery the same paragraph, so causality keeps its shape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is not backdrop; wind-lashed boughs and suspended aeries dictate where Elias can stand, climb, and conceal the rite. Truffle mycelium bridging “relic and flesh” fuses world-logic with body-tool intimacy, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: probe → root ball → wind-whipped aerie → descent to tenders; bodies never float. Weather and altitude narrow perception to “storm-trapped moon” gleam and branch creaks, keeping sensory hierarchy tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—gaining permission to lie—signals early; pressure escalates as each storm night strips more trust, forcing the occlusion decision. The insertion sequence is the decisive tightening: it narrows Elias’s moral options to mediated half-truths, price paid in split vision and self-doubt. Agency remains causal throughout; storms complicate but do not resolve. Cost is visible on-page: “Words now bent to his will” paired with the ache of “pain bloomed, fractured and exquisite.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without assertion: the cost of curated silence versus the violence of perpetual truth, left dangling in the unblinking eye. Fractured grace is enacted, not named, as Lira’s thaw and Thom’s wary hope sprout from withheld grim data. Final image—“the antique eye gleamed, unblinking sentinel”—reweights the premise, making deceit both refuge and new surveillance. Ambiguity is meaningful: reader must decide if psychological safety bought by lies is healing or slow infection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s sensor-focused idiom: geomagnetic, pH, “earthy bounty a rational anchor.” Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed clauses during insertion, longer lyrical cadence in gloaming reflection. No head-hop; Lira and Thom remain opaque except through Elias’s relief at their thawing suspicion. Distinct perceptual signature carries to the final clause: “whole in his duality,” where fractured sight becomes identity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; information often doubles (“sodden but intact, revealing an antique glass eye” does location and reveal in one stroke). Rhythm varies: storm fragments mirror branch thrash; longer sentence mirrors eye’s slow insertion. Mixed metaphors kept minimal—“storm-trapped moon” remains consistent with ravine sky. Minor scaffold: “psychological safety” is repeated three times; trims −0.2. No loops obscure causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of post-viral confessional dystopia with truffle science and Venetian smuggled ocular relic feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Empathy virus trope is refreshed through mycological rationalism and the literal nerve-block eye. Risky archaic surgery is grounded by on-page sterilization and pain, not magic. Conceptual integrity holds: the story commits fully to the occlusion premise and lets mycelium, storms, and optic glass intersect without retroactive rule change.</comment>
