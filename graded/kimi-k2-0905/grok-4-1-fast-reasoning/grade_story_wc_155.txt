<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motive—recover lost joy—anchors every beat; embodied emotion (“fingers itched,” “breath catching”) and micro-choice (kneel, lift, paint) keep interiority concrete. Flawed nostalgia vs. present agency gives credible contradiction; final renunciation (pocketing fragment, walking away) pays cost. No relationship crucible here, but network-ghost nod suffices for secondary pressure. Voice remains singular, no diagnostic speak; stays within 8-band for minor over-reliance on ‘pensive mirth’ refrain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: luminous orchard projection crystallizes options—she can leave but forever carries fog-etched joy; cost is the irreversibility of exposure (“perpetual glow”). Causal chain holds: fragment find → light-expose → network amplify → project → retreat; each because/therefore tightens. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—fog never fully lifts—shapes final image. Minor ellipsis in how network mechanics are accessed doesn’t break causality at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ruined orchard district functions as active antagonist: fog limits visibility, gnarled trunks become projection screen, mossy roots conceal fresco. Micro-setting—lantern beam, crumbling plaster—constrains light-painting tactics. Sensory hierarchy follows artist’s eye: color fade, tactile moss, scent of phantom fruit. Final image of silver-thread fog recharges opening haze with new meaning—less haunted, more canvas. Specificity never stalls momentum; earns 9-band by charging closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover personal joy—tightens when曝光 risks diluting memory into public spectacle; visible price is surrender of private nostalgia to communal network. One meaningful intensification: fresco exposure turns private quest into shared haunting. No external antagonist, but fog + network pressure suffice. Agency remains hers; coincidence absent. Cost legible in final “etched in her soul’s fresco”—private joy now communal beacon. Sufficient for 8-band; would need sharper tactical trade-off for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—light vs. fog, private vs. shared memory—rather than assertion. Final projection reweights initial “lost joy” as ongoing act of re-creation, not recovery. Ambiguity persists: joy now collective, but artist remains solitary. No moralizing; resonance carried by orchard re-bloom image. Minor sentimentality in “eternal whisper” line prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-up maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“pensive mirth,” “lantern hum with captured dawn”—is character-locked. Syntax mirrors fog drift: long, clause-layered sentences that breathe. No head-hopping; network voices filtered through her sensorium. Filter verbs (“felt,” “sensed”) are voice-motivated, not clutter. Dialogue absent, so no convergence issue. Rhythm control peaks in final paragraph cadence that thins fog clause by clause—earned 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences perform expos, mood, metaphor (“branches skeletal relics of abundance”). Figurative language is patterned—light as paint, fog as canvas—paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors; scaffold limited to two near-repeats of “pensive mirth.” No loops or synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm varies sentence openers; paragraph cuts land on image turns. Minor over-modification (“centuries of thick fog that muffled the world into whispers”) keeps from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: light-painting on fog as living fresco, network-as-collective-memory, orchard as palimpsest—each trope transformed through tactile detail. Risky second-person-ish daydream frame is taught early and pays off in closure retreat. Irreplaceable specifics: lantern beams “etch luminous murals onto mist,” fossilized plaster sensitized like film. Conceptual integrity commits to art-as-exposure without retreat. No close echoes; emotional truth overrides gimmick. Within-band +0.3 for bold risk that sharpens resonance.</comment>
