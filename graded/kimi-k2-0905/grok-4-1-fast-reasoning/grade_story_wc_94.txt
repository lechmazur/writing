<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—rage at censorship vs. surrender to communal mapping—are dramatized in the moment he re-seals the envelope; the psychic cost of betrayal and the jagged rib scar body these impulses. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the final micro-choice (descending with the timetable) locks an earned, visible cost. The only bar to 9+ is that the “communal scar map” realization is slightly abstract; the body-level cost could be sharper on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: timer clicks and lightning flashes pattern-tighten until the poem’s arrival reframes the vigil. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s stance shifts from isolated cartographer to node in a clandestine network, cost encoded in the laugh that accepts perpetual endangerment. Causality remains intact; no orientation debt; the envelope’s late arrival is coincidence that complicates, not resolves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory, storm, and timetable form a micro-setting triad that constrains every move: cracked panes force bodily proximity to lightning; timetable’s ghost routes literalize erased futures. Ozone scent and red timer digits anchor who-where-when within 40 words. The final image of the fluttering timetable in pocket charges the closing beat with tactile, irreversible commitment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias transmit his map once the timer hits zero—tightens with each click; the unsigned poem forces a trade-off between silence and amplified risk. Escalation is textural: density of storm/lightning imagery increases until the choice to re-wedged the envelope crystallizes irreversible complicity. Cost is felt in the “perpetual vigil” laugh; a hairline slip is that the external regime threat stays off-page, muting visceral danger one notch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: scars as stellar maps, community as constellation. The timetable’s ghost routes and the broken compass wax reprice censorship’s erasure without a thesis statement. Final line—“maps yet to be read”—reweights every prior wound into shared futurity; no moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: stormlight as “veins of forgotten gods,” timetable pages “yellowed like protest parchments.” Syntax rarefies under pressure—fragmented clauses mirror lightning staccato. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds a poet’s lexicon; register stable.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “timer hit thirty minutes, pausing his vigil like a breath held too long” does triple duty (clock, body, tension). Figurative language is patterned, not stacked—storm-metaphor domain is taught early and paid off. One loop risk: “storm-kissed wonder” recurs four times; slight rhythmic fatigue, but it recharges in the final image, so closure untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The censored-poet trope is transmuted through the timetable-envelope courier system—an analog dead-drop that feels utterly specific to this altitude and regime. Scar-as-constellation is familiar, yet here it is welded to a communal, iterative archive whose survival depends on poets resetting each other’s timers. Risky lyric density is sustained without obscuring causality, yielding a fresh inflection: the vigil is not solitary but relayed.</comment>
