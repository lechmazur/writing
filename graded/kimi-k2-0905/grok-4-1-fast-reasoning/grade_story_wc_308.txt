<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Thren’s centuries-long vigil is a credible, embodied renunciation that costs him his body; the wandering pulse’s final transfer is earned by iterative, escalating micro-choices (skimming stones, enduring dust, refusing to leave). Interiority stays concrete—“dust settling anew on his hooded form,” “pulse quicken against his skin”—never sliding into diagnostic gloss. The only abstraction, “historically reverent soul,” is immediately grounded in ritual action (cradling, skimming, appraising). Final stasis—body ossified, mind roaming—pays the price promised from line one.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative-textural lens: each skimmed stone layers dust, birds, and echo into a density that finally reweights the stake—motionless navigation achieved. Closure is a Charged Poise: the colossal flock mirrors the arrowhead spirals, then scatters, leaving Thren fossilized yet unbound; cost is the irreversible forfeit of corporeal motion. Orientation is taught early (“In the canyon…”) and anchors hold through centuries without drift. No causality break; the wandering pulse’s transfer is the inevitable crescendo of iterated harmonics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bone towers, dust storms, and echo choreography are not backdrop but instruments: the towers supply skimming ledges, dust buries relics anew, echoes amplify harmonics that summon birds. The arrowhead itself becomes micro-setting—its obsidian edge pressed to forehead—charging the final image. Spatial tracking is clean: half-buried → cradled → ledge → forehead. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Thren’s priestly bias: he notices resonance before color, grit before temperature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—disembodied navigation—tightens via accretive cost: decades of dust, ebbing flocks, ossifying joints. Each harmonic session is a micro-bet that forecloses alternatives (no travel, no trade, no human contact). The decisive intensification is the single perfect throw that finally aligns birds with spirals; coincidence is absent, pattern is earned. Price is irreversible corporeal stasis, legible in the dust-mantled silhouette that no longer breathes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative acts rather than statement: reverence as patience, navigation as surrender, history as dust that buries yet preserves. The arrowhead’s wandering pulse reweights the moral calculus—Thren becomes tomb and vessel for a stranger’s severed life, not merely archivist. Final image scatters birds like “fulfilled prophecy,” offering non-literal answer: to move without flesh is to become echo oneself. No summarizing maxim; meaning stays inside the bone canyon’s hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays at monkish distance, mimicking Thren’s own self-effacement; diction (“clack-clack-clack,” “dust-choked dawn”) is filtered through his acoustical priesthood. Rhythm swells and ebbs with flock density, mirroring harmonic cadence. No head-hopping; the one moment of interior transfer is dramatized physically (pulse surging into forehead). Compression of centuries into paragraphs is purposeful elision taught by the first “endless echoes” and paid off when echoes outlive the body.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are bone-stone-echo consistent; vehicles never collide. Clause variety propels the accretion: fragment (“clack-clack-clack”) then rolling anaphora (“decades layered atop centuries”). No filler, no scaffold; each sentence adds temporal or sonic layer. Only nit: “weathered resolve” appears three times—mild churn, but the phrase is buried in differing contexts and never muddies closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The harmonic stone-skimmer who fossilizes himself into an echo-navigation device is a fresh synthesis of archaeologist, mystic, and sound-engineer. Bone towers, volcanic arrowhead, and avian divination braid into a singular mythic logic rather than checklist exoticism. Risk of centuries-long montage pays off because closure reconfigures the premise: stillness becomes motion, caretaker becomes relic. Specificity—“fossilized spines,” “volcanic rites”—prevents generic timelessness.</comment>
