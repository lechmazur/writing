<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Finn’s interiority is vivid—his evaporated melodies and finger-tracing on water embody loss—but Elara’s motives crystallize only through sign-language poetry, never through private contradiction; the final “joyful sorrow” is declared not dramatized, so the micro-choice cost feels slightly abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence-as-material accrues density until the camera-framed hush reweights the festival; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Finn is “remembered… by the bittersweet song” with undeniable social cost; causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor is never postcard; it supplies the map surface—wave gaps, dock creaks—whose texture becomes the symphony; the film-less camera is micro-setting that literally frames silence, charging the final image; spatial choreography stays clean as the pair move from pier to festival heart.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each mapped hush thickens until the crowd’s noise collapses into their vacuum; the price is the festival’s surrendered raucousness, legible on the revelers’ tear-streaked faces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of media: no-film camera captures essence, sign-language births sound; the final image—“Silence mapped is music eternal”—reprises the moonlit ripple, revaluing loss as legacy without moralizing; joyful sorrow stays coherent, modulating from lure to catharsis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Finn’s perceptual filter—stars are “forgotten,” melodies “evaporated”; syntax swells and pauses mimic wave rhythm; no head-hopping; sign-language passages use italicized whispers that teach the reader the pattern without breaking immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long liquid sentences and single sharp fragments (“Tonight, we disrupt”); no synonym loops; metaphors (camera = relic of captured souls) stay coherent; information density high—one sentence often layers setting, emotion, and conceptual hinge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sign-language choreography as musical score, vintage camera as silence sampler; trope of mute siren transformed into collaborative activist; final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk in lyric structure heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
