<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “hauntingly optimistic” trait is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through contradiction or cost; she sleepwalk-sews without internal resistance, so the optimism feels decorative. The heirloom plate motivates entry but her interiority stays generic (“verses whispered to the waves”). No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure; the trance erases active decision-making, flattening potential flaw-driven tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dawn tapestry visibly reweights village rules, cost felt in the ruined docks left behind. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern is taught early (“sleepwalkers roamed”) and paid off when Elara’s needle makes the invisible overlaps visible. One soft teleport: the satchel spools appear without prior mention, a minor prop glitch that does not rupture the image.</comment>

<comment>Red canyon walls, petroglyphs, and cooling rock under bare feet deliver tactile specificity that constrains movement; the loom of tide pools sets a live clock. “Orchid-solace” dye becomes micro-setting, its purple visible in final seams. Spatial choreography stays clean across dream-veins; no impossible positions. Environment directly supplies the stone “cloth” she sews, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—replace shattered precedent with fluid grace—signals early and tightens when she violates the low-tide ban. Agency is accumulative-textural: each stitch deepens pattern density rather than forcing a causal fork. Cost is present but generalized (“ruin reverenced”); no single tool or stamina loss alters later tactics. Escalation is a cadence shift: petroglyphs brighten, walls hum, dawn arrives—stakes reweighted through sensory intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: tradition’s fracture vs. dream-mended continuity, never sermonized. “Broken precedents” recur as visible ledger fragments and petroglyph warnings, reweighted when new tapestry overrides them. Final image offers quiet Charged Poise: villagers climb fluid seams, no moral stated. Ambiguity lingers—will the threads endure the next storm—inviting reflection without tidy answers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains stable distance; no head-hopping. Diction stays within POV’s poetic register—“gossamer threads dyed the hue of orchid solace”—without academic drift. Rhythm swells and subsides with trance cadence, mirroring sleepwalking pulse. Filter verbs are sparse; metaphors stay coherent (“veins in the canyon’s vast body”). Voice modulates from mourning hush to dawn hush, consistent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence runs. Some metaphor density in peak beats—“orchid solace that soothed the soul’s sharpest thorns”—but pattern is taught early and justified by poetic voice. One paraphrase loop: “broken precedents… shattered… crumbled” within three lines costs −0.2. Information density high; most lines braid image, motion, myth. Closure image (“threads of dream sewing eternity’s gentle mend”) lands clean, no figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sleepwalking cartography with textile repair feels fresh; labyrinth-as-loom transforms familiar maze trope. “Overlapping sleepwalking paths” made visible by sewing is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking—trance rather than conscious quest—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic forest; canyon petroglyphs and tide-clock anchor uniqueness.</comment>
