<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s inherited guilt and perceptual gift are vivid, but the pivot from passive reception of echoes to active atonement is declared rather than dramatized; the final vow carries intellectual rather than bodily cost. Interiority is atmospheric yet loops the same note of ancestral dread. No secondary character on page, so relational crucible inapplicable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the film-strip vision reweights the family premise and Elias vows confession, cost felt in the instant the manor’s hum “softens.” Causal chain is sound—diary → darkroom → film → revelation—but the foreclosure is oratorical (“he vowed”) not embodied action. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Vines, ash, and echo-drenched stone are filtered through Elias’s cartographer ear, constraining movement and pacing breath-to-breath. The ivy-veiled passage literally tightens around him, a micro-setting that supplies tactile resistance just before the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy supports momentum; no spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ancestral guilt versus confession—tightens once: the film negative reveals engineered quakes, foreclosing denial. Cost is conceptual (moral burden made undeniable) rather than tactical; no tool or stamina loss alters next moves. Escalation is singular but sufficient under Accumulative lens; pressure peaks at the glimpse, not after.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as both violation and restitution. Final image of “sketching atonement” reconfigures cartography from conquest to confession without moralizing. Subtext whispers through burned pages and weeping walls; no late thesis statement. Ambiguity lingers—can ink erase seismic sin?—inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: echo-damp, ash-bit, vine-slick diction mirrors Elias’s listening body. Rhythm swells with clause-lengthening as echoes build, then snaps to short vow when the vision hits. No dialogue to contaminate; free indirect stays clean. Patterned elision (“walls dreamed”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances map, memory, or atmosphere. Occasional purple peaks (“seismic sorrow”) but metaphor obeys physical logic. One paraphrase loop—“legacy’s burden” repeated twice−0.2. No filter-verb stacks; propulsion breathes with scene tempo. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>“Echo cartographer” freshens post-climate ruin exploration; seismic land-grab backstory is less novel yet grounded in Elias’s sensory method. Risk taken in lyric echo-development pays off. Familiar ancestral-sin template but specific auditory mapping keeps it from interchangeability.</comment>
