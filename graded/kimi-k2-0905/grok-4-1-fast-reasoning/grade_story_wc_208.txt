<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority pulses—contradictory awe and humility toward the storm and relic—but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted more than embodied in micro-choices; her final resolve is signaled, not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara steps into a wind-cleared path carrying the lantern-sculpture; cost is felt because the GPS failure + alliance vision reweights her solitude as portal. Causal chain holds, but causality is lyrical rather than strict; lens = Accumulative/Textural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Driftwood, lantern-slide, and archway form a tactile micro-setting; storm spray and turbine-hum narrow perception; final sculpture-lantern constrains the literal path home, anchoring the closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival + artistic re-visioning—tightens when slide projections foreclose isolation; agency is present (carving, fire-lighting). Cost is conceptual (ancestral load) more than visceral; escalation is lyrical deepening, not sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—complexity scaffolded by simplicity—emerges through recursive driftwood carving and layered epochs; final line “simple wood holding the storm’s complex heart” crystallizes without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: alliances feel both wondrous and unsettling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice owns a turbine cadence, salted diction, and lyric compression; perceptual signature is consistent (“turbine-hum reverie” threads). No dialogue, so no register drift; elision is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with storm gusts, sentences vary; several near-metaphor stacks (“turbine-hum reverie… mechanical moan… turbine-humming”) verge on repetitive but serve motif. Information density high; no mixed metaphors or loops that stall closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing GPS-tech failure with magic-lantern timeslip through driftwood sculpture feels fresh; temporal alliance concept lifts standard “lost artist” trope. Risky lyric structure holds coherence; specificity of carved sigils vs rising seas grounds novelty.</comment>
