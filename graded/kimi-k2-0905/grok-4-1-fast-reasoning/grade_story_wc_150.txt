<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s exile-and-return motive is clear, but interiority floats in atmospheric paraphrase (“faith flickered,” “yearned to restore”) rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (digging, fitting root-gnomon) are present yet feel instructional, not charged; no moment forces her to risk or relinquish anything visible. The rebuilt sundial is catharsis-by-implication only; cost is atmospheric, not embodied. Voice is consistent, but emotion stays at scenic distance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the aligned shadow re-orients Elara toward the sacred mountain, re-weighting earlier exile, visible in “time’s wheel turning unbroken.” Causal chain holds: exile → orchard → excavation → sundial → rekindled vocation. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered. However, escalation is gentle—no tightening beat forecloses an option or raises tangible price; tension remains contemplative rather than consequential under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is sketched with macabre economy—bones as “forgotten relics,” roots “possessively between ribcages”—and the image of apple blossoms drifting onto skulls is indelible. Spatial layout stays coherent across fourteen days of action. Weathered granite, lichen-crust, gnomon slot all supply tactile micro-setting that later constrains the rebuild, satisfying 9+ gate. A few stock cues (“dusty road,” “gnarled trees”) slightly dilute specificity but never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore personal faith—is signaled early; pressure accumulates through artifact finds, not narrowing options. No reversal or resource loss complicates tactics; risk is spiritual and static. The sundial’s function points the way, but choosing to follow is deferred beyond the text, so cost is prospective, not paid. Escalation is atmospheric deepening rather than a crucible that forecloses paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges organically from bone-readings and the gnomon’s broken shadow; no authorial thesis states it. Final image of wheeling stars above the glowing dial invites reflection on circular time versus linear exile. Ambiguity lingers: will restored faith survive outside the orchard? Subtext stays in gesture (roots cradling granite) rather than assertion. A slight抽象 echo in “purposeful wandering” phrase nudes toward thematic label, but refrain is brief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent archaic cadence—“ere it breaks,” “thy path”—that fits pilgrim lore without drifting into purple. Perceptual signature is lightly present: Elara notices botanical minutiae, maps, amulet, all filtered through an antiquarian eye. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Filter verbs minimal; rhythm breathes with dusk-to-dawn cycles. A few template stems (“Across final days… she fitted…”) momentarily flatten propulsion but recover.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates well between long lyrical lines and short tactile bursts (“Blade struck something unyielding.”). Information density is high: one line can deliver time-jump, artifact, and symbolic freight. Minor scaffold: “excavating across hours that blurred into days” repeats temporal compression twice; “cautious enchantment” phrase recycles four times, creating template echo. Closure image is clean, but preceding paragraph holds three “time” references in four lines, dulling edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combining catacomb orchard with pilgrimage sundial is fresh synthesis; pilgrim-ossuary is real history, yet grafting a time-finding device onto bones offers new inflection. Risk is quiet—no twist, just contemplative archaeology—but emotional stakes feel specific to Elara’s diaspora scar. Story would collapse if relocated to generic graveyard, passing transformation test. Still, concept’s quietness keeps it shy of breakout boldness.</comment>
