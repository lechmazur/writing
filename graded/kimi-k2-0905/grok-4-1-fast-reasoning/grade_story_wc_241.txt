<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior contradiction—adoring her father's equations yet fearing his ruin—remains concrete in the lantern-handling beats and the micro-choice to board the train; the final renunciation to publish responsibly is seeded early and paid with the candle's extinguished cost. The only drag is a faint therapeutic overtone ("widen perspectives responsibly") that never quite becomes an embodied flaw with visible fallout; still, the hierarchy of values is legible and the arc feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds: graffiti riddles thicken the texture of chance until the final archive reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by sentence three; the single transition (train → secret wing) is cued by "mica gleams where shadows pool," and closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the candle’s dying glow re-frames the father’s paradoxes as publishable data rather than inherited doom. Cost is unmistakable in the cooled mica pane—a quiet, felt forfeiture of pure rebellion.</comment>

<comment>Rain-washed stone, clover vapour, and the diffused mica glow are selectively returned so that weather and object charge the final image; the lantern functions as micro-setting, constraining her choice to read in low light and later to extinguish. Spatial choreography remains coherent across subway transfers and the forgotten stairwell. One minor slip: the “abandoned station” materialises without prior map cue, but the lantern line immediately re-anchors us, so the waiver applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“inherit genius without ruin”—tightens with each graffito that literalises the father’s paradoxes; the final manuscript confrontation forces a public/private trade-off that was not live at start. Escalation is textural: density of contradictions increases until the archive re-weights the stake rather than explodes it. Cost is visible in the extinguished candle and the cooled mica—tangible, minor, but sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of gambling metaphors repurposed as academic data; the final image reframes “lucid contradiction” as publishable scholarship rather than private vice. No moralising sentence summarises the lesson—the cooled lantern performs the insight. The refusal to redeem the father, only to re-use his fragments, keeps ambiguity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect texture is consistent: Elena’s perception tilts toward probabilistic metaphors (“odds reset,” “quantum superpositions”) without ever ventriloquising her father. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under subway fluorescents, longer sweep during library quiet. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained; the rare elevated term (“mica pane,” “filigree”) is justified by academic lineage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: patter of participles mimics rain, then compresses into staccato seat-rhymes; no template cadence. Information density is high—each graffiti line carries double duty as setting and stakes. One near-loop: “lucid contradiction” is repeated four times; the variance in context saves it from artifact, but the echo is audible. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the final image breathe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “cryptic subway scrawl treasure hunt” is fresh, yet the core move—inheritance reframed by hidden manuscript—leans on familiar academic-legacy tropes. Specificity of probability jargon and the mica lantern’s reuse lift it above template. Risk is moderate: mosaic structure with graffiti pattern is taught early and pays off, but the twist is gentle rather than startling.</comment>
