<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Elowen’s disenchantment and thirst for self-reclamation are etched in every beat; the “spider-silk menace” interiority is concrete, never abstract. Her final inhale of starlight is a visceral micro-choice that costs her the last of her innocence, earning the Resonant Reconfiguration. Thorne’s quiet anchor role is efficient, though his interiority remains a cipher—acceptable at this length. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse under the velvet command.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because she is hollowed by courtly poison, therefore she climbs; because she climbs, she meets the grotto’s offer and takes it. The bleeding starlight is both literal pool and dynastic curse—tight conceptual linkage. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Closure lands with visible cost: “power woven in menace as fine as lace” forecloses her former self; the lens never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ember-grotto walls “shimmered cobalt-blue, veined with embers that flickered without flame” constrains the final choice—she can literally see the price glowing. Body-as-setting is tracked: ragged breath, palms bitten by rope, gown trailing like spilled mercury—each tactile detail narrows her options. Spatial choreography is pristine from throne mirror to ridge spine to cavern dome. The grotto’s living crown of fireflies is the charged final image, impossible to swap out.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim her soul from dream-tyranny—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when she touches the pool: surrender heart or stay hollow. One meaningful turn suffices; the vortex of fireflies is the irreversible narrowing. Cost is legible: she forfeits untainted humanity for “vengeful grace.” No coincidence; every escalation is because/therefore under her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: starlight as ancestral debt, crown as living shackle. No sermon—final image of “thorns hidden in petals” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity is rich: is vengeance salvation or deeper curse? The grotto’s offer is not moralized, only enacted. Subtext in Thorne’s silent blade-draw says more than pages of court dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hovers at velvet distance, never leaking outside Elowen’s ken. Syntax glimmers: “gown trailing like spilled mercury” is perception-specific, not tourist catalog. Firefly vortex is patterned early (summer’s first) and paid off as crown—taught and legible. No head-hop; Thorne’s blade tension is observed, not interiorized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: long breathless climbs contract to “Breath ragged” fragments under peak stress. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight as blood, lace as noose—without mixed vehicle crashes. One scaffold trace: “lacy menace” appears twice; forgiven because it recharges closure. Information density high; each sentence layers sight, tactility, and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar queen-ascends-to-mystical-cavern template is re-animated through sensory specificity and dynastic-curse angle. Fireflies as crown of living light feels fresh, not borrowed fantasy kit. Risk taken: no battle, only inhalation of cosmic guilt—quiet reversal of power quest. Could swap names yet emotional core would hold, keeping it sub-8.5.</comment>
