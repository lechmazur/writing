<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s dread of enclosed spaces and her hunger for open sky drive every move; the contradiction is lived in body (clutching trellis vs. chest tightening in vine cradle). The porcelain doll Mira acts as second skin—she strokes it, fills it, clutches it—so her “archive of silences” is never abstract. Father remains off-page, yet his bunker shadow is felt as live counter-pressure. Final beat: she tastes gilded hush, a sensory cost that makes her refusal of bunkers credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each silence gathered thickens the stake; inversion acts as pattern-deepening cadence shift. Closure—Elara floating down, doll brimming, father’s hammers distant—earns Charged Poise: her stance is crystallized, cost legible in the opulent weight on tongue and porcelain. No causal contradiction; gravity rule is taught early, inversion complicates rather than rescues. Orientation clean by line 10.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sky-trellis is handled, not catalogued: vines curl “hospitably,” snag clothes, mimic bunker walls—environment as pressure tool. Inversion flips spatial logic, forcing new sprout geography; body becomes orienting device. Gilded hush sprout and porcelain doll recur as micro-settings that charge final image. Weather, height, vine density all shift tactical access; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: hoard silences vs. impending bunker return. Hourglass of inversion tightens time; noise-weaver’s intrusion is live antagonistic pressure that threatens archive. Escalation: sideways gravity → scarce golden sprout → claustrophobic entrapment → theft risk; each step forecloses retreat. Cost: swallowed claustrophobia, doll’s fragile core now sole vessel—loss of either = silence collapse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme: acquirable silence as rebellion against engineered dread. Emerges through concrete acts—veiling sprouts, uncorking doll—never asserted. Final taste of “eternity’s quiet gold” reweights father’s mechanical silence as impoverished. Ambiguity lingers: will gilded drop survive the bunker? No moralizing; resonance carried by taste and weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lush, airborne syntax mirrors Elara’s aerial craving; diction stays within her skyfarer lexicon (“sky-roots,” “dandelion seed”). Patterned inversion of adjective-noun pairs (“intangibly tangible,” “contracted into infinity”) taught early and paid off at sprout capture. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior; perceptual signature consistent. Rhythm swells then hushes in sync with gravity flip—line-level music supports pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High figurative density but each image serves traction: vines “curling hospitably” = safety + entrapment. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay vegetal/aerial. One paraphrase loop—“silences sprouted here…delicate buds unfurling”—but immediately justified by craft process. Filter verbs rare; action and taste keep momentum. Closing line “Silence sprouted eternal” lands as earned cadence echo, not ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sky-trellis that farms flavored silence under hourly gravity inversion feels fresh yet inevitable. Combines harvest mythology with vertigo physics; no prior echo in market. Porcelain doll as volatile vessel re-enchants object trope. Risk: dense lyric could clog, but payoff in final taste justifies gamble. Conceptual integrity unbroken—every rule declared is pressure-tested.</comment>
