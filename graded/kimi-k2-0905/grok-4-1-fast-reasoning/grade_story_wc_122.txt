<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to feel while doubting she can—stays embodied through tactile micro-choices (crimping cavern wire, guiding Thorne’s palm). The climactic self-healing is foreshadowed by her earlier refusal to quit the broken needle; the cost is the exposed vulnerability of conducting communal tears. Status shift with Thorne is cleanly staged: she becomes the leader of a rite, visibly shaking him out of grief-stasis. Voice remains consistent: her deafness filters every observation through vibration, never abstracted into “I feel sad” labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrored hush filament reconfigures the cavern into a shared resonant chamber and forecloses Elara’s numbness with undeniable cost—her private wound becomes public instrument. Causal chain holds: cracked needle → backward spin → filament discovery → communal rite → her thaw. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 3. Only minor drag: two exposition sentences (“These were backward recorded songs…”) mid-climb could have been dramatized through Elara’s hands reading the etched groove.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but resonant tool: cavern walls become vibration conduit, drum-stretched hides act as amplification membranes, phonograph horn a “petrified shout.” The body-as-instrument micro-setting (palms to stone, ribcage as cavity) constrains every action and is reprised in the final image. Seasonal rustle is threaded through cracks rather than dumped; it tightens the final hush by contrast. Spatial choreography stays legible as students circle the phonograph—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—pierce her own numbness—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through two tightenings: (1) needle repair risks ruining the relic, (2) communal rite risks exposing her failure. Each move raises social-emotional cost; the filament’s silence reflects each listener’s private void, turning personal stake into communal pressure. Agency remains hers: she chooses the backward spin, invites Thorne, orchestrates the night. No coincidence resolves; the final thaw is earned by her orchestration of others’ catharsis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: music’s inverse—silence—becomes the only tone loud enough to reawaken feeling. The mirrored hush motifies through shifting meaning: first a defect of warped vinyl, finally a communal mirror that costs privacy. Subtext operates in gesture (Thorne’s hovering hammer) and silence (students syncing breath). Final image refuses moral: no one speaks; the cavern simply pulses new quiet, leaving reader to weigh whether shared void heals or replaces individual song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s vibration-filtered perception: every sound is “audibly muted,” every emotion arrives through bone. Syntax lengthens in reverberative clauses that mimic echo, then fractures into imperative signing gestures under pressure. No head-hop; Thorne’s tears are seen from outside, keeping POV clean. Distinct perceptual signature—palette of hush, tremor, wire—reprises in final sentence, reinforcing voice unity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long vibration-sentences swell, then clipped fragments when needle drops. Metaphors stay physical (“horn flared like a petrified shout”) and consistent with acoustic world. No synonym loops; each return of “hush” accrues new charge. One mixed vehicle—“shadows pooled like forgotten echoes”—is forgivable amid otherwise precise imagery that never stalls action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf protagonist + reverse phonograph + silence-as-sound offers inversion that feels inevitable. Risk of concept story is overcome by anchoring abstraction in tactile cavern craft; the hush filament could only surface via backward groove and vibration-trained touch. Not a gimmick—narrative commits fully, never explains away the magic. Specificity of drum-maker culture and seasonal rustle prevents template echo.</comment>
