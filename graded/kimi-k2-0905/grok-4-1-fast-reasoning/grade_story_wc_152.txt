<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory performance—dotty babble vs. steel-trap chart correction—plays out in continuous, embodied beats (thumb-prick, pulse-stitch, tea-spill) that cost her blood, time, and personal safety. Every micro-choice is rooted in the same twin motives: cosmic listening and queen-protection, culminating in the courier beat where her “silly” spill slips the life-saving chart into the satchel. The contradiction is never explained away; instead it sharpens until the final charged poise where she keeps stitching, path foreclosed, candle affirming the price. Voice, perception, and gesture stay singular and idiosyncratic; no competence inflation or moral safety net.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because she spots forged star-threads, therefore she re-stitches, therefore slips the corrected chart to the palace, foreclosing the coup. Closure is the charged poise of her continuing to embroider while the realm’s fate is now altered—undeniable conceptual cost visible in the candle’s approving flare and the autumn leaves that echo approaching soldiers. Anchors (who/where/when) are fixed within the first 60 words; orientation never wavers. No info teleporting; every celestial or tactile detail is earned on-page.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt walls, domed stained glass, and the fuel-less candle are not backdrop—they physically shape her work-light, hide spies in balconies, and let autumn leaves sound like marching boots, directly cueing her feints. The eternal candle’s physics is introduced as founding relic, not explained, but its rhythm synchronizes her needle—an on-page constraint that charges closure. Spatial choreography is immaculate; hoop, satchel, tea-cup, and courier’s hand track cleanly through the single continuous scene. Selective sensory hierarchy favors touch and hearing over visual gloss, matching an old embroiderer’s narrowed vigilance.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent queen’s fall via stellar truth—tightens once: discovery of falsified spiral → covert correction → courier transfer, each beat narrowing her options and raising exposure. Cost is felt: blood, burned secrecy, and the irreversible moment chart leaves observatory. No coincidence resolves; the autumn courier arrives as scheduled, she weaponizes the routine. Under causal lens, escalation is lean but sufficient for 680-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge hidden in apparent foolishness—emerges solely through staged ridiculousness that saves the realm; no character ever names the theme. Subtext lives in gesture: giggle vs. needle’s steel, tea-spill vs. flawless chart. Final image of her humming onward reweights earlier “nonsense rhymes” as encrypted annals of state. Avoids moral closure; ambiguity persists—will queen act in time?—yielding lingering resonance rather than packaged wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close clings to Elara’s synesthetic perception: silk murmurs, candle “approves,” leaves “tap-tap like footfalls.” Diction stays aged-domestic—“silly stars,” “silly weather”—never drifts into stargazer jargon despite astrophysical stakes. Syntax mirrors embroidery rhythm: paratactic clauses, thread-like commas, occasional breath-length fragment. No head-hop; courier’s interior stays opaque. Compressed elision (“By dawn’s gray promise…”) taught early and paid off when chart blooms complete without step-by-step exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic variety matches tension: long filament sentences for stitching flow, abrupt exclamations for feigned senility. Information density high—one sentence often layers cosmic scale, tactile detail, and social ruse simultaneously. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase echo (“echoed silence” repeated) but occurs in opening/closure resonance pattern, hence forgiven. No filter-verb stacks; actions stay kinetic. Proofing clean; no typos or homophones.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses aging-craftsperson trope with astrophysical espionage in a non-obvious way; embroidery as classified data correction feels fresh yet inevitable. Eternal candle and adjacent-possible star nudges are familiar speculative crumbs, but their coordination through textile handiwork transforms them. Risk taken in quiet ending—no battle, just humming needle—yet coherence holds. Could not swap setting or craft without collapsing plot logic.</comment>
