<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-forged focus and “volcanic tenderness” give her a visceral, embodied interiority; every micro-choice (brushing the figurine, piecing the slashed portrait) grows from the twin engines of love and rage. The final collapse beside Theo’s marble lovers is a credibly earned renunciation—she accepts guardianship in place of reunion—whose cost is felt in the whisper of his name. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “analytically intuitive mind” is diagnostic label-speak that momentarily cools the lava.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flame/scroll sculpture crystallizes her new stance—guardian of knowledge, torch-bearer of memory—with the vault’s intact scrolls as undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each artwork adds density until the final tapestry reweights the premise. Causality holds: arson → underground trail → vault; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“deep underground where no grid could reach”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust-choked chambers, humid wool-scented air, and faintly warm ochres make the archive a tactile adversary that guides every step. The clay figurine’s east-pointing threads and the tapestry’s metallic inks are micro-settings that literally steer her path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: loose panel → spiral stair → vault, bodies and distances tracked without drift. Environment constrains the final choice: only the vault’s untouched scrolls can eternalize their story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue Theo’s promise—signals in line 5 and tightens with each artwork that forecloses wrong turns. The slashed self-portrait delivers the decisive micro-turn: gashes reveal coordinates, narrowing options from search to descent. Cost is visible: she trades personal reunion for archival guardianship, a price legible in her collapsing whisper. Pressure escalates via pattern-break—warm paint, weeping pigment—rather than external antagonist, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory as arson and archive, love as both destroyer and preserver. The flame/scroll sculpture reconfigures the opening fire into a hearth of knowledge—an image that reweights every prior burn. No moralizing, only charged poise: “volcanic tenderness” becomes the archive’s permanent warmth. Subtext resides in slashed eyes still “imploring,” silence where explanation would cheapen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Elara’s synesthetic perception—paint “warm as if Theo had just laid it down,” wool-scented air—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm swells and contracts with her pulse: long breaths of description compress into “her breath hitched” at revelation. No head-hopping; diction remains within her volcanic lexicon. The final whisper is syntactic diminuendo that lands the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Volcanic tenderness burned in her chest for Theo” advances both emotion and metaphor without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—lava, obsidian, hearth—forming a coherent thermal arc. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Only a flicker of filter (“she spotted”) but immediacy recovers in the same line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The arsonist-becomes-archivist inversion freshens the “lover’s treasure trail” trope by making the treasure unlootable knowledge rather than gold. Theo’s self-vandalized portrait as map is a specific, non-obvious twist that feels inevitable once seen. Risk—lyric compression, no living antagonist—pays off via accumulative density rather than causal duel. The civilization remains offstage, preventing encyclopedic dump while keeping focus on personal cost.</comment>
