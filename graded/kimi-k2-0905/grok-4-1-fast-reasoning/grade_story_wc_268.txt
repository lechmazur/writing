<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirion’s quiet, scholarly vigil is vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted (“titanic essence” vs. child-size) rather than dramatized in a moment of choice; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. The final smile is earned, yet the cost is cosmic, not personal—he never risks or loses anything we see. Still, the embodied image of the tiny guardian amid infinite shelves keeps him particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the rune-laden book arrives at coronation, sundering the pretender’s claim without blood. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each inscribed book deepens the pattern until the final pellet detonates truth. The lens holds; drift’s cost is the library’s eternal pause—Lirion remains snared, victory tasted only at distance. One scaffold loop—“graceful collapse” repeated—barely dulls the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The temple library is no postcard: drifting constellations outside the arches, iron gall ink dissolving in spring water, vellum drinking tannic black—each tactile detail filters through Lirion’s custodial gaze and constrains his only weapon. Shelves “towering to infinity” double as spatial prison, forcing the cryptic-message tactic. The micro-setting of the hidden pouch and crumbling genealogy volume charges the final beat when the same ink undoes a throne.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early: false king will “unravel the cosmos’ fragile weave.” Pressure escalates by accretion—each planted book erodes loyalty; the final missive topples coronation mid-ceremony. No visible personal cost to Lirion keeps it from 8.8, but the pattern’s tightening is unmistakable: every drift-runed book narrows the usurper’s options until only collapse remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “truth drifts, then strikes”: ink permanence vs. mirrored illusion. Subtext lives in the rune itself—wanderlust of thought weaponized against forged lineage. No moral is stated; the final image of banners “falling like autumn leaves” reweights prior whispers into inevitable harvest. Complexity is present but cosmic rather than human, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lirion’s perceptual sieve: “dust motes hung eternal,” “ink bloomed rusty-black.” Syntax lengthens into cadenced clauses that mimic constellational pause, then snaps short at collapse. No head-hopping; diction remains archaic yet precise. One near-lapse—“regally unpretentious” feels editorial rather than perceived—barely grazes the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from fluid participial openings to hammer-blow monosyllables at collapse. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful: “tannic heart dark as forgotten oaths” marries ink to covenant. No loops or scaffold; every paragraph advances pattern or image. A single mixed metaphor—“throne is chaff before the gale”—is minor against the overall music.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: titan-librarian weaponizes bibliographic drift against counterfeit genealogy. The rune-propelled book-mail is a new delivery system for palace intrigue. Risk lies in cosmic stakes without human cost, but the concept commits fully. Near-inevitable in hindsight, yet not seen before.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: diminutive titan introduced first paragraph. Development: chooses cryptic messages because physical exit impossible. Payoff: final smile as drift-runed book sunder throne. Cost is existential—eternal vigil continues—yet choice drives every beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Pellet dissolved for ink, reappears as dust on final page to amplify sigil. Two distinct handling beats; permanence of iron gall mirrors permanence of truth. Without it, messages fade, plot fails.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rune of drift is inscribed, activated, and finally detonates coronation. Enables the only tactic available; shapes every message’s travel. Closure image depends on its spectral ignition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>“Regally unpretentious” is shown via simplespun robes whispering against giant floors, contrast with cosmic duty. Constrains his stealth—no ostentation alerts spies. Trait reappears in quiet smile at end, costing him spectacle.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Sunder” is literal at climax: veil of illusion ripped, banners fall, throne legitimacy split. Word appears only in final missive, making the action hinge on its exact force. Removing it weakens the collapse cadence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Method is signaled in first third, executed across multiple beats, and delivers the decisive book. Mechanics of rune-ink permanence vs. forged scrolls are essential; without hidden messages, no pressure builds.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Library’s temporal snare forces the ink-message tactic; infinite shelves supply every needed volume. Setting appears in opening, mid-plantings, and final hush. Remove it, no constraint, no story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Constellational pause is named early, broken only at closure when truth resumes time. Creates the slow-burn window for message drift. Not a ticking clock but a frozen river that finally cracks.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Motivation declared in paragraph four, reiterated with each inscription. Drives every micro-choice; final smile confirms payoff. No competing want dilutes it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Graceful collapse modulates from hush of drifting pages to slow-motion banner fall, ending in “silken ruin.” Tone remains consistent, charges final image with elegiac inevitability.</comment>
