<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—playful spinner vs. burdened wanderer—surfaces in the fire-knot twirl and the vow to “light every dusk,” but the shift from defiance to communal hope is asserted rather than embodied; no bodily cost or irreversible forfeiture is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: spinner’s knot → filter → mosaic blueprint → built rocket → sky-bloom → villagers’ wonder; the final image of vines claiming the scaffold supplies visible conceptual cost, earning Resonant Reconfiguration under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Luminous vines, iridescent tiles, and kerosene stink are filtered through Elias’s pyro-perception; the fire’s glow off mosaic tesserae directly enables the blueprint reveal, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the pivotal discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—tightens when the mosaic note offers a concrete tactical path; the rocket’s launch forecloses the old wandering life, price legible in the spent scaffold claimed by vines.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of art as counter-gravity emerges from the rocket’s bloom mirrored in the fortress flowers; the final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though the communal epiphany is slightly generalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at Elias’s sensory frequency—kerosene scent, petal rustle, chant cadence—compressing time without head-hop; rhythmic parallelism (“Spin the knot, sift the night”) is pattern-taught and paid off in the closing twirl.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and clause, propelling the night walk; occasional modifier stacks (“enormous, petals of crimson, gold, and sapphire”) flirt with excess but never stall causality or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing pyrotechnic craft with living mosaic yields a fresh mythic texture; risk lies in the lyric chant risking repetition, yet the specificity of the spinner’s knot as lens keeps the concept from feeling gimmicky.</comment>
