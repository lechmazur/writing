<comment>Elara’s remorse over Lirien is the single, concrete engine of every micro-choice; the “foxglove” metaphor is repeatedly embodied (toxic pulse in veins, tears). Interiority stays sensory—“petals unfurled, absorbing names”—never sliding into diagnostic speak. The final kneel amid glowing shards is an earned renunciation whose cost (tube lost, Lirien still gone) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is crisp: cracked tube → echo-song → light → orchid bloom → name preservation, repeated in four wings with rising stakes. Closure is a decisive change: the tube shatters, path foreclosed, all names secured but tool destroyed. Cost is visible—“bamboo shards tinkling like final regrets.” Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The opal library, cloud winds, and glass orchids are filtered through Elara’s tactile caretaking; each wing’s extinct emotion is rendered via specific sensory hinge (“cobwebbed laughter-mirrors”). The cracked bamboo constrains every beat of progress and literally splinters the finale—meets 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating white-room moments.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve names before they vanish—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens each time the tube’s crack widens. One meaningful escalation per wing: absorption of nomad names, then revelers, then melancholics, finally “Lirien” ghost-name—each step paid with escalating tube damage. Agency remains hers; winds complicate but never solve. Final cost: tool destroyed, task complete but irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as toxic yet vital—emerges from concrete iterated action rather than assertion. Subtext resides in the shift from “foxglove regret” poisoning her veins to the same bloom glowing in the orchids: poison transmuted into preservation. No moralizing line; final image of shard-lit orchids offers resonant, ambiguous consolation. Reader left weighing memory’s sting versus its necessity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent glass-lit diction: “opal,” “iridescent,” “crystalline resonance.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Elara’s caretaker gaze—she never notices what a tourist would. Syntax flexes under pressure—fragments appear as the tube fractures—mirrors rising stakes. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtextual rhythm without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances either orchid handling, tube use, or emotional cost. Metaphors stay coherent—light as dawn, shards as regrets—and never stack into purple overload. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clause when wind howls, then brittle single-word sentence “Shattered.” No synonym loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The glass-orchid library of extinct feelings is a fresh synthesis; cracked bamboo as memory needle feels inevitable yet new. Risky repetition of ritual four times pays off via escalating physical cost. Final ghost-echo of Lirien reweights earlier regret without sentimental twist. Concept commits fully—no retreat to generic fantasy furniture—and yields a memorable, specific vision.</comment>
