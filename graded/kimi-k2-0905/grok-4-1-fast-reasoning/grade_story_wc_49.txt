<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “dancing over gears,” laughter “a soft chime”—and her motive (restore sacred practices) is anchored to concrete memory of grandmother’s songs. The micro-choice to begin singing under moon-dawn alignment turns the loom; that act is embodied, not abstract. No contradictory impulses are staged in real time, so the “internal conflict” bullet is only weakly met; the cost is communal, not personal, blunting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final hush lifts into “murmurs of thanks,” a palpable social cost—village lives now orbit the revived rites. Causal chain: moon-set → song → loom spins → golden stories rain → blight retreats; each step is on-page and irreversible. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (woven platform, eastern horizon) appear by line 4. The lens is Causal; because/therefore linkage holds without ellipsis missteps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Verdant arbor at dawn” is rendered through motion—tendrils harvested, gears of beetle wing, moonlight on leaves—so environment constrains tool choice and ritual timing. The loom itself functions as micro-setting: its vine spindle dictates the choreography of spinning. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and sound, but touch (“supple yet unbreakable”) is leveraged at the hinge beat. Weather is implicit (moon-set/sun-rise) and drives the alignment clock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save arbor from blight—tightens once: the moon dips, Elowen must sing now or lose the weave. The price is paid on-page: blight “retreating like shadows at noon,” villagers compelled to reenact rites they had abandoned. Agency is hers alone; coincidence merely complicates (moon lingers). Escalation is single but decisive; no option is foreclosed beyond the communal endurance of renewed ritual, so cost is visible yet not agonizingly personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme—memory as living thread—emerges through the loom’s golden stories rather than assertion. The final image of “vines thickened around the arbor” reweights the opening hush into sustainable future. Subtext operates in gesture: villagers “eyes wide” as stories imprint visions—no one states “we must remember.” Avoids overt moralizing; however, the grandmother memory is named rather than dramatized, a minor abstraction that keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-limited stays pinned to Elowen’s perception; no head-hop. Diction—“tinkered whimsically,” “thistledown voice”—is idiosyncratic and consistent with her tinkerer vocation. Syntax modulates: longer, lyrical sentences during weave; short pulses at alignment. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is concrete (“eyes bright with mischief and memory”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: opening sibilants mimic hush; loom-spinning sentences lengthen into spiral cadence. Metaphors (“silken veil,” “parched soil drinking rain”) are mixed but internally coherent; none violate arbor physics. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new information or image. Final line cadence—“the hush will gather again”—echoes opener, earning book-end payoff. Minor “golden stories” repetition is thematic, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Fusion of DIY biomechanics (acorn gears, beetle wings) with lunar agriculture is fresh; avoids generic eco-fantasy. The “loom that spins stories” literalizes narrative-as-food, a conceptual risk that pays off when blight retreats. Transformation test fails—names could swap—but the specificity of vine-tendril mechanics and moon alignment keeps it distinctive. No close echoes of canonical scenes; arbor ritual feels invented, not borrowed.</comment>
