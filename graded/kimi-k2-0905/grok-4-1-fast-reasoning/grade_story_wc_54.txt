<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “functionally creative” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices (sextant alignment, panel splicing) that carry visible cost—her steady hands despite fatigue, the risk of overload. Interiority stays concrete, but the arc is thin: she wants “equations for hope” yet never confronts an internal contradiction or sacrifice; the only cost is off-page stamina. The result is competent, not crucible-level transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: sextant → star-sight → scanner coordinates → reroute flows → resonator reboot. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the terminal now offers star-paths she may never board, “hope quantified” but also commodified. One minor scaffold: “equations for hope” is repeated without deepening. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Terminal is lived-in: confetti underfoot, rust in sinks, dome crack aligning Polaris. The sextant doubles as micro-setting and plot key, constraining her body posture and final calibration. Selective sensory triage—smell of ozone, low groan of pressure—keeps momentum. Could use one tactile setback (shock, burn) to raise stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove decay reversible—tightens when mis-wiring could fry both her and the resonator; sparks are felt price. Escalation is linear, not recursive; no second reversal or trade-off. Agency is high; coincidence absent. Sufficient for 800-word window, but lacks a final narrowing—once power hums, risk evaporates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: hope as engineered redirection, not miracle. The resonator’s star-maps reweight earlier “equations” from abstract math to lived possibility, avoiding moral statement. Subtext in the sextant’s broken arc mirrors fractured infrastructure. No pseudo-profundity, but theme stays safe—no counter-argument or personal cost to complicate it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is steady, syntactically controlled, with engineer’s perceptual filter (“stress fractures whispered”). No head-hop; psychic distance stable. One register slip: “proto-AI designed to guide ships” sounds encyclopedic amid her idiom. Otherwise rhythm breathes with action, final sentence lands in cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses setting, tool, and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are spare and consistent. Minor over-modification: “vast halls” + “cracked ferrocrete” + “relic of interstellar dreams” in same breath. Clean grammar, precise verbs. Closure image uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of antique sextant with derelict spaceport AI feels fresh; trope inversion gives nautical intimacy to sci-fi ruin. Stakes stay human-scale engineering rather than galaxy-saving epic. Not radically original, but specificity (Polaris sight through dome crack) makes it memorable. Risk level moderate; could push further by letting the reboot fail partially.</comment>
