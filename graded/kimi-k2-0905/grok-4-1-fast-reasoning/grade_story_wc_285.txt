<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman’s interior contradiction—duty to untangle vows versus the serenity that mending brings—is dramatized through the needle’s micro-choices. Embodied emotion (fingers steady while rain slows) keeps sentiment off the page. The final knot costs him the comforting clutter of inherited ambiguity, a credible renunciation. Cap at 8.7 because the passenger remains a mirror, not a crucible, so relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the tapestry’s distilled essence reweights every prior layer and forecloses further revision; cost is felt in the “silence bloomed” beat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stitch adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and causality is internal but coherent. No artifact touches the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The yarn needle functions as micro-setting: its worn eye and coarse wool constrain stitching speed and decide which threads can stay or go. Fog-bound crossing limits visibility, forcing attention inward to tactile detail. River pulse syncs with heartbeat, charging the final image. Environmental evolution (rain → drip → silence) tracks internal progress without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clarify the palimpsest or lose ancestral meaning—tightens when each unpicked thread removes a comforting story. The single meaningful deepening occurs as the final stitch locks in the reduced vow, foreclosing future embroidery. Cost is the forfeiture of layered identities; no external antagonist needed. Escalation is textural, not causal, and fully legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of simplification: clarity demands amputation of ancestral noise. The re-emergent “ferry souls until the veil thins” reweights earlier oaths without moralizing. No echoic thesis is spoken; insight is lodged in the silent, empty eye of the needle. Ambiguity lingers—will distilled duty suffice?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the coachman’s perceptual filter—raindrop rhythm mirrors stitch cadence. Diction (“spindrift,” “palimpsest”) is within his artisan lexicon. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Compression (“yarn needle danced”) is taught early and paid off in the final knot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates with stitch beats, then lengthens into the hush of gutters stopping. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing”) are brief and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The palimpsest tapestry as ancestral obligation is fresh; the yarn needle becomes both editing tool and quill. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric stasis ending—no spectral attack or twist—yet coherence justifies the gamble. Specificity of Gloom Hill’s unnamed ford keeps the world from feeling generic. Transformation is internal but irreversible: the cloth can never be re-layered.</comment>
