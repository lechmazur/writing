<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “gently persistent” conviction is dramatized through repeated midnight runs and the bell-ringing climax, so her motive scales visibly. Interiority stays light—more label (“forgotten hope”) than embodied contradiction—but actions track cleanly with ethos. Tomas’s gruff-to-soft turn is credible because the anonymous gift economy pressures him on-page. No deep flaw complicates Mira, yet her endurance costs are legible in the final bell peal, satisfying short-form arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each anonymous basket triggers the next run; the bell peal crystallizes the covenant with communal cost. Orientation lands by line 5 (ridge, arbor, night). Closure is Earned Stasis—Mira’s people accept perpetual shadow risk, foreclosing open defiance. The beat is compressed but legible; no causality break, though escalation is gentle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: its acoustics amplify whispers and bell, shaping stealth tactics. Sensory selection (parched earth, olive scent) is POV-filtered and sparse, fitting scarcity frame. Spatial choreography stays coherent across night runs; no geography drift. Setting does not charge the final image beyond being backdrop, capping 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival via secrecy—tightens when enforcers nearly catch Lena, showing visible price. Escalation is cumulative, not causal-peril: each run thickens communal commitment. Cost is felt (Tomas’s cracked voice, Lena’s frozen breath), but stakes never pivot to higher external jeopardy. Sufficient for length, yet lacks a final fork that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through act, not sermon: anonymous care propagates endurance. Final bell reweights prior whispers into covenant, achieving quiet conceptual repricing. No tidy moral—only communal continuance—keeping ambiguity alive. “Shadow Harvest” coinage risks thematic echo but is uttered in-scene, not tacked-on moral, so penalty minimal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains “amplified quiet” cadence with controlled repetition. Perceptual signature is communal-collective rather than individuated, fitting exile chorus. No head-hops; distance stable. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Tomas’s grumble and Lena’s fierce addendum carry subtext. Register drifts slightly elevated (“malevolent fireflies”) but patterned early, forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic propulsion; sentence variety good. Occasional cushion phrases (“gently persistent grace,” “threads of forgotten hope”) flirt with template cadence but do not clog beats. No mixed metaphors or loops. Information density high; each paragraph advances communal state or risk. Minor scaffolding in repeated “amplified quiet” but serves motif, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Midnight food-run economy feels fresh against trope of embargoed exiles. Anonymous gift chain reversed into communal output offers non-obvious moral calculus. Arbor-acoustic stealth and silver-bell heartbeat are specific inflections. Risk is quiet, not gimmicky; payoff legible. Could push further into geopolitical nuance, but within 659 words it achieves memorable angle.</comment>
