<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-propelled quest is credible and embodied; the brother’s famine-death anchors every beat. Interiority stays concrete (“gaunt cheeks tightened,” “tip warm against her chest”). She acts under pressure—banking into the river-current, prying the conductor—each choice visibly narrowing risk. Only the final beat drifts toward convenient triumph rather than visible cost, keeping her from the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each “because” (family groves failed) drives “therefore” (invert-flight, theft of tip). The arrow’s removal triggers a clear Decisive Change—echoes wail, vines retract—paid for by the planet’s reaction and Elara’s trespass. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure lands with conceptual cost: she gains growth but silences a living chorus, a price felt in the hush that follows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating arches, up-cascading rivers, and root-etched cavern are selective, pressure-filtered details that guide flight choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys pilot priorities—airflow over color—so environment shapes tactics. The arrow-tip itself becomes micro-setting when it finally constrains growth. A hair’s-breadth slip: “orchards seemed to salute” edges toward sentiment, not terrain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive dead groves—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when inversion window threatens to collapse. Each beat raises cost: proximity alarms fail, vines recoil on theft, gravity reverts while echoes fade. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence only complicates. The price is visible: planet’s song damped, Elara morally indebted, groves unnaturally juiced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: survival through stolen resonance—life paid for by silencing planetary memory. The broken arrow reweights from relic to catalyst, making resilience morally double-edged. Final image—tip planted, silence returning—invites reflection on accelerated growth bought with echo-extinction. One soft note: “Her brother would have approved” edges toward explicit validation, trimming subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s pilot sensorium: “whirling silence,” “gaunt cheeks,” root-spongy footing under gloved fingers. Syntax compresses under inversion stress—“glider lurched skyward—no, downward”—mirroring vertigo. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains aviator-hydrological. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries rhythmic, wind-breath cadence that never flattens into tour-guide exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long glides to clipped tumbles; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, pressure-placed—“liquid starlight,” “ancient ribs”—never stacked. Information density high: one sentence often handles setting, tool, and emotional cue. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause advances. Copy-clean except one comma splice that actually serves breathless pilot voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard planet + inverted gravity + sonic-echo growth is a fresh synthesis; not a checklist mash-up because each element enables plot mechanics (flight path, time window, growth theft). The arrow’s fractal runes feel discovered, not decorative. Emotional specificity—familial famine—grounds the concept in human stakes. Risky structural compression (single flight) pays off; no retreat to exposition safety.</comment>
