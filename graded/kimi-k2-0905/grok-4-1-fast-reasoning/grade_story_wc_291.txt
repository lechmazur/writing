<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness and methodical ritual are vividly embodied; the prick-by-prick escalation to blood-on-ribbon fusion shows contradictory impulses (detached artist vs. awakening empathy) in one beat. Interiority avoids label-speak, using tactile cues (“ruby against gray stone”). Final portrait unveiling is earned by prior causality with visible scar-cost. Slight safety-hedge: empathy “blooms eternal” edges toward tidy epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ribbon find → blood daub → dual-mask insight → portrait → confession, each because/therefore link narrows options. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) reweights the ribbon from relic to unified truth with undeniable social cost (station portrait, diver ascent). Orientation anchored by 120 words. One micro-soft spot: evidence theft offstage, but later paid on-page by Lance’s attic trophy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mist-choked quarry functions as micro-setting that constrains search grid and hides the flooded basin; every sensory note (cold seep, moss, flashlight scalpel) is filtered through Elara’s tactile POV. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from grid-walk to kneel to rise. Final image—mist parting at dawn—mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Lacks one tighter prop-state change (lancet returned but never felt again).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—awaken empathy while solving Mira’s vanishing—tightens when ribbon discovery forces literal blood price. Agency: methodical grid abandoned for driven portrait unveiling. Escalation visible: each new mask clue shrinks suspect pool until dual-mask fusion names Lance. Cost legible: thumb scar, station portrait, sister’s tears. Coincidence limited; evidence theft later confessed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges organically from ribbon weave, torn mask, peacock/owl duality, blood/velvet fusion—no abstract sermon. Final image (mist parting, light unifying) offers resonant non-literal answer to empathy’s awakening. Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in Elara’s still-face-blind future. One near-echo: “dormant empathy” phrase twice, but second is embodied in scar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Third-person immersive stays close to Elara’s tactile synesthesia; perceptual signature (“flashlight beam cutting fog like scalpel”) is consistent and character-specific. Syntax tightens under pressure: “Blood welled, ruby against gray stone.” No head-hopping; single POV maintained. Minor register lift: “lancet—kept for precision cuts in canvas prep” slips toward expositional precision, but voice recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“velvet drinking her essence” does three jobs. Rhythm breathes: long mist coils vs. sharp “prick… lance”. Metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent (no mixed mist/scalpel clash). Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves by charged image. One micro-hedge: “methodical fire rekindled” edges cliché, but cadence needs the lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist solving cold case via blood-on-ribbon synesthesia is fresh synthesis; trope of masked killer flipped into split-mask unity. Specificity: grid-count ritual, flashlight-scalpel perceptual bias, quarry pick improvised lance. Risky second-person “you” never appears; voice commits to tactile lens. Transformation test: swap artist skill and synesthesia, whole plot collapses.</comment>
