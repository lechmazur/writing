<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Guilt-driven interiority is vivid and embodied; the amber’s hum on his arm is a tactile scar. The single-scene arc from denial to self-inking shows clear contradictory impulses under pressure. Cost is visible: the insect buzz now lullabies inside his skin, foreclosing innocence. Minor slip: “arrogant” label in flashback could be shown sooner.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tattooed firmware-map reweights his life’s work and guilt. Causal chain—letters → amber → slot → self-inking—never breaks; time-fold obeys taught pattern. Cost is unmistakable: he forever carries the translated haunt. Dock 0.3 for slightly late spatial anchor of the oak desk within the lab.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Laboratory’s “frost of echoes” and insect-amber micro-setting constrain every move; firmware port and constellation ink derive their logic from these objects. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and vibration over sight, mirroring guilt. Spatial choreography clean: drawer opens, amber lifted, slot inserted, skin etched—all tracked. Could edge higher if lab architecture had forced one more tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence the cradle-cry guilt—tightens when firmware renders the plea audible. Mid-story deepening (letters reveal his past error) raises cost of proceeding. Final tether act forecloses denial; no coincidence required. Pressure curve is single but sufficient; a second visible tactical loss (needle, blood, or time) would have pushed it to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of translation-as-redemption emerges through insect frozen mid-buzz → cry rendered → inked lullaby, never sermonized. Final coo among “stars he’d given her” reweights prior tattoos from commerce to penance. Ambiguity preserved: salvation is private, client pain still real. One echo risks overtness—“rewrite regrets” line—but resonance dominates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s somatic register—needle weight, amber warmth, firmware sigh. Perceptual signature favors cosmic-quiet metaphors consistent with his occupation. Compression like “meteor hush” is taught early and repaid at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during etching beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from meteor-splash fragments to longer ripple clauses, ear-tested aloud. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; “constellation quietude” fuses image and outcome cleanly. Density high—each line advances guilt, sound, or ink. One participle opener flagged but actions are sequential; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Firmware that translates infant grief into legible words feels fresh, especially grafted onto tattoo art. Time-fold lab housing extinct noises offers a non-obvious crucible for parental guilt. Insect-in-amber as recording stylus reconfigures familiar relic. Risk in cosmic lyricism pays off because emotional specificity anchors the spectacle.</comment>
