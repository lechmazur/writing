<comment>Lira’s hunger to “voice the unknown” is palpable and embodied—she fondles the fossil as if it could speak through her skin. The micro-choice to press it to her sternum crystallizes the internal contradiction between cartographer’s control and surrender to unmapped feeling. When she later releases the relic to the tide, the renunciation costs her omniscience and visibly ends her mapping days, earning the Earned Stasis. Flaw: the apprentice coda is summarized, muting the final visible price on her body.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: fossil surrendered, thermal orbs drift seaward, Lira’s voice lingers as “eternal sensory cartographer.” The image reweights the premise—maps now float untethered, knowledge forever partial. Causal chain intact: fossil induction → buoyant float → relinquishment → legacy of floating maps. One micro-turn mid-float tightens stakes without rupturing lens. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she trades certainty for oracular voice.</comment>

<comment>Coastal cave topology is not backdrop—it funnels every beat: bioluminescent veins guide, salt spray erodes, submerged ruins glimmer beneath her feet while airborne. The palm-sized emitter is a micro-setting extension whose heat palette dictates what she can even perceive; its amber grief/crimson hope overlays literally overlay the limestone walls. Spatial choreography is pristine—boot crunch, grit brush, chest press—every motion geo-anchored. Final image of fossil surrendered to tide makes the ocean itself the next unmapped chamber.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can maps encompass the unmappable?—is signaled early and tightens when the fossil’s emotions detach, forcing her to either contain or release them. Agency is continuous: she probes, inhales, presses relic to chest, then chooses release; each act escalates psychic load until thermal overload threatens. Cost is felt: surrendering the fossil ends her tactile interface with human memory, trading control for prophetic voice. Escalation is accumulative/textural—denser thermal orbs, mounting humidity, rising tide—rather than causal reversal, but remains coherent under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of representation: mapping emotion eventually demands relinquishing the map itself. Fossil as “bridge object” reweights from data-source to sacrificial conduit, quietly answering the thematic question—some unknowables can only be spoken by letting them go. No explicit moralizing; final image of free-floating thermal specters offers non-literal resonance. Subtext of post-human caretaking is carried in gesture (Lira’s whisper to vault-dreamers) rather than thesis.</comment>

<comment>Voice is synesthetic cartographer: verbs like “gnaw,” “dance,” “bleed” fuse geological and bodily processes. Rhythm crests with tidal cadence—long sentences for surge, fragment (“She etched”) for final carve. Emitter’s heat palette creates a perceptual signature distinct to Lira’s augmented eyes; no head-hop. Diction stays within plausible post-human lexicon—“bioluminescent veins,” “cryogenic slumber”—without academic drift. Compression taught early (“relentless waves gnawed”) and maintained; closure line “forever charting emotions that float beyond sight” reverberates with earned poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Every sentence layers job: “traced glowing veins” maps action + setting + metaphor. No paraphrase loops; “thermal” recurs only when palette reframes stakes. Figurative control tight—fossil veins like lightning, amber grief/crimson hope—yet each vehicle returns to heat spectrum, avoiding mixed-metaphor drift. Peak beat at float avoids purple overload by grounding in sensory micro-choices: “inhaled sharply,” “feet lifted.” Minor scaffold: “emotions that float beyond sight” appears twice; second instance recharges closure so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Post-human sensory cartographer who maps feelings not terrain is fresh, but grafted to “transitional object” psychology creates new hybrid: fossil as both data-node and talisman. Risk of floating under emotional thermals is literalized without breaking world-rules; mystical induction field seeded early via “spectral analysis” line. Synthesis feels inevitable—of course a map-maker who heat-reads grief must eventually release her compass. No close echoes of famous scenes; elm leaf fossil is specific to this archive, not generic symbol.</comment>
