<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s hunger for truth vs. protective love of her town—drives every micro-choice. Her embodied reactions (sweat, bone-conduction buzz) externalize stakes without lapsing into diagnostic speak. The final renunciation (eternal vigilance) carries visible fatigue-cost, earned by prior causality. Only minor hedge: Harlan’s opportunism sketched a touch generically, softening status crucible.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because she maps the tricksters’ subsonic pattern → therefore she weaponizes the same frequency against them → therefore the crowd blinks, Harlan slumps. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “cautiously hopeful” stance crystallizes while the tower looms as persistent constraint. Cost is legible—“the weight of stars a gritty comfort”—and forecloses rest. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The station itself—flickering CRTs, solder tang, fog-needled tower—functions as micro-setting that both supplies tech and externalizes cerebral war. Charts recur as handled objects whose curling edges mirror Elara’s fraying hope. Fog and subsonic vibrations narrow perception to immediacies, forcing tactical choices. Final image of tower against whitening sky recharges motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save community from psychic harvest—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation tightens once: subsonic trick pivots from abstract threat to crowd-control failing live on air. Price is felt via protesters’ temple-rub confusion and Harlan’s slump; tricksters’ recoil shown as waveform collapse. Protagonist agency drives reversal; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as weaponized attention, science as iterative vigilance rather than utopia. Never stated; final image of Elara “scanning the sky” invites reader to carry vigilance forward. Subsonic deception motif reweights from menace to shield without moralizing. Complex stance: victory is partial, gritty, ongoing—avoids false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Voice carries obsessive astronomer’s compressed diction—ink-veined constellations, pulsar rhythms—without jargon overload. Rhythm escalates from hunched quiet to transmitter roar, mirroring waveform crescendo. Perceptual signature sharp: coffee stains, solder tang, CRT flicker noticed only because tools matter. No head-hopping; Harlan’s speech stays external, filtered through Elara’s threat read.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Sentences vary from short percussive—“Perfect.”—to lyrical sprawls that mimic static hiss. No loops or scaffold; information density high (one line can layer tool, stakes, sensory grit). Figurative language consistent—void, star-wheels, ether—without mixed metaphor. Minor over-modulation: “ethereal grit” thrice; still, phrase reweights at closure, earning keep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>SETI-meets-town-hall invasion feels fresh; inversion of “benevolent signal” trope into subsonic manipulation is specific, not checklist. Charts-as-weapon and radio-station-as-telescope repurposing grow from Elara’s profession, not ornament. Final tower-sentinel image synthesizes science-hero and Western vigilante myths without echoing famous scenes. Risky cadence compression paid off in closure clarity.</comment>
