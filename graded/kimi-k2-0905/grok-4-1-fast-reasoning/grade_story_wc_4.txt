<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s calm-perceptive trait is embodied through tactile micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, deliberate unclasping) and guides her puzzle-method; the interior contradiction between private grief and public curator role is implied but never dramatized in a beat of visible cost, so the final smile feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the living collage reweights communal memory, vines/applause literalize the cost of reclaimed space; causal chain is lyric-accumulative—each photograph arc tightens the stake—so lens holds. Orientation clear by line 3, no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender and rusted steel constrain every beat—scent veils grief, vines audibly climb during the climax—charging the final image; selective sensory hierarchy (scent > sight > sound) mirrors Elara’s curator attention and keeps description economical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—transmute communal pain—signaled early; pressure deepens through each photograph arc that narrows options from private archive to public ritual; cost is the town’s shared tears and the vines’ irreversible reclamation of the ruins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges inductively from the mosaic of arcs; no explicit moral, final applause-of-vines offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids sentimental closure by keeping laughter tentative and grief still audible underneath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric-accumulative voice—repetition of “arc(s)” builds pattern, cadence modulates with twilight hush; perceptual signature is curator-visual (edges curled like ancient petals) without filter-verb clutter. No dialogue to test, free-indirect stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers scent, color, motion; metaphor strings (lavender conspirator, patient fingers) stay coherent within whimsy register. Minor template cadence in “arcs” repetition but it serves pattern-teaching and does not dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Puzzle-archive-as-ritual and photograph-arcs-as-healing-pathways feel fresh synthesis; risk of whimsy could lapse into twee, but the reclaimed industrial ruin keeps it grounded. Transformation test passed—story fails without lavender-vine reclamation logic.</comment>
