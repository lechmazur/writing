<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—“hammered repose” shows contradiction under pressure; micro-choice of pressing the stone crystallizes cost. Motivation stays steady, but the absence of any second character or relationship crucible limits relational depth. Earned stasis is credible: she forecloses retreat, accepting perpetual vigilance. Still, no flaw compounds choice; competence feels near-perfect, muting struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: final image of “quiet that endures” reweights stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—eternal guardianship. Accumulative lens holds: density of ripple/crack imagery intensifies until silence blooms; pattern break is legible. Causality intact—stone placement follows mapped cracks, no teleport. Orientation anchored by line 3; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice fractures serve as micro-setting that constrains tactic—she must read them to place the stone. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: luminous pulses narrow to crack-veins under fingertips. Spatial choreography clean; stone, ice, body positions track. Environment charges final image—cracks become luminous mandalas—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim core harmony”—signaled early; tightening occurs when spiral node forces single placement decision. Cost visible: eternal vigilance accepted in final line. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens: discordant vibrations intensify until bloom muffles them. No live option foreclosed beyond personal cost, keeping it from top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via ripple/crack pattern: order can be re-carved from trauma lines. Final image reweights earlier fractures from damage to map. No moralizing; resonance carried by ice becoming luminous mandala. Ambiguity lingers—energy beings still circling—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mapkeeper’s perceptual filter: “hammered repose,” “frozen echoes.” Syntax mirrors tidal cadence—long clauses swell, then break at bloom. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Register remains mythic yet concrete, distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High density—each line layers image, action, stakes. Occasional stacked modifiers (“relentless storm of sound and light”) flirt with purple but serve accumulative lens. Zero loops or scaffold; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of seismology, speleology, and mysticism feels fresh; “bloom of hush” reifies silence as living frost. Ripple-mark reading as cartography is specific, not generic magic. Risk taken with lyric density pays off—closure still legible. Could edge higher if conceptual cost had sharper social dimension.</comment>
