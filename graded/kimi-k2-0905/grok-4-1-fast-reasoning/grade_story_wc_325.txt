<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (rope-slick descent, belly-crawl, pulse in throat) and drives every tactical move; the decision to phase through rock is credibly prefaced by prior exposure to the codex. Micro-choices—tracing gold, syncing biofield—show values hierarchy, but the interior contradiction flips are narrated more than enacted in-scene, and the final emotional cost is asserted (“heart light”) rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: slack tide window → cave descent → codex activation → phase transition → surfacing with closure. Orientation anchors within 120 words; the phase mechanic is seeded early via logs and pays off in the ghost-stabilization climax. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she carries their witness and a persistent ethereal tinge (“codex held faint glows”). Cost is felt but could be sharper—no concrete forfeiture beyond exhaustion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is sensory-filtered through claustrophobic bias: brine-slick rope, kelp-lit airlock, kelp sway as locator beacon. The drowned lab’s flickering tubes and floating debris are economically sketched; the codex doubles as micro-setting that physically charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves during phase walk. Tide clock is omnipresent, guiding every beat, qualifying for 9+ gate, but final cliff image doesn’t newly reweight the stake, so capped at 8.4.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“honor the unremembered before tide re-floods”—is clear and externally clocked. Escalation is a single deepening: the codex reveals colleagues’ spectral imprint, forcing her to risk phase limbo that exacerbates claustrophobia. Price is liminal entanglement (body hums like fiber), visible on page. No second reversal, but one meaningful tightening suffices; cost could be sharper—no lasting physical loss, only psychological scar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of digital afterlife and memorial duty emerges through cable-ghost imagery rather than exposition. Subtextual thread—data as soul—gestures at larger commentary but stays internal to Elara’s guilt. Final whispered names offer resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing, but theme is slightly front-loaded in the prompt-like phrase “to stand by the unremembered,” costing half-point.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains tight psychic distance; diction—“crashing hush,” “phase veils”—is character-specific and rhythmic. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory compression under panic (“walls seemed to pulse closer”) mirrors breathless syntax. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior voice remains coherent and differentiated from genre boilerplate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Occasional stacked metaphors (“molecules loosening, passing through stone as if mist”) slightly blur physical logic; “crashing hush” motif repeats enough to flirt with template cadence but serves tonal glue. No scaffolding loops, but two near-simultaneous participle openers create minor simultaneity hiccup. Closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of claustrophobia thriller with quantum-ghost codex feels fresh; undersea cable conduit for lost souls is non-obvious and specific. Risky phase-shift mechanic is grounded in prior lab logs, avoiding late-rule cheat. Transformation test passes—Elara’s precise fear and tech lore are inseparable from plot. Slight proximity to “haunted data” trope but sufficiently re-inflected through bioluminescent kelp and tidal clock.</comment>
