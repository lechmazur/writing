<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—gentle yet steel-armed—remains vivid and embodied; the retrocognitive loop forces her into repeated, costly re-witnessing that visibly erodes her. The shift from passive victim of memory to active re-namer is credibly driven by the tessera’s concrete cue and her prior radical trait. Kael/Kaelon’s off-screen transformation is summarized, not dramatized, so the relational crucible test is weak; survivors’ gestures toward him are reported in aggregate, reducing pressure. Still, her final stance crystallizes with felt cost: the loosening of her own trap is tied directly to the price of embracing a monster, earning the closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tessera-touch → vision → rename → plaza shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient plaza”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rename ripples outward and the sky fissures dim—an undeniable before/after legible to all. Closure lands on-page (“aberrant mercy reigned”) with conceptual cost: Kaelon must live inside his reclaimed compassion; Elara’s curse loosens but is not erased, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tessera functions as micro-setting: its chipped glyphs both constrain how the rename can be performed and literally map the minaret’s fall, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel → trace → whisper → rise—bodies track without drift. Cracked flagstones and crimson fissures are filtered through Elara’s ghosted perspective, never touristic. Weather/environment (the wind sigh, sky dimming) evolves causally with the emotional turn, reinforcing rather than decorating the shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can empathy survive after fire?”—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is single but meaningful: the rename forecloses the option of simply killing Kael and instead encases him in his own forgotten mercy, a tactical narrowing that reweights the plaza’s future. Cost is visible on-page: Kaelon’s tears, survivors’ outstretched hands, Elara’s loosening trap—each a concrete price. No reversal beyond the decisive act is needed at this length; the tightening suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: aberrant mercy is enacted, not defined—granting a monster an identity forged from his own compassion. The tessera’s shift from relic to retrocognitive key reweights “prayer” into weapon, a subtle motif turn. Final line offers conceptual repricing: “aberrant mercy reigned” is an image, not a moral, and invites counter-reading—has Elara merely created a new tyranny of empathy? Sentimentality is avoided; the plaza’s thaw is tentative, not triumphant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: “veins of regret,” “arms of steel”—metallic, fractured, prayer-haunted. Syntax lengthens and compresses with retrocognitive floods, then cuts short at the whispered rename, mirroring her pulse. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Voice never explains what it has already shown; retrocognitive plunges are dramatized, not diagnosed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences often do three jobs (set, body, metaphor). Figurative language is selective, never stacked in peak beats; “crimson fissures wept cold light” is the single high-image line at climax and it pays off. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested, the final clause—“gentle, radical, eternal”—a deliberate triad that cadences without cliché.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise hybridizes post-apocalyptic trope with retrocognitive relic, then focalizes through radical empathy rather than revenge—fresh angle. Tessera-as-key and rename-as-mercy are non-obvious syntheses that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to redeem the warlord is carried through without retreat; no safety-middle hedging. Specificity of the chipped azure-gold pattern, the muezzin’s aberrant mercy sermon, and the plaza’s wind-sigh prevent generic transportability.</comment>
