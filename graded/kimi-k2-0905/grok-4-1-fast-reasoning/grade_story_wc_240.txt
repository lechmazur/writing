<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “spatial gift” lets her trace photons in four dimensions, a trait that immediately enables the laser test and later justifies the algorithm tweak. The quiet wildfire metaphor threads her obsession, embodied when she pockets the device “transformed,” showing cost. Elias is sketched only as catalyst, not crucible, so relationship/status bullets stay mute, yet his spore-handoff still pressures her permeability insight. One flaw: the “revolutionize” beat is declared, not dramatized; still, her micro-choice to let the rat pass (track the echo) earns the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean CR: the final image—“night yielding to reluctant day”—re-weights the premise that surrender equals sight, with conceptual cost (she abandons wall-based defense). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: spore-density and beam refractions accumulate until the pattern break (rat scatter) crystallizes the new rule. Causality holds: luciferin → permeability → algorithm pivot. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the farm’s luminous veil now doubles as both sensor and blind spot—she leaves carrying that paradox.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The farm is not postcard scenery; the veil’s permeability directly enables the security insight, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: she notices refraction angles, drip cadence, spore thickness—never tourist inventory. Spatial choreography is flawless: beam, rat, footprints, alcove all track without drift. The mushrooms’ “living lens” metaphor is accurate, not purple, and charges the final image. One hairline slip: “quiet wildfire” appears twice; still, the second use re-inflects the tone at closure, so penalty is nominal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she detect intrusion without resisting it? Pressure tightens once: the rat’s scatter forecloses the old “block” model and forces the surrender-tracking tactic. Cost is visible—she banks her prototype on an untested philosophy before birdsong. Agency is hers: she chooses to “let the intruder pass,” not Elias. Coincidence (rat) complicates, not resolves. Under Accumulative lens, the spore-density shift reweights the stake; no further reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the luciferin metaphor: yielding produces light/security. No explicit thesis; the final image of dawn surrendering to day re-answers the question wordlessly. Subtext lives in gesture: Elias parts a cap “to release,” silently modeling the lesson. Complexity remains—permeability also means vulnerability, left unspoken. The emotional aftereffect is the hush after wildfire: banked but still-burning insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Mira’s perceptual signature: four-dimensional refraction mapping, “quiet wildfire” diction. No head-hopping; Elias’s interior stays opaque, as it must. Syntax flexes with pressure: short clauses when she spins, then elongates during beam tracing. One elision—“the farm’s yours till birdsong”—is taught by context and paid off when she pockets the device. Register stays within her tech-poetic lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. High density: “luciferin molecules yielding energy in ecstatic surrender” delivers biology, philosophy, and stakes in one breath. Rhythm mirrors content—spore-veil sentences drift, then tighten at the rat scatter. Metaphors (“spores drifting like silent embers”) remain coherent with physical logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image, not summary. Minor alliteration (“wildfire now a forge”) is purposeful, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bioluminescent optics + intrusion detection via surrender is not a trope stack but a conceptual reframe. The luciferin security metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: abandoning antagonist-on-page for philosophical rat is bold yet coherent. Specificity anchors novelty—“Agaricus luminara” is invented yet plausible. Transformation test fails if swapped to any other setting; the mushroom lens is integral. No derivative-premise penalty applies.</comment>
