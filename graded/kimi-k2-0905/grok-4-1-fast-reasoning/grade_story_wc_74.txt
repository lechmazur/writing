<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias’s sleeplessness, trembling fingers, and “methodically hopeful” stance are embodied in every micro-choice; the brush tremor and saffron ink set-up pay off in the final surrender to drowsiness, showing a credible, earned swing from exhaustion to fragile peace. Contradictory impulses—doubt vs. the need to believe—coexist inside single strokes of the brush, never collapsed into tidy self-diagnosis. The only minor safety-hedge is the faintly lyrical distance in the final curl-among-pots image, but the cost of prolonged insomnia is felt on the page, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the moon-waned brush cools, Elias sleeps, and across the city new lanterns reply—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration of both his insomnia and the strangers’ hidden kindness ledger. Causality is causal-plus-textural: each vision flows because/therefore from the brush-stone drinking moonlight, tightening the stake that mercies must echo. Cost is pinned to the exact sentence “For the first time in months, a gentle drowsiness tugged at him,” making the lost language graffiti the price of his sleeplessness finally spent. No ambiguity in lens or orientation; pattern taught by line 3 (“waxing moon’s glow”) pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse, fogged panes, saffron ink, and moon-tipped brush form a micro-setting that actively refracts moonlight into the city’s windows, directly enabling the climax. Smog, ferns, and orchids are filtered through Elias’s painterly eye—selective, never catalogue. Spatial choreography is flawless: rice paper unrolled across the floor, brush pauses, moonbeam path tracked glass-by-glass to tenement panes. The only thing preventing 9+ is that the environment does not physically constrain a final choice—he could have painted anywhere—so the charge is luminous rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving kindness lingers—tightens through each visionary glyph: every caravan/healer episode narrows Elias’s option to quit, because the brush now demands public proof. Escalation is textural/accumulative: visions layer like translucent washes until the greenhouse panes themselves become a city-wide screen, a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake from private obsession to communal signal. Cost is visible—his trembling hand, years of insomnia—but the price is slightly abstract; no tangible object is forfeited except sleepless hours. Still, the final image of strangers lighting lanterns supplies a felt social cost that satisfies the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Kindness-as-virus emerges without a single thematic assertion; it accrues through glyphs, moonlight, and mirrored lanterns. The lost language motif reprises at the end with reweighted meaning: once silent, it now speaks across tenement glass, a perfect non-literal answer to “do mercies echo?” Subtext lives in gesture—brush pause, lantern flare—never exposition. The only whiff of safety is the word “proof” itself, but it is dramatized as painterly evidence, not moral homily, preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays painterly-tight: “saffron quiet,” “waxing moon’s glow,” “daydreams cascaded” are idiosyncratic to Elias’s chromatic insomnia. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences during visions to a clipped final “He curled among the pots,” mirroring his retreat into sleep. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains fixed on color, light, brush-weight. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are minimal and voice-motivated, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—moonlight as both literal beam and narrative projector—taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors; saffron diffusing in broth perfectly marries color and comfort. High information density: one line often paints time, pigment, and emotional temperature simultaneously. Only hairline slip is occasional adjective stacking (“smog-choked city”), but it suits the painter’s synesthetic gaze.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The kindness-ledger-as-lost-language is a fresh synthesis; invisible acts archived in extinct glyphs feels inevitable in hindsight. Moon-tipped brush as projector slides the fantasy element in under magical-realist credibility without late rule changes. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but coherence stays high. Slight tonal kinship to Kiefer’s “everyone remembers the moon” lyricism keeps it just under full 9+ originality, as the emotional contour is recognizable.</comment>
