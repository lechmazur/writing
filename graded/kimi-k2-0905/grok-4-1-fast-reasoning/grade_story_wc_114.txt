<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s fevered clarity and peripheral awareness are vividly embodied; the swallowed berry and smudged illustration function as concrete extensions of her interior contradiction. Her final slump and acceptance land as credible endurance with felt cost. Yet her “fault-tolerant” trait is asserted more than dramatized in choices—no clear moment where that resilience bends and almost breaks—so the arc stops just short of full earning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical return of aurora, berry weight, and charcoal smudge deepens the stake until the final “swallowed truth” reconfigures her vocation. Closure is a Charged Poise—illustration forever altered, station creaking, aurora pulsing—cost is legible in the permanent smear and the off-page death she now carries. One tight scaffold: “certainties began to sway” is repeated with rising intensity, taught early and paid off. No orientation debt; causality of berry→misperception→fatal outcome is coherent if oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mountain weather station is evoked through frost-rimed windows, anemometer clicks, and kerosene flame—every detail filtered by Elara’s fevered selectivity. The botanical illustration operates as micro-setting: its pristine lines become the literal surface she scars, turning setting into choice-constraint. Aurora light is not mere backdrop; it mirrors and finally charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she surface the swallowed truth before another climber dies—intensifies as the berry’s weight grows and the lost cartographer’s fate is revealed. One meaningful tightening: smudging the illustration is the irreversible act that forecloses her former marginal method and makes the cost visible. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via recurring aurora pulses and internal heaviness rather than causal turns. Cost is felt, but external consequences (next climber’s arrival) remain off-stage, keeping escalation just shy of the highest band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the moral hazard of indirect prophecy and the accretive weight of half-spoken truths. Subtext lives in the smudge—her marginal notes physically overgrow the plant, turning method into scar. No moralizing; the final image lets auroral sorrow reweight the premise without exposition. Berry-as-truth and swaying certainties refrain effectively, though two mentions flirt with thematic echo, narrowly avoided by imagistic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s sensory cascade; perceptual signature is distinct—“peripherally aware,” “auroral sorrow,” “reluctant prophecies.” Syntax lengthens and fragments under fever pressure, then compresses during the smudge act, mirroring emotional arc. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext convincingly. Register holds high-literary without drifting into purple because every elevated phrase roots in her body or the storm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (veins like lightning, certainties sway like grasses) are spare, mixed only when intentional—“auroral sorrow” marries sky to grief without contradiction. High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. One paraphrase ripple: “weight of swallowed truth” is stated twice in close proximity—minor, but keeps this just below perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Alpine oracle who divines by margins and must literally stain her own tool feels fresh; the berry-as-revelation stone is specific to this world. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into vagueness, but coherent pattern and final reweighting justify the experiment. No close echoes of famous scenes; aurora-as-burden reverses its usual wonder trope. Transformation test passes—swap berry for generic mushroom and the whole symbolic engine collapses.</comment>
