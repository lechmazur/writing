<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper’s motive—witness without judgment—remains abstract; it shapes attention but never crystallizes into a visible cost or contradiction under pressure. Interiority is atmospheric (“gripped reality loosely”) rather than embodied; no moment of fracture or micro-choice is dramatized. The ending’s “unyielding watch” is credible endurance, yet the absence of a tested flaw or sacrificed option keeps the arc cool, not searing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the keeper attains regenerative silence and consciously renounces surface change. Causality is lyrical–accumulative; each fold of the swan deepens texture rather than tightens plot, but the pattern is taught early and honored in the final image. Cost is conceptual—the eternal erosion of self in chronicling—made legible in “reality’s grip slackened further.” A small orientation wobble at the burrow transition (−0.2) keeps it shy of the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library-catacomb is a living organ: vines “pry at flagstones,” fungi pulse overhead, paper hums—details act, not decorate. The obsidian refuge re-enters as charged micro-setting, its light-absorbing walls forcing the hush that mends. Sensory economy is excellent; one line (“sodden and renewed”) conveys both bodily state and environmental baptism. Spatial choreography holds as the keeper crawls through obedient soil to river-edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—endless witnessing without judgment—signals early and retains constancy; pressure is existential, not escalating. The burrow act is the single meaningful intensification, narrowing locale from archive to silence-core. Because the keeper seeks no external victory, cost is atmospheric: self-diffusion into “crumbling peace eternal.” Agency is pure renunciation; the piece meets lens-appropriate escalation but lacks a tangible price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of passive immortality: chronicling erases the chronicler. Subtext lives in gesture—folding cloak into swan-angles—rather than assertion. The final image of the refolded paper swan offers Conceptual Repricing: the method of entry becomes legacy, reweighting silence as both shelter and sentence. Avoids moral statement; resonance is imagistic, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is sustained lyric–archival: “shelves sagging like weary shoulders,” “congealed night.” Syntax elongates to mimic slow drift, then compresses during burrow—rhythmic control serves pressure. Diction stays within spectral scholar lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Perceptual signature is consistent: light is swallowed, time is measured in fungal bloom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned (paper = map = method); no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety is good; occasional “drift of untold seasons”-type template cadence (−0.2) repeats stem without fresh pressure. Information density strong—one sentence often layers setting, body, myth. Clean grammar; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>7.9</question><comment>Frame—origami as portal via forgotten library—is fresh, yet “burrow to silent stone refuge” faintly echoes Woolf’s “mark on the wall” inward tunnels. Specificity of paper geometry (47° left, 90° right) grounds abstraction. Risk lies in static stakes; immortal witness without test edges toward template. Still, synthesis of archive + silence-repair feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
