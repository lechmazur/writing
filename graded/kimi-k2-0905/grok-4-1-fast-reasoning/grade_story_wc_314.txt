<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—icy calculation versus the ache of hidden letters—are dramatized in the crystal-flame negotiation and the tear that escapes as the starlings bloom. The micro-choice to lift the thawing crystal exactly when the birds wheel into flower-form makes the sentimental cost visible and causal under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One hairline slip: “secretly sentimental proof” momentarily abstracts what the tear has already embodied. Still, the interior split propels every beat and is reconciled only at the iridescent steam, earning the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The orchard is anchored by ~80 words; the waterfall’s prism and pulsing roots teach the surreal logic early, so Orientation Test is waived. Causality is rhythmic, not linear: each sensory layer (crystal warming, bird patterns) deepens the stake rather than triggers a new plot branch. Closure lands as Charged Poise—options reconfigured when the steam braids through the dispersing flock—cost felt in the same breath that harmonizes her. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern holds to the final exhale of the leaves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, luminous fruit, and moss-veined roots are filtered through an alchemist’s precision—every glint counts toward the rite. Spatial choreography is airtight: kneeling → spiral of vials → crystal aloft → steam threading the flock. Environment directly constrains the ritual steps (root-pulse dictates kneeling site; prism-spray supplies the light that ignites the steam). A fraction off the 9.0 because the orchard’s perimeter remains vaguely bounded, though this never affects choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—internal synthesis before dusk—tightens once: the crystal must thaw exactly as the starlings script the bridge pattern, or she remains fractured. This single deepening reweights the premise under Accumulative pressure; the visible price is the crystal’s total loss and the tear’s surrender. No external antagonist needed; the orchard’s magic complicates but does not rescue. Cost is legible, yet the escalation is more a crescendo of density than a causal fork, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recurring dichotomy of frozen vs. unfurling: crystal lattice vs. bird bloom, formula spiral vs. sentimental tear. The final iridescent steam offers a non-literal answer—harmony is not a formula but a lived braid of heat and wings. No moral is stated; the orchard’s approving rustle is implication enough. Minor abstraction in “timeless secrets reborn” is the only softness preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: she reads the flock as “living codex,” not mere birds. Syntax lengthens under wonder, then fractures into breathless clauses as steam erupts—an intentional rhythmic swell. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom alone; it does, through alchemical diction (“glacial heart,” “azure heart”) that never slips into textbook voice. The near-9.0 is clipped by one “ancient freshness” echo that feels generative rather than redundant, but still a hair repetitive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional valence, and ritual function (“warming the crystal without shattering its glacial heart”). Metaphors are coherent—waterfall prism, vein-like roots, bridge of birds—all serving the unity motif. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. One micro-slip: “patterns through the patterns” is an eye-tempting stutter, but the second “patterns” is justified as meta-formation. Closure line “ready for what dawn would forge” lands with propulsive cadence, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The alchemical rite powered by starling murmuration is a fresh synthesis; neither trope is used in isolation. “Frozen dew crystal” as time-captured dawn re-prices ordinary frost into transmutable memory. Risk is taken in letting birds become the sole antagonistic pressure, yet it pays off through choreographed symbolism. Only the “secret orchard behind waterfall” verges on familiar fantasy escapism, but the specificity of ritual mechanics rescues it from echo.</comment>
