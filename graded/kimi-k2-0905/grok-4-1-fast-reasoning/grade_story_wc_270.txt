<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s insurgent past and present gardener identity cohere; her telepathy and amber possession feel pre-loaded rather than earned in-scene, muting contradiction. Interiority is vivid (“her breath caught”), but the decisive plunge reads as foregone once plants chorus—cost is present yet not intensely felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: plant-whisper → kite decode → amber immersion → hybrid sapling, each step narrowing options. Triple-moon rite and geothermal crack land a visible, resonant change with conceptual cost—tradition rewritten in scalding water—satisfying closure under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Volcanic hot-spring details are selective—scalding Primordial Pool, obsidian rocks, sulfur vents—guiding Mira’s dig and later unsealing; setting constrains and enables the climax. Steam, scent, and heat texture every beat, integrating into action without catalog drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evolve tradition or let council ossify it—surfaces early and tightens when plants warn of withering if she refuses. One meaningful escalation: amber immersion forecloses heirloom stasis, forcing live adaptation; price (scalded skin, social risk) is visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—tradition must mutate or die—emerges via glowing sapling rather than sermon. Kite-script and plant chorus reweight meaning at closure, achieving conceptual repricing without tidy moral; ambiguity lingers over new ritual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Mira’s sensorium; plant-telepathy idiom is consistent, perceptual signature sharp (“leafy thoughts”). No head-hopping; lyric cadence in chant merges with geyser roar, modulating intensity cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High-density lines do triple duty—advance plot, texture steam, reveal character. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (steam-plume glyphs). Rhythm accelerates into immersion, breathes at dawn reveal; final line lands charged image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Insurgent grandma decoding botanical telepathy via kite-silk scripture feels fresh; hybrid sapling-as-archive evolves trope past MacGuffin. Risk in volcanic ritual pays off; premise fully owned, not hedged.</comment>
