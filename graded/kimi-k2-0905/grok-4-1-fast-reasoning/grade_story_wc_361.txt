<comment>Kael’s contradictory mix of chronic anxiety and salvific vocation is shown through body (twitching fingers still when the pendant activates) and micro-choice (offering the relic first to a stranger). The earned shift from “jittery courier” to “myth’s next verse” is legible, but Lira’s interiority is ventriloquised at the vision climax—Kael cannot know her childhood star-blades—so the relationship-as-crucible beat is slightly tainted.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s mentor-shaped absence is re-priced into living myth, felt cost is the perpetual trek alone. Causal chain holds—pendant’s sympathetic vibration is set up by Thorne’s lore and triggers Lira’s transformation, feeding back to Kael’s mythic self-reading. One minor causality fuzz: vision-sharing mechanics are asserted mid-beat rather than seeded, but the lyric pattern is taught early by aurora/time-warp motif, so lens stays coherent.</comment>

<comment>The ridgeway, aurora pulses, and pendant function as micro-setting trio: terrain forces the fork stop, sky-light supplies the vision canvas, object acts as conduit. Each constrains choice—Kael cannot leave the ridge, must trade, must use the wing. Sensory hierarchy stays courier-biased: wind against throat, leather cord bite, vibration before visual dazzle. Final image—auroras etching path into legend—recharges earlier “ethereal crystal” line, closing the texture loop.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—whether routine hauls can birth wonder—tightens when the pendant demands a live test on a sceptical stranger. Escalation is interior: Kael’s offer risks ridicule; the sympathetic vibration answers by collapsing Lira’s resistance, forcing Kael to recognise his own legacy as myth-seed. Cost is time-dilated solitude: he walks on alone, mentor still absent. One wished-for sharper external consequence (coin is token; no ridge-beast appears) keeps it from higher band.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: relic circulation turns private longing into shared re-enchantment, absence into lineage. Subtext sits in the unspoken trade—Lira pays for hope, not iron. Final auroral “approval” reweights mentor-death from loss to compost. The avoidance of overt thesis keeps it from 9+, yet the emotional aftereffect—reader left sensing wonder as contagious infrastructure—reads honest.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains courier’s perceptual signature: wind-twitch, pendant-hum, aurora reflections in puddles—idiosyncratic, not tourist. Syntax compresses under pressure (“voice cracking like dry leaves”) then lengthens during dilation, mirroring time warp. No head-hop; Lira’s past is filtered through Kael’s vision, a slight POV stretch forgiven by lyric contract. Dialogue minimal, subtextual (“I’ll carry on” = acceptance of vocation).</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variety, high density (“hammering stars into blades, not just horseshoes” does three jobs). Only recurrent scaffold is “germinate” used four times—bordering on template, but echoes Thorne’s last word so pattern feels purposeful, not loop. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence earns its uplift.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar “lonely courier awakens villager” spine is re-angled through sympathetic vibration mechanic and mentor-vanishing turned myth-compost. Ridge-dragonfly wing feels freshly particular; aurora as forge-light reframes blacksmith dreams. Risk is quiet—no beast attack or betrayal—yet coherence favours lyric over shock. Slight proximity to Gaiman-esque “starry forge” keeps it shy of 9.</comment>
