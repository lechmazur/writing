<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—hands polishing gears, skin tightening over bones—but the “cursed star” and “doomed bloodline” remain abstract labels; no contradictory on-page impulse complicates his leap to self-sacrifice. The final husk-image is earned, yet motive stays monolithic: defy fate because fate says so. Micro-choices (kneel, trace, smash lens) align, but we never see him hesitate or bargain, so the renunciation feels pre-scripted rather than wrestled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the backward-spinning lighthouse beam is a Resonant Reconfiguration that repatterns the island’s fate at visible cost—Elias’s desiccated body. Causal chain holds: yoyo reverse-engineered → spindles decouple → time rewinds → vitality drained. Orientation is swift; who/where/when fixed by line 3. One soft spot: “latent radiance” is declared before we learn it can ignite; a 0.2 sting for rule-teaching lag, but the final image pays it off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The hunger stone’s green bile-glow, the counter-clockwise beam, and the salt-stink of shells are selective, pressure-filtered details that guide Elias’s hands and最终的 lens-smash. Lighthouse geography stays coherent: slick path → stone → stairwell → lantern room. Tide-as-clock is the dominant sensory metronome, narrowing perception as vitality leaks. Micro-setting (bone-and-shell yoyo) becomes the fulcrum object that literalizes “reverse time,” charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break fate or die trying—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when the stone begins to drink. Escalation is Accumulative: each backward click of the lighthouse costs flesh, visibly tracked (“skin tightening over bones”). One meaningful deepening: visions of harvests greening in reverse crystallize the price. No antagonist needed; the stone’s hunger is coherent pressure that forces the final smash.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the cost of rewriting destiny is the author’s life. Subtext lives in the yoyo—child’s toy turned fate-wrench—and in “latent radiance” that proves to be death-light. The closing beam is a non-literal answer: defiance persists as warning, not triumph. No moral is declared; the image of the husk amid gears reweights all prior clock imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed, lyric, mechanically precise—“neatly inventive” as self-descriptor. Syntax mirrors the subject: long sentences wind, then snap (“with a snap”). Diction stays inside Elias’s gear-lexicon without strain. One 0.2 ding: “bleak exhilaration” is named rather than felt; otherwise tone modulates from chill wind to hollow laughter under escalating drain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors stay coherent (tide as breath, beam as skeptical eye). No loops or scaffold detected. Occasional stacked modifiers—“counter-clockwise precision,” “latent radiance”—approach purple but serve cadence. Final shard-image is clean, high-impact. A 0.3 trim could remove two adjectives without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing yoyo mechanics with temporal reversal is fresh; the toy’s dual spindle rewrites destiny rather than merely spinning. Risk taken: abstract concepts (cursed star, latent radiance) dominate, yet they are grounded in tactile objects. The lighthouse-as-clock is troped but re-angled by its beam running backward. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no stock plot scaffolding.</comment>
