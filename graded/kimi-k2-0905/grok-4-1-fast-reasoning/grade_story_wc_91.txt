<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrically sustained—“texture of transformation” recurs—but contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized. The giving obsession is vivid yet never genuinely tested; no moment forces him to withhold or regret a gift, so change is atmospheric, not earned. His passivity at the climax (wind uncorks bottles) leaves motivation ornamental. Cap at 6.9 because the arc lands as lyrical stasis rather than costly renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the harmless ember-fall reweights prior gifts into mythic healing without Elias choosing sacrifice. Causal logic is situational/accumulative; coincidence guides convergence, yet pattern is legible and fulfills prophecy with felt communal cost—illnesses lift, volcano quiets. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; only minor drift is the late “slow dance” label. Closure cost is palpable in the final image of black sand turned cradle; lens holds. High-band gate met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory layering—black sand “cool and yielding,” bioluminous “sapphire whispers”—mirrors interior quest without catalogue bloat. Volcano, planetary alignment, and beach constrain both mythic stakes and bodily choreography; the bottled bugs act as micro-setting that charge the final auroral release. Spatial tracking stays clean across cliff detour → beach → treeline arrival. The setting’s specificity elevates the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand transformation”—is abstract yet steadily intensified by environmental omens: crimson peak, aligning planets, widowed followers arriving healed. One meaningful tightening occurs when the volcanic gust literally snatches the satchel, forcing release; cost is communal awe and Elias’s shift from anonymous giver to mythic guide. Agency is partial (wind triggers release), but pressure remains coherent under situational lens. Could reach 8+ if Elias faced an explicit trade-off; here, escalation is ambient, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through imagistic refrain—sand, bugs, stars—rather than thesis. Subtext operates in silence: villagers’ healing is shown, not interpreted. Final image reframes prior gifts as cosmic currency, yet avoids moral statement. The ambiguity between orchestration and accident invites lingering reflection, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic control—“vibrant hush,” “fireflowers”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices light, texture, pulses. Diction stays within plausible diction for a humble villager turned mystic; no filter-verb clusters. Experimental compression (phrases like “slow dance”) is taught early and paid off. Minor echo of “whispering hush” but reads as intentional motif; no voice contamination.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and musical—many sentences carry triple duty: atmosphere, sensory ground, metaphor. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (bugs as bottled stars → actual constellation). Occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual repricing,” “celestial flux”—skirts register drift but remains within mythic register already established. Final lines achieve charged poise without artifact; qualifies for high-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: destitute philanthropist who engineers coincidences with lightning-bug currency; prophecy fulfilled by wind, not hero. Specificity of black-sand beach under planetary alignment grounds myth in tactile geography. Transformation trope is reweighted from personal enlightenment to communal miracle, avoiding self-help cliché. Risk-taking—lyric situational structure—heightens awe without obscuring clarity. Not quite 9+ because core archetype (generous guide becomes legend) remains recognizable underneath new ornament.</comment>
