<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—“bitter almonds on tongue,” “tide-eroded shore”—and the final micro-choice to clutch the label crystallizes identity. Motivation stays steady but never sharpens into a higher-stakes fork; the wanderer only accumulates, never gambles. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc feels like steady revelation rather than pressured character turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and honored: each tide-borne fragment thickens the perceptual “skin.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the label rewrites the bureaucratic death into sabotage, cost legible in the final smile. One smooth transition (low-tide discovery → high-tide acceptance) keeps structure within 800-word mosaic default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Container cathedral, salt-laced wind, and tide-clock choreography are filtered through the wanderer’s synesthetic bias—containers “brimming with layered narratives.” The poison label’s curl is tactile, re-used at climax to anchor re-identification. Environment actively gates movement (flood/retreat) and supplies the decisive object, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim erased self—remains coherent; each fragment tightens the texture but does not foreclose an alternative path or demand a trade-off. Escalation is accretive, not risky; the final discovery is luck-borne, not agency-driven. Cost is conceptual (knowledge of sabotage) rather than a tangible loss paid on-page, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: official erasure is reversible only through unofficial, embodied memory-work. Subtextual irony—bureaucratic murder by mislabeling undone by salvaging another label—lands without exposition. Final image reweights prior fragments into a private, unverifiable identity, inviting reader to question every history in the maze.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice maintains a tidal cadence—long swells, then short percussive clauses at discovery. Perceptual signature is consistent: every sensory note is run through the “layered skins” filter. No head-hop; diction stays within dock-side lexicon; figurative control peaks in “label curling like a mocking tongue” without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors tide: cumulative anaphora (“Layered atop…”) builds density, then clipped fragments at label pry. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances texture or position. One mixed metaphor (“histories stacking like misaligned cargo”) is minor; no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise flips noir amnesia: protagonist remembers, world forgets. Accretive ghost-archive via overheard dock gossip feels fresh; poison-label MacGuffin reprises bureaucratic error as material evidence. Risk—mosaic without conventional plot—pays off because pattern is taught early and closure reweights all shards.</comment>
