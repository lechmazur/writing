<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s gnarled climb and quartz-eye flicker embody a mender whose fear of irrelevance is as tactile as the sap on pews; Lila’s feisty shove and ribbon-tying enact her trait under pressure, not merely label it. The internal contradiction—persistence masking dread—drives every micro-choice up the rafters, and the final retying of the ribbon crystallizes a visible cost: the orchard’s renewal now depends on their shared, fallible tending. Only the daughter’s interiority briefly drifts into generic “wildflower” scent, a hair below 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat—bag spill, ribbon reprise, quartz hum—because/therefore tightens the breach until the heart-tree eye re-lights, foreclosing the option of solitary persistence. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s excess is revealed as starvation of vows, the cost legible in the rafters’ creak and the ribbon now binding daughter to beam. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (pews, vines, apex quartz) track cleanly within the single escalating scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is no postcard: Rotting beams dictate foot-placement, sap-slick marble endangers grip, and the apex quartz literally cracks choice-space. The ribbon’s reprise from childhood scent to storm-banner shows micro-setting as charged object. One hairline slip—“dripped sweet sap onto cracked marble pews below” repeats the sap image two sentences later; otherwise environment constrains every upward move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can broken vows be mended before visions die—tightens when quartz eyes across valleys fail, turning abstract breach into bodily urgency. The meaningful turn comes when Lila’s feisty shove saves Elias: her trait, once escape fuel, now forecloses the option of leaving again, price paid in shoulder-impact and beam-scar. Cost is visible; escalation causal; one beat short of 9.0 only because the external threat (storm) is helper, not driver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: deciduous vows are roots that regrow, not chains—a reconfiguration earned through the orchard’s own overgrowth mocking their absence. The ribbon’s scent-shift from girlhood to storm-banner reweights memory into covenant, while the repaired quartz eye reframes generational wisdom as mutual, fallible practice. No thematic echo in dialogue; final image offers quiet, non-moralizing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays close to Elias’s quartz-filtered perception, diction earthy (“gnarled hands,” “sap… like thighs”) yet elevated only when the seer-eye ignites. Rhythm climbs with frayed-rope cadence, shortens under storm stress, then widens for the final glow. Dialogue minimal but voice-distinct: Lila’s “You persist in this madness, Father?” snaps with inherited impatience versus Elias’s soft mender cadence. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<comment>Prose carries sensory density without purple drag: “crimson fruit that dripped sweet sap onto cracked marble pews” fuses color, taste, texture, danger in one breath. Varied sentence openings avoid scaffold; only one micro-loop (“sap… sap”) noted. Figurative logic stays organic—orchard roots as generational memory—never mixed. Final line lands with crystalline cadence that recharges ribbon and eye simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar estrangement—post-apocalyptic cathedral orchard—is made specific through mender lore and seasonal vows renewed by sap, not sermon. The quartz eye as literal organ of prophecy fused with arboreal graft feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Risk of lyric excess is balanced by tactile rope-climb and beam-rot; conceptual integrity intact. One notch below 9.5 only because the breach-return arc is archetypal, albeit freshly rooted.</comment>
