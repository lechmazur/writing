<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lirien’s scarred hands, velvet pouch ritual, and instant readiness to unpick the hush-net ground his vocation in embodied habit; the brother-memory supplies a clean motivational through-line that escalates with each rescued spirit. Interiority stays concrete—“unrest coiling in his chest” versus “porcelain smile” tension—showing simultaneous dread and duty without therapeutic gloss. Micro-choices (kneeling, brushing silt, selecting each shard) reveal a hierarchy of values in real time, and the final grounded chorus of spirits proves a visible change that costs him dawn’s exhaustion. The only cap is a hairline slip: the shade’s spontaneous materialisation is accepted without visible surprise, a minor glitch in an otherwise tight causal arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sanctuary’s “murmurs of settled souls” reconfigure Lirien’s private grief into communal quiet; the stained needle in his pocket is the felt relic of that cost. Causality is cumulative-textural—each unpicked knot increases density until the final sigh disperses silence—yet the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is swift: “prism sanctuary under starlight” + “broken mask restorer” anchors who/where by line two. No teleporting props or explanatory dumps; the net, needle, and masks are tactile from first appearance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Star-refracted crystals, silted floor, and the coarse net’s bloated knots are returnable resources that constrain posture and tool choice; the prisms’ colour warnings (reds for rage, blues for drowned sorrow) directly colour-code the escalation beats. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies kneel, reach, pierce, fetch—without impossible drift. Sensory economy favours touch and sight under urgency; calmer star-wheel moments admit wider visual scope. The setting micro-reifies into the tapestry needle itself, whose stained eye supplies the final charged image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—anchor the drowned—signals in paragraph two and tightens with every knot: each release forecloses the option to stop, since silence pools like ink and prisms tremble. Agency is iterative renunciation of rest; the price is bodily (“hands, scarred”) and existential (dawn’s threat replaces starlight). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shade confesses the final knot is its own echo, converting abstract labour into personal reckoning. Cost is visible on-page: the needle tip “stained with hush’s residue” and Lirien’s “fractured core” now mended yet haunted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence: woven hush was meant to smother, yet its unravelling voices the forgotten. The image-set—masks, net, prisms—refracts the idea that restoration demands cutting, not sewing. No terminal moral is stated; instead the sanctuary’s shift from hush to murmur offers a non-literal answer. Subtextual irony: the restorer must break (knots) to mend (spirits), complicating the vocational pride signalled in his title.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Lirien’s perceptual filter—starlight fractures into “reds for rage” exactly as his eye reads warning. Syntax lengthens during methodical unravelling, then shortens under final stress (“With a steady plunge…”) mirroring cardiac tension. Diction stays within a craftsman-reverent register—velvet, porcelain, tapestry—never drifting into academic or corporate gloss. No head-hopping; the shade’s voice is external, rasping, unattributed to interior access.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening technique; stacked participles are avoided. High information density: one sentence can set scene, reveal tool, and signal mood (“He retrieved his tapestry needle from a velvet pouch, its steel eye glinting like a captured prism ray”). No paraphrase loops; “unrest” recurs but accrues new modifiers (lucid, coiling) that shift nuance. Metaphors stay coherent—net knots “bloated with silenced screams” preserves physical logic. The final line avoids exposition, ending on image: “quiet resolve.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of lace-making with exorcism feels non-obvious yet inevitable: the same needle that repairs porcelain must unravel soul-knots, collapsing craft and spiritual salvage into one gesture. Fresh inflection: silence as accumulative material that can “pool like ink” reifies the abstract as tactile threat. Risk is taken in lending the antagonist-role to an absence (hush) rather than a corporeal villain; the strategy works because pressure is still legible. No close echoes of iconic net or mask tropes; the prism sanctuary is particular enough to resist swap-ability.</comment>
