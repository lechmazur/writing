<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is vivified through concrete micro-choices—talking to the hopscotch board, cross-referencing runes, risking the dome activation—so motivation stays legible. Interiority is flavorful (“sociable isolation”) yet occasionally drifts toward performed self-narration, softening raw contradiction. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits lingering safety for ascent, earning a credible arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: glow → cipher → coordinates → dome → ascent, each step linked by Elara’s agency. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rift-bearing now re-weights her solitude into mission, cost felt in “borrowed glow” that must be repaid. Minor scaffold appears in the three-sentence “luminance brightened…surged upward” cluster, not quite marring the image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Airship deck, hopscutch grid, and murmuration layer tactile anchors that steer choice—boards must be dusted, birds repelled, rift approached. Sensory economy is tight: one sniff of “dust-caked” planks, one gleam of crystalline motes, all filtered through map-maker gaze. The final image of glowing veins charging the sails satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovery of uncharted rift—is signaled early and tightened when starlings threaten the ship. The hopscotch sequence forces a trade-off: decode now or be grounded, a visible price paid in energy borrowed from unknown source. Escalation is single but sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity-as-company emerges through image rather than assertion: her chatter to absent crew, phrasebook as relic, solitude flipped into launchpad. Subtle shift from “comforting veil” to “legend” offers resonant re-pricing without moral tag. Final whoop is earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—“sociable isolation,” cartographer synaesthesia of lines/dots—stays coherent and rhythmic. Free-indirect slips cleanly between awe and method. External narration avoids filter verbs; diction (“undulating waves of black wings”) remains within plausibly literate adventurer lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: parallel “luminance” threads braid discovery and peril; sentence lengths modulate from breathy inventory to staccato activation. One scaffold loop (“glow…luminance…glow”) costs minor immediacy; no mixed metaphor or register drift. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hopscotch cipher, starling murmuration, and energy rift feels fresh, not checklist. Antique airship trope is re-coded through cartographer POV and linguist toolkit. Risk of whimsy is embraced and paid off by causal glow-engine—inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
