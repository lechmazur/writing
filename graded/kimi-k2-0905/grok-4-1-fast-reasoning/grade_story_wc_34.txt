<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s vocation to “articulate unspoken needs” is concrete and embodied; her lute, pigments, and plate-handling show micro-choices rooted in that drive. Contradictory impulses surface when awe of the ghost competes with her own fear of silence, dramatized as trembling fingers yet steady singing. The final renunciation—releasing the ghost and accepting permanent audibility—pays a visible cost: she is left “seldom-heard” no more, the plate warm with transferred weight. Interiority avoids label-speak; emotion is pressed through tactile verbs and cloud-moss ink.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s liberation arcs skyward while Elowen’s voice is forever re-tuned to be heard—cost felt in the warm plate and the thunderous applause that replaces her usual silence. Causal chain:她发现壁画→解码幽灵→ plate aligning code→ pigment transfer→ spectral release, each step tightening options. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“misty courtyard above the clouds”). Lens is Causal; every beat is “because/therefore.” No late-rule changes; thunder’s delay is set-up paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Environment (floating stone balustrades, perpetual vapor) constrains movement and supplies ochre moss-pigment for ink—directly enabling the encoding act. Spatial choreography is clean: mural→ blank wall section→ skyward arc. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elowen’s artist-eye: visual vines, tactile plate hum, acoustic thunder. Weather (lightning-thunder gap) functions as live clock, tightening choices. Micro-setting (brass plate) charges final image: its warmth = transferred ghost/code cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: give the voiceless speech before thunder strikes. Escalation: mural pleas → ghost entrapment → plate alignment → pigment transfer → spectral release, each step foreclosing retreat. Protagonist agency drives every beat; no coincidence. Cost is legible: her own anonymity surrendered—she will now be heard, whether she wants it or not. One meaningful tightening: once plate bolts click, retreat is impossible; thunder must carry the truths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: art as compression chamber for silenced griefs. Subtext resides in object-choice—Victorian flower-press bolt plate repurposed for code—implying history’s flattened voices. Final image (thunder as applause) reweights prior silence without moralizing. No explicit thesis; resonance arises from concrete transfer of ghost-code into sky-song. Ambiguity lingers: will being “heard” drown her own melody?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent artist-poet: “lute slung like faithful shadow,” “tinkersong wonder,” syntax lilting with participial music. No head-hopping; single POV held. Diction stays within Elowen’s lexicon—no academic register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences in calm, staccato fragments under lightning. Compression (“driftingly alert”) is taught early and paid off in ghost’s own alertness. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, sensory, motive). Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Metaphors (“living ink,” “pixelated mist”) are coherent, not stacked. Rhythm varies: opening spondaic “misty courtyard” vs. final dactylic “applause from the heavens.” No filter-verb stacks. Clean grammar; pronouns track. Minor scaffold: “driftingly alert” repeated thrice—pattern-taught, hence allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of steampunk relic (flower-press bolt plate) with cloud graffiti ghost-code feels non-obvious and inevitable. Plate’s grid as cipher wheel freshens both tech and art tropes. Risky second-person apostrophe to ghost (“You hear me”) is earned by prior auditory motif. Final reconfiguration—thunder becomes audience—flips natural spectacle into critique of silence. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous scenes. Transformation test fails if plate/ghost removed; story collapses.</comment>
