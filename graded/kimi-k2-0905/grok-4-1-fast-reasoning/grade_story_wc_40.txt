<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elowen’s reticence is shown through action—years of silence broken only by the crystal’s summons; her decision to testify costs her the safety of silence and is visibly paid in tears and cracked voice. Contradictory impulses (wonder vs. fear of sonic chaos) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—walking away after embedding her voice in the crystal—earns its poignancy because we have felt her struggle to speak at all.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal holds her testimony forever, refracting past and future echoes with undeniable conceptual cost—language frozen yet potentially re-awakened. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fractured sequence tightens the pattern recognition until the lectern moment reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the single sentence she utters after years of silence and in the library’s exhalation that follows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library’s vaulted hush, dust motes, and shattered chandelier glass function as micro-setting that directly constrains action: the silence forces her to tap the crystal, the glass shard cuts her palm metaphorically, the lectern scar anchors generations of prior voices. Dawn’s incremental rays track narrative time and mirror the slow illumination of pattern. Spatial choreography is clean: she stoops, lifts, carries, places—every motion alters the sonic archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the growth pattern before the hush erases all future lexis—is signaled in paragraph six and tightens when each fractured sequence proves the viral echo model. One meaningful deepening: realizing growth is fractal, not linear, forecloses hope of restarting external lexicons; the price is the recognition that her testimony can only preserve, not proliferate. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: language as crystalline reflection that both preserves and petrifies. The crystal’s final gleam reweights every prior echo from quaint archive to elegiac warning. No moral is stated; the emotional after-effect is a hush that now feels pregnant rather than empty. The fractal tree image reframes centuries of linguistic hope as viral beauty destined for freeze.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elowen’s perceptual filter: “weathered innocence,” “creased lids,” “ghost in that profound quiet.” Syntax stretches into lyric catalog only when the crystal releases its torrent, matching her sensory overwhelm. No head-hop; diction remains within her scholarly yet childlike lexicon. The final smile is rendered externally, preserving reticent distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: long clauses mimic hush, then staccato fragments mirror fractured sequences. Information density high—each sensory detail also advances pattern recognition. No loops or scaffold; figurative language spikes only during sonic torrents where it is earned. Final line “Forever growing, silently” acts as resonant hinge without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “last dictionary” freeze is a fresh dystopian twist; coupling it with sonic crystal archaeology feels inevitable yet new. Fractal linguistics as viral reflection is specific to this world and character. Risk of lyric avalanche is held in check by grounded physical handling of the crystal. The reticent scholar who speaks only to archive silence is an indelible inversion of the talkative academic trope.</comment>
