<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “infinitely patient” label is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a moment where impatience threatens; the fork is handled, yet no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates his use of it. Interiority stays atmospheric (“burned deep”) rather than embodied or contradictory, so the promised internal hierarchy of values feels declared, not dramatized. Because the closure beat awards him serene success without cost, the arc leans parable-flat, not character-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork-strike thickens sensory density until the ghost-footfall chorus crests into perceptible rebuilding. Orientation is clear by word 60; no causal gaps appear, yet the cost is purely spectacle—no option narrows for Elias, no price sticks to him—so the Resonant Reconfiguration feels weightless. Closure is legible but not freighted, capping ascent into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Place detail is selective and atmospheric: “shadows clung like forgotten whispers,” “cracks…knitting like healed flesh.” The archway, cobblestones, and fork function as micro-settings that physically transmit the rhythm, directly enabling the revival beat. Sensory economy keeps the ghost-town palette vivid without expository drift, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are announced early—restore balance or Perivale collapses—but the only tightening is incremental visual restoration; Elias faces no resistance, resource limit, or emotional trade-off. Escalation is therefore decorative, not consequential; the “before the collapse” clock never audibly advances to pressure tactics. Agency is present but frictionless, keeping pressure shy of 8-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—community rhythm as antidote to greed—emerges through the returning footfall motif rather than moral statement, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext stays in gesture (spectral townsfolk nodding), not exposition, satisfying the show-don’t-tell mandate. The final image of perpetual dance under the arch offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the lack of cost to Elias slightly dulls the conceptual sting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, incantatory cadence that mirrors the tuning-fork hum; sentence rhythms swell and subside with the scene’s pulse. Diction stays elevated and consistent, never drifting into unintended academic register. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is more choral than individual, fitting the mythic mode, though Elias’s interior texture remains generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical but repetitious: “wild hush” recurs eight times, “infinitely patient” four, producing template cadence that dulls surprise. Mixed metaphors (“wild hush deepened, charged with wild energy”) slightly blur the vehicle. Most sentences advance mood rather than multiple tasks, keeping density moderate. No artifact invades the closure, but the echoing diction blocks 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The bell-tuner who resurrects a town via footstep rhythm is a fresh synthesis of folklore tropes, not a retread. Specificity of the lightning-struck ebony fork and the spectral cadence of cobblestones roots the concept in singular detail. Risk is moderate—relying on lyric repetition—but coherence stays intact. The idea feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
