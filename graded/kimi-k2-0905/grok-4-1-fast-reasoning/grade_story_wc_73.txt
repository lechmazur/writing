<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—grim optimism—stays active: he “muttered…yet he pressed on,” balancing calculation with reckless proof. The chipped die as regret-engine and missed-leap texture are handled in micro-choice (rolling to pick equation paths), tying flaw to tactic. Final renunciation—pocketing lone die, smiling darkly—earns its cost via rupture failure. Balanced daring could be more viscerally tested; proof scenes lean cerebral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands under Accumulative/Textural lens: equations layer until dice embody theorem, rupture reweights missed-leap memory with conceptual cost (“wind’s kiss, love’s potential grasp” denied again). Single-scene anchor clear by 50 words; helix taught early, pays off. One meaningful intensification: flawless die shatters, equations fracture, staircase reseals—earned rupture. Causal chain is secondary; pattern break suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Infinite staircase functions as micro-setting: each step’s sameness pressures tactic of mathematical escape; helix curvature enters equations, constraining proof. Sensory economy—glow, seismic groan—mirrors internal vortex without catalogue. Object-as-setting (die, paper scrap) handled tactilely, altering choices. Light-breach image recharges earlier missed-leap memory, meeting 9+ gate for final-image charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rupture eternal climb by proving self-sustaining loop; signaled first paragraph. Tightening occurs when rupture momentarily opens light of missed leap, then reseals—cost paid as renewed confinement. Agency is intellectual endurance; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual: proof’s failure re-imprisons him with sharper regret—visible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recursion: perpetual motion as metaphor for regret’s endless replay. Chipped die’s asymmetry fed into equations literalizes “missed opportunity texture”; flawed luck sustains the impossible. Final smile at lone die reweights premise—confinement is the engine of hope. Avoids moralizing; resonance carried by image, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; diction fuses mathematical register with bleak lyricism—“equations looping infinitely, derivatives chasing tails.” Perceptual signature filters cosmos through proof obsession: staircase = phase-space. No dialogue, so voice rests on syntactic control: varied sentence rhythm accelerates with proof rush, slows at rupture. One micro slippage: “wind’s kiss” edges romantic, but POV’s memory licenses it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose propels: high information density via verb-driven clauses—“integrated over infinite paths, showing equilibrium in disequilibrium.” No loops or synonym churn; metaphor stacks brief, taught early (“golden mean helix”). Minor register drift into “quantum fluctuations scaled to macro” but fits POV’s academic reach. Closure image—“rolled the chipped die once more—five”—remains crisp, unmuddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: infinite staircase + mathematical proof of perpetual motion as metaphor for regret loop; not stock trope. Chipped die asymmetry becomes narrative engine, transforming familiar “eternal ascent” into epistemic prison. Risk—abstract theorem front-and-center—paid off via visceral rupture. Slight proximity to Borges/Calvno echoes, but specific regret texture differentiates.</comment>
