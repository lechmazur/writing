<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically particular (“moonstruck dreamer” is shown through nocturnal vigils, dust-covered canvases), but her contradictory impulses are summarized rather than staged in scene; the decisive surrender to rest is narrated, not embodied under pressure, so the cost feels declared rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>A valid Accumulative/Textural lens: meteor traces thicken into pattern, then collapse into sleep that reweights creativity. Closure is a Charged Poise—stardust “awoke, remembered, unbound”—but the cost (body ache, calendar blur) is asserted in summary, not imaged in the final beat, so the repricing is legible yet not felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frost-kissed threshold, brass hum, auroral greens/purples are selective and POV-filtered; the archway constrains posture (kneeling, tracing) and recurs as the applause-light final image, satisfying micro-setting use. Spatial track stays clean across an essentially single-location sequence.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped creativity—is clear early; pressure escalates by accumulation (each meteor traced adds density) rather than causal reversal. The tightening moment is the final surrender to sleep, but because the prior exhaustion is told, the visible price is diluted; still, one meaningful deepening is achieved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cosmic origin as creative fuel, rest as cosmic surrender. The ending reweights “remembered stardust” from abstract motif to live engine without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—she must return—creating resonance beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at psychic distance 2–3, maintaining consistent moon-biased perceptual signature (“light bending through voids”). Syntax is patterned, almost liturgical, but the repetition serves accumulative design rather than monotony; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and wave-like, yet figurative layering approaches density tax in every sentence (“spectral embrace, silent symphonies”); a few mixed metaphors (“silver vein” beside “plasma surge”) mildly blur physical logic. Scaffold is light, no template cadence, but the lushness nudges toward overwriting under peak auroral description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cosmic-origin-of-art is familiar, yet the mandate that rest—not striving—unlocks it, delivered via auroral semaphore and antique astrolabe, feels fresh. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure image. Specificity of brass astrolabe tracing meteor paths anchors the concept; without these exact objects the arc collapses.</comment>
