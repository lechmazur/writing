<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s longing for community is vivid and embodied in her reed-sculpting hands; her “boldly sympathetic” trait drives her to clasp Lir’s hand and later to speak the dedicatory words, so motive does convert to visible choice. Interiority stays concrete (“callused,” “luminescent ache,” “frost-kissed branches”) without label-speak. The final renunciation of solitude is earned: she kneels, weaves, speaks—an on-page cost paid. Secondary characters remain lightly sketched but apply immediate social pressure, satisfying the crucible test for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: tag-migration → group formation → arbor crest → sculptural dedication, each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“crystalline orchard perched…”) and never breaks. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed canopy crystallizes communal bonds, cost felt as Elara’s solitary craft is forever fused to the group. One soft spot: the tag’s artist never appears, so the ultimate causal agent is off-stage; still, the group’s shared act satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is never backdrop: the translucent trunks literally bear the glyph that catalyzes action, while the obsidian arbor’s facets catch starlight to “pulse” the crater’s glow—charging the final image. Sensory economy is disciplined: one tactile branch, one visual shimmer, one auditory murmur, each filtered through Elara’s reed-sculptor eye. Spatial choreography is clean—ridge crest, vault apex, kneeling placement of reeds—no impossible positions. The orchard–crater dyad constrains every move: they follow branches inward because the geography dictates it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to graft herself onto community”—is declared in paragraph 3 and escalates through each tag migration, tightening the group’s web. Mid-story, Elara’s solitude is tested when laughter emerges “rare, laced with ache,” a micro-turn that forecloses retreat. Final cost is visible: her private satchel of reeds becomes a public canopy, a material forfeiture that seals belonging. Pressure is coherent but one-step; no higher-stakes reversal threatens the commune, keeping it just shy of 8+ brilliance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of kinship and chosen family emerge through the arbor’s webbed spirals and Elara’s literal weaving—never stated, always shown. Subtext runs in silence: Lir’s “eyes shadowed,” Mira’s “trembling hands” imply prior fractures the weave repairs. Final image reweights “luminescent ache” as shared glow, a Conceptual Repricing that turns private pain into communal light. No moralizing line intrudes; the dedication speech is ritual, not thesis, avoiding thematic-echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter: “frost-kissed branches overhead,” “reed-like veins of leaves,” diction organic to her craft. Rhythm swells with the group’s growth—longer cadences as “laughter echoed rarely”—then contracts to short clauses at the apex: “This is it.” Lir’s single line of dialogue carries regional restraint (“haunts me too”), distinct from Elara’s oratory final sentence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; psychic distance remains steady mid-depth.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops; “luminescent ache” recurs with accruing weight, a taught pattern. Information density high—“callused from twisting supple reeds into forms that whispered of forgotten waters” does three jobs in twelve words. One minor scaffold: “Their group swelled, a tentative web forming…” could compress, but it propels. Final knot sentence is taut, propelling closure without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of marsh-reed craft with volcanic-glass arbor feels locally invented; no trope catalog offers “obsidian vault crowned by graffiti kinship glyph.” The sculptor’s medium becomes the communal bond—organic metaphor made literal. Risk is taken: quiet lyric escalation instead of antagonist, yet coherence holds. If names/places swapped, the reed-glass alchemy would collapse, passing the transformation test.</comment>
