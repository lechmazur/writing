<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear arc from doubt to certainty via embodied memory-work; the “kintsugi” quilting of scars is a fresh interior device. Emotion stays somatic—lungs burning, fingers steady—avoiding label-speak. Micro-choices (slotting charm, narrating each scar) visibly trace the hierarchy of regrets. Final smile is earned because each pockmark beat has forced a forgone cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the workshop rises, acid recedes, and the alchemist’s new certainty is locked to the fused charm-core—cost is the lifelong scars now glowing, irreversible. Causal chain holds: each matched pockmark triggers memory-quilt + mechanical repair, leading to buoyant resurrection. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“uncertain alchemist”) and acid-sea stakes; no ambiguity. One loop—”quilting” overused—doesn’t dent closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Acid sea, corroding cogs, and clockwork familiars are tactile, selective, and constantly bite the body. The statue’s pockmarks function as micro-setting that gates each confession; their chill flank steadies his hand—concrete constraint. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: fumes → lungs → touch of bronze, ignoring extraneous sight. Final image of glowing scars on bronze repels corrosion, recharging the premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightens with each pockmark: fail to narrate = drown. Agency is pure endurance under breath-clock; each scar-match costs remaining air, foreclosing retreat. Fifth pockmark crater drains last breath, crystallizing stance before resurrection. Cost is visceral (burning lungs, acid lips) and persistent (glowing scars). No external coincidence; pressure is coherent situational vise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: fractures are not erased but laced with gold, making repaired weakness the engine of flight. Kintsugi motif shifts from metaphor to literal propulsion—bronze scars glow, lifting the barge—so concept and image converge. Final image refuses moral; it crystallizes paradox that exile’s wounds become buoyancy. No echo of prompt jargon; “quilting” is the only soft abstraction, dampening resonance slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric-acid diction—“corroded hull bubbling with fumes that clawed”—is sustained, rhythmic, POV-bound. Compression taught early (“between breaths held underwater”) licenses elliptical syntax that peaks under hypoxic stress. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays tethered to alchemist’s chemically-burned attention. Filter verbs rare; metaphor density purposeful, pattern-paid-off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long inhale sentences build, then fragment as air runs out. Information dual-loaded—“bronze form pockmarked by eons of brine and betrayal” fuses world + backstory. Minor loop: “quilted” appears 5×; deduct −0.3. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold; props tracked cleanly (charm, statue, gears).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating acid forge + kintsugi mechanics is a fresh synthesis; stakes feel inevitable to this world. Risk of underwater monologue is justified by breath-clock and paid off with buoyant resurrection. Transformation test fails if moved to land—acid and clockwork lift are inseparable. One slight echo of “fractures invite gold” self-help idiom, but context literalizes it.</comment>
