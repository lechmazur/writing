<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elaron’s “warmly observant” nature is shown through concrete micro-choices—watching Mira’s trembling hands, selecting the cicada, refusing to stare directly—so his trait alters tactics, not just mood. Mira’s interiority is thinner; her shift from despair to recognition is credible but delivered in a single whispered line, so the cost feels compressed. The closure hinges on her acceptance, yet the causal engine is Elaron’s embodied action,满足Q1的9+ test for contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s stance crystallizes when the cicada’s molt re-prices her leaving as rebirth, not loss. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each ripple, star-refraction, and shell-texture beat deposits density until the final image reweights the stake. The cost is legible—“time’s true skin” carries permanent, tactile loss of the old form. One hairline slip: “years flickered tangentially” is slightly abstract, blurring the exact moment of reconfiguration, holding the score just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto, cicada, and tidal pools constrain every beat: only the angled reflection yields truth; only the pool’s pulse can amplify memory. Starlight refracting off jade literally changes what can be foreseen, satisfying the 9+ gate that environment charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—cicada placed, reflection watched, distance held. One minor over-description: “fragmented skies trapped in eternity” drifts toward ornament, not tool, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira’s terror of transition—tightens when the cicada forecloses retreat: the vision proves leaving is irreversible molting, not optional escape. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (grit, silk, nacre) adds density until the stake is reweighted. Agency remains Elaron’s; Mira’s yes/no moment happens off-page, so the price is felt but not visibly paid by her hand, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from tactile particulars: molt, nacre, jade veins—abstraction “transition periods devour us” is voiced once by Mira, not the narrator, so the echo is character-anchored. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: the cicada’s new skin is “time’s true skin,” repricing loss as necessary exposure. Complexity is honored—no promise that the next skin will fit. Only the faintest whiff of pseudo-profundity in “texture of time itself” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance sustains a consistent, tide-drenched diction: “phosphorescent waves,” “mollusk shell cracking open.” Filter verbs are minimal; perception is filtered through Elaron’s chronicler gaze, not tourist catalog. Rhythm swells and recedes with the sentence lengths, echoing surf. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is outside Elaron’s lexicon, a nano-slip preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “starlight refracted off the cicada’s body, scattering into the pool’s miniature cosmos” does world, object, and metaphor in one sweep. No template cadence, no synonym loops. Peak beat—“viscous in hesitation, feathery in release”—uses compressed adjectives that match the POV’s tactile obsession. A single mixed metaphor—“shell cracking open” then “nacre smoothing”—is justified by the shell’s actual growth, so artifact is avoided.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar trope—mystic guide offers vision—is inverted: the seer seeks texture, not prophecy, and the tool is an insect molt, not crystal ball. Tidal pool as scrying surface is fresh; angled reflection rather than direct gaze redefines foresight as indirect sensory reading. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure replaces causal reversals, yet coherence holds. The synthesis feels specific to this grotto, not portable elsewhere, earning the high band.</comment>
