<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s chastity-as-rebellion is compelling but stays abstract; no moment lets us feel the cost of untouched skin while she dances. Her interiority drifts into grand label-speak (“paradox in the Empire of Lullabies”) rather than a specific, body-level contradiction. The final smile is earned, yet the lack of any micro-choice that risks her chastity blunts the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the loom’s shatter reweights conformity—but causality is vague: why does purity unlock the prism? Orientation is clear; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet escalation feels like decorative layering rather than narrowing options. The “harvest” beats repeat without tightening the noose; the last knot’s resistance is declared, not tested on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and starlit snow are vivid, selective, and mirror the lullaby’s chill; ice crystals refracting through prismatic veils supply the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara dances center-stage. Weather halts mid-fall—an earned environmental response to the loom’s fracture—so the setting actively charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defy conformity’s lullaby—is signaled early; pressure escalates by density (echoes harvested) rather than causal turns. One visible cost: citizens’ smiles falter, but the price to Elara herself is only implied. Agency is present—she lunges at the final knot—but the tightening is atmospheric, not option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: chastity weaponized as revolution, seduction repurposed as decryption. Subtext lives in gesture—untouched fingers grazing decree-threads—rather than exposition. The final image reframes serenity as storm prelude without moralizing. Some abstractions (“harvest of echoes”) flirt with pseudo-profundity but are grounded by sensory particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, ritualized, consistent; diction stays within a courtesan-poet lexicon. Rhythmic control peaks in the “between sigh and smile” refrain, teaching the reader the compressed timeframe. No dialogue to contaminate cadence. Filter verbs are few; metaphor strings serve the liturgical tone without clutter. Perceptual signature is Elara’s: skin untainted yet commanding communal breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; stacked metaphors (“flakes drifted like forgotten promises”) risk purple but stay purposeful. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density high—“threads dissolved to ash at her feet” does triple duty: action, image, consequence. Final line lands clean; no artifact touches closure. Minor register drift toward “conceptual repricing” language, but fits the elevated lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: chaste courtesan as cryptographic key, seduction recast as political decryption. Transformation test passes—change Elara’s purity and the entire mechanism collapses. Risk-taking in lyric repetitions pays off at closure. Echoes of Atwood’s Handmaid lullabies are present but reversed through body-poetic rebellion; not derivative but dialogic.</comment>
