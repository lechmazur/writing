<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—glee braided with grief—stays embodied in sea-foam skin and humming dirges; her micro-choice to scatter a seed is the single visible decision that costs her lingering doubt, so the change is earned if modest. The “cheerful gloom” refrain edges toward performed label-speak twice, damping full credibility, but her flaw (path-seeding hesitation) directly shapes the closing image, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (geode glow, seed patter, glass flare) deepens the dominant stake of vanishing paths until the final Charged Poise reframes loss as migratory necessity. The closing conceptual reprice—paths vanish to become seeds—is legible and felt, but the early causal hook (why her own fork “winked out”) is answered more by lyrical echo than by dramatized cause, keeping it just outside 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Irredescent geode is not postcard scenery; its refracting walls literally color her mood and supply the ledge that catches seeds, charging the final rainbow image. Crater glass functions as micro-setting, constraining her transliterating tool until seeds repair it, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single cavernous room; one capped detail—bird exit vector—could be sharper, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Stake—why paths disappear—tightens once: seed scatter rewrites the rule from “loss” to “migration,” a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of erasure) rather than visceral; no concrete resource is forfeited, so the price is legible but soft, capping high-band entry. Pressure accumulates via sensory density rather than option-closing turns, sufficient for this word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: vanishing paths as latent seeds is reweighted by the final image of Elara tucking a seed away, a non-literal answer to her opening question. Cheerful-gloom tone and iridescence motif recur with shifted valence, satisfying the 9+ quick test. One near-articulation—“paths vanish not from malice, but because they are seeds”—hovers at thematic echo, light but not final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Sea-foam perceptual signature permeates diction: “frothy,” “bubble-memories,” “waves clapping in joy over submerged wrecks.” Rhythm modulates from lullaby dirge to hopeful refrain, mirroring emotional arc without syntactic monotony. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal register stays consistent, if occasionally ornate. Compression (“conjecture her truest action”) is taught early and paid off, meriting high-band credit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene temperature; sentence shapes vary, propelling toward luminous final flare. Occasional purple clusters—“iridescent as frozen fireworks,” “cheerful gloom”—risk overwriting but are pattern-taught and thematic, not artifactual. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding detected; information density remains high. One mixed metaphor—“weaver mending fog”—is strained yet aligns with Accumulative texture, a minor hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Core synthesis—geode + memory-weaving + migratory seed logic—feels inevitable in hindsight and is specific to this voice. Risk-taking lies in lyrical Accumulative structure rather than twist, but the reframing of erasure as dispersal is non-obvious and emotionally resonant. No close echoes of canonical scenes; trope of “lost paths” is refreshed through meteor-glass transliteration and avian sowing, earning the upper band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Early signal frames her task; two beats—handling crater glass and scattering the seed—alter tactics; closure links when she palms a seed, embodying new stance with cost of surrendering certainty.</grade>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Handled in discovery beat (sees gaps), transliteration beat (seeds ignite script), and closure flare (emotions fully inscribed); without its fissures the seed logic would fail, making it indispensable.</grade>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Missing pieces drive every move—gaps in glass, in paths, in memory—and the final reversal revalues those gaps as fertile absence; concept tightly shapes stakes and ending.</grade>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Trait enables the only visible magic: seeds spark azure/golden script; failure (dim glass) pressures her to act; cost is acceptance of unreadable emotions until seeds arrive.</grade>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Conjecture is her sole agency—tracing seed patterns to infer the vanishing rule; the climactic realization arises directly from this interpretive act, redefining her worldview.</grade>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Method is seeded (pun intended) early by bird intrusion; mechanics—seeds nesting in cracks—literally rewrite the glass and the story’s rule; without it no revelation exists.</grade>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>Geode walls supply reflective surface for mood, ledge for glass, and rainbow approval at end; setting subtly guides seed catch and final peace, active not ornamental.</grade>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>Before memory fades is stated repeatedly, tightening ambient urgency; it alters pacing toward haste but lacks a precise ticking mechanism, keeping it solid mid-band.</grade>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Desire propels every beat—question voiced to crystals, conjecture performed on seeds, final laughter accepts answer; friction between wanting truth and fearing erasure is dramatized.</grade>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Cheerful gloom saturates diction, imagery, and emotional calculus; tone modulates from merry dirge to hopeful refrain, charging the final rainbow peace with bittersweet acceptance.</comment>
