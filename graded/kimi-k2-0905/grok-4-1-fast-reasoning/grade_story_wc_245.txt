<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elar’s interiority pulses through embodied sensation—“his skin drank the earth’s mutterings”—and every beat is filtered through his blindness, giving consistent POV-specific perception. The ring’s warming, the soil’s ink-like seepage, the braille of air constitute micro-choices that track his rising emotional stake. Grief is never labeled; it arrives as “unresolved chords” that the stillpoint finally harmonizes, so the renunciation of the ring feels earned. Only minor over-clearness in the final self-explanatory tear keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ultrasonic pulse, note-cluster, and ring vibration layers density until the mirror-cleared clearing reframes all prior vibration into silence. Causality is atmospheric—because he keeps absorbing, therefore the internal map reweights—but the final image of constellations resuming shift crystallizes the cost (his lover’s face resolves). No orientation debt; anchor (blind mapmaker, night forest, star-pause) is taught by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: the stillpoint reconfigures meaning without tidy epiphany, and the price—ring removed, maps now knowingly incomplete—lands on the page.</comment>

<comment>Ultrasonic forest is not postcard backdrop; its very medium—sound beyond hearing—forces Elar’s haptic navigation, constraining every step. The platinum ring operates as micro-setting, cooling, warming, scorching against his flesh, charging the final release when discarded. Constellation pause supplies a live clock: the sky holds breath until the instant he touches the pool, then resumes, marking before/after. Spatial choreography stays clean—mossy hummocks, bioluminescent fronds, mirror pool—always discovered through touch, never visual gloss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—chart inner grief or remain hollow—threads every beat; each ultrasonic note absorbed is a tightening of emotional density. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational: the forest’s very texture demands deeper absorption. One meaningful escalation: when ring “scorches like restrained fire,” the cost of continuing becomes visceral, foreclosing retreat. Final image of ring removed and maps knowingly incomplete pays visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of mapmaking: only by surrendering the compass-tool can the heart’s terrain be drawn. Subtext resides in silence—pool’s mirror lacks waves, yet reflects constellations—implying that grief’s resolution is not erasure but stilled inclusion. No moralizing; the last line quietly equates “quiet blaze” with new parchment, letting image reweight prior motifs. Ambiguity lingers: will future maps still hollow him? The question stays open, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays glued to Elar’s sensorium; every metaphor is tactile—“ring hummed,” “notes etched into air he felt on his skin.” Syntax lengthens during absorption, then fractures into shorter units at the clearing, mirroring the cadence shift from search to stillness. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk; the few murmured words (“Lead me”) retain ember-low register consistent with introspection. Perceptual signature is irreplaceable: only a blind dowser could “read” ultrasonic braille.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sightless perception, emotional state, and world detail—“His skin, attuned to an ancient gift, absorbed languages through leaves and stones as if they were living scrolls.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Figurative language peaks at the pool but remains coherent—mirror-flat water literalizes the stillpoint without mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized into truth”) nudges toward purple but stays within POV’s mystical vocation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind cartography + ultrasonic forest + emotional dowsing converts familiar grief quest into sensory alien terrain. The ring is not generic compass but harmonic tuner; the stillpoint is not zen retreat but literal sound-cancellation node—specific world logic, not metaphysical hand-wave. Risk of rival mapmaker warning could feel contrived yet is subordinated to atmosphere, so doesn’t hijack originality. Transformation test fails only if Elar weren’t blind; sensory premise is inseparable from plot.</comment>
