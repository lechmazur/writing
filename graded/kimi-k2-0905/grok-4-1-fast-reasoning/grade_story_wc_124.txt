<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s wistful, scent-avoidant interiority is concrete (silk scarf, trembling uncorking). The contradictory drive—grief repulsion vs. ache to inhale—powers every beat, culminating in knees buckling then voluntary deep inhale: earned reversal with visible cost. No second character onstage, so relationship/status bullets skipped; micro-choices (light angle, vial reveal) steadily expose hierarchy of values. Closure renunciation (“aromatically cautious anew”) is legible cost, though slight diagnostic tint in “motivation crystallizing” nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation (who/where/when) anchored by line 3. Causal lens holds: because he smells→therefore UV→therefore sees pollen scripts→therefore understands→therefore inhales grief. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “aromatically cautious anew” with felt cost—path foreclosed, memory accepted. No teleporting props; vial and lantern seeded early. Slight risk of thematic over-articulation in final paragraph, but image of tears drunk by petals reweights prior stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal-shadow lattice, dew-kissed fronds, UV scalpel-beam: selective sensory triad mirrors emotional filtration. Greenhouse topography stays coherent—dome center, loamy soil under knees—guidifying physical choices (kneel, pocket lantern). Extinct-plant biopics limited to necessary; no exposition dump. Tool (lantern) doubles as micro-setting that constrains angle of reveal, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather is internal humidity, tracked consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he surrender to scent-induced grief?—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation: scarf barrier→vial uncork→UV reveal→plant floods air→he inhales: each step narrows exit until choice becomes inevitable. Cost legible: knees buckle, chest crushed, sobs rack. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Tension tightens once, decisively; meets short-form threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—olfactory memory as both wound and tribute—emerges through image chain (crystal, UV, tears, petals). No explicit thesis; final whisper to flower offers Charged Poise. Subtext in silent tear-drinking petal suggests reciprocity between grief and revival. Complexity preserved: understanding does not erase pain. Ambiguity lingers: “cautious anew” implies future flinches, not cure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-close hovers at intimate distance; perceptual signature—light fractured into “crystal shadows,” scent as “sweet decay laced with honeyed rain”—remains consistent. Syntax flexes with pressure: long rolling sentences for nostalgia, fragment-like bursts at bloom climax. No dialogue, hence no voice-convergence risk. Register stays within plausible lexicon for bereaved botanist-supplier. Patterned repetition of “as the transformation completes” acts as ritual cadence, taught early, paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Metaphor density high yet coherent—light as scalpel, scent as neural key—without mixed-vehicle collision. One paraphrase loop: “He grieved…grieved openly” adjacent; minor −0.2. No scaffold sentences, no filter-verb stacks. Information layers (pollen scripts, terpene mimicry) compressed into two efficient sentences. Final line “heart lighter” lands cleanly without cliché because earned by prior weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ultraviolet botany + grief-coupled perfumery. Concept of extinct-plant greenhouse as memory theatre feels non-obvious. Risk in lyric repetition of “crystal shadows” pays off by final reprise. Could swap estate-sale vial for any keepsake, so slight swappability drag. Insight—tears honor irreplaceability—avails universality through specificity. No trope subversion, but lyrical angle revivifies familiar widower arc.</comment>
