<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral—scarred fingers, mitotic fire, the snap of trust crystallizing—yet the line “trust breaking wasn’t a scream but a cessation” drifts into analytical label-speak at the exact beat where embodied cost should dominate. The micro-choice to bottle his own memory-silence is earned, but the partner’s betrayal is recalled more than dramatized, softening the contradiction that might have pushed this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hearing aid’s first utterance of the snap→hush reweights every prior silence and colors the sunken world with caution’s new timbre, cost paid in brine-tears. The accumulative pattern (harvesting absences → layering voids → auroral imprint) is taught by 25 % and tightens once, mirroring cell-division clock. Lens holds: because each absence is forged into the spiral, therefore the final quiet is both weapon and wound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting transcends postcard: the volcanic forge-veins radiate auroral heat that literally softens the alloy for imprinting, while the greenhouse’s glowing apples throb in sympathetic tempo to the implantation, constraining hammer rhythm and body temperature. The shipwreck ring is not mere backdrop—its shifting hull releases the silt cloud that kisses the dome at the precise beat the imprint sets, welding environment to emotional climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—tightens once when he pours his own bottled-night into the spiral, foreclosing the option to keep that memory private. Cost is visible: the same silence now warns others, so he must forever hear his own wound amplified. Escalation is accumulative (density of void layers) rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric drive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence as both wound and warning; no character sermonizes. The final reweighting—trust’s fracture turned commodity—avows that healing can weaponize memory, leaving ambiguous whether Elias is protector or contagion. Subtext simmers in the auroral hum: beauty born of collapse, echoing the orchard’s bioluminescent rot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic-gothic: brine-tinged consonants, drowned-sailor metaphors, and syntactic swells that mimic currents. The perceptual signature—“colors roared, then quieted”—is unique and carried through without register drift. One hairline slip: “regeneration stirred within him” edges toward textbook diction amid volcanic ash, but the rhythm recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense, zero scaffold loops, metaphors mutually coherent (auroral veins = forge-light = heartbeat). The hammer-fall sentences shorten under mitotic fire, propelling the finale. A single mixed image—“silt clouding the glass” when the dome is already cracked—barely grazes the closure beat, keeping this shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of hearing-aid alchemy + underwater orchard + auroral forge feels inevitable and unrepeatable; the “sound of trust breaking” as crystalline pop→abyssal hush is a fresh acoustic trope. Risk—lyric accretion instead of causal plot—heightens rather than obscures meaning. The piece commits fully to its drowned cosmos without safety-hedging.</comment>
