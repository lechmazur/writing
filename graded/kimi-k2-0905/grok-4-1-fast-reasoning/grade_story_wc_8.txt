<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “emotional rationality” is dramatized in the tunnel: silent tears while logging gas-shipment proof—body and ledger in one beat. Micro-choice to enter ivy-choked tunnel (danger) versus satchel-safe letter (duty) crystallizes hierarchy of values. Grandfather link supplies personal cost, but the beat is summary not scene, blunting embodied contradiction. Closure choice (publish) is foreshadowed, yet feels inevitable rather than costly because no external obstacle tests it on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single causal spine: petal-drop → letter → microscript → ledgers → publish; each because/therefore link narrows options toward exposure. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the illuminated letter, once decorative, now re-weights national myth as war crime—felt cost in Elias’s “heritage felt whole.” Ivy and rose motifs repay disorientation waiver; station geography remains coherent. One scaffold phrase (“noble lies had served their time”) repeats twice without fresh pressure, a minor artifact not touching closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy as green choke constrains movement (tunnel breach) and mirrors narrative overgrowth; rose petal signals time and illusion’s end—both recharge final image. Flashlight beam catching gold “D” micro-setting turns bench into altar of discovery, constraining cautious handling. Sensory hierarchy (damp earth, rust smell, crimson ink) filters through historian’s curator eye. Environment, tool (letter), and recurring petal collectively charge closure; 9-band gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs national myth—tightens when microscript reveals gas canisters, foreclosing “honourable sacrifice” reading. Escalation is single but decisive: Hale’s confession → worse crime → Elias must publish. Personal cost (grandfather) adds visceral price, yet external obstacle (vandal threat) is off-stage, so cost leans conceptual not bodily. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening suffices; closure reconfigures options with undeniable social cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges via ivy/rose recurrence: decorative beauty masking rot. Subtext in microscript and ledger silence speaks louder than any thesis line. Final image—“ivy whispering surrender”—offers non-literal answer: myths unravel when evidence blooms. Avoids moralizing; complexity (Hale’s mercy vs crime) lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person tight maintains historian’s cataloguing diction: “rational thrill,” “conceptual repricing,” lexical choices apt to academic mind. Rhythm accelerates inside tunnel—short clauses mimic heartbeat under torch glare. No dialogue, so voice carries via perception filter; perceptual signature consistent. One register drift: “history’s honest pulse” edges platitude, but saved by final concrete image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density: single sentences often fuse action, metaphor, and backstory (“ivy had overgrown…turning atrocity into necessary sacrifice”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (ivy = myth, petal = illusion). Occasional stacked modifiers (“emotionally rational guardian”) lightly purple but within narrator lexicon. Closure image crisp, no artifact touch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Freshens familiar “hidden war crime” premise through medieval illumination microscript device, linking WWI forgery technique to modern digital fog. Synthesis of rose petal clock and ivy overgrowth as metaphor for layered deceit feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk in quiet academic protagonist pays off via interior pressure. Could push further if external opposition appeared on-page; still, angle is non-obvious.</comment>
