<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. narrative hunger—are alive in every micro-choice (rotating the wing, folding it at the end). The donor-heart backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters her tactics. Final renunciation—she will “illuminate wisely”—is earned by the fractal-map revelation with visible cost: the gift could kill her. Interiority stays concrete, dye-master idiom intact; no stock epiphanies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fractal veins reweight the premise—beauty magnetizes stories that can devour their bearer. Causal chain holds: donor heart → magnetized tales → wing’s iridescent warning → Earned Stasis of vigilant restraint. Cost is legible in the final image—wing dimmed to “velvet blue,” threat interiorized. Lens is Accumulative; pattern taught early (stories “orbit like moths”) and paid off in charged poise.</comment>

<comment>Floating rock tea house functions as micro-setting: its gentle sway and sun-tracked mist prisms directly enable the wing illumination that changes her stance. Jasmine steam, lichen glow, and reed mat are filtered through dye-master priorities—texture, reflectance, surface tension. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Final image—mist curling like “approving spirits”—mirrors internal acceptance without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she wield the narrative magnet without being consumed—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accretive: each sun-trail intensification tightens the warning until the fractal map reweights options. Price is visible: the wing’s shift from sapphire to “velvet blue” marks the danger she now internalizes. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the same beauty that dyes cloth can dye life with fatal stories. Iridescent caution reframed—brilliance as hazard—not stated but revealed through the wing’s hidden veins. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: she folds the dimmed wing as a “talisman,” balancing wonder and warning. No sermon; ambiguity lingers—she may still fail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sharp, dye-master diction—“vat,” “scales,” “sun trails,” “hue shifts”—consistent throughout. Syntax breathes with sun’s crawl; paragraph lengths mirror light migration. No head-hopping; interiority stays tightly bound to Elowen. Filter verbs serve voice—“she noted,” “she tracked”—always tied to professional gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—“stories clung…like dew on spider silk” does two jobs: magnetism + fragility. Rhythm accelerates at revelation—“Suddenly, the scales ignited”—then exhales into dusk. Minor purple tint in “quietly explosive hush” is pattern-taught and paid off, forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: transplant recipient + dye master + narrative magnetism, all inseparable. Sun-trail mechanics and fractal-wing map are non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric overload is embraced but disciplined byAccumulative pattern. No stock tropes; “valley-mist wonder” becomes lived technician’s workplace rather than décor.</comment>
