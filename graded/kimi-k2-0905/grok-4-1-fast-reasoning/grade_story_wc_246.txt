<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the seeds and hunger for cosmic order—stay active in every beat; the pen-touch moment crystallizes both. Her decision to write revision rather than erasure is earned by the prior sensory overload of floating vines and dead colleagues’ ghost-memories. Cost is felt: she renounces the old self who planted chaos and accepts perpetual uncertainty as the price of editorship. Interiority stays concrete—“her arm feel leaden and featherlight at once”—never sliding into therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the nib “ready for histories yet to bend” makes the new rule—end contingent editing with moral freight—undeniable. Causal lens holds throughout: every edit node (“if stable isotopes…then”) is tested on-screen and paid for by immediate physical feedback in the anomaly. Cost is persistent: the anomaly lingers at the edge, a living reminder that each future stroke may re-open chaos. No causal or spatial disorientation past the 120-word mark; who/where/when anchored by “orbital habitat” and “drifted upward stones” inside the first 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gravity bubble is not backdrop but tool: the same flex that warps the pen nib lets Elara straighten it against her thigh, turning environment into lever. Micro-settings—floating slate, ozone-ink smell, panel moth—are filtered through her signal-interpreter bias (she clocks “celestial chatter” before smell). Spatial choreography is clean: arm strain, pen hover, vines retract in observable sequence. Final image of “right-seeded vines now climbed true” re-anchors the once-ruined garden as proof of rewritten physics, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she atone for the seed catastrophe—tightens at each edit stroke; options narrow from “fix anomaly” to “accept eternal editorial vigilance.” Escalation is causal under the chosen lens: each contingency tweak visibly retracts a vine or rewrites a memory, proving price on the page. The midpoint “soft resonant click” of the nib is the decisive beat that flips the tool from relic to weapon, foreclosing the option to walk away. Persistent constraint—anomaly still rim-visible—keeps future cost alive, satisfying high-band requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of clean revision: every unbending bends something else. Subtext lives in objects—the curved nib carries the same torque as Elara’s guilt—never stated. Final image reframes “strange comfort” as the only moral stance left after cosmic editing power is proven both possible and endless. No moralizing sentence; meaning accrues through pen, ink, and lingering gravity rim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tight inside Elara’s perceptual filter—“celestial signal interpreter” diction colors every noun. Rhythm flexes with gravity: long clauses drift, then snap short at the click of unbending. No head-hop; unreliability is hinted (memories already rewritten) but never breaks causality. Voice is unique to this frame—no stock space-poet cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does world-rule, emotion, and motion—“Ink bloomed unbidden from its dried heart, a viscous starlit fluid that smelled of ozone and ancient libraries.” No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (nib=comet) is single-use and paid. One mixed-metaphor risk—“uncertainty cradled confidence like a warped gravity well holding stars”—but the physics of the setting justifies it, so clarity survives. Final line lands with imagistic punch, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Splicing cosmic horticulture with line-level history-editing is fresh; no prior story combines rogue orbital seeds with contingency-grammar revision. Pen-as-tool-of-revision feels inevitable once alloyed to comet-tail physics. Risk—letting physics stay bent at the edge—pays off by keeping moral cost open. Transformation test fails if relocated to non-anomalous farm; anomaly is integral.</comment>
