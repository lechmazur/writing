<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness is dramatized through her reliance on gesture and light; her calm dexterity under demolition pressure shows embodied expertise. The interior contradiction—wanting to preserve infinity while inside a doomed trunk—drives every micro-choice. Her renunciation of escape to finish the array is earned and costly, visible in the sweat-bead line. No diagnostic self-talk; perception stays sensory and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of coin → fractal plan → mirror execution → sky captured, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tree falls but the sky inside persists, reweighting erasure into eternity; cost is the tree’s death and her anonymous exile. Orientation anchored by word 50 (oak grove, dawn, axes outside). No prop or knowledge teleporting; coin mechanics are pre-loaded and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hollow oak is handled tactilely—bark channels carved, knothole light caught, dust sifted—so the library-tree actively enables the tactic. Micro-setting doubles as tool: the inner bark becomes substrate for mirror channels; spatial choreography stays clean as she pries, carves, steps back. Weather/demotion murmur tighten the clock. Final image of salvaged planks glimpsing sky links environment to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—immortalize sky before demolition—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens with each axe-crink outside. One meaningful deepening: the guild’s abandoned ambition becomes her attainable one, reframing failure into possibility. Agency is continuous: she stays, carves, angles mirrors; no outside rescue. Cost legible: tree falls, her authorship erased—felt in “recognizing none of their blurred faces.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transcendence-through-limit emerges from action: her facial blindness enables fractal sight; the guild’s symmetry fetish blocked their success. No thesis states—meaning grows via mirror recursion and the anonymous final smile. Ambiguity preserved: sky preserved yet tree lost, artist unknown. Final image of “memory’s hollow” reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elara’s perceptual filter—no face data, only posture, light, groove angles. Diction remains painterly but precise: “fractally precise strokes,” “sliver of dawn sky,” matching artist lexicon. Rhythm compresses under pressure—clause stacks mimic carving urgency. No head-hops; internal commentary limited to sensorial cues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver setting, stake, and sensory cue (“dust sifting like stars”). Metaphors are spare and consistent—sky as captured constellations—no mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or cause. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she recognized from commissions”). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks at key turns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusing face-blindness with fractal optics is fresh; reverse engineering a mirror-array from a coin’s micro-grooves feels newly specific. Tree-library as doomed archive adds eco-poetic angle. Risk—lyric escalation inside demolition countdown—pays off in charged poise. Transformation test fails if Elara isn’t face-blind; premise is inseparable from plot mechanics.</comment>
