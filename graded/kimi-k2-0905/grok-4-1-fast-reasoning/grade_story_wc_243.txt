<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obsessive need to “preserve small moments” is embodied in every micro-choice (hand-picking petals, the bone spoon). The contradiction—her joy at reunion is inseparable from grief—remains active in-scene. The locket kiss and translucent reprise give visible cost, fulfilling the Earned Stasis/RR test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cumulative/Textural lens holds: each ingredient layers density until the ink climax reconfigures the covenant. Closure (spectral reappearance, inscription) pays off the steep pattern with felt cost—he fades, she walks on alone. Orientation is anchored by “twilight…blooming jetty” within 20 words; no teleport errors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The jetty’s phosphorescent blooms, tidal slaps, and briny air constrain access and supply the ritual water; spatial choreography never slips. Body-as-setting (rib-spoon, walnut-ink on skin) doubles as tool and memory vessel. Final image—moonlit, bloom-scented—recharges the opening twilight, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep their covenant alive—tightens as each petal narrows the ritual to irreversible commitment. Escalation is textural: liquid thickens, ghosts gather, options collapse into “write or lose him again.” The price (he remains locket-bound) is legible on the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory’s weight versus oblivion—emerges through steeping, not sermon. The recharged locket and fading specter reprice archive vs. loss without moralizing. Haunted euphoria is embodied (laughter while tears blur vision), giving ambiguous afterglow that invites rereading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains anchored to Elara’s perceptual bias: synesthetic ink-scent, pollen as stardust regrets. Refrains (“gently thorough,” “haunted euphoria”) pattern-teach early and modulate under pressure. No head-hop, no register drift; sentence rhythm tightens during the ink swirl, then exhales at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Compression is dense—lines layer job, sense, and metaphor simultaneously. Only minor loop echo (“haunted euphoria” 3×) and one scaffold clause (“as always in her craft”) dull the drum; neither touches closure. Metaphors stay coherent (viscous brew = memory liquid) and read aloud cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Ritual-archivist love-ghost story fuses fresh angles: walnut ink as wartime archival tech; bone spoon from lover’s rib. Proximate-cause alchemy feels inevitable yet new. Risk—lyric recursion, translucent resurrection—heightens emotional voltage without gimmick; payoff lands.</comment>
