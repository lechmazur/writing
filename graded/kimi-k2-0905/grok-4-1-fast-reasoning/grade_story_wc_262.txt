<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich—her spatial imagination is dramatized in tactile beats (“every alcove and echo unfolded”). Motivation is anchored to a concrete loss (vanished fiancé), and her final choice to keep the letters while returning the knowledge is earned. The flaw—therapeutic self-diagnosis (“unused love wasn’t inert”)—breaks embodied immediacy once, but contradiction under pressure is otherwise shown, not told.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara pockets the fragment, projector light fuses past into present, cost is the forever-half-presence of her fiancé alongside Tom/Eliza. Causal chain holds—because she reads the strip → therefore finds box → therefore redefines storage of love. Orientation anchors by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn (love migrates) tightens stakes. Persistent constraint: the booth’s angles will keep incubating ghosts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Projection booth as micro-setting constrains every move—brass gears, panel void, take-up reel niche dictate how Elara pries and hides. Sensory hierarchy obeys her crystal-gazer eye: dust motes = future constellations. Spatial choreography is flawless; ladder, panel, locket tracked without drift. Final image re-projects the couple onto bodily architecture, recharging the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where does unused love go?”—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each relic saturates space until architecture becomes storage, tightening options. Cost is legible: she forfeits permanent closure with her fiancé by choosing to become a carrier of collective longing. No reversal, but deepening pattern forces stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Emergent theme: love is not archived but projected, looping through anyone willing to house it. Subtext in gesture—pocketing fragment > stating “I will remember.” No moralizing; final image lets celluloid reunion speak. Complexity preserved: Tom survived yet still lost Eliza; Elara gains communion yet keeps absence. Conceptual repricing: theater now charges admission in perpetual ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is baroque yet controlled; polysyndeton mirrors mechanical projector whir. Perceptual signature—spatial synesthesia—never slips. Compression taught early (“crystal gazer, her trade honed…”) and paid off in lens-pendant fusion. No dialogue; therefore no voice convergence risk. Register stable; poetic diction stays within eccentric clairvoyant lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with scene breath—long clauses build incubation, staccato verbs (“She pried”) mark release. Metaphors stay coherent (celluloid leaves, ducts as veins). One paraphrase loop (“love incubates eternal…stored love…unused love”) in same graph, −0.2. Otherwise high density: every sentence advances image or knowledge. No strained vehicles; clarity intact at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—psychometric projectionist maps lost love inside cinema skeleton—feels inevitable yet fresh. Synthesis of synesthetic spatial imagination with vintage booth lore is specific; removal collapses entire engine. Risk (lyric density) heightens stakes without clouding clarity. No borrowed set-piece echoes. Conceptual integrity absolute: story commits to architecture-as-artery metaphor start-to-finish.</comment>
