<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—the shard silences the hum, visions sharpen, palms cool—creating embodied contradiction. The final ascent threads spectral custodians who nod approval, staging micro-choices that escalate cost. Motivation (“prove coincidences have meaning”) stays legible, but the beat where she pivots from doubt to certainty is summarized, not dramatized, muting the decisive internal fracture. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she descends “knowing others might come,” a stance that forecloses isolation with felt, visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of star-alignment imagery thickens until the final beam reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise—beam ignites, options reconfigured, cosmic silence converted into summons—cost is the irrevocable exposure of her solitude to future pilgrims. Causality holds: shard→sharpened visions→star map→beam; no prop or rule appears late. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass pavilion, shard, and skylight lens are not backdrop—they constrain every move: silence inside the shard dictates when she can think; curved glass dictates star-viewing angles; broken prism limits rekindling method. The final beam is inseparable from the etched circuits and humming facets already established. Micro-setting (shard in palm) literally bridges past-present. 9+ gate met: environment charges the culminating image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“do coincidences carry meaning?”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each star alignment that mirrors her life markers. Escalation is textural: density of star-path imagery increases until the alignment clears the storm, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is legible: she trades anonymity for beacon exposure, solitude for guardianship. No reversal beyond the single decisive ignition; sufficient for 600-word accumulative arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative question “Coincidence? Or proof that stars remembered?” answered by the beam’s eruption. Subtext lives in silence: shard swallows sound → silence becomes conduit → beacon speaks without words. Final image reweights earlier thistle-blown hope from fragile to seeded. No explanatory paragraph; resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative: thistle-blown, prism-song, star-looped repetitions taught early and paid off in the final blaze. Perceptual signature—Elara notices temperature of glass, taste of dust, hush in bone—remains consistent. No dialogue, hence no head-hop or register drift. Sentence rhythm swells with storm then cuts to single verb “roared,” mirroring pressure.</comment>

<comment>Compression is dense: “glass humming pavilion at its pinnacle” fuses setting + sound + location in five words. Figurative language is patterned (thistle-blown, star-threads) rather than ornamental scatter; no mixed metaphors at climax. Minor scaffold: “visions surged” appears twice within four lines—deduct −0.2. Closure sentence is clean, strong-verb driven, no filters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of retrocognition + silent shard + star-alignment mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight—none interchangeable with generic scavenger tech. Post-collapse beacon rekindling avoids standard fuel-repair trope; instead, cosmic silence becomes power source. Risk: lyric repetition could have dulled, but cadence escalation tightens stakes. Fresh inflection: silence weaponized as both gift and cost.</comment>
