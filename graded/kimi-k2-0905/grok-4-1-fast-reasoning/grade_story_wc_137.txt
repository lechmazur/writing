<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “sympathetic skeptic” trait is credibly embodied—she offers tea while doubting myths, then lets the tile crack her doubt. Interior contradiction is alive when she vows to transcribe “not for proof, but…”—a renunciation of her former stance with visible cost. Mother’s memories arrive via concrete cue (tile warmth) and tilt her present choice. Minor flattening: late beats summarize “entangled memories” rather than dramatize her visceral struggle to align numbers with whale-paths, so the final cost is felt but not gut-punch-strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tile’s arrival → warming → memory unlock → transcription vow → tile placed as invitation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the square’s glow at the platform’s heart re-weights the tower from observation post to communal memorial. Cost is legible—she abandons pure skepticism and her private grief becomes shared archive. One soft causality: the fisherman’s “cursed thing” warning is never acted upon (no refusal or consequence), a small unkept setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stargazer’s tower dominates as micro-setting: wind, salt spray, telescopes, lantern-lit floor—every cushion and carved number is handled under pressure. Whale migration and storm thunder constrain pacing (migration = clock, storm = muffled songs, forcing indoor focus). Spatial choreography clean: fisherman climbs, deposits tile, exits; visitors circle the square later. The square itself becomes the charged object that alters choices; environment thus meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform private grief into shared reflection. Pressure tightens once: tile unlocks mother’s memories, forcing Elara to act—transcription forecloses her detached stance. Cost is conceptual (loss of skepticism) rather than visceral, sufficient for lyric mode but keeps score sub-8.5. No secondary reversals, yet whale chorus + human murmurs at close show visible payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: patterns (magic square, star charts, whale routes) as vessels for communal memory. Subtext in tile’s reprise—object once drowned, now cradle of stories. Final image (glow inviting others) reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; no character states “we need connection,” only enacts it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, slightly elevated dience remains consistent with Elara’s star-map precision. Perceptual signature strong: “indifferent stars,” “salt air without resolution.” One POV, no leakage. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for whale songs, clipped for storm. No dialogue to test, so voice cohesion judged on narration alone—passes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density lines do double duty: “whale songs formed an unheard symphony, rising from the deep like melodies no human ear could fully grasp” advances theme + atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “courageously kind” recurs 4× as epithet; not pattern-taught, so −0.3. Mixed metaphor once—“unheard symphony…vibrating through salt air”—but resolves cleanly. No loops touch closure; final paragraph is taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of magic square + whale migration + grief archive feels fresh, avoids stock tropes. Specificity of 4×4=34 grid anchoring memories gives conceptual bite. Risky lyric accumulative structure paid off at closure. Slight deduction for near-echo of “symphony” trope, but rescued by unheard/impossible register.</comment>
