<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s sensory curse and ambition are viscerally embodied; the flower’s bloom forces a credible, costly shift from conquest to poise. Interior contradiction—yearning for wisdom while retching—plays out in scene, not summary. The final renunciation (no longer “ambitious conquest” but “harmony”) is earned by enduring the stench. Micro-choices (doodling while gagging, lashing the pot) reveal a value hierarchy under motion-pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each journal scrap and scent note deepens density until the midnight bloom reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by word 60; no drift. Closure is a Charged Poise: “serenity not as stillness, but poise within sway” reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost—she will forever smell decay in motion. Persistent constraint: her hyperosmic nose now reads decay as wisdom, a price that will shape every future sway.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Whispercanopy’s swaying walkways and tidal winds are not backdrop but active antagonists, rocking the pot and forcing micro-tactics (lash, doodle, breathe). The corpse-flower stench evolves from “faint rot-scent” to “tidal wave,” mirroring internal escalation. Micro-setting—the seed’s leathery husk and lantern-filtered leaf roofs—constrains handling and timing. Final image: village platforms “heaving like breath,” crystallizing the setting-body merger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she bloom serenity amid motion?—tightens when gales threaten to fling the seed into the abyss, foreclosing the safe option. Escalation is textural: each odor note (earth→sweet→rot) intensifies the assault on her trait. Midnight bloom is the decisive intensifier; no coincidence, pure organismic inevitability. Cost is legible: she collapses, nose “aflame,” yet rises with reconfigured stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the olfactory arc: decay as life’s truth, motion as the only stable ground. No moral stated; the final image of villagers “inhaling its lesson through her transformed gaze” lets readers reprice decay. Recurring doodled wrappers accumulate meaning—refuse becomes scripture—until the last wrapper holds the wisdom. Wildflower hush motif stays particular, never abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is scent-first: “wildflower hush,” “briny shift,” “creeping sweetness laced with foreboding.” Syntax lengthens under stench-pressure, then fractures into “frantic loops,” mirroring sensory overload. Lyric elision (“tides turned fully in thought”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to Elara’s nostrils.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm mirrors sway: long sentences for tide-thought, staccato fragments at bloom (“Rotting flesh…”). Metaphors stay coherent—seed veins as “hidden rivers,” platforms “heaving like breath.” One paraphrase loop late (“wisdom flowed—an undercurrent”) but it echoes title, so forgiven. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“gagged,” “clawed,” “collapsed”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hyperosmia + corpse flower + treetop motion yields a fresh sensory crucible unseen in prior canon. Doodling on wrapping-paper refuse as sacred ledger is a specific, non-obvious cultural stroke. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off when the final image reweights decay. Not a collage of tropes but a singular olfactory myth.</comment>
