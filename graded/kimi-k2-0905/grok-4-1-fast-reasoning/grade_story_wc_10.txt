<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory layers—grief-scarred survivor, tender tuner of others’ pain—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (palming glass, selecting forks, kneeling to Kai). The interior split between her need to heal and her fear of shattering the haven is active in every beat; the final visible cost—her own heat-map stilled to “serene waves of creation”—pays the price of perpetual service. No diagnostic speak, no tidy arcs; flaws complicate and are accepted, not cured. Only the Kai pivot feels slightly accelerated—his shift from scarlet to teal reads more symbolic than psychally earned—holding this back from 9+.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unified glow on winterglass crystallizes a new social contract—silence is no longer void but vessel—while the open case forecloses rest for Elara. Causal linkage holds: each fork strike is because/therefore tied to heat-map readings that tighten the stakes until Kai’s crack forces the final harmonizing gesture. The persistent constraint (perpetual hush) shapes every tactic; felt cost is legible in the etched panes that “now bore eternal heat maps,” a permanent scar of service. No orientation drift; conservatory, twilight, and post-Hush rule-set are anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: the panes’ thermal reactivity directly constrains fork choice and mends the lily, fusing environment to plot. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s bias—she sees light, feels vibration, ignores scent—keeping description urgent rather than catalogic. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the group circle, Kai recoil, lily tremor, final encirclement. One hairline slip: “perpetual twilight” is stated twice in similar phrasing, a micro-loop that barely dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can silence be transmuted into shared resonance—tightens through each fork strike; yellow wonder and violet sorrow foreclose abstract hope and force concrete tactile choices. The lily’s crack supplies a visible price that alters tactics mid-scene, converting Kai’s rage from atmospheric threat to harmonized substrate. Escalation is causal, not additive: every heat swirl narrows options until only the deepest fork can prevent collapse. Cost is unmistakable—the conservatory walls permanently scarred—though the moment of Kai’s hand-on-tine could carry even sharper physical risk to push this into 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: communal grief literally etched into architecture reframes silence as communal instrument rather than absence. Subtext operates in gesture—Kai’s reluctant palm on vibrating tine equals wordless apology to drowned brother. Final image (open case) offers resonant non-moral answer: art as endless custodianship, not triumph. The refusal to pronounce a moral keeps complexity alive; ambiguity is meaningful, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person tightly locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—salt-etched skin, vibration in sternum—never drifts into committee voice. Syntax mirrors her tuning logic: parallel “struck high and fast / low and slow” cadences act as auditory metaphors rendered in silent vibration. No head-hopping; Kai’s interior is mapped only through heat glass, preserving distance control. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a musician-survivor; only one near-cliché (“frozen Eden”) but immediately rejustified by POV wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless clauses for aurora sweep, staccato fragments for fork strikes. Information density high—single sentences layer temperature, color, and emotional valence. No loops, no filler; every paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Metaphor vehicles remain internally consistent (glass = canvas, vibration = heartbeat) and pay off in the mending beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—soundless world tuned by thermal emotion glass—is non-obvious and rigorously pursued: rules taught early, implications followed (caregivers accidentally fogging panes). Transformation test fails if swapped: heat-map emotion translation is inseparable from this plot. Fresh inflection at climax—glass etched forever—turns setting into permanent communal score, a risk that heightens meaning without gimmickry. No derivative scaffold; concept grows from specific lived crisis rather than abstract steampunk template.</comment>
