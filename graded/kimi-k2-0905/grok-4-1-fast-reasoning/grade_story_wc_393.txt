<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is palpable, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“guilt propelled him”) rather than embodied contradiction. The moment he watches the heart tick alive is a genuine micro-choice that crystallizes his vow, so change is earned. Still, the apology-to-action pivot is stated more than dramatized in-scene; we see the decision after the fact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the reactivated hymn reweights Elias’s earlier refusal and charges his public vow with conceptual cost. Causal chain is intact—bringing the box → repair → ticking → vow—though the storm-beam trigger is a mild external contrivance. Orientation is secure within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Shop is sketched with velvet cases, dangling keys, slanted sunbeams—selective, not touristy. The clockwork heart itself functions as micro-setting and constrains the final choice by its repaired state. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track. Light-beam moment edges toward convenient symbolism but is filtered through Elias’s spiritual lens, so it passes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to atone for denying Marcus a second opinion—is signaled early and tightens when the heart’s stillness mirrors that refusal. The single escalation is the heart restarting; it forecloses the option of perpetual self-reproach and forces public commitment. Cost is present but abstract (lifetime advocacy vow); a more tactile forfeiture would deepen the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “second opinions as grace” emerges through the repaired mechanism rather than sermon. Final image reconfigures the premise: absolution is iterative repair, not verdict. Subtext in Harrow’s line “what matters is if it’ll wind again” carries the thematic weight without abstraction. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—dust motes as “silent fireflies,” gears “whispering.” Syntax lengthens under emotion, then contracts at the click of revival, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; Harrow’s dialogue is spare, distinct from Elias’s more ornate internal cadence. Filter verbs (“Elias watched”) are minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet efficient; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional loftiness (“vibrant hush,” “ethereal tinkles”) flirts with purple but stays in-character for a chaplain poetically inclined. One paraphrase loop around “aptly deliberate” appears three times; minor scaffold. Rhythm modulates well across short/long sentences; no drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<comment>Clockwork heart as penitential engine feels fresh; merges steampunk imagery with prison-ministry guilt. The antique-shop resurrection trope is familiar, but the hymn emerging from gears rather than a box’s ballerina supplies specific inflection. Risk is moderate; concept stays coherent. Could push further into the ethical thicket of prison reform beyond personal absolution.</comment>
