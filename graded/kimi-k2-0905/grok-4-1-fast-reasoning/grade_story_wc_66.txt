<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation and obsession are vividly etched; every micro-choice—quill angle, dial twitch—springs from her need to re-animate narrative dust. Interior contradiction is alive: rebellion vs. self-erasure, precision vs. yearning. The single on-page renunciation—shutting the dial at dawn—carries visible fatigue and the implicit cost of ongoing pursuit, earning her stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the alcove dims, dust keeps dancing, legacy now externalized. Causal chain holds—because she transmits, therefore dust awakens; because drones hunt, she desists. Cost is palpable in the ‘thistled calm’ that ends the piece, a crystallized tension not yet discharged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist, ember pulses, and the radio’s pale-azure glow are not backdrop but apparatus: they filter visibility, dictate illegal timing, and refract the final star-like dust. The alcove’s physical logic—stone cracks, rising motes—tracks cleanly across every move. Micro-setting (the shortwave dial) literally powers the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—narrative survival—tightens when drone scanners force the decision to sign off. The pirate broadcast is not mere backdrop; each lyric line raises detection risk, narrowing options. Dust’s visible swirl into orchestral shapes is the irreversible consequence that reweights the world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art as illicit code, memory as particulate rebellion. Subtext resides in the stealth lyrics—lullabies to drones, instructions to dust. Final image of dust ‘whispering anew’ gives conceptual repricing: stories have moved from human voice to environmental haunt, reframing narrative scarcity itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, rhythmic prose mirrors score notation; syntax lengthens and compresses like orchestral phrases. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices acoustic texture (radio hum, quill scratch) over visual minutiae. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked in her precise, metronomic attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often delivers sensory data, emotional tint, and world rule. Figurative language is patterned—thistle, ember, luminous—teaching the reader its lexicon early. Only minor scaffold: occasional triple adjective clusters (‘tiny prisms that mimicked stars’) that slightly dilute peak tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—pirate radio, dystopian famine—are re-cast through orchestral copyist craft and dust as mnemonic agent. Risk lies in lyric density, yet coherence holds. Fresh inflection: notation turned lullaby, Mahler requiem as cipher, making high culture covert ops.</comment>
