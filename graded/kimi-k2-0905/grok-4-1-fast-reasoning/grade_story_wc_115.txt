<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jax’s reckless-explorer tag is vivid in the tunnel’s tactile beats, but the pivotal guilt-turn hinges on an off-panel twenty-year-old act never dramatized; the radio-self-confession is clever yet feels externally engineered rather than internally wrung. Interiority is concrete (“dust phantoms brushed his skin”) yet the brother-death link is asserted, not embodied under pressure. Stakes pivot on sabotage admission, but the micro-choice to turn the valve is freighted more by symbolism than by prior-scene-cultivated compulsion. Earned stasis lands, but cost is abstract (“lighter”) rather than physically or relationally paid on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: tunnel entry → wheel discovery → radio confession → valve turn → closure holds cleanly; the late reveal that the caller is Jax retroactively tightens linkage under a psychological-causal lens. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; single-scene default met; one transition (radio break) is legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “truth expelled…feather-light” reweights guilt and reconfigures Jax’s stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint: snapped beads as residual absolution shape final image, satisfying Q2 9+ cost test with only hairline slip—retrospective confession is told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp echo, rust grit, and silt half-burying the bulkhead are selectively filtered through Jax’s goal-driven attention, guiding his kneel-and-touch choice. The beaded wheel re-appears with evolving texture (rusted → yielding) and finally fragments in pocket, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is clean; distance to valve, radio, and door track. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual catalog, supporting drowsy-alert tone. Environment constrains the final act: only by breaching the buried door can symbolic release occur, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt’s weight—signaled early; pressure tightens when radio voices converge on sabotage, narrowing Jax’s options to confess or flee. Protagonist agency drives climax: he grips and turns valve, physically enacting release; cost is the audible snap of absolution beads and the hush of self-exposure. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates via accumulating callers until self-implication peaks. Escalation is one meaningful tightening; coincidence (radio show topic) complicates but does not resolve, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—industrial aftermath as psychic residue—emerges through fused images of rust, rosaries, and spectral looms rather than exposition. Subtext operates in the beads’ shift from curse to absolution; final “tunnel’s hush” invites post-story reflection on unquiet memory. Complexity lingers: ghost shift is read as mind-echo, avoiding tidy supernatural verdict. Only minor slip: last-line “forever changed” edges toward summary assertion, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Jax’s perceptual filter; no head-hops. Diction—“drowsy alertness,” “rusted skeletons of industry”—creates a consistent, slightly fevered rhythm mirroring sleep-deprived focus. Portable-radio crackle and caller diction are differentiated without forced dialect. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory verbs (“gripped,” “crunching,” “snapping”) keep immediacy. Voice modulation peaks in the one-word caller shriek, compressing syntax under stress; closure hush returns to longer cadence, earning 9- band with micro-slip of “forever changed” cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: most sentences advance action or atmosphere. Metaphors are spare and aligned (rusted valve / buried guilt) without mixed clashes. Occasional adjective stacks (“massive and corroded, jutting from a sealed bulkhead door”) slightly slow propulsion but do not recur at climax. No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or synonym churn detected. Opening and closing lines are crisp; middle段beats avoid scaffolding. Clean mechanics; pronoun reference stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—haunted mill, radio confession—are retooled through industrial-archaeology lens and psychological-causal reading of “ghost shift” as memory residue. Beaded valve wheel fuses Catholic iconography with mechanical sabotage in a specific, memorable object. Retro-self-accusation via call-in show supplies fresh twist on confessional scene. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry. Slight deduction for echoing “phantom looms” motif common in labor-haunt fiction, yet local detail (Father Reilly’s rosaries) individualizes the piece within band.</comment>
