<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s terror-heights-drowning triad is embodied (trembling palms, pulse in ears) and directly drives her decision to weaponise Harlan’s thalassophobia. The “perfect double” contradiction—stunt precision vs. internal collapse—remains active in-scene, culminating in the cliff-edge gambit. Micro-choices (kneeling amid tomes, smearing rust-dust) externalise value hierarchy without diagnostic speak. Only slight over-crank: “certainty that one slip would claim her fragile existence” edges toward label summarisation amid high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: because Harlan forged her identity → therefore Elara flees → therefore deciphers cast → therefore doses Harlan with his own sea-fear → therefore earns self-reclamation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are crystalline by line 40. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: she remains phobic but now owns the shakes. Persistent constraint—her phobias—shapes the decisive tactic (plunge & aerosol) and lingers in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted cliff-library is not backdrop but weapon: corroded shelves become rust-dust camouflage, collapsed roof offers starlight for Harlan’s final accusatory glare, cliff drop literalises his thalassophobia. Sensory triangulation—salt wind over gravel, flashlight catching nautilus iridescence—keeps locale active in every beat. Micro-setting (child’s arm cast) doubles as decryption tool and literal fragment of erased identity, charging the climax. Environment directly constrains the tactic: only a vertigo-ridden stunt double could swing from a rusted beam mid-cliff to snatch the vial.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim erased identity—tightens through each causal notch; the gala confession is the irreversible hinge that escalates flight to counter-attack. One meaningful deepening: when shell decodes “fear the deep,” Elara’s vulnerability flips from liability to ordnance. Cost is visible—she still trembles post-victory, proving vulnerability’s price is perpetual, not magically cured. Harlan’s off-stage scream keeps consequence legible without diluting agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reversal of weakness-as-strength without any explicit thesis: phobias move from survival impediment to tactical asset. Subtext resides in objects—nautilus shell (fragmented identity) and child cast (erased past)—that accrue meaning through action rather than authorial nudge. Final image of Elara whispering to the now-silent shell reweights earlier whispers as internalised authority, offering Charged Poise. No moralising; the paradox remains messy, trembling, alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is stunt-performer sharp: kinetic metaphors (“smile a rusted blade”) match occupational risk vocabulary. Perceptual signature narrows to kinesthetic detail—pulse, grip, swing—mirroring her profession’s body-centred world. No head-hop; single POV stays tightly interior. One micro-slip: “transformative betrayal” tagged as phrase rather than shown, but absorbed within otherwise specific diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors vertigo—short clauses at cliff-edge, elongated when decoding cast. Information density high: “seashell murmuring audibly now, spilling his secret phobia” does three jobs (sound, reveal, pivot) in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Exceptional line-level control under peak pressure justifies near-top band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar amnesia-identity trope is refreshed by embedding it in stunt-trade specifics and weaponised phobia. Nautilus shell as decryption key feels inevitable yet non-obvious, growing from coastal setting and spiral motif of fractured self. Risk—making protagonist’s victory hinge on embracing panic—pays off without safety net. Derivative premise penalty waived by occupational detail and tactical inversion of fear.</comment>
