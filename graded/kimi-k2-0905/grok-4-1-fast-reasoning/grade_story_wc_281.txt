<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “affectionate skeptic” is consistently embodied—she hugs Theo while doubting the telepathy—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky choice. Her somatic markers are shown, yet the final “certainty” feels sudden because the prior beats let her doubt recede rather than bite. The micro-choice to blind-test Theo is motivated, but the cost (losing skepticism) is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The causal spine is clear—static shock → devise test → blind exposure → shared marker—but the closure’s “pathways are real” lands as declaration, not Decisive Change with visible cost. The lens stays causal, yet the final beat skips the because/therefore proof: we’re told the willow image mirrors her hidden memory, not shown how that forecloses doubt. The recall scandal and pill backstory tighten stakes early, but their payoff is thematic assertion, not tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The studio’s ozone tang, black cloths swallowing photons, and the geode’s frozen-lightning facets are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through Elara’s artist eye. The micro-setting of the light rig and prism-centerpiece constrains every tactical move; remove it and the entire protocol collapses. Spatial choreography stays clean across wand passes and camera clicks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“is the telepathy real or chemical ghost?”—is signaled early and tightens via each fractal exposure. Agency lies in devising the blind test, yet escalation is incremental (tingle → throat-clench → willow image) rather than option-narrowing; the final image grants confirmation but no forfeiture or new risk. Cost is aesthetic/emotional, not a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—love’s authenticity beyond chemical or mystical shortcut—emerges through the somatic-marker protocol, not exposition. The willowglass tone starts as fragile hope and ends as “solidified certainty,” a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the pill scandal without moralizing. Subtext in silent mirrored coughs and light-painted branches is stronger than the final whispered thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person close clings to Elara’s perceptual bias—fractal visions, ozone scent, willowglass metaphor—without leakage into Theo’s mind. Syntax mirrors her jittery skepticism: stacked participles, hyphenated coinages, light-drenched nouns. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual (“Feel that?”). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift, yet remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; short paratactic bursts under exposure tension give way to longer, luminous clauses at the willow reveal. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. Minor scaffold: “fractally precise” is repeated four times with no escalating payoff; one mixed metaphor (“bending without breaking” applied to hope) blurs. No loops or paraphrase stacks obstruct clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of recalled neuro-pharma scandal + light-painting + geode optics yields a fresh angle on intimacy verification. The somatic-marker protocol feels invented yet plausible, turning a mineral shard into a DIY lie-detector of love. Risk is moderate—lyric compression, concept-heavy diction—but coherence holds. Not transformative enough to feel inevitable in hindsight, yet memorable.</comment>
