<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but abstract; her “traveled stillness” and “expectantly resigned” stance are repeated labels rather than embodied contradiction. The militiaman, merchant, and scholar are sketched by past labels, not on-page choices under pressure. No micro-choice shows Elara risking or forfeiting anything; the closure feels observational rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rosette’s glow and the single hum reweight the premise that harmony is subtraction. Causal chain is thin—choir members soften because they “mirror the rosette” rather than through dramatized beats—but the accumulative pattern holds. Orientation is clear by 120 words; one transition (weeks → dusk) is legible. Cost is implied, not viscerally felt, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The velvet library, autumn leaves, and zither rosette are vividly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; the rosette constrains her teaching method and charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (amber light, plush shadows) mirrors internal quiet without cataloguing. Spatial choreography remains stable despite off-page choristers. Environment subtly guides choice: the library’s hush enables the subtraction method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—braid hostile voices—signals early. Pressure escalates via accumulative softening rather than causal turns: voices “shed barbed edges” through mirrored drone, not forced choices. No visible price is paid by Elara or choristers; hatred dissolves rather than being traded off. Tightening occurs when Joren falters, but the moment is summarized, not dramatized, limiting escalation bandwidth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—harmony as excision—emerges through recurring subtraction imagery and the rosette’s spiral, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in the rosette’s glow intensifying, implying approval without statement. Final image reframes preservation as active braiding, offering resonant reconfiguration. Occasional thematic echo (“unlearning hatred”) is soft enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s contemplative diction; syntax lengthens to mimic stillness, then contracts at closure. No head-hopping; choral voices remain external. Register remains elevated but consistent with Elara’s vocation. Occasional poetic compression (“velvet hush”) is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from languid opening clauses to the final monosyllabic “braid.” Figurative language is dense but purposeful, never crowding causality. Minor scaffold: “expectantly resigned” appears three times; “traveled stillness” twice. No mixed metaphors or loops in the closure beat. Strong read-aloud cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: peace-building via spectral music theory and abalone cartography. Subtraction-as-harmony reverses usual additive metaphors. Risk taken in lyric compression pays off in final image. Could swap names without breaking arc, so not quite 9.0.</comment>
