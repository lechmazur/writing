<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her hesitation breathes through “waves lapping her ankles.” The librarian’s motivation is locked to the furnace image, a tangible engine of want. Contradictory impulses (archivist vs. cartographer) clash in-scene, not summary; the final fusion costs her the safety of a fixed self. Only micro-slip: “wonder reigniting like wintersun on frost” drifts toward label-speak (−0.1).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the smelted orb re-enters Elara, reweighting identity forever. The cost is felt—“maps unfurled… alive with possibility amid routine tides”—routine itself is now freighted with risk. Causal lens holds: acceptance → alchemical melt → migration. No orientation debt; domes/ tides/ gears are anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass-domed winter-sun and marble alphabets are not scenery but tools—Elara slips on wet marble, the creel’s bamboo “echoes spines of scrolls,” fusing object + setting. Tidal floor constrains every footstep and shapes the smelting pool. The atrium’s very walls press the paradox: serenity vs. flux. Final image—gears drip seawater—crystallizes setting as body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can wonder survive routine? Tightens when the waning moon traps Elara in looping spirals—no exit without smelting. Price is paid on-page: she must surrender coherent self to tidal breath. Escalation is single but sufficient; luck complicates nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the act: preservation through surrender, wonder via fracture. No moral spoken; final image of dripping gears re-prices the librarian’s own ticking identity. Subtext whispers in silence—after “thank you,” the surf answers, not philosophy. Complexity stays: monotony is both enemy and crucible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lens keeps titan-gear distance yet lets steam, chimes, tidal breath filter through Elara’s skin. Syntax mirrors pulse—long tide-sentences crash, then short “She gasped.” No head-hop; librarian’s interior only via joint-whir and furnace-vent. Only blemish: occasional elevated “ethereal essences” drifts from Elara’s earthy cartographer tongue (−0.2).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. “Creel’s slats parting like welcoming reeds” does triple duty: object, motion, metaphor. Information density high—one line can fuse moon-phase, identity storm, and marble underfoot. Rhythm breathes with tide; no figurative muddle at peak smelt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Alchemical smelting of identity via tidal library is fresh synthesis; no template echo. Risk—passive acceptance as action—pays off: climax is surrender, not strike. Specificity keeps it from abstraction: bamboo creel, bronze gears, wintersun glare. Transformation test fails if moved to any other world; the atrium’s physics are inextricable.</comment>
