<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s survivor-guilt and reef-witness identity drive every micro-choice; the tapping ritual embodies memory under isolation and the final broadcast is a credible renunciation of solitude that costs him the safety of silence. Interiority stays concrete—knuckles, rust, salt-sting—and the contradiction between scientific detachment and grief is kept live in scene. The only minor slack: the “metamorphosis” realization is slightly therapy-speak adjacent, but it is immediately grounded in the atlas fold and transmission act, so the cost still lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the torn atlas becomes proof that vanished shipping lanes can re-emerge, re-weighting twenty years of grief into cyclic hope; the price is the exposure of Elias’s solitary witness life to global scrutiny. Causal chain holds: because reefs died → gyres destabilized → lanes vanished; because nascent corals return → new lanes birth → atlas gains future value. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tapping + hologram assembly accumulates meaning until the final image reconfigures stakes. No orientation debt; station, time, and POV are anchored by word 90.</comment>

<comment>Pacific buoy field, rusted railing, salt-fogged holodisks, and the atlas page itself function as micro-setting that physically constrains assembly choices—projectors short in humidity, drawers swell shut. Sensory hierarchy is scientist-biased: data logs before horizon, calcium dust before stars. Spatial choreography is clean; Elias moves from deck to drawer to bench to broadcast console without drift. Final image re-uses the atlas in pocket as tactile promise, charging closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—why shipping paths vanished—tightens through data assembly: each corroded holodisk shrinks options until only the atlas overlay remains. Mid-scene deepening occurs when coral cores reveal nascent color, flipping puzzle from pure loss to emerging pattern. Cost is visible: Elias’s exhausted knuckles, the station’s groan, the decision to transmit rather than hoard data. Agency is accumulative—tapping, aligning, wiring—rather than single decisive punch, fitting the lyric mode.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from refrain “periodically eternal”: bleaching and rebirth are natural cycles accelerated by human harm and repair. Atlas page transforms from relic of loss to seed of future routes, re-pricing grief into stewardship without moralizing. No symbolic convenience; reefs steer currents is stated once then demonstrated through data. Final image—Elias pocketing atlas while watching reborn horizons—offers resonant, non-literal answer: endurance as cyclical witness.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—rhythms of tapping encode memory, scientific diction shrinks to Morse-like pulses. Sentence cadence mirrors tidal rise/fall, varying naturally; no template drumbeat. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which remains salt-corroded and mechanical. Register never drifts into academic editorial; “calcium dust,” “gyres,” “polyps” stay worker-level precise.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence doubles duty—information + sensation—“hologram flickered to life above the bench” advances plot while casting blue ghosts that echo reef spirits. No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes; final sentence resolves with image that recharges “periodically eternal” motif. Only micro-slip: “conceptual integrity” in penultimate paragraph is slightly elevated diction, but immediately offset by pocket-fold action.</comment>

<comment>Fusion of climate-science procedural with lone-worker ritual feels fresh; tapping Morse on a buoy station to map vanished trade routes is not a trope I’ve seen. Atlas page as both data fragment and heart fragment transforms familiar eco-grief into cyclical hope without sermon. Risk taken: accumulative assembly instead of set-piece confrontation, paid off by hologram epiphany that reweights prior coral dives. Specificity of coral-gyre interaction is verifiable, not Wikipedia-voice.</comment>
