<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s inner contradiction—needing to weaponize mockery to heal—lands only in the final paragraph; until then she is a poised guide, not a conflicted agent under live strain. The pendant’s burn and her sweat are the single embodied cost; we are told “bittersweet burden” rather than shown a specific forfeiture. Micro-choices (tuning, fingering) track cleanly, but no moment forces her to risk failure or question her ethos, so the change feels observed, not earned. Still, her perceptual filter is vivid and consistent, keeping her above archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens accrues through echo-layers; closure is a Charged Poise: gorge hush + cooling pendant crystallize cost without narrative over-explanation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 40 words; no penalty. One deepening—Harlan’s laughter finally released—reweights the stake; options narrow to “carry on” with heavier heart, visible in Elara’s faint smile. Persistent constraint (pendant’s heat) shapes every climb and pluck, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mist, wall-caught light, and jagged path are filtered through Elara’s urgent bias, not tourist detail. Echo Gorge functions as instrument: its acoustics amplify confessions and compel the harp counter-music; without the chasm’s feedback the tactic fails. Spatial choreography remains exact across slick rocks and ledge; no impossible positions. Crocodile-tooth and harp serve as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—can laughter purge guilt?—is signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is textural: each warped chord thickens the spectral wail until silence after the final note feels like aftershock. Harlan’s release is Elara’s visible price: she absorbs his ache into the pendant, foreclosing her own rest; cost is legible in “pendant cooling” against her skin. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening at the climax tightens the pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme—redemptive laughter—emerges organically from Harlan’s confessions and Elara’s counter-melody; no explicit moral is stated. The luminous ache motif migrates from landscape to jester’s face to Elara’s chest, reweighted at closure when sunrise gold replaces nocturnal ache. Subtext operates in gesture: silent bells, burning pendant, final faint smile. Insight is earned, not sermonized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual sieve; diction (“luminous ache,” “jagged mirth”) feels character-specific, not authorial flourish. Rhythm accelerates with sweat-inducing climbs, then cadences into the hush of release. No head-hopping; psychic distance calibrated to her sensory spikes. Experimental compression and echo-patterning are taught in line one and paid off in final echo, keeping elision legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Figurative density is high but patterned; every metaphor is acoustic or tactile, supporting the echo motif. No mixed metaphors; “tears on stone” and “giggles choked by thorns” extend the same sensory logic. Information density strong: one sentence often performs place, tool, and emotional charge. Minor loop: “confessions…echo” concept repeated in adjacent clauses; does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Soul-collector + misaligned harp + gorge acoustics forms a fresh acoustic necromancy; trope fusion feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the mechanism collapses. Specific detail (“crocodile tooth harvested from a river beast that once guarded forgotten graves”) anchors novelty in lived world-logic.</comment>
