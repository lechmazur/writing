<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“his breath steadied; ambiguous loss had fractured him”) yet remains convincingly conjurer-specific. Micro-choices (kneel, trace, slot) flow from the revealed motive and visibly dovetail memory to mystery. No contradiction or therapy-speak; flaws (obsessive calculation, secrecy) complicate the final stance. Cost is felt: empty pouch, pulsing stone, onward step—renunciation of certainty earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the stone’s pulse + the step “onward” reconfigures options with undeniable emotional cost under the Accumulative lens. Causal chain holds—because Elowyn vanished, therefore Thorne studies chips, therefore he dovetails eyes, therefore the orchard stirs. No teleporting props; glass eyes commissioned earlier, wand sourced on-site. Mosaic pattern taught by 25 % and constrains final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is not backdrop but tool: stalactite drip nourishes trees, luminescent fruit heats wand-tip, chipped tesserae provide dovetail blueprint. Spatial choreography clean—roots, stepping-stone, eyes, wand— tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys conjurer’s gaze: moon-angles, fractures, iris facets. Environment literally channels the dovetail act and final heartbeat image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve/reason Elowyn—signaled in second paragraph and tightens when each dovetail cut narrows possibility to one: pursue via math. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. Escalation is accumulative: each chip mapped = density rise; orchard’s hum = visible response. Cost paid: pouch empty, glass eyes forever lost to stone, hope re-priced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as soluble geometry—emerges from concrete acts, never asserted. Fractal veins, dovetail joints, harmonic series all re-emerge in final image, reweighting “ambiguous loss” from abyss to asymptote. No moralizing; final smile is stance, not lesson. Reader left with paradox: convergence may never come, yet pursuit is mathematically warranted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, yet anchored in conjurer’s perceptual bias: “spells woven from dew and shadow,” “dovetail guides, interlocking arcs.” Syntax flexes—parallel branches mirror fractal theme—without monotony. No head-hop; single POV stable. Register stays within plausible diction for a secluded scholar-mage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control high—sentence length varies to mimic drip, dovetail, heartbeat. Metaphors (moon-needles, iris-tears) are sustained, coherent, never mixed. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Minor density clot in “mathematics of emotion” phrase repeated twice, but does not stall closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of carpentry joinery + emotional calculus feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Chipped mosaic as cipher for grief’s geometry is fresh; taxidermy eyes repurposed as lens into mathematical after-life is unsettlingly specific. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off in charged final image. Could not swap “dovetail” for “mortise” without collapsing symbolic logic.</comment>
