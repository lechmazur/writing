<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s curse creates immediate, embodied tension in every line he speaks; the contradiction between involuntary candor and his yearning to protect wonder is dramatized, not labeled. The lacquer-box workaround shows a hierarchy of values—truth vs. wonder—paid for with the heirloom itself. Mira’s spark-dimmed weariness is concrete in her grease streaks and coin-slap, and her choice to climb reframes her identity from tech to quest. Cost is visible: Elias loses the box, Mira risks the tower; the final smile is earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: curse → blunt truth → riddle box → Mira’s climb → hive restoration. The blackout and failing hive are anchored by word 30; orientation is never in doubt. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s hum will return, but the social contract between toll-man and city is re-priced—wonder is now a toll paid in risk. Cost is legible in the heirloom relinquished and the climb undertaken after dusk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tower, booth, and matchbox function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Lightning rods, waxen halls, and nectar dusk are sensory, selective, and filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias toward golden, viscous imagery. Spatial choreography is clean: line → booth → spiral stairs → hive core. The matchbox’s striker and worn lid are tactile anchors that evolve from heirloom to ignition tool, charging the final image of sparks relighting the hive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore wonder within routine—is signaled in paragraph 3 and sharpened when the curse forces Elias to surrender his workaround. One meaningful tightening: the riddle’s reading narrows Mira’s options from “fix drones” to “rebirth hive,” foreclosing sabotage theories. Cost is visible—Elias’s loss of the box, Mira’s upward risk—but escalatory pressure is moderate; the climb is voluntary rather than forced by ticking clock. Agency remains with protagonists; coincidence complications zero.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-didactically: wonder is not antithetical to mechanism but is itself a mechanism—riddles are gears, nectar is currency. The final sparks reweight the matchbox from quaint heirloom to ignition of rebirth, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in Mira’s silence after reading shows recognition rather than exposition. No thematic echo lines; meaning accrues via image progression: dusk → lacquer → match → lightning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias without head-hopping; perceptual signature is thick with synesthetic nectar imagery and toll-booth idioms. Syntax mirrors his constrained voice—short, declarative bursts when curse bites, longer riddle cadence when wonder is invoked. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven: Mira’s demands, Elias’s involuntary truth, both carrying subtext of need vs. fatigue. No filter-verb stacks; psychic distance tightens perceptibly during the box hand-off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “nectar dusk settled… like spilled honey” does triple duty—setting, tone, character lens. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent within bio-electric bee logic; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates into the final climb without monotony. One near-overwrite: “thick and golden” repeats honeyed idea, but the echo serves tonal layering rather than redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bee-keeper logic with power-grid mechanics feels fresh and inevitable; trope twist transforms urban infrastructure into living hive. The curse-as-truth-engine collides with riddle-as-veil to produce a non-obvious synthesis: wonder is a technology. Specificity—lacquer box from grandfather, striker worn from old fires—prevents generic “magic item.” Risk taken: lyric escalation rather than action set-piece, paid off by resonant final sparks.</comment>
