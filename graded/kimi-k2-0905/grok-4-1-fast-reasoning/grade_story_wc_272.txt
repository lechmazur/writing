<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for perfection while fearing his own grotesque sight—remains vivid and embodied (“luminescent ache settled in his chest”). The micro-choice to kneel and untangle threads dramatizes a value hierarchy (art vs. self-annihilation) with visible cost. Yet the final “wondering rhetorically” moment drifts into diagnostic self-summary rather than lived contradiction, slightly softening the earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: because patron rejects → therefore artist seeks library → because threads are untangled → therefore loom re-weaves his sight. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elias emerges carrying the mended box: the cost is the glowing scar of transformation, foreclosing return to his old fragmenting gaze. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lighthouse/library anchors are immediate. One minor causality bump: the loom’s sudden existence feels lightly unmotivated, but the closure image still reweights options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse library is not postcard scenery; its narrowing spiral, salt-scented air, and bioluminescent fungi physically squeeze breath and guide Elias’s descent. The broken tarot box and silver threads act as micro-settings that constrain every finger movement. Final image of calmed sea re-anchors the transformed gaze, meeting the 9+ gate that environment charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering artistic truth—tightens when each untangled thread releases a lived memory, narrowing options to either stay shattered or re-weave. Escalation is accumulative: density of recalled betrayals increases until the loom forces a single decisive placement of cards. Cost is visible in the “glowing scar” that persists after storm abates, satisfying the 8+ requirement of felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of necessary darkness emerges from concrete tactile acts (untangling, weaving) rather than abstraction. The final rhetorical question—“if light without shadow held any meaning”—is a deliberate Charged Poise that reweights prior material without moralizing. Particulars (phosphorescent waves, silver threads) accumulate into an organic meditation on art’s dependence on fracture, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly and synesthetic: “gaze splintered into prisms of light” is perceptual signature, not ornament. Rhythm modulates—long clauses mirror spiral ascent, then staccato down-beat clauses mimic descent. No head-hopping; unreliability (seeing faces twist) is consistent until loom corrects. Elision of how loom operates is taught as mystic pattern, paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences pull double duty: “storm’s fury warping the lighthouse into a claustrophobic vortex” advances atmosphere and stakes simultaneously. Few filter verbs; strong verbs (“rifled,” “spilling,” “wove”) propel motion. One mixed metaphor cluster (“vortex” + “compressed time”) momentarily muddles physics but clears before closure. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts test clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Tarot-as-fate is familiar, yet treatment is specific: splintered wooden box dashed against rocks literalizes the artist’s shattered perception. Synthesis of lighthouse library, bioluminescent fungi, and loom of starlight feels inevitable in hindsight, not stitched to prompt. Risk taken in lyrical descent pays off in Charged Poise ending that reweights light/shadow binary without gimmickry.</comment>
