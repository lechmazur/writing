<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—snapping while investing in Kai’s resilience—are vividly present and embodied in her backwards pacing. Kai’s interiority is thinner; his “resilience blooming” is asserted rather than shown through micro-choices. The mentor/ward relationship does act as crucible, altering both states by the end, yet Kai’s final shift feels lightly causally earned. The near-permanence of Elara’s own exile is hinted but not dramatized as a present-tense cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Kai’s shadow rejoins him, reversing exile with visible light-rush; Elara’s cost is the next solitary scroll. Causal chain—tea geometry → sigil → release—holds. Orientation is swift; “forgotten library” and Elara’s shard-mirroring anchor by line 3. The backwards-walking tic is taught early and pays off in the final image, satisfying the pattern waiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The library functions as micro-setting: creaking floorboards constrain Elara’s backwards walk, shards act as tools that must be handled, and the tall glass pane physically traps the shadow—charging the final release. Dust motes, cracked spines, and chipped cup create textured specificity without checklist overload. Playground swing outside re-enters the last line, evolving from atmosphere to approving witness, re-weighting the hush. Spatial choreography remains clean across tea brewing, sigil tracing, and shadow merger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kai’s reversible exile—signals early and tightens when the shadow is literally snared. One meaningful deepening: the fracture line in the leaves raises permanent-loss risk, forcing Kai’s steady hand. Price is visible: Elara’s anxious backwards steps and the emptying library after Kai’s departure. Agency stays with Elara’s annotation and Kai’s sigil; coincidence merely observes from the swing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of shards, shadows, and backwards motion: resilience is assembled from broken pieces and reversed steps. No explicit moral; final image of Elara re-annotating quietly reweights mentorship as perpetual, solitary craft. Subtext in Elara’s harshness carries the unspoken memory of her own near-permanent exile. Combative tenderness avoids sentimentality by anchoring in tactile gestures—steaming tea, snatched scroll—rather than abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment> lyrical, shard-shard syntax mirrors Elara’s fractured worldview: “dust motes danced like forgotten specters” packs perception into metaphor without filter clutter. Dialogue snaps—“Drink, boy” vs Kai’s trembling obedience—maintains status and age idiom. Backwards-walking tic is rhythmically repeated, becoming percussive signature rather than gimmick. No head-hopping; interior access stays locked to Elara with one brief, necessary external observation of Kai’s steadied hand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is strong; long lyrical cadences alternate with clipped commands to mirror tension. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors stay coherent—shards, shadows, tea leaves form interlocking glass imagery. Minor overwrite in “combative tenderness” label reused four times; slight shaving keeps it from 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile parsed through tea-leaf geometry feels fresh; links divination to bureaucratic banishment. Backwards-walking mentor tic is memorable and thematically inevitable. Library of shattered mirrors archiving broken destinies synthesizes gothic and bureaucratic fantasy without overt retread. Risk in lyric density pays off; non-obvious angle elevates familiar mentor-test structure.</comment>
