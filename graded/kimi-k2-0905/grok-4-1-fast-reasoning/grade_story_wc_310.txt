<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—quiet enthusiasm against cosmic dread—is embodied every time she fondles the coins; the final broadcast is earned because each prior cast visibly narrowed her risk. Micro-choices (coin toss, ink on amber shard) dramatize her hierarchy of values without therapeutic self-labeling. No second character appears, so status and relationship criteria are waived; single-POV interiority stays concrete, never abstractly “doubtful.” The only blemish is a hairline slip into “stellar doubt mocked every claimant,” a compressed personification that momentarily outsources her felt cost to the cosmos instead of keeping it in her fingers.

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon beam crystallizes her stance and reweights the contracted universe with undeniable conceptual cost—expansion is prelude because she paid with existential forfeiture. Causal linkage holds: each coin-cast is a because/therefore gate that chooses which static burst she risks sanity to reverse-distill. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“ambered observatory deck…after the universe’s brutal contraction”) so the -0.3 cap is waived. The lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at payoff.

<comment>The ambered deck, resin-locked telescopes, and orrery receiver are not backdrop—they are tools that physically constrain her sequencing of bursts; removing the amber resin would break the distillation mechanics. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias: she notices haptic coin-etch over sound until the high-frequency whine is selected. Spatial choreography is flawless—coins spill, shard is inked, beacon hatch opens in clean succession. World-rules stay consistent: the Big Bang echo can be backward-read because the contraction has literally reversed radiation.

<comment>Dominant stake—wavelength alignment versus dissolution into stellar doubt—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened twice: first when she risks mis-interpreting a burst (peers shredded), then when the core burst demands she become the fulcrum. Each narrowing is driven by her coin-cast agency; luck complicates but never rescues. Visible price: she forfeits passive observer safety and accepts possible obliteration when she ignites the beacon. Cost is legible on the page (“stellar doubt trembled”) even though the universe’s response is still only a hint.

<comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: meaning is not found forward but distilled backward from the cost one is willing to impose on oneself. The backwards prophecy is not a gimmick; it reconfigures the reader’s understanding of causality itself. Subtext lives in gesture—coin spin equals temporal spin—never in editorial assertion. Final image reweights prior material: the amber deck pulses with “newborn purpose,” a non-literal answer that reframes all her earlier micro-choices as inverted Big-Bang fragments.

<comment>Voice is high-register but stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon—an alien-astronomer-poet who literally reads cosmic microwave static. Rhythmic control is precise: long Latinate sentences for cosmic scale, staccato fragments (“She cast lots thrice”) for ritual beats. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Perceptual signature is distinct: she tastes time in metallic coin hum, hears nebulae in radio whine; no head-hopping or filter-verb sludge.

<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Metaphors are stacked (“fossil in the shrunken void”) yet stay coherent because they extend the contraction metaphor without mixed vehicles. Information density is high: “quiet enthusiasm” does emotional double-duty as trait and ironic counterpoint. A single hairline scaffold—“she listened intently” after “static bursts filled the air”—is the only near-redundancy, too minor to touch closure.

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The Big-Bang-in-reverse frame is familiar, but the integration of coin-divination with cosmic microwave static feels singular and inevitable. Risk-taking—lyric accumulation rather than linear plot—pays off because the pattern is taught early (“etched with alien script…hummed”) and recharged at the end. Transformation test fails: rename coins or telescope and the whole mythic engine collapses. No close echoes of famous scenes; the amber-orrery receiver is a fresh conflation of astrolabe and radio.
