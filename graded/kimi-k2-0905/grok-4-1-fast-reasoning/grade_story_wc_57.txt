<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “infinite patience” is stated more than dramatized; the only micro-choice—offering to help with the rope—comes late and costs him nothing. Kael’s shift from gruff to cooperative is asserted, not forced by visible status moves. Interiority drifts into abstract paraphrase (“philosophy unfurling like kelp”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final pact to teach the boy lands as gift, not sacrifice, so the closure lacks felt personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decoded rope becomes a living archive and Elias’s mandate to teach is the irrevocable new burden. Causality holds: fulgurite → reveal → pact, each step because/therefore. Orientation is swift and fog serves the final image. Cost is conceptual (custodianship) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Golden dock, snow, fog, and fulgurite glass are filtered through Elias’s collector gaze; each tactile detail doubles as survival tool or lens. The rope’s weave is micro-setting that literally rewrites options. Weather muffles sound and sharpens focus, mirroring the hush of secrecy. Spatial choreography stays clean across crouch, rise, coiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods—tightens once: the rope’s cipher must be decoded before modernity erases it. Agency sits with Elias; the fulgurite is not coincidence but his deliberate instrument. No new opposition surfaces after the knot yields, so escalation plateaus rather than compounds. Cost is custodial, not immediate, keeping pressure short of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the parallel of seeds and knots as living archives; no character sermonizes the moral. Final image of the dock “sighing” under fresh snow reweights earlier golden glow into quiet responsibility. Ambiguity lingers: will oral transmission survive any better than rope? Subtext resides in Kael’s raw knuckles and Elias’s uncalloused thumb—both marked by contact with the past.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Elias’s collector perception; diction of “salt-crusted pods,” “barnacled pilings” is specific and unliterary. Rhythm lengthens during decoding, then shortens at the pact, mirroring patience crystallizing into duty. Kael’s dialect (“won’t yield its grip”) is restrained, distinct without caricature. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is strong, but occasional poetic pile-up (“oceanic hush cradling their secret”) slightly overdresses the final beat. No paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent—lightning glass as revelation, kelp as philosophy. A single scaffold phrase—“infinitely patient” repeated four times—edges toward mantra; trimming one instance would sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Knot-encoded lore is fresh, yet rope-as-archive has Celtic antecedents; the fulgurite decoder is the genuine twist. Synthesis of seed-saving and maritime script feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric stillness over action—but coherence rewards the gamble. Could push further by letting the rope resist decoding, forcing Elias to sacrifice a treasured seed to loosen one final hitch.</comment>
