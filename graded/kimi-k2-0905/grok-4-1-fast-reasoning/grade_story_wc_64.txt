<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s blithe temperament is consistently shown through humming and tender gestures, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the final “contented sigh” feels unearned because no micro-choice visibly costs him anything. The tapestry decoding is presented as foregone success, so agency under pressure is muted. Still, the gardener’s perceptual filter is vivid and occupation-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the noblewoman’s plea reframes the cemetery’s whispers, giving the echoes social cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each teased thread tightens the pattern—yet the beat-to-beat linkage is more associative than consequential. Orientation is clear within 120 words; only one reflective block (sovereign case back-story) exceeds 20 % but is anchored and tilts present goal, so BRR waiver applies.</comment>

<comment>Velveteen gloom, cobalt silo, and star-slit dust motes are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s gardener eye. The silo’s cramped vertical space forces him to crate-props the tapestry, so micro-setting constrains the decoding action. No spatial drift; weather is night-cold but registers only as shimmer on paint—economy upheld.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode intentions or remain haunted—signals early. One meaningful tightening: poisoned-wine revelation reweights the “game” from abstract ritual to mortal stakes. Cost is conceptual (fabricated crime) rather than felt by Elias, so pressure peaks intellectually, not viscerally. Agency remains intellectual decoding; no tactical forfeiture narrows his options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: history is a palimpsest of exploited voices, exoneration possible only through attentive labor. Subtext resides in the echo-harmony falling silent—an earned image rather than stated moral. Final reconfiguration carries social cost (noblewoman’s name restored), but emotional aftereffect is distanced by Elias’s blithe filter, muting resonance a notch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s gardener perception; diction of “petals,” “thorny vines,” and “silo slits” is occupational and rhythmic. Velveteen gloom motif recurs with slight modulation, pattern taught early and paid off in final silence. No dialogue, so no voice-drift; free indirect syntax remains consistent, compressing under starlit hush without fragmenting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; most sentences dual-load atmosphere and plot advance. Occasional purple clusters (“velveteen gloom” thrice) flirt with over-figuration but stay pattern-driven. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; metaphor vehicles (chess, tapestry, garden) stay internally coherent. Final line achieves chilling clarity without ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Melds cemetery-gardener noir with textile detective story—fresh synthesis. Chess-clock-as-timer and tapestry-as-archive feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Risk lies in lyric density, but coherence holds. Could edge higher with a sharper personal cost to Elias; still, concept and voice imprint memorably.</comment>
