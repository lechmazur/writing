<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession is palpable in embodied micro-choices—trembling bow, wet fingers coaxing the page—but the great-aunt’s suicide and “feverish dreams” are handed to us in summary, not dramatized contradiction. The final resolve to perform the aria is earned by the water-damage reveal, yet the interior cost feels slightly under-cooked: we see him clutch the score, not feel the forfeiture of his former life. Still, the hierarchy of values (legacy > safety) is legible and stakes scale to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rising flood swallows the program but Elias keeps the score, a crystallized before/after with undeniable conceptual cost (the opera house lost, his life re-routed). Causal chain holds: slashed lantern → wave → map revealed → grate pried → case found. One minor warp: the “unresolved glyph” that demands dryness is introduced late, so the lantern-slash feels 5% engineered rather than inevitable. Orientation is swift—who/where/when anchored by line 40—and the single-scene default is met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Flooded pit, bobbing lanterns, water-lapped proscenium—each detail is filtered through a violinist’s ear-eye hierarchy and actively guides choice (the prompter’s box below stage, the submerged grate). The lantern chains, muck underfoot, and sloshing acoustics constrain movement and supply the final tool (water as developer of images). Micro-setting (sodden program on a dry ledge) doubles as plot engine. One small float: spatial relation between pit, prompter box, and grate could be one sentence tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode Elara’s message—tightens once: water damage reveals the prompter-box clue, narrowing options from “search everywhere” to “go below.” The influx that cracks the foundation raises physical cost in lockstep with emotional stakes. No reversal after that; escalation is linear rather than recursive, sufficient for 700-word scope. Luck (lantern happens to be rusty) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of “in-between spaces” emerges through concrete images—ink bleeding between staves, the prompter’s box, the pause before the first chord—never named in abstract sermon. Final image of Elias tuning while the house dies behind him reweights the premise: art must inhabit the very ruptures it cannot save. Ambiguity lingers—will the aria resurrect or doom him?—without confusion. One soft echo: “lately inspired” is repeated rather than evolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual lens—sound of water slapping wood, visual glint on wet paper, kinesthetic tug of string against lantern. Syntax lengthens under tension then fractures into staccato clauses as flood escalates, mirroring bow pressure. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through filtered sensation and action; diction stays within a working musician’s lexicon. One tiny filter slip: “conceptual cost” in closing paragraph edges toward meta, but recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; every sentence advances either discovery or flood. Figurative language is spare and accurate—“lanterns bobbing like threats”—avoiding purple clutter. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; only micro-repeat is “lately inspired” refrain, acceptable as temporal marker. Strong paragraph cuts; each block advances beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Flooded opera-house-as-darkroom is fresh; using water damage as progressive decryption engine transforms a familiar ghost-quest into something tactile and specific. Elara-as-ink-ghost avoids cliché by remaining wordless, present only in ripples and gesture. Risk taken: no spoken lines, all meaning via image and act—coheres. Slight echo of “phantom haunting theater” trope, but grounded in material process.</comment>
