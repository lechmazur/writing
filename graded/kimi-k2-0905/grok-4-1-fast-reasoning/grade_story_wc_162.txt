<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s contradictory impulses—yearning to close the sacred gap yet fearing its collapse—are dramatized in her finger-tracing of grain and the final hesitation before crossing. The “featherly determined” trait is embodied, not labeled, in her light touch and decisive etching of code into the table. Interiority stays concrete, anchored in tactile discovery rather than abstract self-diagnosis. Only the father’s single-word greeting at the end feels slightly undercooked, preventing a 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each newly revealed pattern (grain, weather code, compass) tightens the same stake—how to honor necessary distance. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elowen steps across the threshold while the prism beams reconfigure the maze below, crystallizing the cost that “lose the light” warned of. Orientation is taught early via the “drifting prism terrace” and “fractured light,” anchoring who/where within 50 words. No causal break; every increment deepens the texture of sacred distance rather than advancing plot in linear fashion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The driftwood table’s grain functions as micro-setting: its whorls physically guide Elowen’s decoding, constrain her pacing, and finally receive her etched signature. Prism beams and corn maze below are sketched with selective sensory strokes that mirror the refraction theme. Spatial choreography is flawless—chair arm twist releases compass, terrace edge yields to aerial descent. Weather code symbols and 33.7° coordinate supply tactile verisimilitude without encyclopedic dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder by respecting distance—tightens each time a new code surface (grain, logbook, compass) shows the same spiral warning. The protagonist’s agency is the incremental decoding; each intuition forecloses simpler solutions (charge straight in, ignore the log). Cost is legible: she almost loses the light when twisting the chair, and the final crossing is shadowed by the log’s warning. One meaningful deepening suffices for 800-word frame; no multiple reversals required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: sanctity is not a place but a buffer created by chosen distance. The butterfly effect is never moralized; its fracturing simply reveals the architecture of awe. Final image of father and daughter inside the maze, terrace now a “prism ghost,” reweights earlier motifs—grain, code, flight—into quiet revelation. No late thesis sentence; resonance is felt in the hush that follows the beam’s realignment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed diction stays inside Elowen’s perceptual signature: “featherly,” “cornstalk labyrinths,” “veined like forgotten maps.” Syntax lengthens then fragments to mimic breath under pressure. No head-hopping; father’s single line is external. Non-standard punctuation (em-dashes, fragmented quotes) is pattern-taught and pays off in the final “fractured no more, yet ever hushed.” Voice modulation under intensity is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to staccato fragments; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective: “skies folded into infinite refractions” is the only extended metaphor, earned at high-stakes opening. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new texture or causal cue. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “light” images 60 words apart; otherwise propulsion is clean and closure image untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The butterfly-effect fracturing is inverted: instead of chaos, it births a sacred geometry of distance. Corn mazes as aviation flight plans, wooden grain as weather code, and drifting prisms as spiritual buffers feel inevitable yet unexampled. Risk—lyric density inside a hard-SF premise—pays off by making the final hush feel both cosmic and intimate. Synthesis is specific to this voice; swap any detail and the whole prism collapses.</comment>
