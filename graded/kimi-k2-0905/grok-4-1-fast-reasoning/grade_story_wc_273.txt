<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s “consciously wild” nature is shown through braiding feathers into his hair and choosing to crush the drone rather than analyze it; the contradiction between serene anger and feral instinct is embodied, not labeled. The final step into the ink is a micro-choice that costs him literal corporeal stability, sealing his arc. Mira remains a cipher; her motivations are asserted (“return and wield it”) rather than dramatized, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink rewrites reality, forcing Elowen to accept that his time-dilation is evolutionary, not mystical. Cost is legible in the prismatic fracture of his body and the vanished drone dust. Causal lens holds throughout—every ink appearance is a because/therefore trigger that narrows escape routes. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wind-carved tents and bone-like structures constrain movement paths and echo the theme of endurance sculpted by pressure. The disappearing ink’s ephemeral mandalas function as micro-setting, dictating spatial logic: step inside or remain outside. Final image of wind resuming its carve re-weights the earlier tent metaphor, proving environment charges closure. 9+ gate satisfied: the ink patterns directly shape the final tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why time slows—tightens when the ink offers a single escape route that demands bodily risk. Escalation is one-step: from question to lived answer inside the ink void. The price is the sensory fracture he carries back; visible cost is on-page (“prismatic shards”). Agency is high: he elects to step in, not merely observe.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wild perception as evolutionary survival rather than chosen mysticism. Subtext resides in the hummingbird drone—mechanical mimicry of nature paralleling Elowen’s albino visibility. The final wind-carved world “sharper in crisis’s wake” re-prices the premise without moralizing. No motif checklist; feathers and ink recur only because they gate survival, not symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elowen’s perceptual filter: “porcelain skin gleaming unnaturally” is his self-consciousness, not author description. Syntax compresses under stress—“seconds bloating into eternities”—mirroring time dilation. No head-hopping; Mira’s interior is unknowable, preserving distance. Diction remains within a tracker’s lexicon; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “viscous ink—disappearing ink, he recognized by its faint, ethereal sheen” delivers world rule, sensory texture, and character knowledge in one clause. No synonym loops; “wind-carved” returns only to re-weight the closure image. One near-mixed metaphor (“tents whispered of endurance”) but it is brief and does not touch the final beat. Rhythm accelerates into the ink fall, then breathes out with the resumed wind, matching emotional arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of time-dilation with disappearing ink feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Evolutionary rationale for albino hyper-perception reframes a fantasy trope through biological specificity. Risk is taken—void traversal inside spilled ink—yet coherence is preserved. Minor deduction for recognizable “tracker with feathers” type, preventing 9.0.</comment>
