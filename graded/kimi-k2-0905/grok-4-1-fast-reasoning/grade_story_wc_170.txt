<comment>Elowen’s motive—mirrors must show hope after her lover’s despair—gives every beat direction, and the borrowed-heartbeat constraint forces visible micro-choices (kneeling, inhaling threads). Interiority stays concrete (“her chest blooming”) rather than abstract, and the endurance of annual theft earns a felt cost. Flaw: “perceptively calm” is repeated label, not embodied contradiction, keeping her just short of full contradictory life under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lullaby layer thickens density until the final bell toll reweights the city’s mirrors. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality of heartbeat-borrowing is shown through sensory choreography, not exposition. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elowen dissolves but the altered reflections remain—cost legible in “borrowed heartbeat echoing forever.” Minor slip: heartbeat mechanics are told once rather than demonstrated mid-transfer.</comment>

<comment>Prism parapet is not backdrop; its rain-slick crystals hum under touch, decide where she can paint, and refract the final image back onto city glass. Micro-setting (parapet edge) literally constrains her body position and brush strokes. Sensory hierarchy follows Elowen’s painterly eye—light, droplet, rainbow—integrated into action. Spring dusk is familiar season, but the terrace’s echo and rain-stone scent are particularized through her perception.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—annual renewal of existence—peaks when final lullaby threads the last heartbeat. Escalation is textural: each borrowed pulse visibly brightens her form and the mirrors’ resistance softens. One meaningful tightening: mirrors tremble, then yield, foreclosing return to rigid truth. Cost is felt in the children’s unwitting donation and her ephemeral survival; both are on-page.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: reflection should promise, not imprison. Subtext lives in the mirrors’ ripple—possibility replacing despair—never articulated by Elowen. Final image of “borrowed heartbeat echoing forever” reweights earlier lullaby theft with societal cost. Avoids moralizing; the city’s new visions are left ethically ambiguous.</comment>

<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at mirror-distance, matching Elowen’s elusive nature; diction stays within painterly lexicon (prismatic, refracting, mirage). Rhythm swells with lullaby cadences, then fractures into shorter glints as mirrors yield. No head-hopping; perception remains strictly Elowen-filtered. Voice modulation under stress is subtle—breathless clause stacks during inhalation of heartbeats, then calm declaratives after sync.</comment>

<comment>Compressed lyrical mode teaches its pattern early (“petals unfurling like whispered secrets”) and sustains it without clutter. Mixed metaphors are controlled: terrace “echoing” and “hush” serve auditory motif. Few filter verbs; action is shown through tactile verbs (traced, dipped, poured). Occasional adjective stacks (“dusky harmony,” “prismatic hues”) risk purple, but stay purposeful to painterly hyper-saturation.</comment>

<comment>Fantastical premise—heartbeat-stealing mirage painter—feels inevitable because grounded in specific sensory mechanics and emotional need. Lullabies as code is fresh, yet logically tied to children’s purity. Mirrors showing latent possibility refracts everyday reflection anxiety into lyrical stakes. Risk in poetic structure pays off: dissolution ending becomes earned stasis rather than escape.</comment>
