<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s creed (“find the beginning in every ending”) is dramatized through micro-choices—pocketing tools, climbing the vibrating ladder, rerouting feeds—so motive stays embodied. The interior contradiction between salvage-optimism and the risk of literal collapse is kept present via the groaning cables, giving her a visible cost. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority stays concrete, though one or two phrases (“practical triumph surging”) edge toward label. Earned renunciation of old maps at climax is causally tied to prior beats, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s silence is repriced as intentional dormancy, and Elara’s cost—abandoning her own creed of finality—lands in the final image. Causal chain (perigee → overload → discard assumptions → new amplifier revealed) holds without gaps; no teleporting props. Orientation is clean by line 8; the one-line orientation debt waiver is not triggered. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity. Persistent constraint (cables could snap) shapes every tactical move, meeting the 9+ cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dish, catwalk, and moon-tugged gorge are not backdrop but tools: the feed horn accepts the Hollywood fragment, the cliff crystals become the new resonator. Spatial choreography is immaculate—boots on perforated steel, rungs vibrating under lunar gravity—so environment constrains each action. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s technician bias: she notices cable tension before mist color. Micro-setting (the shard of hush in the signal nexus) literally mutes noise and thereby enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elara turn cataclysm into reborn broadcast—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when cables begin to sing. One meaningful deepening: the realization that abandonment was “by design” collapses her binary of ruin/renewal, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visceral: if she mis-tunes, the city plunges; after success she still loses her prior worldview. Agency drives every turn; coincidence merely complicates (moon arrives on schedule). Meets 9+ quick test: escalation under protagonist control with on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of her creed: only by discarding the need for “beginnings” does she birth one. The Hollywood star (fallen glamour) and shard of hush (perfect quiet) reweight from junk to instrument, enacting the theme without statement. Final image—fresh static as “symphony of tomorrows”—offers a non-literal answer that reconfigures prior silence. One near-slip: “practical magic, tuned true” flirts with thematic echo, but the line is salvaged by its placement inside Elara’s technician idiom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices “cables groan city-wide” before moonlight aesthetics. Diction is hers—jittery waves, feed horn, power feeds—never authorial tour-guide. Rhythm accelerates with syntactic fragmentation under cable stress (“Static hushed to velvet; now the real work.”) yet never loses clarity. No dialogue on page, so dialogue bullets N/A; voice distinction and distance control remain airtight, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “perigee’s pull making each rung vibrate as if the moon gripped the metal” fuses sensory cause and stakes. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each clause advances tool, body, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—no mixed metaphors. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she noticed”) mid-scene is acceptable under lens; no artifacts touch the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long suspension to staccato at climax, propelling momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of fallen movie-star metal + comet-core silence as functional RF filters is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Abandoned antenna city repurposed as a lunar-tuned loudspeaker flips post-apocalypse trope into genesis without gimmickry. Risk—using Hollywood kitsch—pays off because the object’s etched “Walk of Fame” script is later neutralized by void-veined hush, creating conceptual repricing. Transformation test fails if swapped: only this exact star-and-hush pairing can enact the theme of salvaging glamour into signal clarity.</comment>
