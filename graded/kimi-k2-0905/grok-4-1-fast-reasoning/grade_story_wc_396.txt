<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thorne’s interiority is vivid—shadows “coiling from her sleeves” marries body to magic—but the dryad and wraith remain archetypes; their loneliness/withers are told via mirror glimpses rather than embodied choice, so the relational crucible never scalds. Her calm-intuitive trait is shown pacing the parley, yet the decisive act of reknitting the orb feels preordained by lyric premise, not hard-won under rising flaw. Cost is present—she pockets a now-laden orb—but the price is metaphysical, not personal, keeping the arc just shy of higher-stakes embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orb’s shared-light map visibly reweights both factions’ options with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—because she unearths the fragment, therefore she can weave empathic light—mirrors teach pattern early and pay off in the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint (the orb’s glow as living treaty) shapes the closing image, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse, orchard, floes, and vintage mirrors are never backdrop: the beacon’s pulse times Thorne’s breath, the table-scarred oak hosts the fragment, mirrored panes literally refract hidden pains into policy. Cold-light ecology constrains the peace terms—shared beacon pulses or mutual death—charging the final hologram. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and glint over cataloguing, achieving economy. Micro-setting (the fragment’s orbital shards) becomes the decisive tool, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—annihilation of orchard vs. floes—signaled in first paragraph and tightened into one meaningful turn: the orb’s reconstitution that forecloses war. Escalation is lyric-accumulative under Hybrid lens: each mirror glimpse thickens mutual isolation until shadow-empathy becomes the only narrowing option. Visible price is legible—wraith’s bow and dryad’s unfurling leaves carry surrender of absolute claim. Agency is Thorne’s mapping, not external coincidence, satisfying causal test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as reparable light—emerges through orb and beacon imagery rather than statement, though “map empathy onto action” flirts with thematic echo (−0.4). Final holographic map reweights “stolen light” into shared pulse, offering ambiguous stewardship, not moral. Subtext in mirror glimpses (loneliness/ancestral wither) is strong; absence of overt moralizing recoups score. Complexity survives: anomaly remains outsider, peace is treaty not transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient maintains stable distance, filtering perceptions through Thorne’s shadow-sensed lexicon (“smoke given form,” “shadows lacing”). Lyric compression is taught early (“lighthouse rays tangled with encroaching darkness”) and paid off in rhythmic pulse-lines matching beacon sweeps. No head-hopping; dryad and wraith voices surface only via Thorne-interpreted glimpses, keeping focalization clean. Some elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “holographic map”) momentarily lifts above noir-poetic register but remains consistent enough to avoid register drift penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences of orchard description to staccato parley exchanges, propelling without template cadence. Information density high: single sentence often layers sensory cue, world rule, and micro-action. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors in climax; “orbiting shards” logically extends knitting-light conceit. Minor paraphrase loop on “empathy onto action” phrase twice in closing beats (−0.2), preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise syntheses—lighthouse-orchard on ice, empathy-crystal, mirror-truth refracted peace—feel inevitable yet fresh, resisting stock fantasy templates. Transformation test passes: remove beacon-orchard ecology and the entire conflict collapses. Risk in lyric accumulation mode heightens coherence without gimmickry. Specificity of “frost-kissed fruit” and “salt-rot” air gives idiosyncratic texture, not ornament. Slight deduction for near-allegorical wraith/dryad pairing, but world logic redeems.</comment>
