<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—logical calculus versus raw ache—are dramatized in the sprint-to-tower beat; the key’s pulse against his palm anchors embodied emotion. The final calibration micro-choice visibly hierarchizes values: lover’s memory > personal survival. Cost is felt: trembling fingers, tear-tracked cheeks. Flaw: “logically emotional” is abstract self-label twice, not embodied; slight therapy-speak tinge keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because key hum → wraiths come; because console activated → marina resonance reconfigures ice and wraiths. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the largest wraith blooms into luminous petals—absolution priced as irreversible dispersal, not victory. Persistent constraint: key now thrums heartbeat-like, future guardian burden legible. Orientation and causality clean; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not postcard; it cracks underfoot, shifts choreography, dictates sprint path. Crystalline resonator functions as micro-setting that must be tuned, constraining dial choices. Final image—cathedral of frozen light—recharges earlier “fleshly glow” with transformed meaning. Gate met: environment shapes tactics and charges closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect key—tightens when wraiths emerge; option to flee is foreclosed by sprint to tower. Escalation: ice cracks sonically, light fades, wraiths mass; each beat raises physical & spectral cost. Visible price: tear-tracked cheeks, body thrumming with residue—tactics altered by exhaustion. Agency: tuning choice is proactive adaptation, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—absolution through resonance—emerges from action, not statement; final luminous petals reweight earlier “fleshly glow” without moralizing. Subtext in key’s heartbeat: love and burden inseparable. No thematic echo line. Slight risk of abstraction in “sonic absolution” phrase, but image of wraiths solidifying to mist keeps it concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: Elias notices ice like “awakening leviathans,” light in “shimmering veins”—professional engineer’s sensory hierarchy. Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during sprint, breathes in final sentence. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bound. Filter verbs minimal; “tasted of salt and spectral desire” shows controlled elevation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High density: “floe groaned like awakening leviathans” does triple weather/ice/foreboding work. No scaffold loops; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—fleshly/golden/resonant thread unbroken. One mixed risk: “orgasmic clarity” edges purple but pays off via bodily cost, so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse engineer + sonic absolution + vibrational match turns familiar gothic key trope into spectral tuning fork. Drift-ice marina as resonant stage is non-obvious. Risk of “wraiths” cliché offset by quantified tuning mechanics and flesh-to-ether rift mending. Transformation test fails if relocated—specificity of ice acoustics is integral.</comment>
