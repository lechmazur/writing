<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lirien’s contradictory impulses—rational alchemist vs. longing friend—are dramatized in the whisper beat, but the inner split is told more than shown earlier; Thorne’s pressure is present yet his interiority is thin, so the relationship crucible glows but never scalds. The final shared endurance earns a credible stasis, yet the cost feels slightly abstract because both characters’ flaws stay verbalized, not bodily paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the glowing columella curl—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the spiral’s intensified glow is the visible cost. Causality is internal but coherent: Lirien’s return + whisper drives the alchemy, no outside cheats. Orientation is clean by line 10; the ember nexus and twilight are anchored immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus, twilight threshold, and columella curl micro-setting collectively constrain every beat—colors must be poured into the spiral, voices must drop to a whisper inside the nexus tunnel—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors heat, spiral geometry, and hush, all filtered through Lirien’s empirical-poetic gaze; no static tour, every descriptor feeds the alchemy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—density of presence—signals early and tightens through color pour → whisper → spiral ignition; each step forecloses retreat. The meaningful deepening is the relational gravity infused by the shared secret; options narrow to “endure this new weight together.” Cost is legible in the curl’s star-heavy pearl and Thorne’s audible breath-catch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: presence becomes portable only when relational risk is paid. Subtext lives in the spiral’s appetite for colors and the whisper’s fractal time—no explicit thesis. The final image reweights earlier solitude without moralizing, though the whispered insight flirts with thematic echo, held just beneath sermon level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distilled-chemical diction (“solar spectrum precision,” “logarithmic grace”) and syntax mimic spiral compression; rhythmic control tightens into the whisper beat’s fragments. Perceptual signature is unmistakably Lirien’s—every sense measurement carries romantic intuition. No head-hop; POV remains anchored to Lirien, Thorne observed only externally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>High information density—most sentences couple sensory data to emotional valence. Occasional modifier stacks (“honeyed amber,” “silken directive”) flirt with overwriting but stay pattern-true to alchemical voice. No loops or paraphrase beats; metaphor logic stays consistent. Closure line is clean, propulsive, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy + astrophysics + conchology compressed into a love test. Spiral shell as time-dial, pocket-sun as Bunsen burner—tools feel native, not gimmick. Risk is high—lyric density could have collapsed—but coherence holds, yielding an inevitable yet non-obvious ending.</comment>
