<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—poet vs. tactician—shows in micro-choices like humming code through her rebreather; the “dice across his palm” reprise proves her renunciation of solitary genius is earned, with visible cost in the rising hull groans. Flaw balance holds: competence never eclipses cold-seep vulnerability. Only the AI’s ghost-recognition feels slightly convenient, nudging the cap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every vault progress is because/therefore tied to dice rolls → dance → AI re-activation, culminating in cryo-pod liberation. The final “rise, encrypt your scars” reweights the premise—vulnerability itself becomes the cipher—charging closure with conceptual cost. No orientation drift; sunken anchors land by line 5. Persistent constraint: the lab’s groaning hull forecloses lingering, tightening the ascent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Phosphorescent algae and silt-clouded distances are filtered through Elara’s coder-poet bias; the vault’s hum is tactile, not tourist décor. The dice-slate strapped to her thigh functions as micro-setting that literally gates data access. Final ascent carries the weight of watery graves, recharging “mysterious familiarity” with earned dread. Missing 9-band only because the hull’s structural threat is named, not exploited to constrain final舞步.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate archive & colleagues—tightens once: dice failure would drown both data and people. Agency is continuous: each pirouette narrows AI options until revival sequence is the only path left. Cost is visible: pods warming drain suit power, hull groans escalate. Would breach 8.8 if a single dice mis-roll had forced a trade-off between data and lives on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis-statement: encryption of fragility into collective strength is shown through dance-unlock and shared ascent. Hangman dice reprise converts lethal game into communal code, a resonant reconfiguration. Final image—dice pocketed, “web of rebellion”—invites reflection on invisible networks without moralizing. Only the faintest echo of prompt language (“encrypt vulnerability as strength”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression teaches its pattern early—“spins its web” / “lyrical code breaker”—and sustains aquatic rhythm: “bubbles trailed… phosphorescent algae… weightless ballets.” Syntax mirrors pressure: long fluid clauses under water, staccato dice rolls on slate. No head-hopping; AI voice is external, filtered through comms. Filter-verb stacks absent; diction stays within POV’s poet-engineer lexicon. Achieves 9-band clarity and texture, minus 0.1 for one stray adverb “faintly.”</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, paragraph breaths synced with dance beats. Information density high—“each pirouette encoded a journal revelation” advances plot + character + metaphor in one line. Figurative language is patterned (web, dice, kraken) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops. Minor prop-tracking glitch: dice start on thigh-slate, later “rolled across his palm” without transfer shown—0.2 deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hangman dice + underwater ballet + AI dance-interface is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors freshness: dice etched with letters, watertight alloy journal, hydro-holoprojector. Risk—dance as code input—could have read gimmicky, but prior calibration with AI makes it credible. Deduct 0.3 because cryo-pod twist, while effective, is a familiar salvation trope without further spin.</comment>
