<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-rooted quest is vivid, but “shielded openness” is asserted more than embodied; the single on-page decision—pressing the keystone—aligns with his curiosity yet feels lightly foreshadowed, so the cost reads as gentle rather than irrevocable. Interior contradiction is present but compressed into summary, muting the beat where vulnerability might have crystallized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reframed map and exhumed letter reweight silence from absence to empathetic medium; the keystone press is the visible act that pays the entry fee. Causal chain holds—tear → footage comparison → fissure → descent—though the off-stage email is a soft hinge rather than a tightening turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault, wind-lashed henge, and mossy chapel steps are filtered through Elias’s conservator gaze, guiding each discovery; the northeast-shadow discrepancy smartly compresses decades into one tactile detail. Still, the chapel interior receives only a cinematic once-over, keeping the final image from charging the physical space with irrevocable cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode silence without succumbing to its madness—escalates via each new fissure (map, soil, keystone), narrowing Elias’s options toward descent. The price is knowledge rather than bodily risk; because the psychological toll is implied而非 dramatized on-page, the tightening is legible but not viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as compassionate vessel emerges through the exhumed priests’ letters and the final reframed map, avoiding explicit thesis. The echo between outer rain-scoured frescoes and inner chapel walls quietly reweights heritage as dialogue across muteness, leaving resonant ambiguity about who is finally heard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style sustains a hushed, antiquarian cadence consistent with Elias’s vocation; diction stays within connoisseur-register without drifting into catalogue-speak. Occasional adjective stacks (“petrified guardians,” “sacred voids”) flirt with purple but compress mood efficiently at beats where momentum is already slow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Syntax modulates from long atmospheric openers to staccato descent clauses, mirroring the literal drop into chapel darkness. Only minor scaffold (“methodically curious” twice in close proximity) and no mixed metaphors obscure causality; the closing sentence lands clean, letting rain murmur rather than commentary speak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The whispered-chapel-inside-henge conceit feels freshly unearthed rather than genre-stock, and the drone-footage comparison method supplies a modern, non-intrusive detective beat. While “lost chapel” tropes hover, they are reanimated through map-repair specifics and the reversal that silence shelters rather than erases.</comment>
