<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“heart pounding in cautious abandon,” treating horror “as a riddle”—but the emotional arc is smoothed by abstract self-labeling (“chivalrous,” “sacredly playful”) rather than embodied contradiction. The decisive swap is motivated, yet the cost (a few frost snaps and gratitude) feels light for cosmic stakes; no path is foreclosed. Flaw: diagnostic label-speak peaks at “guilt had felled the old guardian,” flattening a beat that should hurt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: wrong sky → theft → swap → mend. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the Arbiter’s sovereignty is quietly usurped by a thief who pockets noon. Sundial’s early anchoring and chess-piece foreshadowing pay off; slight Orientation wobble in first 120 words (who/where taught only by image) but disorientation serves the lyric tilt at closure, so waiver applies.</comment>

<comment>Icebound spire is more than postcard: frost “whispered warnings,” bioluminescent veins “pulse,” enchanted frost snaps like veins—details constrain stealth tempo. Micro-setting objects (sundial, chess pieces) are handled tactilely and return in the final image. Weather evolution mirrors plot reversal; spatial choreography remains crisp during swap scramble.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—heal the sky—tightens when corrupted queen writhes and alarms stir; option space narrows to smash-or-fail. Cost is present but light: a psychic vision and a shattered queen; no lasting personal price is dramatized. Agency remains thief-driven; coincidence eschewed. Sufficient tightening for length, yet lacks a visceral trade-off to reach high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—wonder as ethical praxis—emerges through playful theft that restores cosmic balance, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in the sundial’s “honest noon” versus warped sky, reweighted when thief pockets noon again. Final image of “sky righted, heart unbound” offers Charged Poise without sermon. Could deepen if personal cost were felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric, elevated diction stays consistent to wonder-apprentice persona; perceptual signature strong—“vault bruised purple,” “void-secrets” filtered through thief’s awe. Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadence for climb, staccato for swap. No dialogue, so voice carries all; filter verbs minimal. Experimental compression (“cautious abandon”) is taught early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Figurative density occasionally overwrought—“frozen fang,” “brittle veins” twice—yet never muddles causality. Two metaphor clichés (“heart pounding,” “stars wheeling”) and a paraphrase loop (“sacredly playful spirit… sacredly playful even now”) stall momentum. Closure image clean. Within tolerance for elite tier, but one more revision pass advised.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Freshens classic sky-heist by making theft an act of piety; chessboard-as-cosmic-circuit and sundial-as-moral-compass are specific syntheses, not stock. Apprentice-thief who embraces wonder as vocation feels individuated. Risk: lyric cosmic fantasy leans on familiar purple-sky trope, but inversion via playful reverence lifts it above template.</comment>
