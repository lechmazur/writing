<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—rational skeptic vs. hunger for myth—stays active in-scene and powers the salvage choice. Embodied emotion (“pulse quickened,” “cool ooze”) is specific, not labeled. Final renunciation of chase is earned via the sundial inscription that reweights motive; cost is quiet but legible. Motivation remains character-bound; no knowledge leaks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sundial anomaly → salvage → twin inscription → renunciation. Orientation locked by word 60; no debt. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: “Time reveals the frame; lies collapse at dusk” reweights premise with undeniable cost—he abandons the quest. Persistent constraint: twin sundials in pocket literalize the reframed mission. No causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Twilight canal, half-sunk hull, and pocket sundials are rendered through Elias’s trader-trained attention; every sensory note is filtered by POV priority. Micro-setting (sundial face, mud suction) constrains the salvage action and charges the final inscription image. Selective detail—no tourist catalog—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography clean; props track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode myth vs. risk of being misled—tightens once the twin sundial surfaces; option to keep chasing is foreclosed by inscription. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence. Cost is conceptual but legible: abandoning lifelong quest. Felt price could be sharper; inscription acts more as idea than visceral loss, capping score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—lies are time-bound constructs—emerges through concrete salvage rather than lecture; inscription is the only overt thematic line and it lands as reweighting, not sermon. Ambiguity allowed: Elias may still be deluded, keeping complexity. No tidy moral. Aftertaste is contemplative, not sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature—“ripple-reading,” “architecture of lies.” Rhythmic control mirrors twilight calm vs. internal upheaval: long cadences drift, then snap short at inscription. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded. Filter verbs (“he sensed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“mist clung… unspoken regrets”). Mixed metaphors absent; vehicles stay consistent (time/sundial/light). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Occasional elevated diction (“serene upheaval”) is earned by pattern, not register drift. Closure line pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Myth-hunter who learns myths are empty is familiar, but canal-twilight salvage of anti-treasure maps gives local freshness. Sundial-as-twin, bent gnomon as “liar’s hand” is specific inflection. Risk taken: quiet conceptual ending instead of chest-thumping reversal. Could edge higher if submerged maps had exploded into reader view, not just parchments.</comment>
