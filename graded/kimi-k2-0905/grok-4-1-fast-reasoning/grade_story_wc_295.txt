<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Thorne’s interiority is textured—his dream-entry ritual, tactile journal, and star-dust glyph tracing show embodied emotion.  Lyra’s exhaustion is filtered through his watchful sympathy, creating a credible marital crucible.  The final “shared alignment” moment crystallizes a micro-choice hierarchy: her tears vs. his risk of dream-burnout, cost visible.  Minor slip: “midnight solace” becomes a repeated label; still, the contradiction between lucid control and bodily sweat keeps him credibly flawed.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the solstice prophecy reweights every prior star-pulse and inscription curve, felt cost in Lyra’s lifted tears and Thorne’s depleted gasp.  Causal chain holds: telegram → dream → seventh-pulse discovery → temple confirmation, each because/therefore link tightening options.  Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Ebon Peak cliffs”).  No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (dream-maps) and paid off in dawn image.  Could nudge 9.0 if the telegram’s flower had later physical consequence instead of symbolic echo alone.</comment>

<comment>Observatory stone walls, brass instruments, and cliffside temple form a micro-setting that constrains movement (single night, single climb).  Starlight/color choreography tracks cleanly: “roseate hues” gild tools only after dream-data arrives.  Dream-void is rendered through perceptual bias—variable stars as “erratic heartbeats”—anchored in Thorne’s professional filter.  Final image of glyphs glowing under first light recharges the setting with closure cost, meeting 9+ gate; slight shortfall because temple interior spatial layout remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode before light fails—signaled in telegram and reiterated by clock strike.  One meaningful tightening: seventh-pulse realization collapses infinite inscription permutations into a single solstice alignment, foreclosing further search.  Cost legible in Thorne’s “ethereal sweat” and Lyra’s tear tracks.  agency remains interior (dream witness) but directly changes physical next-step (temple ascent).  Could edge 8.8+ if a concrete resource (ink, stamina, telescope time) had been visibly forfeited to obtain the alignment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge is relational, not solitary; star-maps mean nothing until shared.  Subtext carried in silent telegram flower, not declared.  Final image reweights “solace” from isolation to mutual dawn without moralizing.  Avoids tidy binary—triumph contains exhaustion, decoded glyphs promise future eclipses, not eternal safety.  Near 9.0 but “midnight solace” refrain drifts toward conscious thematizing in last paragraphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, syntax lengthens under dream pressure then fractures at gasped awakening.  Perceptual signature sharp—Thorne notices star ratios, ink stains, petal creases; Lyra notices spiral curves.  No head-hopping; single POV holds.  Diction stays within lexicon of astronomer-poet without academic drift.  Rhythm modulates: long breathless dream sentence collapses into short spoken revelation, mirroring cognitive snap.  Meets 9+ quick test; hairline slip is occasional alliterative excess (“blanket of solace”) that reads self-conscious.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can stage, reveal star ratio, and foreshadow seventh pulse.  No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge.  Metaphors stay coherent (star-pulses as heartbeats, glyphs as stellar dust).  Filter verbs minimal except where voice-motivated.  Final paragraph contains one mixed metaphor—“midnight solace had birthed eternal dawn”—slight register lift; keeps score sub-8.5.  Otherwise clean mechanics, varied cadence, precise pronoun tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid-dream astronomy with epigraphic archaeology feels non-obvious; variable-star eclipse calendar as Rosetta stone is fresh.  Daylily telegram compresses urgency and intimacy into single object.  Risk taken: entire climax occurs inside dream, yet stakes remain physical (miss the solstice and prophecy evaporates).  Synthesis makes hindsight inevitability: of course the temple spirals match stellar cycles.  Minor template echo—“ancient pines sigh” is familiar nature shorthand—but overall transformation overrides it.</comment>
