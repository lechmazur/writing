<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thorne’s farmer-grief and Elara’s fatalism are sketched quickly and embodied in gesture (staggering, clutching the pearl). The final surrender is credibly motivated by her prior “curious blind spot,” so the cost is felt. Relationship pressure is thin—only one reactive beat of help—but the single POV default holds. Interiority avoids label-speak; tension between desire and dread stays physical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pearl → awaken forces → inhabit → transfer seed. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at “she opened herself” forecloses retreat with visible agony. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl pressed into Thorne’s palm reweights the stakes and carries the cave’s cost outward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cave is not backdrop; crystal angles dictate the choreography of shadow-invasion and constrain the only exit. Music’s cadence mirrors emotional crests, forcing Elara’s surrender on the down-beat. Sensory hierarchy favors sound over sight, matching POV bias. Pearl-as-micro-setting charges the final image; removing it collapses the transfer logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—is voiced early and tested by the cave’s offer. Escalation is one-step but decisive: the forces’ demand narrows Elara’s options to surrender or die; she pays with bodily agony. Thorne’s agency is passive, yet the final transfer keeps the cost legible. No coincidence resolves; the cave’s rule simply finds a host.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: wonder extracted from barren earth, magic as communal yield rather than spectacle. Final image of pearl-as-seed literalizes the metaphor without commentary. Subtext in Elara’s blind spot reframes her prior visions as preparation for self-sacrifice, not control. Ambiguity lingers—will the “magnified” wonders bless or haunt the villages?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays latched to Thorne’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax swells with sonic verbs (“chime, cascade, hum”) that mirror cave music. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature favors aural over visual. Dialogue sparse but differentiated: Elara’s cadence is oracular, Thorne’s terse farm-bred gratitude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long clauses for approach, staccato for seizure. Figurative language is restrained to crystal and music domains, avoiding purple drift. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. Tense and pronoun reference remain clean; only minor scaffold in “steady/unpredictable” repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fusion of clairvoyant-blindness + musical geology feels fresh, yet pilgrim-seeks-hermit is familiar. Cave pearl as transferable seed reweights trope. Risk taken: surrender-as-happy-ending, but the cost keeps it from sentimentality. Could swap names without breaking arc, so not fully singular.</comment>
