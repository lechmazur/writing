<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grace as a dock worker is vividly embodied, but the sudden merfolk reveal feels unseeded—no prior embodied contradiction or micro-choice foreshadows it, so the final shift lands as a label rather than a earned transformation. Interiority is strong until the climax; the tears and whispered confession are performed, not lived, weakening the cost. Relationship crucible works: the scrimshaw forces a mutual softening that alters their status. The mer reveal is competence without prior struggle, capping the arc short of 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scrimshaw touch → truth → skiff detachment → mer reveal, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vanishing-island dive crystallizes freedom with undeniable cost—dock life foreclosed. Orientation clean by 60 words. The mer reveal is a late rule-add; no earlier hint of physiological constraint, so the Decisive Change is slightly unmoored. Cost is felt in the rope-crack and receding docks, but the body-change lacks prior price, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe is more than backdrop: salt-crusted crates, bioluminescent waves, barnacled hulls all constrain posture and tool use. Micro-setting is the scrimshaw itself—handled, warmed, used as knife—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s dock-trained eye; she notices rope fibers snap one by one, not tourist vistas. Environment alters tactics: tide timing, skiff surge, whale-call resonance all force the detachment moment. Meets 9- gate: setting/tool constrains choice and charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom from human guise—signaled early via cage metaphors. One meaningful tightening: scrimshaw confessions collapse their dock-bound option, foreclosing retreat. Price is visible: severed rope, shouts receding, clothes shed. Agency drives the turn: Elara saws, Kai steadies, both row. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; mer reveal is new rule but does not resolve conflict, only manifests it. Cost legible; persistent constraint (cannot return to dock) implied but not dramatized on-page, holding below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—shedding false skin for oceanic self—emerges through concrete recurrent shedding: clothes, dock, human speech. Final image of scales glinting reweights earlier “seal in boots” jab, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No explicit moral; resonance carried by image. Subtext operates in the whale’s call as invitation rather than exposition. Avoids echo; no character states the thesis aloud. Complexity acknowledged: they abandon comrades who remain caged. Slight softening: “true nature” is cliché phrasing, but buried mid-paragraph, not final.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices net tangles, whalebone warmth, Kai’s voice crack. Distinct idiom: “seal in boots,” “chained to these planks,” dock-worker diction. Rhythm compresses under pressure: “Cut deeper, love—fight for it!” mirrors pulse of sawing. No head-hopping; Kai’s interior accessed only through exterior cues and dialogue tone. Filter verbs minimal; sensory immediacy dominates. Voice convergence at kiss is brief and intentional, acceptable under rule. Meets 9- quick test: perceptual signature stable, no elision untaught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long rolling sentences for waves, staccato for rope snaps. Information dense—one sentence can carry scent, social stakes, and tool state. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge. Metaphors integrated: “swords sheathed in velvet” sustains combat-tenderness motif without mixed logic. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is editorial jargon, but occurs in commentary, not prose. Closing image clean, no artifact. Density high; only hairline slips keep sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar merfolk escape given fresh angle: violence-forbidden world forces emotional combat, making tenderness the only blade. Scrimshaw as truth-serum object is novel and functional, not ornamental. Synthesis feels inevitable: dock labor → rope-cutting → detachment literalizes emotional severance. Specificity throughout: salt-crusted fish crates, whalebone edge honed by pirate craft—details not reusable templates. Risk taken: late mer reveal could have capsized causality, but payoff is swift and image-rich. Minor deduction for echoing “siren’s summons” phrase.</comment>
