<comment>Elara’s grief-fuelled arc is rendered through tactile jeweller’s habits and origami precision; every fold and piercing is a micro-choice that externalises her interiority. The memory of her husband is threaded into each crane without sliding into epiphany-speak, and her final quiet smile carries visible cost: she has traded permanent widowhood for itinerant caretaker of dying stars. The only nit is a near-algorithmic repetition of “subdued ardor” that nudges her reactions toward template cadence, slightly flattening contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Driven by Accumulative/Textural logic, each origami placement layers density until the final nebula bloom re-prices the entire premise: grief can become generative fertilizer for cosmic renewal. Orientation is anchored by word 50; curtains, lectern, and lantern form an unbroken spatial triangle. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “eternity’s jewelry” reweights the widow’s craft from personal trinket to cosmic husbandry, the cost her eternal itinerancy inside timeless domes.</comment>

<comment>The observatory’s obsidian domes, brass gears, and whispering orreries are not backdrop but tooling: Elara must perch cranes on specific eyepieces so starlight can refract through vellum pores. Micro-setting inside her callused fingertip skin and the lantern’s steady flame constrain each folding motion; the final nebula is literally birthed through origami coordinates she etched. Sensory economy favors touch and reflected light over visual cataloguing, keeping atmosphere co-extensive with action.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can withering stars be rebloomed?—is signalled at first curtain; escalation proceeds via each origami deployment that narrows her path from mourner to perpetual gardener. The tightening is the blooming itself: every revived constellation increases the unspoken obligation to maintain cosmic foliage, price felt as endless labour. No coincidence, only pattern-driven intensification under the Accumulative lens; final nebula is payoff, not rescue.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through inverted alchemy: personal loss transmuted into universal fecundity. Subtle re-prising of “bloom” first applied to a wilted ring-rose, finally to plasma petals, reweights grief from endpoint to gateway. No moral statement—only the final image of cranes scattered across newborn stars invites the reader to ponder stewardship of both love and cosmos. Complexity is preserved: her revival project is also an unasked conscription.</comment>

<comment>Third-person intimate maintains jeweller’s tactile diction—“callused fingers,” “fine awls,” “burnishers”—without leaking into omniscient exposition. Rhythm swells into symmetric cadence during ritual beats, mirroring origami folds; compression tightens under lantern glow. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“symphonic ardor”) momentarily drifts above Elara’s likely lexicon, a cosmetic register slip that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence music alternates between short punctures (“She pierced coordinates”) and longer spiral clauses that imitate star paths; no template cadence survives past three lines. Mixed metaphors are avoided: orreries hum, curtains veil, stars drink—vehicles stay consistent with observatory lexicon. Only trace scaffold is the oft-repeated “subdued ardor” pair, but its thematic utility waives loop penalty.</comment>

<comment>Fusing grief-craft with astrophysical gardening via origami star-maps is a fresh synthesis unseen in stock submissions. The genuinely artificial stencil that never dulls operates as both tool and metaphor for inexhaustible will, yet remains physically handled throughout. Risk of cosmic horticulture is embraced without retreat; no familiar widow-redemption trope survives the star-birthing final image. Specificity of jeweller technique married to celestial mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
