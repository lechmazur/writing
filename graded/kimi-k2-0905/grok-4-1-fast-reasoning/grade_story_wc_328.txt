<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s bitterness-to-jest arc is dramatized in one continuous embodied sequence—tears freeze, palm embeds arrowhead, weightlessness hits—so the shift is legible. Yet the interior contradiction is stated (“my bitterness was the heaviest stone”) rather than shown in micro-choice before the phone call; the cosmic-joke motive stays thesis-level until the final whisper. Brother’s re-entrance is pure invitation, not crucible, so relationship pressure is felt only as wonder, not decision cost. Still, the physical mutation of grief into levity is individual and memorable, satisfying the 600-word bar for earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arrowhead→phone→confession→levitation chain is cleanly causal under a Causal lens; each object triggers the next beat. Closure is a Decisive Change: weight lost, underground garden left, bitterness transmuted; cost is the palm-embedded flint that literalizes “punchline etched in starlight.” Orientation is secure by line 20 (“frost-rimed earth… underground garden”). No persistent constraint reverberates post-ascent, keeping the cost gorgeous but momentary; that caps the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garden’s bioluminescent herbs, quartz-veined soil, and rime-crackling dome are filtered through a researcher's gaze—every noticed detail doubles as specimen or tool. The arrowhead’s warmth against cold and the phone’s bent-antenna question-mark give tactile micro-settings that charge the metamorphosis beat. Spatial choreography is flawless: half-buried phone under echofern, receiver lifted, voices spiraling while pots levitate in lazy spirals. Environment directly enables the levitation choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim hope from frostbitten void” via cosmic joke—is signaled early and narrowed to one tightening: hearing brother’s confession forces her whispered surrender of bitterness. The price is palpable—palm pierced, feet lifting, garden forever abandoned—so escalation lands under Causal lens. No secondary obstacle complicates; escalation is a single crescendo rather than a tightening sequence, holding the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete sequence: grief→stone→jest→flight, letting the image of levitating pots answer the thematic question without moralizing. “Gravity’s got a sense of humor” is spoken by character, not narrator, so it reads as punchline, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is the joke on her or on gravity itself? The refusal to moralize keeps resonance alive, though the cosmic register skirts self-importance once.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensory field; no head-hop. Diction is lush but botanically precise—“gravitas vine,” “ozone-tasting dew”—consistent with a cryptid researcher’s perceptual signature. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments as static swells, then relaxes into weightless cadence post-metamorphosis. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal idiom is sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often delivers sensory hit, world rule, and emotional tilt—“pots levitated in lazy spirals, herbs danced in midair ballets.” Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles). Minor template cadence in tripled -ing phrases (“floating… thawing… twisting”) but never in the closure beat. No loops or synonym churn; pronoun tracking clean. Read-aloud rhythm varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cordless-phone-confessional-as-ritual is a fresh mechanic for metamorphosis; the flint arrowhead warmed by primordial memory feels mythic yet specific. “Gravitationally playful” as literal plot device rather than decorative adjective is a risk that pays off visually. Synthesis of cryptid research, underground herbalism, and cosmic prank avoids familiar templates. Emotional specificity of sibling rejection keeps it from quirky-for-quirk’s-sake.</comment>
