<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven need to recycle betrayal into diplomacy powers every beat; the drawer-pull apology is embodied, costly, and alters her brother’s fate. Interiority stays concrete (“antique drawer pull…freed was her conscience”). Micro-choice hierarchy visible: relic first, brother second, self last. Voice never slips into label-speak; flaw remains active to final arm-clasp.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: forged pull → war → captive brother → parapet apology → synchronized release under lunar cue. Single scene, anchored by 40 words, no teleporting props; true pull’s reveal tightens stakes. Closure is Earned Stasis: relics swap, prisoners freed, but feud remains fragile—cost felt in her relinquished talisman of shame. One tightening beat suffices; no outline drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-scoured parapet and waning moon are not backdrop; wind dictates rope handling, mist veils intent, slick stone risks literal fall. Micro-setting (drawer pull in palm) constrains the apology ritual. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV priorities: lunar phase > tactile relic > brother’s wrists. Spatial choreography clean across four bodies and two artifacts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will apology avert renewed blood feud?—signaled in first 100 words. Tightening occurs when counterfeit pull is produced: apology must be physicalized or fail. Protagonist agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost legible: she permanently loses the relic that once defined her cunning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of recycled error emerges from action—relic swapped, not sermonized. Lunar cycle motif reweights at closure: wane literalizes diminishing hatred. Subtext in gesture: relinquishing the false key = relinquishing narrative control. No final-paragraph thesis; image of enemy clasping relic carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains mythic cadence without purple drift. Perceptual signature filters world through metallic relic, moonlight, rope texture. Dialogue sparse, idiomatic (“The moon aligns; we proceed”), distinct from narrative sweep. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under peak wind but stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract as moon nears quarter-mark, mirroring tension. Metaphors stay coherent (moonlight catches engravings; mist beads like unshed tears). No synonym loops or filler stacks. One paraphrase loop (“furrowed hush” repeated) mild enough to keep propulsion. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar clan-feud trope refreshed by relic-as-apology mechanic and lunar同步ritual. Drawer-pull MacGuffin turns symbolic diplomacy into tactile stakes. Risk taken: lyric diction bordering epic, but payoff justifies tone. Not radically novel yet specific enough to resist name-swap test.</comment>
