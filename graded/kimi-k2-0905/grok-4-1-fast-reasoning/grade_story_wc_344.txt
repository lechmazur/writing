<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s longing for his father’s lost rhythm is embodied in every micro-choice—selecting, fitting, uncapping—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction surfaces when nostalgia collides with the fear that the hall will merely mirror more loss. The final reassembly of the satchel shows a renunciation of pure replication and acceptance of improvisational repair; cost is the realization that no gear can resurrect the man, only the cadence. Closure choice is fully earned by the causal trail of tactile gear-work and mirrored memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern taught early via frost-rimed shelves and gear-clink echoes; density increases through prismatic light burst until mirrors soften to “gentle glow,” reweighting stakes from archive to living pulse. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias descends with clocks now carrying infinite reflections; cost is legible—he must live every tick knowing the source is mirrored, not original. Orientation and causality remain clean; no prop or knowledge teleports.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen library’s stratospheric cold actively numbs fingers, slows metal, and forces deliberate movements; the hall mirrors’ vertiginous infinity dictates a kneeling stance and narrowed visual field, directly shaping gear placement. Gears themselves act as micro-setting, their brass weight anchoring attention and limiting which pieces can be handled with gloved hands. Final image of “clocks carrying echo” is charged by the library’s prior frost and mirrored light, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single meaningful tightening: when the final pinion meshes, the hall’s light intensifies and mirror options collapse from infinite refraction to single repaired rhythm—live with the mirrored cadence or leave forever. Cost is visible—sweat freezes on skin, reflections confront him with irretrievable father loss. Protagonist agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific reciprocity: frozen stasis vs. living tick, mirrored illusion vs. repaired acceptance. The clocks’ final hum is the non-literal answer—resurrection is not of the man but of the imperfect beat, reweighting all prior driftwood nostalgia as workable timber rather than relic. No moral is stated; ambiguity remains over whether villagers truly feel the echo or only Elias does.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar-eclipse locksmith diction stays within plausible lexicon: “pinion,” “moonshadow,” “eclipsed bench.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—clauses shorten during gear insertion, then lengthen in mirror awe. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent celestial-mechanical hybrid. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level density high—“spectral motes,” “prismatic ghosts”—yet each image advances either frost optics or memory bleed. No synonym loops; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Mixed metaphors tightly controlled: mirrors amplify dawn, gears exhale vapor; logic holds. Final image “folded infinities” is precise, no clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen cloud-library + eclipse-locksmith + living mirror-clockwork yields a fresh synthesis; premise feels inevitable yet unencountered. Risk of lyric overload is embraced but paid off by coherent closure. Specific detail—“crystal cap etched with celestial gears”—prevents abstract drift. Transformation test: swap gears for coins or mirrors for paintings and the entire resonance collapses.</comment>
