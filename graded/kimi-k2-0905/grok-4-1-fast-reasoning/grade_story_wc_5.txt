<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lir’s interiority is concrete—heartbeat-counting, palm-on-frost, knuckles blanching—culminating in the Earned Stasis of kneeling inside the sealed star-map. The only drag is near-total isolation: no second character on stage to force status choices, so relationship crucible is absent by default, not error.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the dome of starlight hovers, Eira’s path reconfigured from “lost” to “ascending,” cost shown in frozen tears and trembling knees. Causal chain—plate → pattern → flash-paper ignition → dome—is airtight; no orientation debt; lens holds accumulative to the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subarctic orchard, brass plate, bone constellations, and the micro-setting of Lir’s own vasculature all constrain tactics—every placement is a heartbeat forced into spatial form. Final image recharges these particulars: the dome’s glow etches the plate, making setting itself the talisman.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn grief into navigable map—tightens once: the flash-paper ignition costs the entire scavenged pattern, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible (sweat freezing, palm numb) but not persistently punished afterward; still, agency drives every escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of “loss as direction” emerges wordlessly through the transformation of refuse into star-road; no moralizing, only the final image of Lir stepping onto the map. The reweighting is conceptual yet visceral—reader feels the orbit shift without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Lir’s sensorium: “veins bulging like roots seeking water” is character-particular, not generic. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under stress; diction remains within plausible alchemist lexicon. Minor over-decoration in “emerald loops” and “departing spirits” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for stillness, staccato fragments during ignition. Zero loops or scaffold; information density high (“lunar salts and auric distillates” does worldwork). One mixed metaphor (“apple cores formed nebulae”) but clarity intact; no artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Flash-paper alchemy + safekept starlight + heartbeat cartography is a synthesis not seen before; risk is high yet coherence maintained. Tropes of grief-ritual and star-map are transformed through refuse-to-constellation logic that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of brass plate etched by its own glow seals originality.</comment>
