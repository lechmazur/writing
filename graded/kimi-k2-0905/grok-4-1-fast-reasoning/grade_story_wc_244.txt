<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s jocular mask cracks in the final beats, showing embodied cost (“voice cracking like dry leaves”), but interiority leans on label-speak (“craved his own relief: the cure for loneliness”). Micro-choices (passing the rock, lingering at dawn) earn the shift from elusive to present, yet contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the community’s new rhythm is crystallized, Elias’s mask softens, and the rock’s conceptual cost is felt. Causal chain holds—rumor seed → arrival → reciprocity spiral—though the “improbable rumor” mechanics are off-page, slightly thinning motivation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (“stories change” dusk) and paid off in dawn reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ivy-choked station is vividly textured—“crumbling arches,” “ivy curtain”—and the rock’s starlit glint serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean through courteous queueing; environment nudges choices (lantern light enables rock reveal). Yet, world rules (how moon rock catalyzes bonds) remain poetic rather than materially constrained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—loneliness vs. reciprocity—tightens when each rock touch compels a story-for-story exchange, foreclosing solitary exit. Escalation is textured, not causal-heavy: density of shared stories increases until dawn’s “new rhythm” reweights options. Visible cost is the mutual vulnerability each teller pays; Elias’s own mask-drop caps the spiral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: reciprocity as antidote to isolation is enacted, not stated. Final quip derails any tidy moral, leaving resonance in the communal laugh. Subtext lives in gesture—scones exchanged for touch, hugs traded for verses—rewarding reflection on gift economies. Ambiguity lingers: moon rock is “just gravel,” yet magic feels real because social cost was paid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient distance stays consistent; lyrical compression (“rumors slithered through ivy”) teaches the pattern. Diction favors sensory nouns/verbs (“creaking bicycle,” “feral cats meowing secrets”) and rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences to short quips under lantern light. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice carries distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>High density—“baker mended boots, mechanic recited poetry” packs two jobs & beats. Occasional stacked modifiers (“desperately jocular, his quips a frantic shield”) flirt with purple but serve his panic. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Final line lands cleanly, recharging “derail” trope with new emotional freight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: disaster logistician + moon rock + polite anarchy + rumor lattice feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Reciprocity-as-cure avoids greeting-card uplift by embedding payment in every touch. Risk in omniscient lyric pays off through coherent closure. Could shave −0.3 if premise echoes cult-classic “shared talisman” tales, but specificity of ivy station and aid-worker burnout transforms the template.</comment>
