<comment>Elias’s reticence is credibly lived-in; every observed micro-choice (brushing the stone towers, pocketing the glass) reveals his hierarchy of values without a confessional interior monologue. The moment he pens his own note, the prior fifteen years of silence retroactively acquire cost—an earned shift. Harlan’s thinning frame and wet cough embody decline without diagnostic labels, keeping interiority concrete. Status dynamic is minimal yet legible: deliverer vs keeper, silence vs rasp, both men yielding a little at the end—enough to count as crucible.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s note folded into the rebuilt tower crystallizes the “bottled safety” idea and forecloses his former mute stance. Causality is accumulative rather than twist-driven; each stacked stone/note is a prior beat that charges the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when). The only softness is the off-stage “haunt”—never allowed to resolve the conflict, but it also never breaks the lens; pressure stays situational/accumulative.</comment>

<comment>Fog, salt whispers, and iron grating give tactile specificity; the lantern room itself functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and frames the stone code. Weather is not backdrop—black-out literally triggers the scene. Spatial choreography is clean: crates up spiral, stones on sill, bodies tracked downstairs at dawn. Fresnel lens, sea glass, and lantern crate recur as handled objects, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the anonymous letter chain/fragile safety survive the keeper’s death?”—is signaled once lamp dies. Escalation is textural: each unearthed note thickens meaning, narrowing Elias’s options to silence or participate. His decision to write and rebuild the tower is the single tightening that charges the ending; cost is the permanent vocal commitment he can’t retract. No reversals needed; density pattern suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Bottling safety” emerges via concrete images—glass, stacked stones, folded paper—never explained aloud. Final note’s metaphor of “stone that doesn’t fall” reweights earlier precarious towers into a emblem of endurance. Theme avoids moral: chain can continue or erode; Elias only guarantees protection, not permanence. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection on how anonymous care survives caretakers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Free-indirect diction (“luminescent ache”) is consistent with a quiet man who thinks in images. Sparse dialogue is idiomatically distinct: Harlan’s rasped “Pocket that” versus Elias’s single full sentence at climax. Syntax mirrors tide-breath rhythm—long sentence for storm approach, fragment for blackout—modulating with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors (“dying heartbeat,” “captured tear”) are sparse and specific; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one line can stage action, deepen atmosphere, and foreshadow glass motif. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, providing propulsion and cadence without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Anonymous message stones inside a haunted lighthouse” is fresh synthesis of maritime folklore and quiet literary fabulism. Stakes hinge on emotional preservation, not ghost-busting, sidestepping genre cliché. Specificity of stone-stacking code and sea-glass talisman prevents easy transplant to another setting. Risk is modest but coherent; innovation lies in micro-ritual rather than plot twist, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
