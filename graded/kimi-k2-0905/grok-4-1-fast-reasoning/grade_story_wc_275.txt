<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist convictions collide with her father’s legacy in two concrete beats: the dagger-draw-then-sheathe and the thorn-trip instead of stab. Interiority stays embodied (“hands sinking into sun-warmed soil”) without therapy-speak. The roses’ evolved pollen feels like a convenient late power; still, her renunciation of blood carries visible cost when the looters flee and the farm survives maimed but unbroken.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tower fall → breach → looters → pollen defense, each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (glass dome, desert, Jax gone). Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses violence, pays with perpetual vulnerability—roses now marked, dagger forever sheathed. Cost is legible in the final image of etched petals and Jax’s softened grimace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dome, roses, sand, and canvas scrap are tactile and bias-filtered: Elara notices thorn tremor before sound. The scrap’s grit mixed into soil later constrains the roses’ evolved response, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean during the breach fight. One minor slip: “sun-baked with purpose” edges toward overt symbolism but is saved by POV warmth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the farm’s quiet life—faces two escalations: physical breach then moral choice of steel vs. pollen. Protagonist agency drives both turns: she repurposes the scrap and cultivates the pollen trait. Cost is visible: dome wounded, roses forever altered, dagger permanently sheathed. Coincidence limited to prior tower debris; it complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Engraved quiet” emerges from concrete objects (scrap, pollen, etched petals) rather than slogans. Theme—continuity through peaceful cultivation—ripens when the roses themselves become pacifist warriors. Final image reweights the premise: peace costs mutation and eternal vigilance. No moralizing paragraph; Jax’s nod is subtext enough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception (“whispers of wind as unspoken secrets”) without purple drift. Syntax mirrors her calm: long breathy sentences until looters arrive, then clipped beats. “Sheathe” as one-word sentence at climax crystallizes stance. No head-hopping; Jax’s softness is shown externally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does setting, metaphor, and motive (“petals a serene inferno against the scorching sands”). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (blaze/roses/pollen as controlled fire). Final line “tranquil blaze enduring” earns its oxymoron via prior combustion imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic pacifist horticulture is fresh; the roses-as-ballast evolution feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: evolved pollen could read as deus ex planta, but setup via inculcating values offsets it. Deeper freshness lies in treating cultivation as martial art without strike. Could edge higher if societal implications beyond dome were hinted.</comment>
