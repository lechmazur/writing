<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elowen’s motivation is vivid—turning peril into prophecy—but interior contradiction is asserted (“restlessness gnawed”) rather than dramatized in split-second choice. The final leap-and-dub is earned, yet the cost (tattoo flare, slump) is stated more than felt. No second character on page, so relational crucible waived; micro-choices (sketching, lashing debris) align with motive and supply visible hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam glances off a dome of sound, leaving the orchard still afloat—cost is the prophet’s exhaustion and the perpetual promise “half-kept.” Causal chain holds: cloud pattern → sketch → fractal dub → harmonic deflection. Orientation is swift (blue hour, sea-orchard, Elowen named by line 3). One causal tightening suffices; no plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setting is micro-scaled to the floating orchard, xylophone-debris, and tattoos; each constrains action (rope strings, plank dome). Sensory triage under wave assault narrows to salt-slick touch and vibrating apples. Spatial choreography survives the slap-splinter sequence; no geography drift. The driftwood ring and whalebone mallet return in the final image, recharging the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the fragile orchard—faces concrete test with each wave and beam. Escalation is accumulative: each dub layer increases harmonic density until the final crescendo repels the beam. Agency is continuous (sketch, lash, strike); no coincidence resolves. Felt cost is legible in the slump and “promise half-kept,” though the price could bite deeper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: art can transmute destruction into navigable order. No moralizing; the final “promise half-kept” invites counter-readings of hubris versus stewardship. Motif of dubbing returns reweighted—storm now inside the music. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Elowen’s perceptual filter: salt-rimed tattoos, cloud-vortices as “ink spilled.” Syntax grows staccato under peak pressure (“mallet blurring in fractal frenzy”), then exhales. No head-hopping; diction remains within maritime-mystic lexicon. Distinct rhythmic signature sustains throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative chains (“sapphire shards,” “bruised sky”) accrete like the harmonic layers they describe. No template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor risk—“thunderous applause gone wrong”—but context keeps it legible. Final paragraph slows cadence to match spent pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard-as-instrument and storm-dubbing synthesis feel fresh, not checklist. Fractal music generated from flotsam is specific to this world; removal would collapse the plot. Risk-taking (lyric escalation, visible mandalas) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor proximity to “weather-mage” trope is transformed through acoustic mechanics.</comment>
