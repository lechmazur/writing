<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for authentic connection while clinging to rational control—drives every beat, but the memories that “alter” remain off-stage abstractions; we never see a single concrete before/after image, so the cost feels announced, not felt. The final “sinew’s echo” is a strong embodied token, yet the texture he sought is still told rather than lived in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: escalating pattern-weaving tightens the stake until the tapestry detonates, reconfiguring illusions into visceral bonds with undeniable cost (“arterial spray frozen in time”). Orientation is immediate; the gallery anchors who/where inside 40 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias stands newly textured, options rewritten, calm now laced with grit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The loom-sinew functions as micro-setting: its warmth and grit constrain every weaving choice and charge the final eruption. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices translucency, hum, muscle-heat—while optical murals act as living mirrors, rippling in sympathy. Selective detail keeps momentum; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—connection’s authentic texture—is signaled early and tightens as knots accrue visible side-effects: memories warp, illusions lean closer, pulse syncs. One meaningful deepening—the tapestry quivering before detonation—makes the cost legible and forecloses safe spectatorship. Agency stays internal but causal under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: illusion ➔ sinew, silk-soft ➔ resilient drag. No moralizing; the final fingertip trace reweights “rational enchantment” as tactile necessity. Subtext lives in gesture—touching the gritty strand—rather than abstract claim, leaving an after-effect of exposed nerves beneath beauty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is architect-cool yet fevered: clauses lengthen during weaving, fracture at detonation. Perceptual signature—measured steps, optical angles, muscle-warmth—never drifts. Non-standard grammar (“a architect's forge”) reads intentional, pattern-taught early; closure stays legible. Rhythm modulates with heat, no drumbeat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>High density: “sinew threading through air like veins seeking a heart” shows stacked metaphor yet stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “unsettling calm” repeats four times; each returns with new charge, so not loop. Closing finger-trace sentence is crisp, propulsive, earns final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses fever-dream architect + optical gallery + rational enchantment; fresh synthesis, not trope shuffle. Illusions that explode into arterial sinew feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulation over scene—pays off in textured closure, though memory warp remains abstract, limiting full 9-band.</comment>
