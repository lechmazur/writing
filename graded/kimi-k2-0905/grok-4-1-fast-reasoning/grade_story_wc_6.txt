<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—burn grafts, callused hands, the weight of the foreign coin against fresh bark—so her compassion reads as lived, not declared. Contradictory impulses (saving what her father tried to erase) stay active in-scene through the graft act itself. The final renunciation of paternal shadow is earned because the graft literally binds her scar to the land’s. Only minor slippage: “unyielding compassion” is once label-speak near the end, blunting full 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each return of black sand, kelp drift, and obsidian reweights the stake until the red-threaded coin clinches Charged Poise. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no disorientation serves closure, so test waived. Closure—new life grafted onto fire-scar—carries felt cost: her father’s coin now forever pins her own healed skin to the dune’s wound. One hairline slip: the phrase “to prove that scars can sing” is an abstract set-up never concretely tested, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian shards, volcanic grit, and kelp strands aren’t backdrop—they dictate drainage, graft tension, and the final image’s shine. The lagoon’s micro-setting (black water, glassy surface) constrains her kneeling posture and the precise angle of the cleft cut. Spatial choreography is flawless: sand pouch → rootstock selection → coin drill → binding loop; every prop state tracks. Environment literally charges the closing image as the foreign coin glints against fresh cambium—without it the poetic reweighting collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal land and self—tightens through tactile micro-choices: slicing her own scar-patterned rootstock, threading paternal coin, sprinkling sand that once fed her father’s flames. agency is continuous; coincidence absent. Cost is visible: the coin’s alien runes bind her to patricidal legacy forever. Missing a sharper external risk (storm, tide, witness) that could have forced a trade-off, so escalation stays internal, capping short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of black glass/sand motif—first her father’s weapon, now her healing grit—without overt thesis. Final image “scars…humming in the wind like a song” reweights prior kelp-drift peace into audible life, achieving CR. No moralizing, yet the thematic echo “to prove that scars can sing” is slightly overt; had it been dramatized as sound rather than asserted, would breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Lira’s fire-sharper perception: “senses attuned to the subtlest shift in wind or warmth.” Syntax lengthens and softens during kelp idyll, then compresses for the graft cut, mirroring respiration. No head-hop; coined foreignness stays object-bound. Voice avoids pyrotechnics yet accumulates a hush unique to post-fire lagoons—distinctive enough for 9-band but for one cliché cluster (“silenced screams”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with task: long aquatic clauses drift, then staccato verb bursts for drilling/binding. Information density high—one line can carry sand memory, paternal legacy, and drainage chemistry. No scaffolding loops; metaphors stay internally consistent (volcanic grit = pulverized midnight). Only micro-deduction: “unyielding compassion” is therapy-speak intrusion amid otherwise visceral diction, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wildfire-arson legacy healed via bonsai-style graft, using a shipwreck coin as living staple—specific, non-obvious, irreversible. Volcanic black sand repurposed from weapon to wound-bed is transformative rather than ornamental. Risk is real: quiet lyric ending trusts reader to hear unsung scar melody. Transformation test passed; swap coin for pebble or sand for soil and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
