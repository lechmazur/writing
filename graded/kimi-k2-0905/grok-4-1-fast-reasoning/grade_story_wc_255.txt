<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s tactile, color-blind aesthetic is concrete and consistent; his refusal to trade for sight is earned by prior beats that show him cheruring flaws. The micro-choice to blow a wavering, imperfect note on the reed tongue crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. Mira’s off-stage sleep limits her to a reactive role, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only lightly traced. Internal contradiction is present but compressed; still, the renunciation carries visible cost and satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: every beat is linked by because/therefore logic (need Mira awake → decode plants → fetch reed → climb → imperfect offer). The phoenix’s acceptance is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Elias’s “sight” remains absent, sealing the thematic bargain. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure image recharges earlier motifs of cracked glaze and shared imperfection, meeting cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glass-spire shards, quenching trough, and plant codes are filtered through Elias’s touch-centric POV, creating lived-in specificity. The courtyard’s asymmetrical blooms and warped curves constrain the bargaining tableau and echo the theme. Micro-setting (the reed tongue) charges the final exchange. Sensory economy is high; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mira’s awakening—tightens when the phoenix demands a sensory trade, forcing Elias to wager his dormant color-sight. Escalation is singular but meaningful: the reed tongue’s imperfect note narrows options and is paid for by perpetuated blindness. Cost is legible on-page (“content in his blindness”). Agency is protagonist-driven; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Beauty-in-imperfection emerges organically from Elias’s choices and the phoenix’s valuation of a cracked melody. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of touching a bubbled pane reweights earlier visual lack into shared tactile triumph. Subtext operates through plant codes and reed vibrations. Resists tidy moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Elias’s tactile, color-blind filter; perceptual signature is consistent (“fingers tracing warped curves”). Diction stays within plausible artisan register; no corporate drift. Rhythm modulates: short sentences under climbing pressure, longer lush cadences for dawn/dusk transitions. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal and natural.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and textures emotion (“twisted glass spires caught the reborn sun in fractured glints”). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent (molten heart, cracked glaze) and payoff-linked. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blind artist, plant floriography, and bartered-sense phoenix economy fused into an inevitable whole. Imperfect-music-as-currency twist feels both surprising and foreshadowed. Risk in renouncing color payoff heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity prevents trope recycling; transformation test passed.</comment>
