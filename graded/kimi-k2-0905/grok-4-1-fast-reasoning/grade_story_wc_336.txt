<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lirien’s gentle-sage profile is vivid, but his interior contradiction (creative hunger vs. pruning restraint) stays narrated rather than enacted; the single micro-choice—handing over the seed—feels pre-ordained, not wrestled. Elowen functions more as wonder-receptacle than crucible, so relationship pressure is nil. The earned cost is present yet diffuse: the “frayed thread” he snips is described, not felt. Voice texture is strong enough to lift the score above mid-band, but the absence of a visible, personal price keeps it under 7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the seed-tree erupts, color returns, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the valley’s palette. Causal chain is soft—essence-capture mechanics are asserted rather than tested—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each strand added thickens the stake until the final image crystallizes the cost of guardianship. Orientation is swift; no penalties. A firmer mid-scene obstacle or pruning miscue would have tightened causality and pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Waterfall spray, moss pulse, and orchard buds are filtered through Lirien’s cultivator gaze, each sensory note tethered to his next ritual move. The parapet’s slippery ledge and the seed’s warmth in Elowen’s palm constrain gesture and decision, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp across the single scene. A half-point shy of 8+ only because weather/environment never push back—no wind shear, no mist-blind misstep to test the weave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and escalates through each essence-capture beat; the final rainbow tree offers visible payoff. Pressure is accumulative: every strand tightens the possibility of failure, yet no live option is foreclosed; the ritual never falters or demands sacrifice beyond described effort. A credible price (fatigue, bleed, orchard wilt) would have driven the score into the 8-band. Still, the tightening pattern is coherent and sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: creativity as cultivation, wonder as perennial that must be pruned and grafted anew. The closing image of children under a rainbow-leafed tree reconfigures the opening “twilight fade” without moralizing. Subtext whispers in Lirien’s shears—tool of both cutting and creation—yet the idea never hijacks the scene. A sharper ironic echo (e.g., a pruned branch later needed) could have lifted it into the 9-band; as is, it resonates cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Lirien’s perceptual signature: vegetal metaphors, rhythmic snips of syntax, orchard lexicon. Compression (“radiant hush” repeated with shifting inflection) is taught early and paid off in the final hush that “enveloped all.” No head-hopping; Elowen’s interior is inferred through bodily cue, maintaining distance. The lyric cadence never buckles into monotony; controlled variation under stress keeps the score high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences multitask—sound, sense, and forward motion. Occasional modifier stacks (“insatiably creative” thrice) flirt with overgrowth but are pruned by immediate sensory pivot. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor stays coherent within horticultural logic. A single mixed vehicle—“thread of calm amid the cascade”—barely blurs clarity; otherwise line-level craft is secure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wonder-graft premise feels fresh, yet its fairy-tale arc (wise elder rescues child with magic seed) leans on familiar bones. Specificity of orchard craft and the “prune the air” move inject localized novelty, pushing the score above mid-band. Risk is moderate—lyric repetition, soft causality—but not bold enough to earn the bonus. A reversed power flow (Elowen’s despair fuels the weave at Lirien’s expense) would have elevated inevitability and originality.</comment>
