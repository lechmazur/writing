<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her breaths sync with the dying station, the compass rose pulses against her skin, and her ancestral oath is whispered at the leap—yet the ‘blessed pariah’ label is stated more than dramatized; we see crew scorn only by report, so the social crucible never quite bites. Still, every beat of the sketching ritual is a micro-choice that narrows her options and forecloses the station forever, so motivation coheres and the final renunciation carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal lattice is tight: shutdown → isolation → compass twitch → sketch → rift reveal → jump, each because/therefore pivot legible under 120 words. Closure is a decisive change—she abandons the station forever—with felt cost (loss of human orbit, eternal exile) and a resonant reconfiguration: the same sketch custom that began in nostalgia ends in alien soil, now a survival tool. The wormhole is foreshadowed by the compass’s impossibly ‘true north’ twitch, so no late-rule cheat; the lens stays causal to the last line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Temporal stretch is not mere backdrop—it warps Orion into ‘elongated smears’ and makes pencil trembles last miniature eternities, constraining how she can draw and thus how she discovers the rift. The compass rose functions as micro-setting: its golden petals glint against starlight at both ends, charging the final leap. Station geography stays coherent—window edge, micro-gravity hum, residual power surges—each detail filtered through Elara’s navigator-trained eye rather than tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—map or die in isolation—tightens when the compass twitch reframes the station from prison to gateway; one meaningful escalation suffices. Agency is continuous: she sketches, interprets, then leaps; the cost (eternal exile) is visible on the page at the jump. No external coincidence rescues her; the wormhole was always there, masked by the same field that trapped her, so revelation not luck drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: orientation as inheritance—‘true north’ is not a place but a family habit of turning confusion into charts. The final image reweights the sketchpad from nostalgic ritual to colonial deed, letting the reader feel the moral cost of exploration without dictation. Silence modulates from oppressive to harmonious, an echoed triumph that invites reflection on solitude as creative forge rather than curse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cosmic yet body-anchored: ‘temporally stretched trails’ and ‘gilded applique caught starlight’ compress relativity into sensory texture. Syntax lengthens under dilation—comma-rich cadence mimics time stretch—then snaps to staccato at the leap. No head-hopping; the camera stays inside Elara’s perception, her navigator diction filtering every star and vibration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: elongated sentences for dilation, fragment-like bursts at jump. Metaphors are coherent—compass as heartbeat, silence as companion—never mixed. No loops or synonym churn; each line either advances sketch, body, or stars. Only minor scaffold: ‘echoed silence’ is repeated as deliberate motif, pattern-taught and paid off, so exempt from penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: turns time-dilation trope into an origami map—stretch literally unfolds hidden topology. Family tradition of star-sketching as life-raft feels non-obvious and specific; remove it and the story collapses. The wormhole is not gadget but inherited destiny, making the fusion of heritage and physics inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
