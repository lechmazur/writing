<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s wound (Mira) is concrete, his micro-choice to crown the node with the pearl is legible, and the cost (relinquishing bunker-as-tomb) is felt. Interiority stays specific to his sensory bias (“mineral tang,” “flashlight’s infinite shards”) and avoids label-speak. The flaw: his “hardened heart” is stated more than dramatized in scene; we’re told the bunker walls symbolize isolation rather than shown a live moment where that wall almost blocked him. Still, the final renunciation is earned by the shell’s confessions and the pearl’s glow, fulfilling the motive with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pearl’s insertion dissolves physical and metaphysical walls, reweighting the bunker from tomb to nexus under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric but traceable—shell → confessions → pearl → crown → permeable seals—each beat accumulates density until the final cadence shift. Cost is unmistakable: Epsilon-7 can no longer serve as airtight refuge; inspector has traded certainty for connection. No orientation or lens ambiguity; pattern taught early by crystal “breathing” pays off in permeable facets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as both macro-setting and micro-tool: the master node socket is a literal apparatus Elias must decide to modify, constraining the climactic act. Sensory hierarchy is inspector-biased—flashlight angles, corrosion, mineral tang—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: footfalls echo, shell extracted, crown enacted; no floating geography. The “resonant hush” tone is sustained through selective auditory detail (distant sigh, faint scrape) and charges the final image of soft connection-thrum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he seal or open hearts—is signaled by line 4 and tightens when the override switch hovers. Pearl insertion is the decisive turn that forecloses bunker-as-bunker, price paid on-page (seals now permeable, refugees exposed to unknown connection). Pressure escalates via accumulative texture: each inscribed confession thickens the moral weight until the pearl ignites. No coincidence resolves; the seashell anomaly complicates but remains causally linked to builder grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particularized inversion: shelter becomes bridge, hardness becomes permeability. No final-paragraph moral—final image is the soft thrum of connection, not an articulated lesson. Subtext operates through object trajectory: shell absorbs abandoned hopes, pearl re-emits them as shared radiance, reconfiguring isolation ethic without statement. Complexity is preserved: opening the walls is risky, unquantified, yet morally necessitated by the confessed losses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature attuned to refracted light and mineral breath, never drifting into committee voice. Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, fragments under pearl-glow ignition, mirroring cardiac cadence. Diction—“labyrinthine glow,” “geologic crush”—stays within inspector’s sensory lexicon. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; interior texture remains singular and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose achieves high density: each sentence layers setting, metaphor, and emotional charge without scaffold. Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses for hush, staccato fragments for ignition—read-aloud ear test passes. Mixed metaphors avoided: crystal/heart permeability stays consistent. Minor tic: “hush” repeated seven times; while thematic, it edges toward template cadence but never obscures causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Fusion of bunkers + bioluminescent crystal + confessional seashell feels specific and non-obvious; trope of post-apocalypse inspector is rotated into intimacy mechanic. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulation instead of confrontational climax—pays off via pearl-light reweighting. Without the shell->pearl->node chain the emotional math collapses, satisfying transformation test. Slight proximity to “crystal cave” sf trope is offset by grief-etiology of shell.</comment>
