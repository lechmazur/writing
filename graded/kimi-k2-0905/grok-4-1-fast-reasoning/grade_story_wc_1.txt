<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Steadily adaptive” is dramatized in the kiln-dodge and frost-tracking beats; contradiction between survivor’s caution and aesthetic hunger is felt, not named. Final renunciation—melting the ledger into art—pays a clear opportunity cost (evidence lost). Interiority is concrete (“her breath a faint mist… fingers trembled”), never diagnostic. Minor slip: ledger’s earlier emotional weight summarized more than shown in one beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the melted ledger globe holds pauses as golden voids—conceptual cost legible without exposition. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: frost-filigree & ledger gaps tighten until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) fixed by line 3; no ambiguity at end. One transition (night → dawn) is legible; pattern holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frost maps, kiln scorch, starlight, and glass shards are tactile tools that constrain tactics; frost patterns literally guide her steps. Spatial choreography across ledge overlook remains coherent. Sensory hierarchy obeys glass-artist bias (heat, translucence, fracture lines). Final image recharges the canyon’s micro-climate as living canvas—qualifies for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find purpose in silence—tightens when frost gaps mirror ledger pauses, forcing a choice: expose smugglers or transmute evidence. Escalation is density-driven, not causal reversal; each frost-lattice amplifies threat and possibility simultaneously. Visible price: she forfeits legal leverage by melting the ledger. Slight slack: off-page smuggler raid survivors reduce direct pressure in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from material process—glass cools into new form, silence accrues meaning—never stated. “Pauses” as golden voids reprice silence from absence to generative space. No final moral; image carries conceptual cost. Minor echo: “drifting resonance” used thrice without fresh inflection last time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is glass-artist: light fractures, internal glow, heat-cool cycles shape every metaphor. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for starlit frost, staccato for shard strike. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Diction stays within artisan lexicon; “luminous resonance” becomes mantra, justified by craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often fuses sensory cue, interior tilt, and forward motion (“She shattered a luminous orb… light exploding in blinding resonance”). Metaphors are glass-maker specific, not stock. Two near-paraphrases (“quiet canyon… drifting echo”) two paragraphs apart → −0.2. Closure sentence clean, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Frost-cryptography as tracking method is fresh; ledger-pause as map key feels inevitable in hindsight. Canyon glass-installation guardian angle transforms eco-thriller into aesthetic myth without losing tension. Risk: lyric repetition could edge purple, but disciplined craft lexicon keeps it grounded. Not quite revelatory, but memorable.</comment>
