<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s oppressive fatigue and his craving for “eternal quiet” are viscerally embodied in every prism placement; his calloused finger on jagged glass is character-specific texture. The lens-riddle turns his stoic endurance into active, costly invention—he trades breath, flesh, and finally mortality for silence, so the final fusion with light feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic jargon; even “weariness” is shown via micro-choices—ignoring lung-fire, jamming shards into dry crevices that shouldn’t exist. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc is single-track rather than psychologically torn, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: Elias becomes the beacon that both “warns and welcomes,” re-weighting the lighthouse’s original duty into an after-life sentence he must eternally serve. Causality holds—each impossible pocket he exploits is pre-seeded by ancient wards, and every shard placement tightens the lattice until silence is purchased with his body. The cost is incontrovertible: “his body pulled into the lens’s glow” is the final beat; the reader feels the price as both transcendence and obliteration. Because the lens’s logic never reverses and the lens-as-solution is foreshadowed in the city’s founding myth, the resolution is inevitable rather than contrived.</comment>

<comment>The drowned library is not a backdrop but a tactical partner: airless rifts, petrified leviathan spines, and the cracked air dome literally hold the prisms that rewrite death-protocol. Sensory hierarchy is biased by Elias’s profession—he catalogues silt graves, notes “bioluminescent anemones pulsing like hesitant heartbeats,” and smells decay only when it signals an echo he must silence. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, books, and currents are tracked without drift during the multi-vector shard installation. Micro-setting triumphs: the lighthouse lens charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate even though environment is slightly less active than body/tool in constraining choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—silence versus the relentless distress flares—tightens with every shard; each successful pulse silences one wail, foreclosing retreat and raising bodily cost as oxygen dwindles. Escalation is causal under the Situational lens: mounting spectral aggression and lung pressure force Elias deeper into “impossible spaces,” turning abstract architecture into life-or-death leverage. One meaningful deepening suffices: when the final prism clicks above the air bubble, the option to remain alive is erased. The price (his corporeal dissolution) is visible on the page, meeting the 8+ cost requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the keeper of the dead must become the eternal keeper of light, proving that absolute silence demands an eternal broadcaster—rest itself is a vigil. Subtext coils around the paradox: lighthouses exist to speak; Elias’s triumph is to speak the end of speech. The final image re-weights all prior flares from grief into welcome, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo line articulates the thesis; the paradox is left pulsing, inviting reflection on custodianship and after-life labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic—long, rolling clauses that mimic surge and drag, yet compressed to urgent fragments when air thins: “He ignored the mounting pressure in his lungs, diving…” Perceptual signature is grimly tactile, never touristic: Elias sees “drowned tomes swelled with eternal silence,” a phrase only an undertaker-librarian would coin. No dialogue appears, so voice modulation is carried through syntax alone; the shift from languid reminiscence to shard-by-shard staccato mirrors rising hypoxia. Compression and ellipses are pattern-taught early and paid off in the breath-starved final beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer job and metaphor simultaneously: “souls he’d laid to rest in silt graves, only for their echoes to resurface as distress signals.” No loops or paraphrase packs appear; each clause adds new pressure or sensory angle. Only minor mixed metaphor risk—“lighthouse beam piercing fog until a cataclysmic quake submerged all”—but the image resolves causally, not confusingly. Register stays within Elias’s diction; no elevated diction invades the underwater grit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of undertaker + librarian + lighthouse is non-obvious and specific; the drowned beacon’s inversion into a silencer feels both fresh and inevitable. Risk is taken by welding metaphysics to masonry—impossible architecture sustains the plot, not merely decorates. Detail is particularized: leviathan-fossil spine as conduit, anemones as heartbeats—none borrowed from trove catalogues. Transformation test fails if names or venue change, confirming conceptual rootedness; the premise is boldly committed to and fully followed through.</comment>
