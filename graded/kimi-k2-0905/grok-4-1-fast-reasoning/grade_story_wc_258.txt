<comment>Elara’s “steadily curious” mantra is shown through tactile card-and-tape work, but her interiority stays general; the final shared resolve is credible yet the cost feels light. Theo’s hollowness is sketched more than embodied, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is present but thin. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the beat where she “adjusted a path’s angle by one degree” is the closest we get to visible internal friction. Voice distinction is moot—only Elara speaks—so the single-POV baseline is met but not exceeded.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pair reverse-engineer the crash map and inherit a communal warning duty—an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (“the map reborn in onyx and measure”). Causal chain is tight: letter arrival → method revealed → path multiplication → new pattern found. Orientation is complete by line 6; no lens ambiguity. The measuring tape and ink cards act as persistent constraints shaping every tactical move. Only nit: off-stage grandmother does the original intellectual labor, blunting protagonist agency a hair.</comment>

<comment>The rain-beaded skylight is not backdrop but a metronome that times every beat; its taper to drizzle syncs with the closure. Micro-setting inside the ink pots and brass tape clasp charge the final image—Elara rolls the tape, cards fold, world outside “stirred faintly.” Spatial choreography is flawless: spiral stairs, central table, card spread sprawling “like a topographic map.” Sensory economy favors touch and sight, filtered through Elara’s cartomancer eye—no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the crash pattern to warn the next generation—is signaled early and tightened when the reversed World card reveals “communal ledgers.” Cost is conceptual but legible: they accept lifelong vigilance against the next mania. Agency is mostly intellectual; the physical act is the final roll of the tape, still a visible foreclosing. Escalation is steady under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each measured branch increases pattern density until meaning crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—“greed as the new god” cycling through history—emerges through reversed tarot paths rather than statement. The communal-ledger twist reframes crypto not as tech failure but as recurrent cultural myth, offering non-literal answer. Subtext lives in ink veins and measured distances; no character sermonizes. Final image of rain beads tracing “new secrets” invites ongoing ambiguity without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays latched to Elara with no leakage; perceptual signature is precise, synesthetic (“glass into a mosaic of liquid jewels”). Syntax lengthens during intellectual surges, contracts at tactile moments—rhythmic control under pressure. Diction remains within her artisanal lexicon; no academic register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural, subtextual—Theo’s voice cracks, Elara’s replies are measured, matching status shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers image or rule: “ink distilled from rare volcanic obsidian” does triple duty as material, heritage, and metaphor. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; metaphor strings are disciplined. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, ear-tested. Minor overwriting in “mosaic of liquid jewels” and “topographic map of madness,” but these occur early and do not taint the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing tarot cartomancy with post-crypto noir is fresh; the measuring tape as epistemic tool is a Risk distinction that heightens coherence. Reverse-engineering cultural manias through card-spacing is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. No trope checklist—each element (ink, tape, Fibonacci) is particularized. Grandmother as off-stage oracle is the only derivative echo, but her absence is thematic (inheritance) rather than convenience.</comment>
