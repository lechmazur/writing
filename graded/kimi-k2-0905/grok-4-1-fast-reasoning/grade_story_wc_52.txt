<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied through tactile woodworking and memory-crystals; the interior contradiction between holding and releasing Theo is alive in every chisel stroke. The final act of snapping the locket shut is a credible micro-choice that seals her path, with the kettle’s shriek as audible cost. Voice occasionally drifts into abstract catalogue (“here and gone” repeated as label) which flattens peak beats −0.4.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each chisel cut is a because/therefore step toward containing memory, narrowing options until the locket snap forecloses indefinite grief. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the kettle screams, tea is forfeited, eternity is now portable. No teleporting props; crystals and tools are tracked cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash grain are returned in final image, re-weighted from melancholy décor to container of eternity. Micro-setting—the locket interior—literally constrains the crystal’s placement, charging the closing snap. Selective sensory economy (rust hue, wood warmth) keeps momentum; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be contained without ossifying?—tightens as each crystal is seated; the final snap trades open-ended mourning for curated memory, a visible forfeiture of endless replay. Cost is legible: the kettle’s whistle=time’s insistence, ignored. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: roar vs. silence, wood vs. crystal, kettle vs. locket—life’s ephemerality crystallized into portable artifact. Final image reweights “harvest the roar” from circus bravado to private discipline, avoiding moralizing. Subtext resides in chisel sound and steam, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—rain beads “as if autumn itself had settled” echoes her seasonal grief. Rhythmic control: long cadence for reflection, staccato “cut, shave, snap” under pressure. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within circus widow lexicon. Pattern of rust/ash/roar taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and tool function (“wood dust sifted like fine sand”). One paraphrase loop −0.2 (“here and gone” phrase reused without fresh charge). No mixed metaphor; vehicles stay mechanical/organic. Final line is propulsive: “Tea could wait; she had contained eternity while it boiled.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Crystallizing memories into river quartz via lion-mane-fungus oil is a fresh, earned fusion of circus craft and grief technology. Risk in lyric repetition of “here and gone” could have flattened into gimmick, but payoff reconfigures the phrase into artifact. Transformation test fails if swapped—loft, ash, crystals are irreplaceable.</comment>
