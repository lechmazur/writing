<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—"cyclically spontaneous nature" and "sensory map maker" are concrete, embodied traits that steer every beat. The withheld-truth engine gives her a sharp contradiction: craving origin yet fearing collapse. Micro-choices (gripping the shard, twisting it twice) visibly escalate; the fused hand ending is earned. Flaw: mentor remains a thematic mouthpiece, not a full second character, so relationship crucible is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens: lyrical accumulative texture that tightens into causal redirect. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—shard fuses to hand, crystallizing cosmic cost. Orientation taught immediately: "abandoned spaceport repair bay," who/where clear inside 50 words. One soft patch: "worlds whispered thanks" edges toward anthropomorphic shorthand but occurs post-closure, so cost still legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is micro-textured through Elara’s sensorium—ozone, rust, green glass edge—each detail filters her map-maker bias. Bay’s hulks constrain movement (debris paths, tripping hazards) and supply the shard; spatial choreography stays clean across universes. Final image re-weights bay from decayed grave to loom-anchor, charging closure. 9+ gate met: shard-as-tool fused to body charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs multiversal collapse—signaled early. Escalation: first redirect reveals mentor’s warning; second exposes engineered origin; each tightens stakes from personal to cosmic guardian. Agency sits in the two shard-twists; cost is the fusion burn. Slight abstraction: "weight...a steady hum" could be more visceral, but cost is still page-visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: map-making as identity, birth as stitch, shard as seam-ripper/stitcher. Final fused hand answers the question "what is the weight?" without moralizing. Mentor echo’s regret and Elara’s acceptance create plausible ambiguity—she is both ward and weapon. Only minor drift: "weaver eternal" nudges toward grandiosity, but image is grounded in her bleeding palm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually distinct: velvet hush, metallic tang, verdant fire—synesthesia feels map-maker specific. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under shard-twist, longer dream-murmur cadence for folds. No head-hop; single POV stable. Free indirect style clean: "she understood" slides seamlessly from sensation to concept. Minor over-alliteration in "verdant fire...weaver eternal" but fits lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High information density—many sentences carry sensory, emotional, world data simultaneously. Rhythm breathes with escalation: clipped fragments during twist, expansive loops during parallels. One paraphrase loop: "withheld truth’s weight" echoed 3×; costs −0.2. Metaphors stay consistent (weave/fabric/thread); no mixed vehicles. Filter verbs minimal; strong verb choice predominates. Clean copy, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Freshest inflection: sensory map-maker as multiversal seam-stress, menstrual-cycle spontaneity married to cosmic engineering. Green glass shard reprises Arthurian motif but retooled as calibration tool, not mere jewel. Risk—recursive universe hops—paid off because each hop tightens rather than dilutes stakes. Derivative guardrail waived: world-weavers exist, yet birth-as-stitch and cycle-driven spontaneity feel specific and inevitable.</comment>
