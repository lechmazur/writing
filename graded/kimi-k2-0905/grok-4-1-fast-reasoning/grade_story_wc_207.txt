<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers tremble, vials clink, scents guide her—but the “sensibly eccentric” label is asserted more than dramatized. The decisive turn—choosing to pull the hinges and accept communion—carries credible cost, yet the prior psychometry visions feel like summary rather than embodied contradiction. Still, her flaw/obsession directly enables and complicates the climax, earning a solid high-band pass.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s stance is re-configured from outsider factory-worker to guardian-initiate, cost visible in the translucent mentors who merge with her. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each hinge pull intensifies density and reweights petrichor from quaint hobby to ontological key. Causality remains intact: compass → vision → hinge → transformation. One soft spot: the expedition’s fate is delivered in vision-summary rather than dramatized beat, a minor chilling effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Limestone weeping mineral tears, bioluminescent algae shimmering on obsidian water—details are selective, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s scent-oriented gaze. The vials, compass, and lagoon reappear as handled objects that alter tactics (pull hinge, bottle essence), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating bodies. A single over-ripe phrase (“gothic hush”) is forgivable amid otherwise precise economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tightens with each hinge: first vial of ancient essence, then revelation of thought-moving water, final offer of eternal guardianship. Each deepening narrows her options from curiosity → commitment → irreversible communion. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits explanatory sanity and former life. Agency is hers at every latch; no coincidence rescues or dooms her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: obsession with invisible scents becomes a gateway to accepting an unknowable world. The refrain “explanations fail” is iterated through image (compass spinning wildly, water obeying thought) rather than lecture. Final image—uncorking subterranean hush—reweights her earlier rain-kissed vials as mere prototypes, offering quiet conceptual repricing without moral tag. Slight risk of abstraction is offset by sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—petrichor, clinks, mineral breath—creating a distinct texture. Syntax flexes with pressure: short paratactic clauses during hinge pulls, longer humid cadences in lagoon stillness. No head-hopping; psychometry visions retain reported-frame distance (“Visions hinged open…”) so narrator remains modest. Minor echo of “resonant hush” used adjectivally four times; cadence just avoids monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines are dense and propulsive—“limestone walls wept mineral tears” does three jobs in seven words. One paraphrase loop (“resonant hush” repeated) and one mixed metaphor edge (“frozen waves” beside obsidian mirror) keep it shy of pristine 9. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero filter-verb stacks, strong verbs throughout. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature, accelerating at hinge beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusing scent-collecting hobby with underground transformation cult feels fresh; petrichor as metaphysical key is not a trope catalogue entry. Specificity anchors risk—glyph compass, mossy hinge-levers, bioluminescent decision-pool—so bold premises never slide into abstraction. Expedition backstory could be any lost-cave tale, but the olfactory through-line reconfigures familiar bones into Elara’s singular skin. Transformation test: swap petrichor for, say, sound-collecting and entire arc collapses—proof of organic invention.</comment>
