<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s patchwork body and reverse-migration obsession are vividly embodied; every burn and graft is a lived waypoint. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the final choice to light the censer is the direct culmination of his compulsive atlas of loss. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible off the page, but the object interaction supplies equivalent pressure. The earned smile into dawn shows credible endurance with cost—scars still ache—so the arc closes under its own momentum.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon ignites and reverse migration becomes legible, charged with foxfire cost. Causal chain holds—each midnight call + lunar pulse tightens the next tactical move—so the lens is clearly Causal. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when); no penalty. One minor scaffold: “reverse migration flowed” repeats the concept twice in the closing paragraph, but it does not touch the final image, so −0.2 only in Q7.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Starlit signal station, hydraulic wreckage, and salt-stung wind are filtered through Elias’s navigator eye—selective, professional, urgent. The censer foot operates as micro-setting: its lodestone hum constrains knot timing and charges the final flare. Spatial choreography stays clean across ladder moves and shore-line sight-lines. Environment never stalls momentum; instead, moonlit antenna ribs literally guide coil winding.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—call the scattered home—signals early and tightens with each lunar phase. Mid-story deepening occurs when the censer’s wild spin under gibbous moon forces Elias to twist left coils, visibly raising failure risk. Final act is his decision to strike flint; cost is palpable—flames lick his scarred hands, signal wails into unknown. Escalation is causal, single-thread, and sufficient for 700-word span.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of return-as-repair emerges through image, not axiom: driftwood ribs, eel sinew, and patina bronze literalize the act of piecing back. Final reprise of “raw solace” reweights earlier grief without moralizing. No echo-line articulates a thesis; meaning stays in the flicker of village fires. Ambiguity remains—some may still drift away—so complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s scar-fixed perception; no head-hop. Diction—“gritty comfort,” “fox-fire glow”—is navigator-poetic yet internally consistent. Midnight phone voices carry distinct gravel/hiss timbre without drifting into exposition. Rhythm accelerates with coil winding and flame strike, mirroring cardiac spike, then exhales at dawn. Compression and elision (“twist left under gibbous”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong density: each sentence advances coil, bone, or tide. One paraphrase loop in closing paragraph (“reverse migration flowed… steady reclaiming”) costs −0.2. Otherwise verbs are kinetic—“lashed,” “hissed,” “leapt”—and metaphors stay coherent (lodestone as compass heart). No filter-verb stacks; no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm varies from staccato calls to long tide-drawn sentences.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ancestral incense burner + failed telecom hardware = ghost radio for diaspora recall. Conceptual risk—voices of dead kin via rotary phone—pays off because lunar magnetism rule is taught early and obeyed. Patchwork body as living map literalizes “geography of loss” without allegory. Specific detail (verdigris crust, eel-sinew lashing) makes the device irreplaceable. Ending image of villages rekindling feels inevitable yet non-generic.</comment>
