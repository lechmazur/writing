<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s lifelong curiosity and the ache of stolen boyhood are rendered through tactile, scholar-body detail—callused fingers brushing silt, lantern held steady though hand trembles. The final palm-to-mushroom choice is credibly grown from earlier pattern-tracing and costs him the safety of forgetting; we feel the door close. Interiority stays concrete, but a few phrases (“crisp nostalgia sharpened his resolve”) flirt with label-speak, keeping it just under the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the constellations re-knit, memories flood back, and the fairy ring’s fade becomes the felt cost. Causal chain holds—because he traces the star-map in the water, therefore the sprites’ bargain reverses. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One causal micro-turn suffices for 798-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s half-submerged dome, cracked glass, and drowned apple trees are not backdrop; they force Elias to wade, kneel, and read the sky through fractured panes, directly shaping the decryption act. Shipwreck husks echo the 1947 flood that first let the sprites in, binding history to present tactic. Sensory hierarchy obeys a folklorist’s eye—phosphorescence, silt, salt wind—without tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the fairy ring itself) ultimately charges the final image as its glow seals the door.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover or relinquish stolen memories—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the star-map decryption demands a literal touch that will end the ring’s glow. One meaningful deepening suffices: the alignment of Sirius with the ring’s center forces a now-or-never stance. Cost is legible—he gains the past but loses the numinous refuge forever. No escalation loop; pressure coheres under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of archival obsession: to catalogue wonder is to exile oneself from it. The broken constellations re-stitching into a hologram reweights the earlier image of scholarly pattern-tracing, letting the reader feel the paradox without moralizing. Subtext in the sprites’ giggling bargain hints that every ethnographer steals even as he is robbed. Final image of the fading ring offers a charged poise rather than a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s perceptual filter—decades of fieldwork shape every noticed spore and star fracture. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under choice, mirroring the climb toward decryption. No head-hopping; diction stays within an aging folklorist’s lexicon. One clause (“conceptual cost”) edges academic but reads as his own scholarly self-talk, so waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: “brackish water that lapped at his knees” does triple duty—setting, body, stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (sky torn by fairy mischief) and never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; paragraph breaks pace the lantern’s sweep. A single near-miss: “crisp nostalgia” is abstract, but immediately grounded by apple-pie scent, so artifact kept minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fairy-ring memory theft is familiar folklore, but the star-map decryption through a cracked greenhouse dome feels singular. The 1947 shipwreck flood pinning ships to an orchard is specific and irreplaceable. Risk lies in merging maritime disaster with fairy cosmology, yet causality holds. Transformation is evident: remove any piece and the decryption collapses.</comment>
