<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elyra’s contradictory impulse—hunger to know why echoes linger yet readiness to weaponize that knowledge—stays alive in every beat; her micro-choice to meter the shell’s whispers alters alliance tactics twice. Interiority is sensuously embodied (“reed-blown melancholy” tightening her throat) rather than labeled. The climactic renunciation—using her own echo as manacle—pays off prior causality with visible social cost (merchant entombed, oracle silenced). Flaw: the “richly perceptive” trait is asserted once too often, slightly over-articulated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene orientation is secured by line 5; the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via iterative shell-whispers that intensify density. Four progressive disclosures function as because/therefore escalations: each revelation narrows the group’s trust and Elyra’s tactical options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she pockets the shell under a hush-hum, now knowing perception itself forges echo-chains—reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost (she walks alone). One causal micro-gap: the guardian’s instant stone-web ability is not pre-seeded, a hairline convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The serpentine canyon is not backdrop but acoustic amplifier that Elyra weaponizes at climax; stone geometry dictates betrayal’s rebound. Starlight refracts through the shell’s “iridescent veins,” fusing macro-setting and micro-prop. Reed-born wind and humming cosmos supply an ever-tightening auditory clock. Spatial choreography keeps four bodies legible without head-count clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will knowledge of echo-immortality survive the night?—is signaled in paragraph two. Each disclosure raises relational cost: first doubt, then oracle grief, finally merchant violence that forces Elyra to expend her sonic trump card. The tightening is one-directional yet sufficient for 750-word scope. Price is legible: permanent fracturing of the pact and her self-exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory persists only through attentive, perilous listening—emerges from the shell’s iterated half-truths rather than exposition. Subtext accrues in gesture: merchant’s “smile hid venom,” guardian’s tear-frozen armor. Final image of singer walking “the coils alone” reframes earlier melancholy as obligatory price, avoiding moral statement. Conceptual repricing is subtle but undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elyra’s synesthetic ear: “universe hummed its secret song” is her perceptual register, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens and contracts with disclosure rhythm, mirroring breath control of canyon song. No head-hopping; oracle, merchant, guardian remain opaque in motive, read only through Elyra’s sensory bias. Compressed lyric diction is pattern-taught early and paid off at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—most lines couple sensory image with causal push (“Its fractured curve... murmured fragments”). Occasional modifier stacks (“reed-blown melancholy, soft lament”) flirt with overwriting but stay within voice. No paraphrase loops; pronoun chains are clean. One mixed vehicle: “armor gleamed like frozen tears” momentarily fuses reflectivity with emotion yet does not blur action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mythic trope of the singer who binds souls is re-angled through acoustical physics and game-theoretic trust erosion. The half-shell as data-storage device feels novel, its spiral fracture literalizing “half-truths.” Risky lyric escalation could have collapsed into purple vagueness but is anchored by tactical disclosure beats. Fresh inflection: echo as parasitic payment for perception.</comment>
