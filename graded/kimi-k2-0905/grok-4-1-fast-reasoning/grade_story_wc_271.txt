<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s quiet-talent trait drives two on-page grafting beats and the mentorship moment, so the attribute is dramatized, not merely labelled. The drone-survivor past is anchored to present stimuli (photo find, wind-whine) and triggers a credible freeze response that alters her micro-choices. Interiority stays concrete (“somatic marker igniting from gut to spine”) and avoids therapy-speak until the single word “trauma,” which is cushioned by immediate embodied fallout. Final stance—grounded optimism—pays visible cost: she relinquishes the photo as wound and offers it as bridge to the younger woman, earning the closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the photograph is re-weighted from shrapnel-of-memory to keepsake-of-endurance, and this reconfigures Elena’s future stance with felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of freeze-thaw-pearl images tightens across three beats, each re-cueing the arboretum’s vegetal resilience; final beam-sweep crystallizes the re-priced meaning without contradiction. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words (who=Elena, where=seaside arboretum, when=post-automated-lighthouse era), so no penalty. One micro-turn—photo find— suffices; escalation is density-based, narrowing the stake from mere survival to grounded optimism, with price legible in the shared photo and lighthouse beam.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Seaside-cliff arboretum constrains every beat: salt spray, wind, and rooting metaphor shape Elena’s tactics (grafting, stillness) and the younger woman’s sketch hesitation. Micro-setting of apron pocket and mulch embeds the photograph as handled object that alters choice when smoothed and shared. Spatial choreography is clean: visitors pause, ferns sway, beam sweeps—no impossible positions. Environment and body (callused hands, seized muscles) both charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can optimism survive recurrent trauma?—is signaled by line 3 and tightened when the photograph resurfaces. The meaningful deepening occurs during the freeze: Elena’s options narrow to endure or collapse; her choice to “root through” re-weights the stake under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: she yields the photo’s private pain to become social bridge, forfeiting secrecy. Agency is present; coincidence (finding the photo) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from vegetal resilience pattern rather than assertion: winters/springs analogy stays implicit, finding full articulation only in the advice line “winters come, yet springs follow if you graft the scars right.” Subtext operates in gesture—smoothing and sharing the photo—showing that remembrance, not amnesia, anchors realistic hope. Final image of beam sweeping shared photograph offers resonant non-literal answer: light circles back, re-illumining damage as testament. No late moralizing; complexity remains (grief not cured, only re-rooted).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elena; perceptual signature is botanical (“hybrid blooms,” “wilting leaves”) and trauma-tuned (“drone hummed unseen”). Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under freeze: “Her breath caught; her body betrayed her first…” demonstrating rhythm control. No dialogue contamination; the two spoken lines carry subtext of invitation rather than exposition. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose shows high information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and symbolic layers (“the world narrowing to the salt spray and her hammering pulse”). Metaphors stay coherent within vegetal through-line; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: three adjectives in “quiet, talented in grafting” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull closure. Rhythm varies; paragraph cut test passes—each graph advances knowledge or charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of drone-survivor with plant-grafter healing practice feels specific and inevitable; neither strand works without the other. Freeze-to-pearl trope is refreshed through vegetal realism rather than self-help cliché. Risk of split-scene (two shards) pays off by mirroring grafting structure. Transformation test: swap setting or trauma source and the entire conceit collapses, confirming originality.</comment>
