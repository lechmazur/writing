<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger to bottle infinity is the only motive that matters; it intensifies through each frost-coded signpost and crystallizes in the final uncorking. Interiority is lean but concrete—his laugh at the climax embodies the cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, so the arc is linear rather than layered, capping the score below 9. Still, the single-minded obsession lands with visible price, satisfying the 9+ quick test threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkage is immaculate: frost pattern → broadside → descent → rupture → collapse, each beat tightening options until the library’s fall forecloses return. The closure is a charged poise—Elias fused to eternal moment—whose cost is the literal shattering of order. Orientation is taught by word 40 (“glass orchard library”), so no penalty applies. The only hairline slip is a single adverbial cluster (“cryptic no more”) that briefly tells the laugh, but the image still reconfigures stakes irreversibly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard is not backdrop but causal engine: buoyant fragility enables the perfect system that the bottled whisper then destabilizes. Micro-setting becomes tool when Elias presses discarded type against the cork—environment literally supplies the key. Frost filigrees recur with shifting stakes, charging the final shatter. Spatial choreography stays clean across the vertical descent; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“compress eternity into a moment”—is declared early and escalates through each frost rereading. The rupture act narrows options to one: library death for personal transcendence. Cost is legible in prismatic rain and the swallowed remnants; no off-stage rescue. One beat short of 9+ only because the price is borne by setting, not Elias’s body, softening visceral punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that permanence demands systemic violence; no character states this aloud. The glass orchard’s beauty is not symbol but prerequisite—its destruction is the only path to eternal moment. Final reconfiguration is conceptual: survivors will decipher new frost, implying cyclical destabilization. No moralizing, only charged image of broadsides raining as “cryptic seeds.”</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature is Elias’s pattern-hungry gaze, filtering every leaf and whorl as omen. Syntax compresses under pressure—“rupture inevitable / awakenings rustled forth”—mirroring the staccato press clacks. No head-hopping or register drift. The only micro-slip is the abstract noun cluster “singular, shattering now” that edges toward thesis, but cadence still serves climax.</comment>

<comment>Prose is artifact-free: no loops, no filler, no mixed metaphors. Information density is extreme—each sentence both advances descent and reweights stakes. Rhythm accelerates into single-line staccato at rupture, then widens into plummet. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp anchors; middle paragraphs vary length to create visual fall. Only reason not 9.5 is the faint poetic register that may alienate some editors, but within this speculative mode it is flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of letterpress mysticism with floating crystalline library feels inevitable yet unseen before. Rupture as creative act upends the usual destruction-as-negativity trope. Frost-cartography turns weather into plot engine, not atmosphere. Risk is maximal—entire setting annihilated—yet closure remains legible under causal lens, earning the high-band bonus.</comment>
