<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s “uncertainly certain” interiority is dramatized in micro-choices—using a quartz shard as screwdriver, levering the chest with a hairpin—showing trait-consistent improvisation under pressure. The closing alliance with uncertainty is earned: his laugh and tactical pivot (knotted-root shortcut) visibly shed old rigidity. No contradictory impulses appear simultaneously; reflection is summary, not embodied mid-action. Still, the single on-page cost is light for 700 words, capping the arc just under the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pocket-watch pattern → compass rose → waterfall fissure → journals delivers a legible because-chain that tightens options. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: Thorne’s maxim reweights Elias’s premise on-page, cost felt in the ash-smudged journals he pockets. Orientation anchored by line 4; no gaps. One soft spot: clocks’ 3:17 pattern is declared, never explained or paid off, a minor unkept set-up that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Subterranean waterfall, mist-beaded gears, vine-spring lattice, and soot-thick chamber are sensory-filtered through Elias’s tinkerer gaze; each locale offers tactile tools that constrain next improvisation. The compass rose functions as micro-setting, its swivel charging the chest-opening beat. Final ash image reprises “beneath the ashes” concept with visual cost. Environment never slips from POV notice; missing 9-band only because waterfall itself could have bitten back harder (spray-slick grip, etc.).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—replace control with chance—tightens once: decision to enter spray despite no map forecloses retreat. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no second tightening or physical price (injury, lost tool) is logged. Improvised vine-ladder and hairpin lever show agency, yet luck (hidden ledge, chest intact) abets rather than complicates. Cost is conceptual; visible price would push the band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from particulates: mist, ash, broken springs, errant compass—never labeled “uncertainty” until journals speak. Final CR reweights earlier clock motif without sermon. Admirable restraint: no thesis sentences; meaning arises from image juxtaposition. Lacks a counter-argument beat, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s tinkerer diction: “springs for grip,” “quartz screwdriver,” “brass disc etched.” Rhythm compresses under spray—sentence fragments mimic breathlessness. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Dialogue absent; no voice convergence risk. Elevated diction (“ceaseless roar,” “spectral eddies”) slightly overshoots workshop realism but remains tonally coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Varied sentence shapes; no template cadence. Strong verbs: “hewn,” “pried,” “lashed.” Figurative language sparse and apt: “mist…like forgotten thoughts.” One paraphrase loop: “uncertainly certain” repeated four times; trimmed once would sharpen. No mixed metaphors; opening and closing lines carry propulsion. Artifacts light; closure image untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Fusing clock-repair with nautical-navigation lore feels non-obvious; compass pointing to “Doubt’s Drift” freshens standard treasure hunt. Ash-choked greenhouse beneath a waterfall is idiosyncratic world-building. Transformation test fails only if Elias were generic “seeker”; his tinkerer specificity anchors the concept. Risk taken: no gold, only philosophy—yet cost is intellectual, not visceral, preventing full 9.</comment>
