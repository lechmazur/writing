<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s haunted loneliness and covert craft are vivid; her decision to surrender anonymity at the spiral carries felt cost. Interiority occasionally slips into lyrical shorthand (“whimsy inevitable” twice) rather than embodied contradiction. Theo remains silhouette-plus-letter; his agency is asserted not dramatized, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spirals lock, Theo appears, Elara’s anonymity dissolves, reconfiguring stakes with undeniable social/emotional cost. Causal linkage is loose—Theo’s arrival is coincidence—but the accumulative pattern (letters, spirals, birds) teaches lyric reunification, so lens holds. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors clear by line 6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lily pond/temple micro-setting constrains the literal stage and charges the final image; rain-drop jewels and thrush song act as tactile props. Selective sensory economy—ink-stained fingers, feathers in water—keeps momentum. One excess: “prismatic quiet” becomes reflex epithet, slightly diluting its final hit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can risking exposure reconnect her?—tightens once: the twig offering. Escalation is lyrical, not causal; pressure accrues through mirrored spirals and hush of crowd until stance crystallizes. Cost is legible in her public unmasking and Theo’s reciprocal reveal. Slight deduction for coincidence facilitating climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: shared vulnerability dissolves isolation. Subtext beats in silent letter-exchange and spiral symmetry; no final moralizing. Final image (nest-knot between palms) reweights prior ghostwriting as communal circuitry. Avoids tidy binaries—secrecy both wounds and heals—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-up sustains perceptual signature—ink, feathers, refracted color—without filter-verb glut. Diction stays within Elara’s poetic but human lexicon; cadence swells at reunion without drum-beat repetition. Dialogue sparse and natural, though Theo’s idiom converges with Elara’s in climactic exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High metaphor density but pattern-taught early (“prismatic quiet,” “rain-drops…jewels”) and pays off in closing kaleidoscope. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Minor paraphrase loop—“inevitably whimsical” x2, “thread connecting all things” x3—dulls edge slightly. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar lost-loverMeet-coincidence is re-visioned through anonymous ghostwritten letters and participatory art spiral, transforming trope into communal ritual. Nest-twig spiral as both talisman and sculptural node is specific and memorable. Public-art engine supplies fresh social mechanics for private reconciliation. Risky lyric repetition mostly earns its keep.</comment>
