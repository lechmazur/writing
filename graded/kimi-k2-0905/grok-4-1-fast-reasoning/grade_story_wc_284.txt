<question>1</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elias’s scarred caution versus relic-mentor impulse is alive; the pill stimulant hand-off crystallises his “fixer” identity and costs him Lena. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The poise of self-exile is earned, but we don’t see competing impulses in the rook-nest beat; he declares rather than dramatises his final withdrawal.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: pillbox → snow codes → rook rendezvous → vouchsafe burst. Closure is Charged Poise—Elias re-weights Lena’s future while foreclosing his own. Orientation anchored within 120 words; only micro-slippage is “Prudently daring” refrain that occasionally overlays the same beat. Cost feels real: the empty box handed off is the visible forfeiture, cyanide implied.</comment>

<comment>Bluff, mist, ladder, rook niche all constrain access and visibility; pillbox doubles as micro-setting that keys the snow glyphs. Weather (snow crust) doubles as code substrate—setting literally hosts the plot mechanics. Final image of fresh codes scratched in new snow recharges environment as torch-passing slate. Spatial choreography is impeccable; no credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—network resurrection via Lena—tightens once with the stimulant transfer; options narrow from possible suicide to self-sacrifice as mentor. Agency remains Elias’s; no outside rescue. Visible price: his own future is foreclosed to green-light hers. Could use one additional micro-cost beat (tool fatigue, frost-numb fingers) to enter 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal-through-relay emerges via pillbox, snow codes, and empty container—never sermonizes. Final non-verbal image (new codes for “next tilt”) reweights premise: legacy is iterative, not heroic. Avoids equivalency trap—Elias accepts irreversible burn-out. Minor echo of “unused courage” concept twice; still, resonance is mostly earned by gesture, not label.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person sustains silver-mist tonality; diction (“zephyrs whispered in silver hush”) is consistent, never purple. Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays body-anchored. Cadence modulates—long breaths for approach, staccato for burst signal—without template monotony. Elias’s interior idiom distinct from Lena’s breathy diction; differentiation holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: most sentences advance code, pillbox, or bodily stakes. One micro-loop: “prudently daring” refrain; slight scaffold but not in closure zone. Metaphors stay coherent (snow glyphs ≠ mixed vehicle). Opening and closing lines carry echo without self-plagiarism. Rhythm supports hush tension; no simultaneity errors. Minor paraphrase adjacent on “silver hush” usages but within tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Snow-encoded spy relay fused with mentor-sacrifice gives familiar genre a fresh tilt. Pillbox as literal cipher key is elegant and specific to this world. Risk in lyric repetition pays off—final “For the next tilt” re-energizes earlier motif. Hierarchy of courage through physical artifact feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echo; concept committed fully.</comment>
