<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s chameleonic borrowing is dramatized in every beat—hands stained with star-dust, voice modulating to Mira’s tremor—so the trait drives the climax when her dread floods him. Interiority is concrete: “dread flooded his veins like molten topaz” embodies rather than labels. The final renunciation—releasing her personality—carries visible cost as the halo dims and the press resets, foreclosing his prior detachment. Micro-choices (pulling the lever while already half-stolen) reveal a hierarchy of obsession over self-preservation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat is a because/therefore chain—fragment embedded → ink mixed → invite tendered → empathy swaps. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the new star’s math reweights the premise that emotion equals series; cost is the spent halo and Elias’s stagger. Orientation is nailed in the first sentence (“topaz workshop perched on a jagged cliff”). No causal amnesia; every object state (fragment, press, page) tracks cleanly to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Topaz walls refract starlight to force disorientation; the press’s trapped-hornet hum constrains pacing and attention. The workshop’s jagged cliff position mirrors the emotional precipice Elias courts. Micro-setting succeeds: the halo fragment’s heat and glow alter tactical choices (when to pull the lever, when to release). Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—Elias notices ink viscosity, Mira notices vanishing stars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quantify emotion or perish—signals early and tightens when the transpose recoils, swapping dread for obsession. One meaningful deepening: the feedback loop amplified by the halo forecloses the option to stay detached. Cost is visible on-page: seared palms, spent fragment, new star’s birth. Agency remains Elias’s at every turn; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as an infinite series—emerges through the fractal refractions and the final star’s flicker, never stated. The broadsheet’s ambiguous line “Light bends where shadow yearns” becomes a resonant non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in silence: Mira’s laugh is the echo of Elias’s cadence, showing identity is additive, not zero-sum. No final-paragraph moralizing; the new star reweights the premise without assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured: syntactic parallelism (“Joy's vector traces sorrow's arcuate path”) mirrors mathematical obsession. Perceptual signature is concrete—Elias measures emotional angles in refractions. Compression is taught early (“golden facets gleamed under the ebbing night sky”) and paid off in the final flicker. No head-hopping; even Mira’s interiority is filtered through Elias’s borrowed lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “transposed empathy ignited” does triple duty—action, emotion, concept. Figurative language is patterned, not stacked; each metaphor (molten topaz, hornet hum) returns in altered form at closure. Rhythm accelerates with clause-fragment pairs during the swap: “He reeled... She laughed...” No synonym loops or template cadence. Copy-clean; pronoun paths unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—emotion as derivable calculus—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk: letting the antagonist become the lover-of-math without external villain pays off when the cosmos itself subtracts stars. Topaz workshop + letterpress + comet shard fuses occult science with tactile craft, unattributed elsewhere. The final star’s birth reframes loss as operation, a conceptual turn impossible with names or places swapped out.</comment>
