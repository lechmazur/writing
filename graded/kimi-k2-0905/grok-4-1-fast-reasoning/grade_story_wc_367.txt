<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s “shadowed elation” is vivid, but interiority drifts into label-speak (“tears of manic glee”) and the decisive turn—summoning shadows—rests on a vision rather than a prior flaw or contradiction. No micro-choice shows him weighing sailor-safety against godhood; the laughter stays performative, not revelatory of cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dawn gilded by eternal night reweights the world. Causal lens holds—vision → beam tweak → shadows → coast—yet cost is atmospheric, not personal; Elias loses nothing on-stage. Orientation is swift; only one causal hinge feels thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Emerald stone, glass wick, and lighthouse stairs are tactile, light-bent, and steer action; the wick’s physics is poetic but internally consistent. Stars and velvet sky compress scale to a single shaft of light, letting setting double as tool—rare micro-setting win.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rebirth via primordial dark—tightens once: storm-beam redirect forecloses safe routine. Escalation is situational: external pressure coils, Elias angles mirrors, shadows answer. Cost is societal (screens flicker), not personal; price is legible but vicarious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of mediated truth versus primal dark emerges through images—inkless presses, lantern loops, veiled dawn—never sermonized. Final image reweights early “printless epoch” into literal shadowed renewal. Subtext stays in gesture; no thematic echo spoken aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured: archaic diction, maritime cadence, storm-mirth syntax. Compression (“velvet sky,” “starlit omens”) is taught early; rhythm crests with Elias’s giggles. No POV drift; perceptual signatures—light as trap, laughter as thunder—remain consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary; high-pressure beats avoid figurative overload. One scaffold loop—“laughter pealing like herald bells” echoes earlier peal—adds 0.2 cost. No mixed metaphor; opening line anchors stakes; closing line crystallizes CR without exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing meteorological lore, optics physics, and post-media apocalypse into a single lighthouse beat feels fresh. “Print extinction → beacon shadows” is non-obvious synthesis. Risk: lyric density could obscure, yet clarity holds. Transformation test fails only if relocated; concept is inseparable from setting.</comment>
