<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—mourning his failed revolution while hungering to resurrect it through myth—are active in-scene when he palms the shard and chooses annihilation of evidence over possession. The gesture crystallizes a hierarchy of values (legacy > truth) with visible cost: alarms, pursuit, the scholars’ outrage. Interiority stays concrete (“revolutionary ghosts” trembling in his fingers). One beat of diagnostic label-speak (“his poetically inclined soul”) keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shard’s allure → storm plan → mirror ingress → shard seizure → shattering that rewrites scholarly war. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who/where/when visible). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—by atomizing the shard Elias forces new myth-making, paying with permanent exile from scholarly record. Persistent constraint (mirrors veiled to survive storm) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is more than postcard: mirrored gallery’s chronal fragility enables the heist; velvet shrouds become tactical tools; rococo vaults supply spatial logic for stealth. Micro-setting (his inked palm couplet) constrains the plan. Environment mirrors interior—“frozen screams” spires echo Elias’s stalled insurgency—yet detail is filtered through POV attention, never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—redeem lost cause by weaponizing artifact—tightens when Elias realizes possession is impossible and ups the ante to narrative sabotage. One meaningful turn: instead of keeping shard, he destroys interpretive certainty, escalating stakes from personal trophy to collective ideological seeding. Cost is legible: alarms, pursuit, scholarly enmity, permanent loss of scholarly voice. Could use one earlier tactical loss to sharpen trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges—revolutionary memory outlives material proof—through destruction rather than sermon. Final whispered line refracts earlier “burnished sorrow,” reweighting shard dust as perpetual insurgent echo. Ambiguity persists: Elias may have birthed tyrannical myth instead of utopian one. No overt thesis; complexity earned via costly act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Baroque-rococo syntax mirrors asteroid architecture: stacked clauses, gilded adjectives, iambic cadences in interior monologue. Perceptual signature is consistent—poet sees time as “iridescent rivers,” danger as “chronal lashes.” No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under storm pressure. Dialogue absent; narrative voice sustains rhythmic control without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences spiral then snap short (“He hurled the shard”). Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early and paid off at mirror-shatter climax. One scaffold loop: “burnished sorrow” appears twice with only slight reweighting; else no paraphrase churn. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs propel heist beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Retrograde-archaeology heist inside visible-time asteroid feels novel; premise synthesizes baroque aesthetics with chronal physics without exotic graft. Risk—poetic voice carrying thriller mechanics—pays off; shards refract both light and ideology, turning object into epistemic bomb. Could edge higher with one more concrete specificity tying Aetherian runes to Elias’s past slogans.</comment>
