<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Achieves fierce interiority through tactile, embodied beats (“callused…clandestine rituals”, blood drip onto bones) that fuse motive to micro-action. The contradictory impulse is present—“never forced; instead…inlaying meaning”—but shown only once, so the arc leans summary rather than sustained contradiction; still, the final trammel choice carries visible bodily cost and is earned by earlier ritual groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: card-find → ritual → blood seal → cracked destiny; escalation tightens exactly once via the price of flooded memories. Closure lands as a Charged Poise (resonant reconfiguration): roots “pulsing with new life” reweight future options while the cost—“shadows…whispering” and her “dimmed” future—remains legible. Some causality is implied rather than dramatised (swap mechanism asserted not tested) so it stops just short of 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is no backdrop: roots tightening around bones after the blood-rite physically constrain further motion and literally nail the Lovers card in place. Half-lit phosphorescence, loam-strewn corridor, bone shard tool—every sensory detail is filtered through Elara’s ritual urgency; the final root pulse mirrors her heartbeat, charging the closure image. World rules stay internally consistent; no orientation drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mend soul-holes by bartering destinies—announced early; pressure tightens when the blood seal forces memory influx at visible personal cost. Agency progression is causal under ritual logic; no outside coincidence. Stakes stay personal, not abstract, yet the “dimmed future” cost is stated more than dramatised in-scene, blunting visceral escalation needed for 8.2+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image rather than thesis: card, root, blood, echo braid into a meditation on substitution and afterlife debt. Subtext lives in gesture—her fiercely gentle refusal to force, the orchard’s willing cooperation—creating durable ambiguity about who profits from the swap. Final smile-through-tears image reframes earlier “holes” without moralising, satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical voice maintains dusky, incantatory cadence; diction (“snaked between bleached bones”, “earth’s hidden markets”) stays within lexicon of occult initiate. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences in ritual, clipped fragments at cut palm—mirroring pulse of pressure. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature consistent; no POV leakage or dialogue to contaminate voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence performs double duty (image + motive, metaphor + causality). Only minor scaffold present (“her reckless ideal fueling…” repeats concept already shown). Minor metaphor strain when “tarnished coins” and “echo” rub shoulders, but vehicles stay physically coherent. Closure line is clean, resonant, typo-free, with strong cadential drop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot-as-graft, tree-root-as-vein, orchard-as-catacomb blends necromancy with arboriculture to generate new metaphor space. Premise is familiar (trade fate for love) but the organic-bonding ritual and botanical necropolis feel specific to this text; without them the emotional maths collapses. Risk is present yet coherent. No echo of famous scenes or lines.</comment>
