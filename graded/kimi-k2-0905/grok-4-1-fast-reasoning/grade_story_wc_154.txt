<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and character-specific; the “lotus-hearted ache” refrains risk label-speak but are earned by embodied gesture (trembling fingers, whispered balm). The brother-loss backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters her decryption choices, satisfying BRR. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: feigned playfulness → decryption → unknotting string → pocketing fragment. No contradiction under pressure; the final refusal to sink is credible renunciation with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of coral/knot imagery reweights stakes toward the final Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by line 7; no penalty. Closure is a clean CR: the pocketed fragment reprices both their unspoken griefs. Felt cost is the tear-graft and the vow to carry the fragment—visible on the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: the creeping mist mirrors emotional seepage and physically allows privacy for decryption. Twilight’s bruised silvers recur as color-filter for POV bias. Sensory economy is tight—fading skylights, distant waves, cool coral—each later reappears to charge the final image. Spatial choreography clean: bedside → cast → string pocketed → fragment pocketed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to turn ciphered despair into lifeline—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: decryption moves from generic fear to the literal tourniquet scar, tightening options. Cost is the tear-graft and the vow to carry another’s grief. No coincidence; escalation is her escalating intimacy with Kael’s code.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from coral/knot recurrence: beauty can reform from ruins. No explicit thesis; final whisper is imagistic, not moral. Subtext in the hidden drawing reframes “unknot” as mutual rescue. Ambiguity lingers—will dawn hold?—yet pattern feels complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: alliteration (“bruised silvers,” “lotus-hearted threnody”) and hyphenated compounds create Pacific-patois music without caricature. Psychic distance stays tight to Elara; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“she recognized”) are voice-motivated, not intrusive. Dialogue absent; narration carries subtext alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for twilight languor, fragments under decryption pressure. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Occasional stacked metaphors (“brain-like” coral + “lotus-hearted” ache) flirt with overwriting but serve pattern. Proofing clean; tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Pacific-war hospital + child-code decryption is fresh synthesis; coral-as-brain metaphor transforms eco-war trope. Hidden drawing inside knotted string is a non-obvious reveal that reweights prior knots. Risky lyric density pays off in final reprise. Could not swap names/places without breaking patois cadence and coral idiom.</comment>
