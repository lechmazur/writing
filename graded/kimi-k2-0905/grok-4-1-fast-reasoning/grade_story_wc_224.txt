<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home yet dreading memory—surface in every tactile beat (the trembling hand, the feather’s rasp). The cost is legible: sealing her talent left her hollow, unsealing it floods her with thunder that will now never quiet. The final stance—home is the archive she walks—carries credible renunciation: she forfeits literal return to become living conduit. Interiority is silver-veined and idiosyncratic, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each feather-stroke layers density until the final spiral reweights “home” from absent valley to present labyrinth. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—her mercury eyes “forever changed” makes the cost conceptual and irreversible. Orientation is taught early (“deep within the labyrinthine bookstore”) and pays off when the mountain’s veins become home. No causal breaks; glyphs and dreams track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but prosthetic memory: geothermal warmth, teetering stacks, obsidian-skinned stone—each detail constrains how she moves (kneeling, tracing, abandoning exit). Micro-setting of the feather’s “silken rasp” becomes wind-over-valley, fusing body and world. Final image—stone aglow on pedestal—recharges every prior shelf as latent home. Spatial choreography never slips; distances tighten as she descends.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map the contours of what was lost”—tightens when each glyph seeded forecloses nostalgia and demands inner thunder. Agency is continual: every stroke is a conscious trade of pain for phoneme. The deepening is the reversal of loss itself: home relocates into labyrinth rather than outside it. Cost is cumulative insomnia and irreversible perceptual shift—visible in her “forever changed” eyes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as palimpsest: archive overlays valley, loss becomes architecture. No moral, only resonant re-pricing—“home was the labyrinth itself” reweights prior ache into custodial calling. Motif of mercury-glass recurs only as perceptual filter, never ornament. Emotional aftereffect is quiet vertigo: reader senses corridors humming with borrowed thunder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, perceptual signature fused to Elara’s mercury refractions: “visions flickered like liquid silver.” Syntax lengthens under trance, shortens under pain—“she whispered the syllable” lands like pulse. No head-hop; feather and stone are focalized through her skin. Register stays within plausible antiquarian-bookstore lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glyphs that pulsed faintly, like veins under obsidian skin” performs three jobs—visual, tactile, foreshadow. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor is bespoke and paid off. Rhythm modulates from cavernous cadence to feather-light rasp, accelerating at spiral-stroke. Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances knowledge or texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of seer-myth with bibliophilic archive feels fresh; mercury-glass as memory-medium is specific rather than trope. Lost-language-via-feather-texture is non-obvious procedural, never seen in prompt templates. Risk—lyric accumulation over plot—pays off when labyrinth becomes home. Could not swap mountain-bookstore for generic library; its geothermal veins are integral to closure.</comment>
