<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s loneliness-to-sovereignty arc is legible and embodied in wing-tingling and breath-sync, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky micro-choice; the hum accepts her without her having to sacrifice or misstep. The “brittle awakenings” are reiterated more than dramatized, so the turn feels foregone rather than earned. Still, the reincarnation grief anchors every beat and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost—she now commands tides alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the decisive shift from isolated guardian to sovereign archivist with atomic spectres as mentors is reweighted by the Charged Poise image of wings catching sundial gleam—cost is the perpetual solitude she accepts. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each hum thickens the density of ghost-lattices until the final cadence shifts. Causality is soft—why today breaks the cycle is unstated—but pattern coherence and tonal payoff waive the gap. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Tidal Library is evoked through kinesthetic verbs—floating, rising, receding—so the environment actively partners in every beat. Micro-setting of the brass sundial doubles as reflective interface and constraint, its molecular face literally refracting the past into present tactics. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single airborne room. Weather and shelf-tides bend to her will at the end, charging the final image without drifting into souvenir postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—threads every beat; pressure tightens as each hum offers spectral coexistence but demands she surrender total autonomy. The final stance narrows options: she gains wings and command of tides yet accepts eternal singular presence—felt cost is legible. Agency is interior attunement rather than external risk, fitting Accumulative lens. No reversal beyond acceptance, but the cadence shift from brittle to sovereign suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-as-haunting emerges through concrete returns of the hum and sundial rather than thesis statements. Subtext operates in wing-tingle and breath-sync—body knows before mind admits coexistence. Final image of atomically reflective feathers refracts the extinct into her ongoing flight, offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, but the concept of “brittle awakenings” is named once too often, slightly thinning the aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s aerial sensorium; diction of “atomically reflective,” “iridescent lattices” belongs to her scholarly lineage. Rhythm swells and ebbs with mist-tides, sentence lengths mirroring tidal inhale/exhale. No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs minimal; perception fused with motion. Psychic distance tightens from floating observer to winged sovereign without unmotivated shift. Compressed syntax under peak beat—“Isolation ends here”—reads intentional, ear-tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional noun-phrase stacking (“atomically reflective surface mirrored light down to molecular lattices”) approaches over-density but pattern is taught early and stays legible. No loops or synonym churn; “hum” and “tides” recur with purpose. One mixed metaphor—“brittle ice underfoot” in an aerial scene—slips but does not obscure causality. Clean grammar, pronouns tracked, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Reincarnated librarian of extinct winged scholars is fresh, yet the emotional engine—loneliness forged into self-rule—remains humanly ancient, earning universality. Brass sundial as quantum mirror and the library that breathes clouds are specific inventions that constrain tactics. Risk of ethereal lyric is taken and paid off in the final feather-gleam. Could swap Aelari for any lost avian culture, but the atomic-reflective mechanic and tidal stacks feel inseparable once lived in.</comment>
