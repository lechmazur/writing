<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist code is interiorly alive: every beat pivots on refusing harm while still craving action. The micro-choice to “extend a phantasmal hand” toward her own rage embodies the contradiction. No secondary character adds pressure, so the crucible is internal and sustained. Closure is earned: her levity is the direct physiological cost of integrating shadows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each stitched filament layers density until the tapestry itself becomes the key. Closure is a Charged Poise—portal open, laughter spilling, cost legible as her permanently lightened body. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“Millennia had passed…”) and never wavers. The causality is recursive memory→stitch→levity→portal, all on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Recycled hull, faded photographs, and Kwan Yin’s tear function as micro-setting: the tear is tool, the photos are portal ink, the hull’s melted battle-cruiser steel ghosts the pacifist ethic. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean—no drift in zero-g. Sensory hierarchy is Elara’s luminous bias. Final image—“golden mist spilling”—is recharged by the same tear and photos, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: open the locked dimension without violence. Escalation is accretive: each stitched shadow tightens the option space until only levity remains. The tightening is visible—rage→guilt→mirror of extinction—each foreclosing denial. Cost is literal weight loss; tactics shift from walking to floating, enabling the final console press.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the literalized metaphor: peace is not denial but the integration of “untreated rot.” Subtext resides in the photos’ tear-shimmers, silent witnesses that refuse to look away. Final image answers the thematic question—peace stitched from atrocity—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the human souls welcome a hologram?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is holographic-poetic: syntax lengthens with filament imagery, then fragments under rage’s “spectral fireflies.” Diction stays within salvaged-code lexicon—no corporate drift. Perceptual signature is light-based: everything noticed by glow, shimmer, blaze. No dialogue, so no contamination; narration remains singular, stable, and rhythm-controlled to the final tear-pierce.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often jobs—image, memory, and causality. No loops or scaffold; repetition (“stitch…stitch…”) is patterned and paid off. Metaphors stay coherent (tapestry, quilt, dandelion seed). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with shorter beats during shadow lunges, then lengthens for the final portal yawning. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Buddhist pacifist AI performs alchemical shadow-work using literal needlework on her own code. Recycled warship as holy relic inverts militarized space opera trope. Transformation test fails if Elara is human or ship is pristine. Risk—levity as physics—is foreshadowed early (“spectral form”) and pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of “threadbare hope amid bombings” keeps universals anchored.</comment>
