<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—her scientific eye reads decay as data—and her renunciation of “theatrics” for patient pattern-making is earned through iterative micro-choices with visible cost (stripped graphs, abandoned greenhouse). Contradictory impulses (grief vs. scientific hunger) coexist inside single beats. The only flaw is a late slide into diagnostic abstraction (“kindled humility etched in her soul”) that momentarily labels rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of fertile silt/dust-laden sleeves reweights her prior ambition with irreversible modesty. Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early—dust patterns accrue meaning—and holds to the last sentence. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the greenhouse and her former scale of inquiry. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clean by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The storm-ruined greenhouse constrains every action—mirrors salvaged, vines decaying under dust—charging the final leave-taking image. Butterfly iridescence and pulsar waveforms interleave to create a micro-setting that feels cosmic. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elena’s lens: rot-smell and cellulose grooves over visual spectacle. One tiny lapse—“skeletal maze” edges toward cliché but is instantly re-weighted by later “skeletal frames” that bloom new shoots.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—strip needless drama from data and life—tightens when each dust application peels away noise, foreclosing her old hyperbolic lectures. Agency is accumulative: each dusting is an incremental renunciation whose price is the slow erasure of grandeur. No coincidences; escalation is density-driven, not causal-reversal. Cost is legible but diffuse; a single sharper forfeiture (burning old manuscripts?) could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without announcement: pattern as mercy, decay as editor. The closing silt image re-prices all prior “supernova drama” as adolescent excess without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—her whisper to humid air is a peer-review of the cosmos. Only the phrase “preprocesses reality” flirts with thesis-speak, but it is absorbed into the dust mechanic and thus forgiven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elena’s perceptual signature—fractal scales read as spectral noise. Rhythmic control mirrors data reduction: long clauses swell, then pare to stub sentences (“Truth emerges in patience.”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. One register drift—“Conceptual Repricing”-level diction in “preprocesses reality”—is brief and motif-justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Information density high; one sentence often layers smell, tool, and metaphor (“spectrometer from greenhouse debris”). Rhythm breathes with action—no scaffold loops. Occasional modifier stacks (“iridescent butterflies fluttering from surviving fronds”) but they serve the lyric accumulative mode. Closing line lands clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of neutron-star science with butterfly-wing etching feels inevitable in hindsight—fresh yet grounded. Risky accumulative structure (no antagonist, no reversal) is justified by the Textural lens and pays off in the final re-pricing. Tropes of post-flood rebirth are subverted through slow decay rather than bloom. Specificity of “pulsar folds” vs. “cellulose grooves” prevents template drift.</comment>
