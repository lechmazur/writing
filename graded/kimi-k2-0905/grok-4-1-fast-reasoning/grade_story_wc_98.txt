<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s motive to “protect cultural memory” is stated early and re-iterated, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the dream-library sequence shows her observing, not choosing under conflicting impulses, so the final vow feels appended, not earned. No embodied emotion beyond lyrical labels (“heart luminous yet laced with doubt”). Micro-choice at the seed-planting beat is purely procedural; stakes rise only in summary. Closure cost is asserted (“doubt lingered luminous”) rather than paid in visible action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: the islanders wake humming lost songs, proving memory restored. Causal chain, however, is soft: seed → dream → Guardian stirred → memory fixed relies on magical logic never grounded in constraint; failure risk is declarative (“monsoon will wash us clean”) but never tightens tactics. Orientation clean by 120 words. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift at final image satisfies, yet cost is conceptual, not felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting (ridge, arbor, dream-library) supplies every beat; the levitating petals and echo-mirrors constrain observation rules that Elara must calibrate, charging the empirical-whimsical tension. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to her instruments and gaze; weather serves as live clock. Spatial choreography clean across the dream/real divide. Final image of villagers humming while petals fade re-uses setting to re-weight stake. World rules stay internally consistent once taught.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—cultural memory erasure—signaled immediately; pressure escalates only through lyrical countdown (“monsoon’s distant rumble”) rather than narrowing options. Guardian’s stirring is off-page catalyzed; Elara’s agency is interpretive, not decisive. No visible price exacted from her; success feels ornamental. Meets single meaningful tightening rule under Accumulative lens, but cost is intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-roots emerges organically from flora imagery and forgotten lullabies; no overt thesis statement. Final image of island “remembering” offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in dream-library—shadows devouring volumes—visualizes cultural loss without exposition. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity (“tomorrow’s dreams might demand checking anew”) lingers. Lyrical reprise of “luminous doubt” re-weights premise, satisfying CR form.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: calibrated, instrument-filtered diction (“petrichor promise,” “echo-mirrors that quantified the unquantifiable”). Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed clauses during seed-sprouting, longer cadence in dreamscape. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged solely on narrative texture; remains consistent. Register stays within Elara’s empirical-whimsical idiom; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm and information density: most sentences advance image or concept. Occasional ornamental stacks (“luminous petals unfurled… casting a golden haze that flickered like fireflies in doubt”) border on purple but serve tone. No scaffold loops; only minor paraphrase echo (“luminous doubt” repeated) that charges closure, hence allowed. Metaphors stay coherent within fantasy botany; no mixed vehicles. Closure line clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of empirical science fantasy with cultural-memory conservation; “reality checker” as botanist-dream-interpreter is non-obvious. Dream-library mechanics grow from earlier seed-fruit logic, avoiding late rule drops. Specificity of flora-only-when-unobserved twists quantum imagery into lived ritual. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off via resonant final image. Could not swap seed or ridge without collapsing whole conceit.</comment>
