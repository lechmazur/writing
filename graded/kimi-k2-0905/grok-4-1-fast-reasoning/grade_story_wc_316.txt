<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kai’s interiority is vivid—“emotional numbness” is dramatized through the sterile way he notes history’s rewrites without flinching; the final flood of feeling lands as credible release because the void was consistently embodied earlier. The complementary duplicate is used as an externalized second self rather than a true relationship crucible, so status/relationship bullets remain n/a; the single-POV arc still satisfies. Micro-choice hierarchy is present—he trades blood for vivification, a visible cost that forecloses his prior stoic stance. Flaw: the clone’s first words (“Not duplicate…complement”) verge on thesis-label; the beat still carries embodied shock, so only light ding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: Kai’s numbness shatters on-page when palms touch, cost paid in blood and the forever-split/shared identity. Causal lens holds throughout: because he is void, therefore he can vivify via complementary opposite; each Blade slash tightens options until only fusion remains. Orientation anchor—“floating rock dojo amid swirling temporal vortices”—arrives by line 3; no penalty. No meaningful accumulation or situational pattern, so judged under Causal default; no lens ambiguity. The price (shared existence, Collective antagonism unresolved) persists into the final image, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Floating obsidian slab, anti-grav hum, and temporal ink-bleed rewinds outside the barrier are selective, sensory, and immediately constrain stakes—time edits are lethal if the duel fails. The brain-in-jar micro-setting functions as the contested territory; its pulsing glow and label “duplicate” are re-used at climax to re-weight meaning, clearing 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp—Kai lunges, Elara repelled by wards, jar placed on levitating crystal—no impossible positions. Weather/history-as-environment evolves beat-by-beat, mirroring internal volatility without dropping into tourist-catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—own the duplicate to reclaim feeling—signaled in second paragraph and tightened when Elara’s drones project false histories meant to disqualify him. Mid-scene reversal: Kai’s bloody slice vivifies the brain, converting pretense-shattering into literal life-creation; option space collapses from “win custody” to “become dyad,” a visible trade-off. Cost is on-page: shared identity, perpetual Collective threat, and loss of singular self. Agency remains Kai’s; coincidence only complicates (history rewrites) never resolves. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no narrative loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: identity as negotiated multiplicity rather than solitary ego—“duplicate” label stripped to “complement” reweights the premise. Subtext lives in gesture: Blade slices silence, blood diffuses into nutrient fluid, emotion returns as electric laughter—no moral spelled out. Conceptual Repricing at closure: the hive-monopoly fear is validated yet survived, implying future guerrilla coexistence. Ambiguity is meaningful—dyad unity is exhilarating but also a loss of sovereign self; story resists tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, slightly elevated diction—“neural Collective, emissary of replicated minds”—yet stays within Kai’s post-void, hyper-lucid perceptual range. Perceptual signature sharp: he reads faces as “morphing into strangers,” feels anti-grav hum sync with heartbeat—specific, not generic. No dialogue contamination; what little speech exists carries subtext (Elara’s taunt, clone’s dual-toned gasp). Occasional stacked simile “ink in water” and “like a taunt” flirt with overwriting but arrive at high-pressure beats; pattern is taught early, so accepted. No head-hopping; single-POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Propulsion strong: sentences vary, openers shift, paragraphs cut cleanly; each line advances image or stakes. Minor scaffold: repeated “Pretense shattered;” the anaphora is purposeful, not loop, so only light tap. One mixed metaphor—“history flickered wildly…storms parting like clouds”—but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, clarity intact. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn. Near 9-band but for two adjacent “convulse / firing in symphonic fury” that edges purple; still readable under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Synthesis feels fresh: ego-death as prerequisite for合法 plural self, custody battle over one’s own scan, vivification by complementary opposite—ideas married through ritual sword and jar. Risky structure—lyric montage of rewriting empires—teaches pattern early and pays off when timelines stabilize at climax. Could not swap names/places: the dojo’s anti-grav and Blade of Verity are bespoke. No close genre echoes; avoids “upload clone” cliché by making affect the prize. Bold, coherent vision.</comment>
