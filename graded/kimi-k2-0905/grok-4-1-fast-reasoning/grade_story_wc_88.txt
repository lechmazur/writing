<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Jax’s interior contradiction—guilt clawing through engineered amnesia—remains vivid; the baseball functions as a concrete memory cue that forces micro-choices (descend, offer, confess). Elara’s “walking void” is shown only through the single tear; we don’t see her contradictory impulses in scene, so the empathy rekindling feels declared, not dramatized. The final stance is legible and costly: he forsakes the clean slate for a fragile shared future. Voice convergence under stress is minor but keeps this out of the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear reweights the premise—“oblivion denied, empathy possible.” Causal chain holds: baseball signature → newspaper cipher → descent → lake fork → tear. Time-travel rule is kept off-stage, avoiding late-breaking gimmick. Cost is felt in the final image (cracked leather, glowing water, shared path), satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Body, tool, and micro-setting converge: the cracked-leather baseball literally steers every descent choice; the bioluminescent lake supplies the final reflective surface that charges the tear. Spatial choreography is clean—rust-grate → tunnel fork → cavern—tracked through flashlight, drips, echo. Sensory economy favors bioluminescent pulses that mirror emotional flicker, avoiding tourist catalog. No environmental constraint alters tactics in the 8.8 way, but the baseball-as-compass is specific enough for high-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“spark empathy in Elara”—is signaled early and tightened once: the lake forces a visible test (tear or no tear). Escalation is situational; pressure coheres as each tunnel fork eliminates retreat. Cost is legible: Jax risks physical descent and emotional exposure; Elara’s tear is the on-page price. No persistent constraint shapes later tactics, keeping this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “cracked yet glowing” objects: baseball, lake, human heart. No overt thesis statements; final image reframes prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—did Chronos engineer the tear or chance?—inviting reflection. Minor sentimental tilt in “chosen light” phrase, but subtext mostly earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Jax’s perceptual signature is consistent: jaded wonder colors every noticing—“delicately robust,” “veins of light.” Syntax compresses under descent pressure; fragments mirror tunnel breath. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within plausible post-heist argot; no POV leakage or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with concrete nouns or prepositional plunges that mimic descent. One paraphrase loop (“jaded wonder” repeated three times) triggers −0.2. Mixed metaphor “clean slate smeared with ghosts” is earned by premise. No scaffold, no template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Minor typo-risk: “post her own” needs hyphen, not enough to obscure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: neural-wipe noir meets bioluminescent pastoral. Baseball-as-chrononaut object is non-obvious and keeps payoff inside character stakes. Risk taken with lyric ellipsis (how newspapers map to tunnels) pays off by closure. Could edge toward 8.8 if lake rules were exploited for one surprise tactic.</comment>
