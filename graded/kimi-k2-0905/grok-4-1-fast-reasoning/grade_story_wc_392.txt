<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—Elara’s empirical lens collides with fugitive visions—yet the “diagnostic” moment (“hallucination from fatigue, she reasoned”) flirts with label-speak. The phone-hurl earns its snap, but Marcus is only a text-cipher, so status pressure stays abstract. Lantern-as-talisman crystallizes her turn, yet Lila’s memories arrive fully formed, blunting the discovery cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands: phone sparks in puddle = visible bond-break; lantern swing reweights all prior entangled imagery. Causal lens holds: each reverberation tightens options until she acts. Cost is on-page—digital leash literally dies—so RR qualifies. One micro-lapse: the artifact’s sudden psychic upload isn’t fore-shadowed, but it pays off in the final image, waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tunnel algae, dripping cables, and rusted grate are tactile and bias-filtered; the lantern’s patina is re-checked under flashlight, turning setting into evidence. Post-drought rain keeps surfaces frictionally dangerous, guiding her grip on the ladder. Final emergence into rain-slick night mirrors internal rinse—environment charges the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break Marcus’s control—signalled by text leash; each train rumble deepens the cost of staying linked. Mid-story phone-toss narrows options irrevocably; no coincidence required. Price is visible: severed comms + soaked report risk, tightening the external conflict to match internal flight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from parallel escapes: 19C underground vs modern subway, both lit by defiant light. No moralizing—final image of lantern swinging in storm lets resonance accrue. Ambiguity lingers: investigative report is now late, authority may punish—freedom has observable cost. Subtext in graffiti over chisel marks layers temporal palimpsest without commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is forensic, clipped, yet lyrically charged—“fortified vulnerability” is repeated but earned as armor that wounds. Syntax tightens under vibration peaks; fragments mimic train-throb. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature distinct: she sees everything as evidence first, ghost second.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density—“subterranean veins pulsing with water” packs metaphor + transit body + flood risk. One template cadence around “entangled memories” (three opens in five lines) slightly drums. No mixed metaphors; rain-to-drought reversal stays consistent. Closure sentence clean: “her guide to unbreakable resolve” avoids preach by staying in physical motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing preventable-death inquiry with Underground Railroad psychometry is fresh; drought-to-flood subway as rebirth conduit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of spectral memory upload is high, but pattern is taught by lantern patina match and paid off in final swing. Not a stitched prompt-response—vision feels authoress rather than algorithmic.</comment>
