<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—clutching a fragile box while promising mastery over fire—shows, but his final “enlightenment” of Lena is told more than dramatized; the micro-choice to hand her the box is the single visible pivot. Lena’s agency is largely reactive; her vow reads as thematic echo rather than earned stance. Burn scars and porcelain cracks supply embodied emotion, yet the diagnostic self-summary “I bargained my innocence” flattens the contradiction. Relationship pressure is present but one-sided; Elias does all emotional heavy lifting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is intact—fire survivor meets fire orphan, trades box for vow—but closure lands as declarative beat (“I won’t bargain mine away angry”) rather than image with cost; no new option is foreclosed for Elias. Orientation is clear by word 60. Single-scene structure respected; celestial framing returns at end but doesn’t reweight meaning. The porcelain box is set up, handled, referenced, yet its final beat is sentimental token, not tactical object. Cost is asserted, not shown: Elias leaves ridge unchanged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge, gravel crunch, boulder huddle—selective sensory triangulation keeps white-room at bay. Porcelain box serves as micro-setting; its cracked glaze tracks across beats and final hand-off. Celestial imagery is decorative rather than pressure-bearing; stars don’t constrain tactical choices. Weather and slope remain static; no environmental turn affects outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—translate personal pain into universal—but the on-page test is only Lena’s tears quieting; no live option narrows for Elias. Pressure rises once: sob from brush shifts Elias from solitude to mentorship. No credible loss of gear, time, or stamina; box leaves his pocket but costs him nothing. Vow is emotional lift, not tactical impediment—escalation emotional but static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared burn-survivor identity emerges from mirrored backstories; subtext operates in cracked glaze and traced fissures. Final articulation “pain speaks to all” is overt thematic echo, not earned reconfiguration. Moral avoids tidy binary yet lacks fresh angle—standard fire-as-trauma motif. Porcelain motif recurs with steady meaning; no shift at end to reweight premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Close-third firefighter POV holds; perceptual signature is tactile—ember handling, hose wisdom—but diction drifts into lyric register (“celestial dance”) that feels authorial rather than Elias-born. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under breath-catching, longer coils for reflection. Dialogue minimal and natural; only Elias speaks at length, so voice distinction test waived. No head-hop or filter clutter; celestial framing is pattern-taught early and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is mostly varied; occasional “hard softness / gravelly yet warm” couples stock phrasal pairings. Overwriting Check: metaphor density peaks in celestial paragraph but pattern is taught, so only −0.2. One scaffold loop: “bargained innocence” concept restated three times without fresh angle. No mixed metaphors; spatial tracking clean. Final line achieves image resonance without syntactic sag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Mirror-structure orphan-meets-orphan is familiar; freshness lies in porcelain box as tactile burn map, yet concept stays within expected trauma-lit lane. Risk level moderate—no structural experiment. Celestial choreography is decorative overlay, not rule-change. Specificity of firefighter scar tissue and porcelain fracture elevates above generic; still, emotional trajectory is foreseeable from paragraph two.</comment>
