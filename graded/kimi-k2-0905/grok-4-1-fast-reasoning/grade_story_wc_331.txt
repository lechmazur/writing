<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza’s obsession is palpable and embodied in her tactile handling of the scarf; her quiet refusal to surrender to full immersion shows a credible, costly stance. Interiority is specific—hyperbolic arcs, pseudosphere models—never generic. The final micro-choice to shelve the pseudosphere while wearing the warmed scarf crystallizes her hierarchy of values: discovery yes, self-loss no. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc stops just short of the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the scarf half-open, the library holding its breath, Eliza’s promise etched on the desk—cost is the perpetual pull of an unfinished portal. Causality holds: scarf → geometry → portal shimmer → renunciation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten until the final crystallized image. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The scientific-poetry library is not backdrop but instrument: pseudospheres and saddle-shaped metrics are literally pulled from shelves to bend the scarf. The scarf itself becomes micro-setting—its silk resists, warms, blooms color—constraining every folding act. Patrons’ coughs and dawn’s gray light anchor time and keep the infinite horizon at human scale. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reach the place where stories live—is signaled in para 2 and sharpened by the scarf’s growing heat. One meaningful tightening: the hyperbolic warp tries to suck her in; she shelves the model, foreclosing immediate transcendence. Cost is the perpetual incompleteness she now carries. Escalation is textural—colors blooming, threads vibrating—rather than causal, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the price of analog infinity: memory resurrected through cloth and curve must be worn daily, never fully entered. The final etched arc reweights earlier motifs—scarf, geometry, solitude—without moralizing. Hyperbolic space becomes a metaphor for unfinishable art; the reader leaves tasting that asymptote. No thematic echo lines; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyric, yet disciplined: “triangles swelled beyond Euclidean restraint” stays inside a librarian-mathematician’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for warp, short clauses for renunciation. No head-hop; POV locked to Eliza. Filter verbs (“she saw flashes”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density poetry without purple drift: each metaphor (saddle-shaped metrics, pseudospherical cone) is exact tool-use, not ornament. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Sentence variation is deliberate—parallel anaphora taught early (“Patrons would browse unaware, as ever”) and paid off in closure. One register spike—“non-Euclidean fury”—but justified by storm imagery.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing hyperbolic geometry with resurrecting analog memory via a silk scarf is a fresh, specific synthesis; no template echo. The scientific-poetry library is a venue I’ve never seen in fiction. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—heightens the asymptotic longing and succeeds. Conceptual integrity absolute: the story commits to infinite curvature and refuses tidy exit.</comment>
