<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—yearning for reconciliation yet sensing its futility—is kept alive in scene, not summary; her decision to walk to the pavilion grows from that tension. Theo’s “gently persuasive” stance is shown through gesture and wine-offer, not label. The burned-letter hand-off crystallizes a credible renunciation for both: she releases the city architect, he releases Clara, each at visible cost. Micro-choices (returning the fragment, rising at dawn) foreclose paths with felt scale adequate for 700-word frame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena steps toward the sunrise carrying Theo’s reframed mismatch as personal compass; the image reweights prior stakes without tidy moral. Causal lens holds: because she misses the bus → meets Theo → parallels burn away illusion → she leaves. Orientation anchored by line 4; no penalty. One micro-turn—letter fragment switches from relic to talisman—tightens options cleanly. Cost is legible: both lovers relinquish possession of the past in the same gesture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, skeletal vines, and mulled-wine steam are filtered through Elena’s fatigue and curiosity; sensory hierarchy obeys her emotional aperture. The burned letter edge functions as micro-setting that constrains the final handshake; its brittle heat mirrors her turmoil. Spatial choreography is clean: bench, jug, lantern, threshold tracked without drift. Environment is not mere postcard—it offers refuge, then release, guiding her dawnward stride.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether mismatch is fracture or gift—tightens once: letter fragment reframes quarrel from loss to redirection. Escalation is Accumulative: sensory density (amber, clove, wind) accumulates until stance crystallization feels inevitable. Agency resides in Elena’s decision to accept mismatch and leave; Theo’s cost is already paid. Price is visible—she relinquishes fiancé, he relinquishes Clara again—sufficient for sub-800-word scope.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from concrete parallels rather than assertion: “vines that part to let sunlight kiss the earth” is image, not maxim. Subtext lives in Theo’s silence after handing over the fragment—he withholds advice, letting parallel do its work. Final image reweights “mismatch” from romantic failure to existential honesty without sermon. Ambiguity remains: we sense she may still ache, but now owns the ache as compass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Elena’s shoulder yet borrows Theo’s vineyard idiom: “lovers’ quarrel,” “vineyard sentinel,” “tamed wild seasons.” Syntax lengthens with vine-like clauses under calm, then shortens at dawn release. No head-hopping; Theo’s past is delivered in dialogue, not interior leap. Perceptual signature is consistent: city architect’s “rigid lines” versus vines’ “organic curves” stays Elena’s metaphor system.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: longer serpentine sentences inside pavilion, then clipped sunrise stride. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor pile-ups in peak beats. Information density high: single sentence often layers sensory detail, backstory hint, and emotional charge (“steam carrying notes of clove and destiny’s quiet ache”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; “mismatch” recurs but reweights each time, earning its repetitions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Destined mismatch” is familiar romantic terrain, but reframing it through vineyard agronomy and shared relic burn feels specific rather than template. Theo-as-sentinel and letter-fragment are not stock images; their pairing creates fresh symbolic economy. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure instead of dramatic breakup—but coherence justifies choice. Could edge higher if mismatch metaphor probed agricultural specificity deeper (pruning cuts, graft failure) to tighten agrarian logic.</comment>
