<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “vigorous tender” resolve is dramatized through embodied action—hoisting the clock weight, climbing last, voice threading languages—so her drive feels lived-in. Interior contradiction is hinted (gentle librarian wielding cold lead) but never pressed to a moment where tenderness actually collides with ruthlessness; the cost is choral, not personal. Still, her micro-choices (releasing the plummeting weight, stepping center-bridge) foreclose retreat and earn the bridge’s talisman status. The absence of a private stumble or visible flaw keeps her just shy of 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: starlight hush → weight drop → cable arcs → dawn bridge → polyglot summit, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the same weight that once measured clock time now measures communal time, dangling at the bridge’s apex with undeniable social cost—former enemies must now literally cross the same plank. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. The −0.6 non-closure cap applies for two small causal elisions (how crews suddenly possess planks; how language-switch actually alters bargaining leverage), but the final image reweights the premise, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prairie-constellation mingling with orrery projections is sensorily precise and filtered through Elara’s librarian gaze. The astronomical clock tower functions as micro-setting: its gears, brass binoculars, and lead weight supply the literal pulley rig that powers the bridge, so environment constrains tactics. Grain elevators evolve from “concrete silos of suspicion” to “fragile arc of unity,” a causal state-change mirrored in the physical planks. Spatial choreography stays clean: 200-yard cable, lantern glow tracking bodies, no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent harvest violence by uniting silos—is signaled early and tightens when the bridge skeleton must be finished before dawn. One meaningful deepening: shouted accusations modulate into polyphonic chorus under Elara’s literal bridge, narrowing options from separation to shared crossing. Cost is visible—weight repurposed, social credit wagered—but the escalation leans on communal euphony rather than a private, felt price for Elara herself. Agency is choral-directorial, not personal-sacrifice, keeping it south of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete inversion: a weight designed to descend now lifts a bridge, reweighting “elevate” from grain to voices. No moral is sermonized; the final multilingual cuckoo trill is image, not thesis. Subtext operates in the hush between languages, the shared breath before singing. Complexity is honored: farmers’ fears and workers’ dignity are kept in productive tension rather than false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—starlight as “borrowed,” weight “pulsing with tender vigor.” Syntax elongates during choral ascent (“English baritones joining Spanish sopranos…”) then contracts at the release (“Cheers erupted”), mirroring breath. No head-hopping; crowd voices stay external. Register stays within a librarian-poet’s lexicon; the occasional Latinate flourish (“polyphonically”) feels earned by her musical vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can stage, evoke, and advance (“she lifted the heaviest…perfect counterbalance”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is single, coherent. Rhythm modulates from long anaphoric listings to hammered monosyllables at climax. Minor scaffold: “vigorous tender” is repeated four times, a touch over-insistent, but the phrase is motif-level and charges the final image, so only −0.2. Closure line is crisp, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of orrery clock mechanics with prairie race-class tension feels idiosyncratic and inevitable: only this tower could supply a counterweight capable of yanking cable across silos. The multilingual cuckoo song is a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars rather than gimmick. Risk—turning a town-hall dispute into a literal aerial bridge—pays off without losing clarity. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing the causal engine.</comment>
