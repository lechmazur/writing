<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s wistful-pragmatic contradiction is embodied early—kneeling over the rose corpse yet pocketing the gauge—but the interior conflict is stated more than dramatized; Mira remains a silhouette of loss rather than a second pressure crucible, so the relationship shift feels charitable rather than compelled. The gauge hand-off is a clean micro-choice that scales to the length, yet the cost (giving away her talisman) is declared, not felt—no visible after-shock in Elara’s body or future tactics. Still, both characters avoid therapeutic self-diagnosis and the final pruning action is a credible, quiet renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the harbor’s moonlit surface and the oar-stroke cadence deepen the stake (“measure depth before turning the key”) until the gauge transfer reweights Mira’s options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the skiff glides shore-ward while moonlight chases shadows from Mira’s face—conceptual cost legible, no soft reset. One transition (fire-escape → dock) is cleanly anchored; Orientation Test waived because disorientation never occurs. No causal reversal is required under this lens; the final image crystallizes possibility without forcing a neat catharsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is not postcard backdrop—moon-fractured water and swaying masts constrain proximity, dictate silent approach, and supply the rhythmic cadence that paces Elara’s parable. Micro-setting (bitting gauge tooth) is handled twice, its brass teeth catching moonlight to charge the final transfer image. Spatial choreography holds: iron stairs, alley, piling, skiff—each body and prop stays tracked. Weather (winter’s frost) is implicit via the dropped petal, motivating the timeline without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to “reflect light into dark corners”—is signaled at the harbour edge and tightened once: the offer to row. Agency is low-risk (offering a boat ride) but still forecloses solitude for both; cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is accumulative: moonlight density increases, Mira’s silence thins, gauge passes—no causal chain, yet pressure coheres under the chosen lens. A higher band would require a sharper forfeiture (time, safety, or social credit) visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the gauge-tooth parable rather than declaration: measuring depths before unlocking futures. Subtext lives in gesture—Elara testing the boat knot with the same tool she later gifts, implying trust is another lock to pick. Final image of pruning dead rose canes offers quiet conceptual repricing: endings are cuttings for new growth—no moral stated. The “quivering hush” motif risks Echo penalty but remains imagistic, never translated into thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close stays pinned to Elara; no head-hop. Diction—“luminous harbor silvered like spilled mercury,” “oars crossed like patient arms”—is lyric yet consistent with a gardener who sees the world in tools and tides. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for moonlit description, clipped fragments when Mira speaks, mirroring her thread-thin voice. Dialogue is minimal but indirection is observed: “The harbor listens best at night” carries invitation, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with oar strokes; no template churn. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“moonlight silvered the waves like spilled mercury”) and pays off in final transfer scene, avoiding overwrite penalty. One paraphrase loop: “wistfully pragmatic” appears twice in close succession; minor −0.2. Pronouns, tense, and spatial order remain clean; no simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fire-escape gardener who rows moonlit parables is fresh; locksmith botany hybrid feels inevitable, not quirky. Gauge tooth re-purposed as emotional calipers is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Conceptual premise—gardening vertical rust and human hearts—could tip toward cute but stays grounded through tactile handling of tools and frost. Risk is present but moderate; no structural gimmicks that obscure clarity.</comment>
