<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theo’s compulsion to “discover what ceilings hide” is concrete, embodied in the dust-patterns he reads, the ghosts he endures, and the toolkit he wields; interiority stays tactile rather than diagnostic. The final act of lowering bones and pocketing the barrel is a credible renunciation that costs him the continued company of the ghosts, foreclosing his lone ritual. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page—he never hesitates—so the arc is linear, not layered with simultaneous conflict. Still, the observable-to-action pipeline is clean, specific, and scaled to the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore progression from dust → mainspring → grate → bones → release. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ceiling’s literal cracks and the circus’s cracked façade are repriced into exposed truth, with the ghosts’ sigh as undeniable social/emotional cost. One minor slack: the watchmaker’s backstory arrives as a compressed info-dump rather than a present-tense obstacle, but it pays off immediately in the key turn, so causality is only nicked, not broken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment is more than postcard: the warped counter, rusted grate, and ghost-worn dust spirals literally guide Theo’s choices and supply the lock that resolves the plot. The circus ticket office is compressed into a micro-setting whose every surface (ceiling mural, dust, grate) constrains access and discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is technician-biased—metallic tang of mildew, flashlight beam angle—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography stays legible across stool-climb and bone-extraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide” vs. the weightless burden of ghosts—tightens once when the dust anomalies force Theo to pry the mainspring, narrowing options from mere observation to physical breach. Cost is visible: the ghosts dissolve, taking with them Theo’s accustomed (if eerie) companionship, a felt price on the final beat. No reversal beyond the single escalation, but that deepening is meaningful and protagonist-driven. Coincidence is absent; escalation is pure agency under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: façades—ceiling paint, circus joy, elevator shafts—betray what they conceal, and the price of revelation is solitude. No explicit moralizing; the reweighted image is the empty stool and lighter night air. Subtext resides in the ghost sigh and the pocketed barrel, not in commentary. The thematic question (what hides above?) is answered by the bones, yet the emotional after-effect—lonely release—remains ambiguous enough to invite reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Theo’s technician perception: dust as wear-indicator, mainspring as seized mechanism, ghosts as “weightless burden.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—sentence fragments (“The buzz faltered. Flickered. Died.”) mimic the failing light without breaking clarity. No head-hopping; ghost interiority is implied only through gesture and moan, keeping POV modest. Distinct perceptual signature sustained through final image of pocketed barrel.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive: every sentence moves knowledge or atmosphere; no filler scaffolding. Figurative language is spare but precise (“grinning through peeling paint,” “sound like unraveling wire”) and never clusters to blur sense. No loops, no template cadence, no register drift; technician diction remains credible. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of elevator tech, ghost-whisperer, and circus disaster feels fresh; none of the tropes arrive in their expected containers. The mainspring-as-key and dust-as-footprints are small, specific inventions that would break the story if swapped for generic clues. Risk is taken in making the protagonist a passive conduit who acts only at the very end, but the causal chain justifies the delay. Emotional specificity (lonely release) rescues the premise from mere cleverness.</comment>
