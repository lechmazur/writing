<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lila’s desire to “bottle” her father’s betrayal sound is dramatized through three escalating gambits, each with visible micro-costs (cracked voice, dropped fob, public exposure). The interior contradiction—vengeance vs. inherited outlaw pragmatism—stays embodied in the cool chain, racing pulse, and final wax-whirr rather than labels. Her final renunciation of the market’s hush is earned by prior causal beats; the price is the permanent exile encoded in dawn’s “uneasy quiet.” Only slight: the “curiously steadfast” label appears once un-dramatized, but the stance is otherwise lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lattice is tight: each failed attempt escalates Thorne’s suspicion, narrows Lila’s options, and culminates in the fob-noose reveal that snaps the truce. The sunrise deadline is a persistent clock that compresses space for maneuver; the wax-cylinder payoff is foreshadowed by “capture that sound” and lands with conceptual cost—the market’s covenant is irreparably priced. Orientation is anchored by sensory triangulation within 60 words (“rotting pier,” “fish guts,” “swaying lanterns”). Closure is a Decisive Change: the recorded rupture becomes a circulating warning, re-weighting the region’s power ecology.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pier’s rot, tidal groan, and lantern sway are not backdrop but tactical cover—timbers mask footfalls, shadows hide knives, dawn tide forces evacuation. Object-as-setting: the antique fob constrains every major choice (bait, evidence, loaded heirloom). Sensory hierarchy obeys Lila’s runner DNA—she clocks barrel proofs, scent-tracks contraband routes, feels gold temperature for status jolts. Final image of dunes at sunrise re-prices the same salt air from lure to exile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the truce survive Lila’s recording gambit—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens with each false start; sunrise is a live fuse, not scenery. The third attempt’s public fob-exposure is the meaningful turn that forecloses negotiation, forces steel-draw, and produces the literal sound of trust breaking. Cost is legible: the market’s social contract is shredded, Lila’s future access forfeited, the cylinder itself a portable curse. Escalation is causal under the inferred lens: because she displays proof, therefore blades emerge, therefore truce collapses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the monetization of silence—pirates trade quiet like contraband until an artifact of betrayal becomes currency itself. Subtext operates through the fob’s chain shifting from status bling to noose to recorded evidence, never explicated. Final dune image offers resonant non-literal answer: the same wind that once carried illicit lullabies will now ferry her warning, re-weighting secrecy’s value without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—her victory may merely accelerate cyclical violence—yet the emotional after-effect is concrete: trust, once commodified, can be counterfeited out of existence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coastal-outlaw idiom is consistent and specific: “shine for your pa’s ghost,” “truce of hush,” “barrels at a stall draped in tattered Jolly Rogers.” Syntax mirrors Lila’s compressed urgency—elliptical fragments under the pier, lengthened cadence when she climbs the piling for oratory. Perceptual signature is runner-daughter: she notices lantern shadow angles, dice-glide acoustics, gold temperature before visual shine. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly character-bound, unreliable only in the self-mythologizing that her plan will “warn the wind,” a poise the final image undercuts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Compressed metaphor density is taught early (“twilight bled,” “timbers groaned like weary guardians”) and paid off when the same groan frames the recorded snap, preventing figurative clutter. Sentence rhythm accelerates across false-start triad—parataxis for failures, then stacked participles for chaos: “Gasps rippled; runners froze… fists flew.” Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances choice or atmosphere. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line re-energizes “comforting unease” by reversing it—dawn now menaces. Copy-editing clean; only micro-slips (“snuff” for “snuffed”) do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Pirate-market moonshine vengeance is familiar turf, yet the angle—recording trust’s acoustic fracture as sellable intel—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The wax cylinder as both McGuffin and conceptual repricing device transforms stock outlaw justice into media piracy centuries early. Specificity of tidal curfew, lantern-shadow choreography, and runner lineage keeps the trope from floating. Risk in lyrical compression (only ~760 words) heightens rather than dilutes stakes; closure remains legible under causal lens.</comment>
