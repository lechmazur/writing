<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory interiority—eccentric driftwood carver turned memory-thief—emerges in concrete micro-choices (pocketing the flower, pinning it to his own coat). His embodied grief under pressure, crystallized when he recognizes the Alpine echo of his own lost betrothed, earns the Earned Stasis closure. The muttered gulls and “hesitant heartbeat” lantern anchor trait; the gaps he pursues are literal blind spots that force costly mis-reading until the final reprise. Only minor backstory spillage keeps it shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught by shimmering opal veins and looping “softly persistent” refrain; closure is a Charged Poise—beam cuts fog while Elias wears the flower, reweighting isolation into communal vigil. Cost is felt in the image: perpetual sentinel duty replacing suicide. Setup anchors who/where/when within 90 words; transitions are interior memory shards, cleanly legible. No causal turns required under this lens; the cadence shift (dawn after twilight) tightens the stake once—exactly sufficient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Opal dock’s iridescent veins function as micro-setting: surface smear of seawater after the plunge literally changes traction and cues Elias’s kneeling discovery; mist and twilight narrow visual field, forcing tactile investigation. Edelweiss acts as portable alpine setting that re-weights the maritime space. Sensory economy—no tourist catalogue—filters through Elias’s keeper habit of “whispers under boots.” Final lighthouse beam refracts off dock, charging closure image. World rules hold; no physics amnesia.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the stranger’s gesture or remain locked in solipsistic grief. Escalation is textural—each surfacing borrowed memory thickens emotional density until the final pinning narrows Elias’s options to perpetual guardianship. Cost is conceptual: he forfeits the possibility of ending his own vigil. No causal antagonist required; pressure is situational isolation amplified by imprints of another man’s dying. One meaningful tightening suffices—from spectator to successor—and lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of isolation-as-bridge emerges without statement: gestures (pinning, beam-sweep) reconfigure loneliness into shared echo. Subtext in silence—salute to void, not Elias—carries the thematic freight. Final image answers the central question: isolation is not curse but medium for trans-oceanic communion. No moralizing; resonance arises from particular dried bloom and salt-stained glove. Complexity preserved: reader can’t tell if Elias is healed or conscripted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—opal shimmer equated to “frozen whispers”—remains keeper-specific and lyric without purple overload. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses mirror fog, then fragment under memory intrusion. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is internal monologue texture: “Softly persistent, Elias whispered to the sea” sustains cadence while varying syntax. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb stacks. Under peak stress compression (“He knelt… petals”) diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Information density high; single sentences twin ambience with causality (“mist curling softly persistent around his ankles” both sets scene and cues compulsive kneel). Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Occasional near-repetition of “softly persistent” is pattern-taught and pays off in closure, hence waived. Minor scaffold: “gaps yawned—missing faces” could tighten to “gaps yawned: missing faces.” Rhythm varies; paragraph cuts crisp. Proofing clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.5</question><comment>Freshest synthesis: maritime gothic meets alpine flower as mnemonic Trojan horse. Not a stock suicide tableau—gesture is pinned *before* plunge, converting Edelweiss from kitsch symbol to time-capsule weaponized by stranger. Risk of lyric overload is embraced yet controlled by dock-as-micro-setting constraint. Transformation test fails if relocated inland—specificity secured. No close famous echo; lighthouse guardianship trope is subverted when keeper becomes client of the dead.</comment>
