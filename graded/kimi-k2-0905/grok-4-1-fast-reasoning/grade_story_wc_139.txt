<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eli’s drive for “the mathematics of a fair trade” is concrete, embodied, and steers every micro-choice; the internal contradiction between honest instinct and con-artist heritage is dramatized in-scene. The ink-vapor beat liquefies scruple on the page, forcing a visible shift in tactics. Final escape success feels earned because earlier timing equations are practiced under pressure. Cost is present but compressed; a hair more embodied consequence at the breach would lift to 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the alley image reconfigures stakes—freedom bought with father’s amoral solvent. Causal lens holds throughout; each beat because/therefore links ink discovery → vapor insight → patrol math → breach. No orientation debt; “funeral home prep room” anchor arrives by line 3. The 247-second loop is the visible constraint that shapes tactics and charges the final moment; cost is the implicit erosion of Eli’s ethical rigidity, felt but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prep-room micro-setting acts as both pressure-cooker and toolkit: refrigerators tick like metronomes, embalming fluids become chemical clue, door doubles as breach vector. Stainless-table spatial choreography stays clean throughout. Sensory hierarchy obeys Eli’s con-artist eye for hidden pockets and timing. Ink pot as recurring object constrains choice and reweights at closure. Modeled arterial glow and chemical zest verge on overwrought but stay purposeful; one excess adjective keeps under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—political asylum—announced early and narrows to a single night-time breach. Escalation is causal under the lens: each patrol loop tightens the window, ink insight liquefies prior rigidity, timing equation forces precise action. No external reversals needed; knowledge gain is sufficient tightening. Price is conceptual—Eli trades ethical rigidity for passage; visible but could be more visceral. Agency remains protagonist-driven; math, not luck, opens the door.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “fair trade” emerges from concrete mechanics—equations, patrol intervals, ink that dissolves moral absolutes—rather than thesis statement. Final image reframes father’s swindle legacy as balanced equation: risk traded for freedom at the cost of Eli’s ethical ossification. Subtext in gesture (twisting the stopper, shoulder driving the bar) carries moral ambiguity without sermon. Resonant reconfiguration achieved; slight deduction for final-line commentary on “balanced truth” that edges toward echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Eli with con-artist perceptual signature: quantitative noticing, hidden-pocket reflex, chemical zest as data. Syntax tightens under pressure—sentence fragments during breach mirror pulse. No head-hop; POV distance stable. Vapor metaphor is legible and pattern-taught early. Voice distinctiveness sustains through final line; one clause (“math prevailed, fair and flawless”) nudges toward template cadence but remains within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “sheet-draped yet radiating an eerie vigor” does triple visual, symbolic, hinge work. Rhythm varies from long chemical tang sentence to staccato timing beats. No synonym loops; “mathematics of fair trade” repeats with escalating stakes so allowed. Mixed metaphors avoided. Minor scaffold: “breach by waiting actively” concept restated twice; keeps clarity intact. Closure image clean; no artifact touches final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: embalming room as tactical sandbox + vintage ink as cognitive solvent + patrol differential equations = specific heist logic. Con-artist filial redemption flipped into ethical liquefaction is non-obvious. Risk taken with compressed word-count heist pays off; closure legible. Element combination feels inevitable post-ink reveal. Tiny proximity to familiar “one last job” noir but transformed by forensic math angle. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
