<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elar’s “quiet determination” is shown only in summary (“his actions remained deliberate”); the rubble-binding beat is the single on-page micro-choice that embodies the trait, so the arc is present but thin. The interior contradiction between meek surface and defiant fire is asserted repeatedly rather than dramatized in scene, so the “meaningful change” feels forecast rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final arch lifting reweights the planet’s rule-set and the cost is the spent silk and Elar’s hidden scars. Causal chain holds—silk → binding → floating stones → stabilized orchard—but two transitions (grove → shaft → grove) are compressed into montage, so the tightening is felt more as image than as option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and azure fruit are particular, re-used, and directly supply the raw material for the climax; the mine shaft micro-setting constrains acoustics that amplify the silk’s magic, cleanly charging the final image. Sensory balance favors twilight hues and mineral dust, giving the orchard planet a memorable, non-generic skin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled early and deepened when each silk-tied stone lifts, narrowing options toward planetary salvage. The visible price (spent silk, public whispers) is present but diffuse; escalation is imagistic rather than tactical, so pressure tightens through spectacle more than through contested choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: resilience bartered from ruin via awakenings paid for by past loss. The final azure-lit arch acts as a non-literal answer, reweighting the meaning of rubble and silk alike; the ambiguity of “whispers spread” keeps the moral unsettled, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a blacksmith’s perceptual signature—forge sparks as “defiant stars,” silk hum “like distant wind.” Rhythm modulates from hushed orchard dusk to cavern-echo crescendo without head-hopping; free-indirect filter stays intact, though diction drifts toward ritual epic throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Prose is vivid but leans on ornamental pairing (“azure defiance,” “silken skies”) that thickens mid-scene; no loops or garbled metaphors, yet sentence openings repeat subject-verb cadence (“Elar…,” “Rubble…,” “Arches…”) enough to dull momentum. Information density remains high; the final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Combines floating-arch SFF trope with resource-craft alchemy (binding stone with dream-silk) to produce a fresh visual grammar; the bartered-awakening economy feels novel and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric montage over scene—but coherence holds, giving the orchard planet a singular mythic stamp.</comment>
