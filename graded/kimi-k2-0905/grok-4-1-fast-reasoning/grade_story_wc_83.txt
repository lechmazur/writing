<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Survivor trauma is anchored in concrete sensory scars and the geode relic; every micro-choice (sealing the crystal, ignoring the rebooting console) is driven by the “harvest the void” motive. Interiority stays specific—shrapnel itch, recycled air—never drifting into therapeutic self-label. The final stance crystallizes earlier motives with visible cost: she is now “sovereign of the unseen,” foreclosing any return to ordinary grief. Just shy of 9 because the groom/family remain abstract counters, not fully individuated memories that collide in-scene.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pulse, spark, and cooling breaker adds density until the vacant ten-minute window reweights possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—crystal sealed, breakers still humming—cost is the irreversible self-redefinition legible in “sovereign of the unseen.” Causality holds: the cooling timeframe literally opens the psychic space that lets her perceive the vacuum pool. Orientation is taught by the fourth sentence (floating observatory, mile-high), so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The floating observatory is more than scenery—anti-grav coils, null-grav spindle, and panoramic crater-view directly enable/constraint her hunt tactics. Micro-settings (railing, spherical void, grated floors) are handled tactilely, never catalogued. Geode acts as portable setting-fragment that phases through her palm, merging body/tool/environment. Slight discount because atmospheric null-point physics is asserted more than demonstrated through sensory consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harvest wasted vacuum energy to birth something from wedding ashes—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the 10-min blackout literally exposes the pool. Protagonist agency drives every beat: she initiates perturbation, ignores reboot, phases crystal, laughs at the spike. Cost is immediate and persistent—breakers resetting, world still crumbling, self re-configured. Stays just below 9 because the external world’s opposition is atmospheric, not embodied antagonist pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of scavenging beauty from apocalypse emerges through concrete images—ashes become power pool, ruined dress becomes hunting rags—never thesis lines. Subtext in her jagged laugh: exhilaration born of desolation, not explained. Final image reweights the geode as heart-echo, linking private grief to cosmic void without moralizing. Could be stronger if an earlier memory of groom’s voice briefly interjected to sharpen the personal stake inside the cosmic frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-sharp: Elara notices vacuum troughs, shrapnel itch, thrumming coils—never neutral exposition. Rhythms tighten under pressure—fragments like “phasing through mist-made stone” compress sensation. No head-hop; AI voice is external tool, not focalizer. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—she names perturbation theory because she literally uses it, not author showing off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variation propels: long sensory clauses collapse into staccato sparks “Sparks flew, consoles died, breakers tripped.” No loops or synonym churn; each line either advances hunt or deepens atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled—“mist-made stone” is one vivid coinage, not cascade. One stray “vacuum energy resonances” edges toward jargon, but immediately grounded by her misidentifying it as cursed relic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of drone-survivor, floating observatory, and quantum-geode energy-harvest feels fresh yet inevitable; none of the tropes arrive in expected form. The 10-minute breaker cooldown as existential window is a genuine inventive engine, not gimmick. Risk is taken and paid off: bleak exhilaration becomes lived emotional state rather than oxymoron. Slight familiarity in post-war scavenger premise keeps it from 9+ band.</comment>
