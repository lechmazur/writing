<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—wild charge vs. mentor-engrained patience—surface in embodied micro-choices (scaling the viaduct while rehearsing moon charts). The final cut costs her the comfort of reckless identity, earning credible renunciation; however, Kai’s “softly purposeful” refrain drifts into label-speak twice, muting full interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: rain-slick → firm ice →可行 crossing → lunar nadir → field collapse. Closure lands with visible cost—sparks, shuddering viaduct, awakening town—under a single, coherent lens. One scaffold loop (“patience sculpted from impatience”) repeats without new pressure; else exemplary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen lake, basalt cliffs, and rain-glazed alloy are filtered through Elara’s horizon-mappers’s bias, constraining route and timing. The viaduct’s crystalline webs and moonlit magnetic groan charge the final image, making environment protagonist-level. No micro-object recurs, but macro-setting suffices for 9- gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single stake—sever the Regime’s neural yoke—tightens as lunar nadir approaches; protagonist’s agency drives every beat. Price is legible: personal risk on ice, public exposure, irreversible act. No secondary reversal needed; escalation cleanly forecloses retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of “patience as blade” emerges through mirrored moon-path / basalt-crack imagery; no overt thesis stated. Final image—revolution’s roots delving like basalt fractures—offers resonant reconfiguration. Minor drift toward allegorical convenience in “yoke” terminology keeps it shy of 8+ band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person tight sustains flint-sharp perceptual signature; syntax glides from compressed procedural (“skates whispering”) to wind-claw tactile peaks. No head-hop; lunar math diction stays within mapper’s lexicon. One register bump: “conceptual repricing” moment veers academic; else excellent rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers action, weather, and magnetic physics without pad. Two adjacent “patience/wild” loops repeat concept sans new image—minor loop artifact. Metaphors stay coherent (ice-pane, oiled veins); no closure-line clutter. Overall propulsive, varied cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Frozen-lake heist on lunar magnetic dip feels fresh, yet “neural yoke” tropes familiar from cyber-dystopia. Specificity of horizon mapping and basalt sanctuary rescues premise from template drift. Could transplant plot with minor edits, so not fully inseparable; still, tonal synthesis is memorable.</comment>
