<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory envy of her past selves is embodied viscerally (“hot and irrational,” “savage, clawing yearning”) and drives the lucid-break mechanism; the final renunciation of jealousy lands with visible cost as she folds the scroll and shoulders the next commission. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Could nudge 9+ if the earlier selves were given one more micro-choice apiece to sharpen the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the grave flips from terminus to rebirth marker under the Accumulative/Textural lens, cost felt in the dawn-lit folding of the scroll and the literal splintering of the cabin roof. Causality holds because every uplift is triggered by the jealousy method previously seeded. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchors arrive by line 3. One of the cleanest 800-word lifts I’ve seen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting: it’s harvested, inked, clutched, and finally folded—its changing tactile state tracks the arc. Mountain ridge, creaky bunk, and frost-slivered window constrain her lucid-break ritual (the envy must crest in physical confinement). Final image of dawn creeping over the ridge reprises the setting with shifted weight. Meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map the chaos or be swallowed by it”—tightens when the grave vision turns the scroll into an existential invoice. Escalation is accumulative: each recalled self ups the envy-density until the cabin roof literally shatters. Cost is legible: she forfeits the fantasy of reunion with earlier freedoms and accepts perpetual servitude as chronicler. One hairline slip: the plunge-and-glide sequence is slightly abstract; a sensory pinch would cinch 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the chronicler’s paid labor commodifies her own wildness—grave as invoice, scroll as receipt. The final fold of the bark re-prices her life-work as ceaseless rebirth rather than terminus. Ambiguity lingers (“whose grave next?”) yet feels earned. Avoids sermon; the only near-moral is embedded in the dawn image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly Elara: resin-clung flannel, raven-quill, “jaded wonder” as self-diagnosis. Syntax warps under pressure—fragments and em-dashes mimic lucid-break fragmentation—then re-solidifies in the dawn coda. No head-hop; focalization stays locked. Diction stays within mountain-ranger lexicon; no thesaurus-itis. A masterclass in prose-as-character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temps: long sentences for nostalgia surges, staccato bursts for roof-shatter moment. Mixed metaphors are purposeful (“arrow of light”) and internally consistent. One minor scaffold: “feral nostalgia” is repeated thrice within 60 words; the third could be pruned. Otherwise zero loops, high density, clean grammar. Artifact-free at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Takes the tired “lucid dream” trope and re-roots it in manual labor: ink on birch, paid in honey, grave as timecard. Jealousy-of-past-selves as ignition switch is fresh and mechanically visible. Risk—rupturing the cabin roof mid-sentence—pays off by literalizing the psychic break. Transformation test passed: swap any detail and the story collapses.</comment>
