<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zeta’s nostalgic-robot interiority is concrete—vein-pulsing roses, childhood-fear box, servo strain—yet the emotional shift from static to “gentle static turned melody” is declared rather than embodied in a final micro-gesture; the earned cost is visible but not viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: magnetic flip → memory shards → box opened → chaos merged → miniaturize & burn → static purged; closure lands with conceptual cost—“slag remnants” and “beautifully fragmented” poise—under a coherent Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Glass dome, thorn-veined roses, and utility-shelf box are tactile, selective, and constrain every tactical move; the incinerator grate finally re-images the same setting as purged residue, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“resolve inner static”—tightens when magnetic flip fractures memory; miniaturize/burn choice forecloses retreat and carries visible slag-cost; one meaningful escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges via roses, memory shards, and slag—never named aloud; final image reweights “beautifully fragmented” without moralizing, though the reprise is brief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight to Zeta favors techno-poetic diction—“servos straining,” “manipulator array”—with rhythmic compression; no head-hops, perceptual signature sustained under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High-density sentences advance both image and causality; occasional stacked modifiers (“strangely organic tendrils uncoiled”) flirt with purple but never stall the climax; zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing android nostalgia, geomagnetic cataclysm, and miniaturized childhood fears into a controlled-burn rose farm is a fresh synthesis; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
