<comment>The oracle’s quiet monomania is credibly embodied; his “mild obsession” surfaces in tactile micro-choices—closing the booklet with deliberate care, sketching lines pulled from silence. Elara’s desperation is shown through sodden cloak and ragged breath rather than labels. Their final shared stance—map fragment clutched against night—earns a credible endurance with felt cost. Interior contradiction could be sharper: we hear his obsession but never sense a flicker of doubt that might complicate the map-making.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the map fragment crystallizes options while the last star gutters, re-weighting the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because the oracle retells via silence, therefore the map emerges and Elara leaves with tangible hope. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no penalty. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of hush & flake builds toward final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the lone star’s disappearance and the booklet’s gilded dust—both on-page.</comment>

<comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort, ambered chamber, and flaking gold leaf are vivid, selective, and filtered through oracle’s tidal sensibility. Spatial choreography is clean: alcove, arrow-slit, corner gap all track. The “marbled hush” functions as micro-setting that constrains acoustics and thus the silence-summoning method. Weather stays causally present—wind seeping through mortar becomes the oracle’s raw material.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—navigating endless night—signals early and tightens once: map or perish. Escalation is textural: each summarized silence adds a fold to the darkness, narrowing options until only the fragment remains. Agency is shared oracle/Elara yet cost is visible—star winks out, booklet sheds final gold. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: obliteration can be mapped only by listening to its own absences. Subtext lives in gesture—closing the booklet mirrors the sky’s closing eye. Final image reweights earlier motif: the flaking gold becomes stardust, map becomes portable cosmos. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the hush.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization clings to oracle’s tidal ear; perceptual signature is consistent—“pebble-shore” diction, wave-like cadence. Syntax lengthens during silence-listening, contracts at star-wink, mirroring pressure. No head-hop; Elara stays externalized appropriately. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “appeared”) avoided; immediacy intact.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for ambered hush, fragments at star-wink. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—each metaphor (amber, marble, resin) returns to mineral stillness, justifying density. No synonym churn; “hush” recurs with accruing weight. One mixed vehicle—“waves of quiet pooled”—minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography of silence carved from literal mortar gaps. Risk—mapping oblivion via absence—pays off without gimmickry. Tropes (last star, dying world) are re-cast through tactile miniaturization: gold dust = galaxies. Specificity high: “flaking gold leaf booklet” could not swap with generic diary.</comment>
