<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—compiling fragments into meaning—drives every beat, but his interiority stays reportive (“his motivation burned steady”) instead of exposing contradictory impulses under pressure. No micro-choice shows him wrestling with the valve’s risk or the visions’ toll; he simply acts, so the endurance feels cost-free. The final stance crystallizes, yet the missing inner friction keeps the arc shy of 7+.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the third blast re-weights absence into bridge, crowd lit, valve retained—cost felt in the hush after crescendo. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each interval thickens density until pattern breaks into communal catharsis. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 3). No telegraphing flaws, though the leap from private vision to mass hallucination could use one on-page constraint beat.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory selection is POV-true: Elias notices salt-veined shelves, brass hum, seaweed stink—details that serve his curatorial drive. Ivory Harbor’s slick pier and spray-mist constrain footing and timing, integrating into the trumpet ritual. The alabaster docks recur, charging the final moon-silver veil. World rules stay consistent; no spatial drift. Meets 9- gate but micro-setting (valve) could have bitten back physically to push higher.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending communal absence—signals early and tightens through each blast: first reveals survival, second confronts death, third reconfigures absence as bridge. Pressure grows by density, not causality; options narrow to whether the crowd will stay hollow or re-story themselves. Cost is visible in sobs/cheers, but Elias pays no personal price, muting the top band. One visible forfeiture (voice, memory, or valve rejection) would have punched 8+.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative trumpet notes: absence is not lacuna but connective tissue. No moralizing—final image lets moonlit spray reprice exile as communal artery. Subtext stowed in the valve’s brass waves and the mother’s shawl clutch avoids abstraction. Could reach 9- if one earlier fragment (lock of hair?) returned in the final chord to tighten the motif loop.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric-curatorial distance that matches Elias’s archival lens; diction (“salt-crusted shelves,” “evoked haze”) stays consistent and rhythmic. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Spray-triggered visions justify slight synesthetic compression (“vision bloomed for all”) without head-hop. Sentence cadence varies, climaxing in triple crescendo that mirrors trumpet intervals—tight control under pressure.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like waves: long sentence → clause break → fragment at blast moments. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds image or knowledge. Figurative language clusters only at ritual peaks where pattern is taught and paid off. One mixed metaphor (“intervals…staggered pause, breaths held as spray refreshed”) barely grazes closure, not enough to cap.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Exile-as-absence re-cast as connective sea-bridge feels fresh; trumpet valve fragment as communal psychopomp is specific, not generic magical prop. Accumulated visions rather than causal showdown risks gimmick, but payoff lands. Risk-taking in lyric communal hallucination heightens stakes without clarity loss. Could push 9- if valve’s sigils had earlier foreshadowed bridge iconography.</question>
