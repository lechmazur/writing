<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—pure art vs mortal longing—stays embodied in tidal posture and heel-on-moonstone shock; the anchoring freezes her mid-dance, dramatizing flaw. Micro-choices (reading star-gaps as syntax) emerge credibly from her dancer’s pattern-hunting instinct. Final renunciation of flight for skin-warmth carries visible cost through dissolved wings, meeting Earned Stasis threshold. Voice drifts toward abstract lyric register under peak pressure, blunting full specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: wings fold to vapor while Kai’s glowing skin locks Elara into mortal time; cost is reweighted by the spent speck and foregone sky. Causal chain holds: lunar speck → anchoring → gap-reading → reversal → flight → inscription; no teleporting props. Orientation is lyric-delayed (who/Kai unnamed until balcony) but pattern is taught early by star-syntax obsession and pays off in final skin-verse, waiving penalty. Accumulation lens dominates: density of star-gaps rewrites options rather than external plot turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Garden’s dew-moss and lunar haze function as micro-setting that physically pins her foot; moonstone speck is a tactile prop whose polish recalls ancient lapidary, constraining later choreography. Spatial track is clean: kneel → roots silver → upright twist → balcony descent. Twilight palette mirrors internal tides without overt symbolism. Final image of city roses paling under her comet-shadow recharges earlier garden palette, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver verse to mortal skin—tightens when anchoring nullifies mobility; gap-reading offers one escalating micro-turn that rewrites cosmic syntax rather than external opposition. Cost is visible: dissolving wings and permanent terrestrial anchor convert exile into irreversible choice. Agency remains internal/decisional under Accumulative lens, sufficient for 600-word scope. Pressure stays coherent but single-threaded; no second reversal beyond anchor release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of art’s need for mortal substrate emerges non-declaratively through skin-ink glowing with starfire. Subtext in star-gaps (silence as generative) counterweights nostalgia’s return, offering ambiguity: is exile abandoned or transformed? Final image of verse humming between bodies resists moral equation, inviting reader to weigh eternity vs temporality. No late thematic echo; Kai’s whispered verse back to her crystallizes reciprocal charge without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception: “milk-fire,” “tides raged within.” Syntax flexes with tidal cadence; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature distinct. Dialogue brief, natural (“Elara?”) and subtext-laden by extended forearm. Register elevation in peak beats (“comet’s sigh”) is voice-motivated, pattern-taught early, and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long sentences for drift, fragments for anchor shock. Mixed metaphors avoided; lunar/ink/star vehicles stay coherent. One paraphrase loop: “obsidian grace” thrice; minimal impact. No scaffold, no synonym churn. High density: each sentence layers image + motion + internal tide. Closure image crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tide-dancer who reads star-gaps as choreography to escape lunar anchoring, then inks cosmos on skin. Moonstone speck as both shackle and pigment feels inevitable. Risk of lyrical over-saturation embraced but controlled, heightening rather than gimmickry. Mythic registers personalized through dancer kinesthetic detail, avoiding archetype trap.</comment>
