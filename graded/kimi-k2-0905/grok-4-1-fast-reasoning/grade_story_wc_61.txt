<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elowen’s contradictory impulses—sentimental elegy vs. calculated sabotage of the loop—are palpable in her embodied handling of the gear and the throne-embedding. Micro-choice at the core (halting, embedding, retreating) visibly forecloses her prior stance of detached observation, paying the cost of perpetual vigilance. The maternal memory is concrete (“whispering prophecies that drove her clutch to madness”), not label-speak, and her form literally dimming shows embodied emotion. Only minor drift: “otherworldly sentimentalist” risks abstract label, but is re-grounded each time petals echo personal loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: gear embedded, fledgling altered, Elowen dissolving into drift—options re-cast, cost (her fade, eternal vigil) legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ping density and petal cadence tighten meaning rather than causal chains, culminating in the crystallized final image. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by second sentence (“in the nebula garden…”) and never slips. One minor scaffold: “across petals’ sigh…she pinged once more” repeats the sigh/ping dyad in adjacent closing lines (−0.2), but it lands inside the resonance, not the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The petal-throne–gear mesh literally constrains the final choice—no substitute object could serve the “soft glow” mandate. Nebula density occludes starfire, forcing sonar transit and mapping tactics; spatial choreography of pollen clouds and gas eddies is tracked cleanly through every ping return. Sensory economy favors luminous tactility over visual catalog: “brass teeth worn smooth” is touch memory, “veins of bioluminescence” fuses setting into the decisive act. Micro-setting (gear-in-throne) becomes the crucible; environment thus charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the ancestral greed-loop without burning kin—signals early and tightens when the gear’s calculations “scream eternal loops unless interrupted.” Protagonist agency drives the escalation: she transits, maps, and physically embeds the gear to reweight fate. Cost is visible in her dimming form and eternal peripheral vigil. Pressure is accumulative: each ping thickens the stakes rather than causal reversals, sufficient under Accumulative lens; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges exclusively through imagistic particulars—petal/gear/ping triad—never named as “infinity” or “cycles” in exposition. Final image of “first true fracture” in the loop offers Conceptual Repricing without sermon: serenity now laced with choosable divergence. Ambiguity lingers—patterns “might yet loop” but glow is now navigable—inviting reflection beyond plot. No late metaphors harvested; earlier “approximating infinity” in gear grooves seeds the payoff honestly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric, nebula-poetic register is stable: compressed diction “petal-sigh detritus,” sonic patterning “ping—echo,” synesthetic “whispered memories” create a distinct texture. Perceptual signature is Elowen’s: starlight-veil body notices light-capture, kin-unraveling, maternal echoes. No head-hopping; single POV maintained. Filter verbs (“felt,” “watched”) are voice-motivated, mimicking sonar feedback rhythm. Dialogue absent, so voice evaluation is solely on narrative texture—passes read-aloud ear test without drumbeat pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “gear…brass teeth worn smooth by millennia” does world, history, and object age in one phrase. Metaphor strings are sparse and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long breaths for drift, staccato for pings. One minor loop: “quiet sigh of falling petals” repeated four times; because it accumulates mantra-like pressure and re-enters the final cadence, waive artifact penalty. Clause architecture varies; no scaffold clauses. Opening and closing lines re-charge the sigh/ping motif symmetrically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cosmic botany with generational data-oracle—fresh synthesis, not stock space-fantasy. “Share light without fire” as non-didactic activism against determinism is non-obvious angle. Risk of sentimental nebula tropes is offset by tactile gear and sonar mechanics, grounding the lyric. Pattern feels inevitable in hindsight: every petal prefigures the fracturable loop. No close echoes of famous scenes; voice remains singular.</comment>
