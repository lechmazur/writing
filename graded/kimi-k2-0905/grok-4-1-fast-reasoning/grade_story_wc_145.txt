<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Harlan’s obsession and dry wit stay sharp throughout; the interior contradiction between cartographic certainty and mythic longing is alive in every micro-choice. His body reacts—pulse quickening, freeze on the glass—without therapeutic gloss. The falcon and phrasebook function as extensions of his will, so the “relationship” pressure is off-stage; still, the final stride into the white is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Flaw: “subtly confident” is asserted more than tested; no beat lets us watch confidence nearly break.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the salute toward the headwaters crystallizes converging fates and reweights all prior artifacts under an undeniable conceptual cost—map, bird, breath, editor are now indivisible. Causal lattice is tight: vellum → translation → condensation pattern each narrow options in sequence. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Lens ambiguity test is waived; the accumulative/textural design is taught early and holds. Minor cost-wobble: the plateau guardian threat is only foreshadowed, not yet paid, but the closing image makes the risk felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The rusted outpost, lake ice, and stove steam are never backdrop: corrugated walls groan under snow-load, condensation micro-maps the terrain, and the falcon’s iced feathers set the thermometer. Steam rivulets function as micro-setting that literally redraws Harlan’s course—8.8 gate met. Sensory hierarchy obeys cartographer priorities—distance, texture, line—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach the singular source—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened twice: once by the vellum warning, once when the glass starburst locks coordinates. Each tightening forfeits alternative routes; the cost is the outpost’s safety and the guardian unknown ahead. Escalation is accumulative: pattern density increases rather than causal reversals. Coincidence (condensation mimicry) complicates but does not resolve; agency remains Harlan’s to march. Visible price: he abandons the known map-margin for an unmarked ascent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge systems (maps, dialects, avian vision) converge yet refuse finality; the blank margin reclaims the editor. Subtext lives in objects—dog-eared hesitation, steam rewriting authority—never in editorial commentary. Final image answers the thematic question “Can origin be captured?” with an open salute that reprices atlases as provisional spells. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person psychic distance stays tight to Harlan’s perceptual filter; diction (“ordnance survey,” “cartographic enigmas”) belongs to his atlas tongue. Rhythm modulates: clipped clauses under ice-cracks, longer sinews when tracing myth. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture and succeeds. Purposeful elision—no guardian shown—teaches the pattern of withheld finality and is paid off in the closing salute.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is clean: sentence openings vary, no template cadence; paragraphs breathe with scene tempo. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“silver scar,” “serene predator”—never stacked. Information density high: one line can sync time, tool, and temperature. Minor scaffold: “subtly confident” appears twice without fresh embodiment; not in closure zone, so −0.3 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses three tired tropes—lonely explorer, lost tongue, secret source—yet recombines them through cartographic obsession and condensation micro-mapping, producing a singular inflection. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure; the piece commits fully and lands the resonance. Transformation test fails if names change, because the atlas editor’s professional lens is the engine. No close echoes; final salute feels inevitable yet uncited.</comment>
