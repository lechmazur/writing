<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s shift from healer to recluse is sketched in evocative shorthand, but the interior contradiction between mercy and isolation is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the scar-link moment supplies a single micro-choice that finally externalizes her flaw, earning partial credit for change with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared scar touch reconfigures both lives and the sanctuary’s rule-set, cost felt in the simultaneous exhale; causal chain is thin (child arrives by authorial fiat) but the final image reweights all prior threshold imagery, satisfying RR under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sanctuary’s cracked roof and cold iron ring are returned as tactile constraints—starlight dust on the child’s skin, ring pulsing with her breath—turning setting into a ventilator that literally enables the final shared inhale; micro-setting beats fulfill the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she re-engage mercy?”—tightens once, via the child’s suffocation; the scar bridge escalates pressure under Accumulative logic, forcing a single stance crystallization with visible physiological cost, meeting the 8.8+ price test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reciprocal healing emerges through the scar image moving from wound to airway; no moral is stated, but the final shared breath re-prices the keeper’s creed of isolation, achieving Conceptual Repricing without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to the keeper’s perceptual filter—“starlight spilled like silver dust,” “lungs expanding as if for the first time”—maintaining rhythmic control and distinct texture; no dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal cadence modulates with rising breath beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and metaphor-rich yet purposeful; occasional stacked similes risk purple drift but never obscure causality or clutter the closure beat; no loops, scaffold, or register violations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>“Healer who must learn to receive healing” is familiar, but the scar-as-airway inversion and suffocation-as-teaching conceit supply a fresh inflection; risk is moderate, specificity high, transformation evident.</comment>
