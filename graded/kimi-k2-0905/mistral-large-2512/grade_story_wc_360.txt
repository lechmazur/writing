<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with emotional mathematics is vivid, but the borrowed-personality trait stays ornamental; no micro-choice shows it altering tactics or exacting cost. The final hollowed-out state is legible, yet the causal path is blurred because the fragment dissolves without forcing him to decide anything. Interiority is textured, but the poet/mathematician voices are asserted rather than embodied in action. Still, the specificity of ink-stained fingers and the rib-barnacle image keeps him above the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the workshop darkens, equations remain unsolved, and Elias’s silence carries undeniable conceptual cost—he is emptied of the very voices he stole. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: star-extinction, ink, and fragment hum build density until the final absence reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—topaz dome, letterpress, dying sky by line 3. One causal micro-gap: the fragment’s dissolution is not tethered to Elias’s agency, but the resonance of the darkened room suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The topaz dome refracts dying starlight into liquid-gold pools that mirror Elias’s fracturing inner light; the workshop itself becomes a prism constraining perception. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: ink smell of parchment and copper precedes cosmic grandeur, grounding the metaphysical in tactile labor. Spatial choreography is clean—fragment on bench, press, woman’s silent boots—every object is within arm’s reach and charged. The vanishing stars evolve from backdrop to final extinguished lamp, reconfiguring the dome from sanctuary to void.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can emotion be mathematized without self-erasure?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when borrowed voices accelerate and the fragment’s hum invades bone; options narrow to endure or be hollowed. The woman’s warning complicates but does not resolve, satisfying coincidence guardrail. Cost is felt in the final quiet, yet the beat is more atmospheric than tactical; a hair below the 8.2 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recursion: equations meant to quantify grief instead quantify the operator’s own evacuation. The closing dark is a non-literal answer—knowledge pursued through theft of voice ends in silence, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in “stars are unremembered” reframes cosmic loss as cognitive erasure, tightening the meta-question. No thematic echo violations; the final image lets absence speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Elias’s shoulder, filtering every image through his synesthetic labor—ink smells of copper, choir hum vibrates teeth. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments, em-dashes, and rhythmic repetitions mimic the press’s clank and the fragment’s rising frequency. Borrowed voices are italicized only once each, then absorbed into free indirect discourse, keeping psychic distance controlled. No head-hop; the woman’s interiority is withheld, her coat-color tag doing all the work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “equations that mapped the weight of sorrow, the velocity of joy” compresses theme and world in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal layer. Metaphors stay coherent—predator-grin equation, rib-barnacles—without mixed vehicles. Minor elevated diction (“deliberate ambiguity was his method”) is earned by the academic POV; no artifacts touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing letterpress craft with cosmic grief-calculus feels fresh; the halo fragment reframes celestial fallout as typographical artifact. The borrowed-personality mechanic avoids cliché by turning empathy into consumable type, literalizing “transposed emotion.” Risk is high—lyric sf in under 800 words—yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic lab; the press-and-ink specifics are irreplaceable.</comment>
