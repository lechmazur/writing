<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior ache is embodied in the reed child and the trembling placement of it; the moment she offers the sculpture against the arbor crystallizes her contradictory want to belong yet remain invisible. Motivation stays consistent: every beat circles the fear of being “ungrafted,” and the final hand-shaped charcoal line externalizes that cost. The travelers function only as witnesses; no status crucible or secondary pressure tests her, so the arc is solitary but earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor absorbs the sculpture and prints her hand, making belonging materially legible with felt cost—the reed child is gone. Causality is clean under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (glass branches, silver lake, charcoal pulse) thickens the stake until the pattern breaks in her favor. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty applies. One shard, single POV, default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and liquid-silver crater are not backdrop; their reflective surfaces literally let Liora see herself as “kin” and force the final gesture. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold glass, charcoal heartbeat—mirrors her emotional narrowing. Spatial choreography stays clean: sculpture travels from hand to arbor without teleport. Environment never constrains a tactical choice enough to reach 9+, but it charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to graft onto community”—is signaled early and tightens once: the arbor’s acceptance costs the reed child. Under Accumulative lens, density of mirrored surfaces and charcoal pulse reweights the stake rather than chaining causal reversals. No antagonist or second reversal is required at this length; the single deepening suffices. Cost is visible (loss of sculpture) but not persistent; no later tactic is altered, capping entry to 8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of chosen kinship emerges through the arbor’s reflective logic rather than assertion; the final hand-line reconfigures “blood” as shared mark. Subtext lives in gesture—placing the hollow child signifies she offers absence itself. No character verbalizes the thesis, avoiding Echo penalty. Ambiguity lingers: will the root hold? Complexity is honored, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice carries a perceptual signature of glassy fragility and “luminescent ache”; syntax lengthens then fractures under pressure, matching the orchard’s brittle branches. No dialogue until beat 12; when it arrives, diction stays hushed and elliptical, distinguishing Liora’s hush from travelers’ clipped awe. No head-hopping; distance stable. Filter verbs (“she saw”) appear twice but serve reflective beat, not leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“whispers of lost languages” beside “glass-like branches”—and stay within POV lexicon. One scaffold clause (“she had come here not for the fruit…”) efficiently compresses backstory. No artifact touches closure; final line breathes. Density high; each sentence layers image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses volcanic-glass oracle with charcoal graffiti of belonging—fresh synthesis, not trope shuffle. Reed-sculptor occupation is specific and necessary to the offering beat. Risk lies in quiet lyric escalation rather than twist; coherence never sacrificed for gimmick. Could swap names and still function, so not quite 9.</comment>
