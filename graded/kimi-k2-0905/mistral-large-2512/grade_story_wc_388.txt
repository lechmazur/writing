<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s drive to “excavate truth” is declared early and re-iterated, but interiority stays at mission-statement level; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The final choice to accept the stranger’s help is causally linked to prior beats yet carries no embodied cost—he never hesitates, filters clog, or fears radiation exposure. Relationship with the stranger is pure alliance, no status friction, so the crucible test is waived. Enough motive coherence for 7-band, but the absence of a micro-choice that costs him something keeps it below 8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shredded letters → stillpoint clue → diamond lens → revelation of healing orchard. Orientation is clean by word 90; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the diamond reveals the orchard is regenerative—so a before/after exists, but the cost is purely conceptual (government lies exposed); no personal price is levied on Elias. That softens the resonance; still, the lens stays causal and the turn is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard is rendered through tactile pressure: respirator filters past prime, spongy soil swallowing boots, warm untouched circle at the end. The glowing fruit and blackened hollow tree serve as interactive props—Elias handles the nest of paper, kneels on the stillpoint soil—so environment constrains action. Micro-setting (hollow tree) doubles as archive, integrating setting with plot. Sufficient specificity and functional use for high-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove the government lied about toxicity”—is signaled early and sharpened by the warning letter. One meaningful tightening: the diamond is revealed as a lens, not loot, forcing Elias from hunter to witness. Cost is conceptual (public truth) rather than personal; no resource lost, no risk internalized. Escalation is linear but coherent under causal lens; meets length-appropriate threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth buried beneath official narrative—emerges through the orchard’s hidden regeneration rather than authorial statement. Final image of healing roots reweights earlier “wasteland” imagery without moralizing. Subtext in the shredded letters (someone wanted them found) adds irony. No late thesis statement; avoids echo penalty. Could ascend higher if Elias paid a private cost for that truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: radiation taste in mask, numb fingers, pulse quickening. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates at the boot-crunch reveal. No head-hopping; stranger’s dialogue is externally observed, maintaining distance. Voice distinctiveness stops short of 9-band because diction occasionally slips into generic thriller register (“his mind raced,” “adrenaline”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences advance knowledge or image. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“letters clutched in his gloved hand” burning—momentarily muddles tactile and thermal senses, but it does not touch closure. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“sinking,” “pieced,” “shifted”) drive momentum. Clean enough for 8-band, not flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of post-apple-orchard with eco-whistleblower intrigue feels fresh; diamond-as-lens rather than MacGuffin reconfigures trope. Government-liquidation cover-up is familiar, but the regenerative stillpoint twist re-weights it. Specific detail (glowing fruit, pulsing roots) anchors the concept in sensory novelty. Risk is moderate; execution competent but not paradigm-shifting.</comment>
