<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is textured—glass flake in boot, childhood boats—yet her contradictory impulses stay static; no new micro-choice under pressure re-weights the final “not-knowing.” The hitchhiker is gone, so relationship crucible never activates; motivation remains a lyrical constant rather than an engine that tightens. Closure cost is atmospheric, not character-internal, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rust-lace rail, pixel valley, rain applause) deepens the stake of “loading the world.” The glass flake reprise at tuck-in supplies visible cost, reconfiguring the pullout from pause to departure. One causal gap—hitchhiker’s scaffold wrap never loops back to constrain Lena’s tactics—keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain pullout is lived-in: fiddle chinrest against damp wool, salted guardrail cutting into forearm, gravel under boot heel—all filter through musician’s sensorium. The valley’s “low-res file” metaphor re-appears at mist-closure, sharpening then dissolving, directly charging the final image. Micro-setting (glass flake in velvet case) becomes the pivot object; environment thus constrains the leave/stay binary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the world finish rendering?”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each sensory coat thickens the question until rain “loads” the valley. No reversible turn or external opposition narrows options; tension is accretive, not adversarial. Cost is aesthetic/epistemic rather than visceral, adequate for length but below 8.8 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of partial revelation emerges through recurring low-res/pixel imagery without explicit statement; final “luminous disbelief” re-prices the premise that clarity must arrive. Subtext in hitchhiker’s breadcrumb invites reader to weigh trace versus proof, but theme stays slightly abstract because glass flake never endangers Lena’s safety—stakes remain contemplative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—sound of bow on damp string, scent of ether on glass—remains musician-specific. Syntax modulates: longer lyrical coils for valley gaze, staccato fragments during rain onset. No head-hop or register drift; compression in “promise half-kept” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with weather: clauses lengthen during mist, shorten when rain drums. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—every metaphor (rust-lace, pixel amnesty, applause-rain) re-enters closure, avoiding sprawl. One mixed vehicle: “pixelated amnesty” fuses tech and legal diction—acceptable within Lena’s conceptual lexicon. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing wet-plate chemistry with digital-pixel metaphor creates fresh temporal dissonance; hitchhiker’s scaffold-wrap escape map is original world-building rather than trope. Risk lies in quiet stakes—no physical peril—yet specificity of musician-sensorium keeps it from generic “wanderer epiphany.” Could swap names, but glass-flake + low-res valley pairing would still feel unique.</comment>
