<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—temple-body versus defiant will—drives every micro-choice; the thread-memories externalize conflict without therapy-speak. The final “testament” line shows earned change, but the cost is more asserted than embodied—no lingering ache or forfeiture is felt in body or voice. Still, her silence-as-shield motif remains specific and stakes scale to the lyric frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prism dims, Liora’s voice is found, and the courtyard mirror reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—“no longer just a temple, but a testament.” Causal chain holds: untangle → unlock → harvest → re-voice. Orientation is swift; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held without slippage. One minor scaffold: “the weight of her chastity a vow as heavy as the winter itself” tells what the ice and breath already show.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, prism walls, and snow function as micro-setting: the mirrored surface literalizes the stakes of self-seeing and charges the final image. Sensory selection favors reflective cold—glinting glass, starlight fracture—mirroring internal rigidity that melts only after the black thread is pulled. Spatial choreography is clean; barefoot prints track cause and effect. No occupational detail required; weather and crystal constrain choice on every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“defy the lullaby of conformity”—is signaled early and tightens through each thread-loosening beat. The prism’s echo-harvest functions as the single deepening that reweights options: once voices are gathered, silence is no longer viable. Cost is legible in the black-thread inhale and the sanctuary’s dimming light. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure escalates under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between commodified body and self-authored voice; the prism refracts both light and choice. Final image of the courtyard-as-mirror re-prices the premise: reflection now demands speech, not display. No moralizing—theme stays implicit in the echo-gathering gesture. Minor abstraction in “conformity was not a song, but a silence” slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, filtered through Liora’s perceptual bias: every glint and thread is judged by its threat or promise to her vow. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath, sustaining “between sigh and smile” cadence without monotony. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction in commentary edges academic, but it occupies only a single clause.</comment>

<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive—sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene temperature. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent: glass, mirror, temple, prism all orbit the same optic metaphor without contradiction. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. One mixed vehicle: “thread unraveled like a curse lifting” compresses two domains but clears within the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The courtesan-as-untangler trope is refreshed by memory-threads that must be understood, not cut—an inversion of the usual sword-slash liberation. Prism-echoes as stored resistance voices feels novel yet inevitable once established. Risk taken in lyric accumulation rather than causal duel pays off in the final mirror-image. Could edge higher with a sharper cultural specificity to the “lullaby” being rejected.</comment>
