<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—gloved fingers, fogged ink, tremor under pressure—but her contradictory impulses (restore trust vs. fear of weaponized speech) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible micro-choice. The final “dip into air” shows earned endurance, yet the cost feels symbolic rather than bodily or social, keeping the arc just shy of 9-band depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shattering ink-well releases the symphony, reconfiguring silence into expectant openness with conceptual cost (“she had not restored trust, not yet”). Causal chain holds—each spoken syllable escalates ink response—though the voice’s external agency slightly blurs protagonist causality, holding score below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archive is rendered through sensory compression—dead-tongue weight, rippling glass, sliding books—creating an accumulative tomb-texture. The ink-well micro-setting constrains the final act: its shattering reweights the room’s silence, satisfying the 9-band gate, but broader spatial anchors (where within archive, time of night) arrive late, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore trust by reviving truth-language—tightens when each spoken fragment visibly escalates ink reactivity, narrowing options to the final promise. Cost is legible (archive tremors, glass rupture), yet the external voice absolves some protagonist accountability, keeping escalation strong but not irreversibly personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as covenant weapon, silence as colonial cover-up. The ending’s “expectant” quiet reweights the premise without moralizing; no thematic echo pollutes the final line. Ambiguity lingers—truth may again wound—giving the resonance needed for 9-band, minus a hairline for symbolic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter: breath fog, iridescent shimmer, “carefully reckless” idiom. Syntax lengthens then fractures under pressure, mirroring the unfolding symphony. No head-hop or register drift; the archaic voice feels owned, not borrowed, meeting the 9-band test with microscopic margin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “unsnared the first tangled thread of syntax” does triple duty—tactile, intellectual, sonic. One mixed metaphor (“ink…rippling like water” inside glass) and a paraphrase loop on “silence” slightly dull the peak beat, preventing full 9.0, but rhythm and information density remain exemplary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Extinct-language-archive trope is refreshed by treating grammar as living chemistry: equations that bite back. The “symphony of truth” concept re-prices language from communication to covenant weapon, a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present; slight safety in keeping the external voice unnamed holds it below 9.0.</comment>
