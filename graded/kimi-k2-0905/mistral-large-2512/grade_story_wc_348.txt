<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lina’s regret is palpable, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“she had come here to atone”) rather than embodied contradiction. The foam insight is sharp, yet the turn from chemist-control to river-flexibility feels announced, not dramatized in a micro-choice that costs her something right there. The sister memory supplies motive but no on-page relationship pressure, so the arc lands as introspective summary rather than crucible-tested change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is cleanly legible: she decides to design self-healing polymers and re-enter life—Conceptual Repricing with professional and emotional cost signaled by “grief loosen its grip.” Causal lens holds: foam pattern → insight → notebook sketch → plan. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The sister thread remains off-stage, so the personal stake’s cost is abstract, capping the resonance below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ravine, moss, river foam, and chrysalis are tactile, selective, and filtered through polymer-scientist perception. The braided channel literally constrains her physical path and metaphorically maps her new design logic, charging the final image. Weather and season stay implicit, keeping economy. Spatial choreography is secure; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem her life’s work and reconnect—surfaces early. Pressure tightens once: foam insight reframes her rigid polymer dogma, foreclosing the old research path. The beat is intellectual, not externalized; no tangible resource or relationship is risked on the page, so the cost is felt but not dramatized. Sufficient for a single meaningful tightening at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence-as-strength emerges organically from foam patterns and chrysalis husk, never sermonized. The river’s “symphony of fluid motion” reconfigures her scientific worldview without moralizing. Sister estrangement adds personal layer but stays off-stage, slightly thinning resonance. Final image of the ravine as “map” offers quiet, earned re-framing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lina’s perceptual lens—polymer jargon, tactile earth, foam geometry. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at insight: “But what if she had been wrong?”—effective modulation. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Occasional elevated diction (“cacophony of regrets”) nudges above scientist idiom but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, rhythmic, largely free of scaffold or metaphor clutter. Mixed metaphors (“braided ravine stretched like a scar… whispering of ancient fractures”) are vivid and coherent. No paraphrase loops; information density high. One filter-verb cluster (“she thought… she remembered… she had treated”) mid-story slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Scientist-seeks-redemption-through-nature is familiar terrain; freshness comes from polymer chemist reading river foam as self-healing blueprint—specific, credible expertise. Chrysalis-as-metaphor risks cliché but is saved by tactile handling and linkage to lab notebook. Risk level moderate; no structural experimentation. Synthesis feels personal rather than template, but not startlingly new.</comment>
