<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and curiosity read concretely through weekly ritual and the pocketed seal; the contradiction between solitude and need for connection is quietly embodied. Mira’s “patiently nimble” interrogation is shown only once, not sustained across beats, so the trait never alters tactics on-page. The final shared resolve lands as credible renunciation of the lie, but the cost is stated rather than felt in gesture or consequence. Interiority stays specific, yet the emotional crescendo is slightly under-cooked—no bodily register of the “weight lifting.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: seal discovery → rooftop habit → Mira’s appearance → mutual recognition → decision to listen. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s “hum” is re-weighted from private grief to shared legacy, cost legible in the word “finally.” Orientation is anchored within 120 words; rooftop, night, meteor shower all cue early. One minor causality gap: Mira’s identical seal feels convenient, but the text retrofits it as paternal inheritance, preserving credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rooftop garden is sketched with sensory economy—whisper of meteors, scent of herbs—filtered through Elara’s memorial purpose. The embroidered shawl and worn brass seal provide micro-setting that constrains her grip and memory. Spatial choreography is clear: bench, bowl exchange, bodies beside parapet. While the broader city remains a silhouette, the meteor shower functions as dynamic ceiling that times the recognition beat; environment is not just backdrop but clock for the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep the language private—is signaled early via hidden seal. Mid-story tightening occurs when Mira spots the seal, forcing exposure; options narrow from solitary remembrance to collaborative legacy. Cost is present but light: the shared secret ends Elara’s monopoly on grief, yet no tangible loss (time, safety, object) is dramatized. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; coincidence of twin seals is allowed to complicate, not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited knowledge versus agreed silence emerges through object and ritual rather than exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: the returned sugar bowl equals an unspoken request for truth. Final image—“let’s listen”—offers resonant, non-moralizing pivot from mourning to stewardship. The meteor shower as fleeting script subtly mirrors the endangered language, reinforcing theme without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly aligned to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Diction—“language of stone and mortar,” “dust of the stars”—creates distinct texture without purple drift. Dialogue is spare, idiomatic, and carries subtext (Mira’s “Why do you come up here?” is gentle probe, not curiosity). Psychic distance modulates nicely: wide for meteors, tight for seal reveal, maintaining immediacy.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary in length to match emotional breath. No paraphrase loops or filler stacks. Figurative language is selective—meteor trails as “fleeting silver”—and stays coherent. One minor scaffold: “she had come here every week since his passing” could compress, but it does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “buildings speak” conceit revitalizes the trope of lost languages by literalizing architecture as archive. Twin-seal reveal risks gimmick yet is saved by paternal backstory that reframes prior secrecy. Emotional specificity—grief worked through horticultural ritual—keeps concept grounded. While not radically avant-garde, the synthesis feels fresh and memorable within flash length.</comment>
