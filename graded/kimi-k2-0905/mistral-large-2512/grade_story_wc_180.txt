<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the ribbon while preaching release—are dramatized in the quiet offer of the peach; the girl’s matching ribbon turns memory into mutual recognition, paying the cost of shared loss without therapy-speak. Interiority stays concrete (“juice sweet on her tongue” as closure). The -0.3 keeps it under 9 because the girl’s feistiness is asserted more than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the repaired fracture and shared peach reweight the premise—safety is internal, not artifactual—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the orchard’s density of blossom and vow-shedding literalizes the cost. Causality is lyric but legible: because Liora mends and speaks, the girl can offer fruit that tastes of persistence. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is not backdrop; its low branch supplies the girl’s perch and the peach that finalizes the reconfiguration. Micro-setting (quartz pendant, resin, silver wire) constrains the literal repair and metaphoric transfer. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—dappled light, damp earth under boots—never touristic. One hairline slip: “skeletal rafters” appears twice in close proximity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep a child safe after vows fail—tightens when the girl presents the cracked pendant; the micro-choice to use iron-smelling resin and silver wire forecloses the option of perfect restoration, making safety a matter of persistence, not magic. Cost is visible in the scarred quartz and the juice that replaces blood-iron taste. One beat suffices for this length; no coincidence intrudes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the deciduous vows image and the peach gift: promises shed, but fruit remains. No final-paragraph thesis; the last line lets sweetness stand as non-literal answer. Subtext in the matching ribbons implies generational relay without stating it. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide if “already safe” is comfort or consolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter—pollen-dust, iron-resin smell, ribbon-twist—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during repair: controlled modulation. No dialogue tags clutter; girl’s diction (“You’re the mender”) is sharp, distinct from Liora’s interior cadence. One filter verb cluster (“she thought”) is voice-motivated elision and allowed.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “vaulted ceiling had long since surrendered” carries both history and botanic victory in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—vows “deciduous,” juice replacing blood—without purple overload. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<comment>Cathedral-orchard vow-shedding is a fresh synthesis; the quartz-eye mender who binds cracks with silver and resin turns fantasy trope into lived craft. Risk—quiet repair instead of spectacle—pays off in the peach moment. Specificity (“peach blossoms and the weight of time”) prevents generic eco-fable. Transformation test fails if moved to generic garden; setting is irreplaceable.</comment>
