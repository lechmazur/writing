<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s need to “understand the shape of home” is visceral and consistent, driving every beat; the contradictory pull between clinging to memory and surrendering to the stone is shown through bodily sensation rather than label-speak. Interiority is concrete—mercury in veins, feather barbs pricking palm—but the final shift into collective “buried talents” is asserted more than dramatized, blunting the cost of his personal change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the feather dissolves, the labyrinth reconfigures, and home becomes a shape to carve rather than find—cost is felt in the irreversible loss of the feather-guide. Causal chain holds: feather → journal map → descent → stone → dissolution → reconfiguration. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“mountain loomed… shelves of books”) and waiver applies; pattern pays off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore fusion is immediately sensory—“shelves of books that spiraled upward in impossible geometry”—and constrains action: shelves become tunnels, air thickens, stone nestles in roots. Selective detail (damp earth, ink smell, mercury sheen) filters through Elias’s perceptual priorities; the feather’s texture functions as micro-setting that guides the final choice. Environment actively reshapes in response to the climax, reweighting the meaning of “home.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the buried language of self/home—tightens when the journal reveals intentional burial, narrowing options to descent or perpetual exile. One meaningful escalation: feather-map proves the stone is hidden by design, forcing Elias into the descent where reality frays. Cost is legible: feather lost, identity diffused into collective talents. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular of a man trading his singular guide for communal memory: “home wasn’t a place to return to, but a shape to carve.” Subtext operates in gesture—pressing feather to wrist, dissolution into light—without final-paragraph moralizing. Final image reweights prior material: thunder is not hidden but waiting to be named, inviting reflection on who gets to speak the lost language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—mercury taste, tooth-ache language, texture-divining—and modulates rhythm: longer clauses while reading, staccato fragments during descent. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Diction stays within his arcane-tinged lexicon; non-standard grammar is absent, so no deviation penalties apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but disciplined: “stone… humming with a language that made his teeth ache” does double sensory duty. Occasional poetic overlap—“thread pulling taut between his ribs” beside “knots in his memory”—slight over-cranking, yet never muddles causality or dulls the final image. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of bibliophile labyrinth with mercury-blooded seer feels fresh; the buried-language stone refracts collective amnesia rather than generic MacGuffin. Risky geometry of impossible shelves pays off when the mountain literally reconfigures at the end. While “memory-as-home” is familiar, the tactile feather-map and communal burial angle transform the trope into a singular vision.</comment>
