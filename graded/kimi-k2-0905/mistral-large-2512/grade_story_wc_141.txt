<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s skepticism is cleanly established and his shift to listening is dramatized through the cello bow, not speech. Interiority stays concrete (“gasping,” “breath hitched”) and the final renunciation costs him his lifelong debunking identity. The only drag is the fisherman’s remembered line acting as external prompt rather than self-discovered contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the last cello note re-weights all prior sound imagery and forecloses the debunking path with felt cost (“this wasn’t the end… it was the beginning”). Causal chain—shell → hum → vision → cello → choice—holds without gaps; orientation is swift (who/where by line 3). Minor slack: the fisherman’s prior advice is retro-injected rather than earned in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Observatory is tactile—peeling murals, salt wind through broken panes—and the unplayed cello functions as micro-setting that finally constrains the choice to play. Spatial track stays coherent across the single continuous scene. While cliff and tide are sketched more than felt, the cracked dome and echoing instrument supply enough environmental pressure to satisfy the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“disprove or accept the Compass”—tightens when the shell’s first vision proves the device real, forcing Elias either to abandon his life’s work or keep listening. Playing the cello is the visible, irreversible act that escalates commitment and carries the price of professional self-nullification. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—myth vs. lived resonance—emerges through sound imagery rather than assertion; the final line lets the ocean’s absence reweight meaning without moralizing. Subtext in the astronomer’s “universe hums” line seeds the concept early and pays off in the closing note. Avoids tidy thesis while still offering a charged conceptual reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; sensory selection skews auditory, matching his growing attunement. Syntax lengthens under wonder, then fractures during transitions (“suddenly, he wasn’t…”), mirroring temporal slippage. No head-hopping; diction remains within his educated but non-academic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-driven; figurative language appears sparingly and only when it advances atmosphere (“like a forgotten thought”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentences vary in length to control tempo around the cello beats. One mixed metaphor—“pages are closing” literalized—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “skeptic meets real magic” arc by making the compass a method (listening) rather than an object, and by weaponizing an unplayed cello as time-tuner. Specificity of the painted shell and half-finished instrument keeps the concept from feeling generic. Risk in the sound-based structure heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
