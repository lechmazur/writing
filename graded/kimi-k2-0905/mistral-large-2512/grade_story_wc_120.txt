<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is textured—breath on glass, shell warmth—but her contradictory impulses stay summary-level (“she had laughed then, bitter and sharp” vs. present silence). The final stance crystallizes (pressed shell, cracked horizon) yet the causal chain from cookie slips to this moment is asserted, not dramatized; cost is felt but lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the horizon “cracked just a little” by remembered sound-conducting, cost legible in her exhausted vigil. Accumulative lens holds—each memory shard adds density until the mirror fractures—but the cookie aphorisms function as off-page catalyst; tighter causal stitching would sharpen the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus ridges are sensuously handled and return to refract dawn light onto the final image; the shell-as-micro-setting constrains her tactile choice and charges the crack. Early spatial anchors arrive by line 5; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can memory crack the mirrored trap?—is signaled early; pressure deepens via each recovered memory until the horizon fissures. Escalation is textural, not causal, but the tightening is unmistakable: silence becomes unbearable, then breaks. A visible price (exhaustion, shell relinquished to cold glass) is present but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—time as reflective prison broken by listening to internal silence—emerges through image pattern (mirror, shell, unheard symphony) rather than statement. Final crack reweights the premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers whether the break is escape or deeper entrapment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter: breath-fog, prism fracture, spiral ridges. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at the crack; no head-hop. Cookie slips retain distinct aphoristic register without invading narrative voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; figurative layering (molten glass, mirrored horizon) stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “had”-heavy pluperfect blocks in memory paragraphs slow propulsion; no loops or mixed metaphors in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusing fortune-cookie oracle with symphonic silence inside a glass-spire ice-scape feels fresh; the accumulative memory-mosaic structure is apt. Risk is moderate—lyric stasis could sag—but the final crack converts pattern into event. Could push further into sonic or architectural specificity for higher band.</comment>
