<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for wholiless while fleeing his doubles—is shown through embodied micro-choices (palm to tablet, letting go of the door). The final renunciation costs him the labyrinth’s certainty, earning a credible shift. Yet the older-scarred self speaks in abstract thesis (“You can’t conquer the labyrinth”), muting pressure. Still, motives stay legible and the refusal lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias releases the door, collapsing timelines; the rain-soaked viaduct re-anchors him with quieter whispers—cost is the surrender of omniscient possibility. Causal lens holds: each beat (tablet touch, door offer, release) links because/therefore. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One minor soft beat: the tablet’s rule-set is learned mostly through effect rather than early setup, but payoff justifies the delay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct, ozone air, and mud-slick stones are filtered through Elias’s disorientation, guiding his attention and later mirroring his re-grounding. The tablet’s shifting runes serve as micro-setting that literally rewrites possibility. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the dissolve and return. Environment never merely decorates; it constrains when to touch, when to let go.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-definition versus multiplicity—tightens when the older self demands Elias choose who walks out. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal, but it meaningfully narrows options: kill, merge, or relinquish. Agency sits in relinquishment, priced by the infinite selves he abandons. Cost is legible in the rain-soaked silence that replaces prior noise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: identity is not a puzzle to solve but a limitation one must accept. The tablet, door, and labyrinth reweight this idea without moralizing. Final image of quiet rain avoids thesis, offering felt reconfiguration. Ambiguity lingers—whispers dim, not gone—preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature leans on synesthetic cues (ozone, glass-snap) that feel personal. Syntax modulates: longer clauses for dissolving timelines, clipped fragments at release. No dialogue beyond the older self’s two lines; those carry menace but remain generic enough to slightly flatten distinction. Voice stays coherent across speculative folds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective (“world snapped like breaking glass”) and never muddies causality. One mixed register moment—“procedural generation, not of code, but of time”—leans meta, yet the phrase is brief and pattern-taught by prior surreal logic. Closure beat stays clear and unpolluted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “fractured timelines as labyrinth” conceit refreshes chosen-one tropes by making escape equal to relinquishing omniscience. Specific sensory grounding (wet stone, ozone) keeps the conceit from abstraction. Risk is moderate—recursive selves are familiar—but the thematic reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight. Not earth-shatteringly new, but executed with conviction and detail.</comment>
