<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s want-to-mend motive is concrete and returns at every beat; the mirrors force micro-choices that reveal hierarchy-of-values. Interiority stays sensory (“metallic whispers,” “gears hummed”) rather than diagnostic. Final “bridge” self-definition is earned by causal chain, but emotional contradiction is muted—no moment where repair-urge collides with fear of becoming the clockmaker—so the arc feels single-note rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias assumes custodianship of a living mechanism, cost legible in the flicker that shows the clockmaker’s scattered consciousness. Causal lens holds: each beat (oil uncap, kneel, gear placement) is a because/therefore step. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the prophecy scraps act as off-page shortcut for the machine’s cosmic scale—slight motivational leap, not quite a break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ice-and-glass library is filtered through locksmith’s tactile bias—frost on parchment, gear weight in palm—so detail never stalls momentum. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the mirrored floor literally guides gear placement, constraining the climactic arrangement. “Hauntingly bright” reappears at closure, recharging the image. Spatial choreography across mirrors and bench is trackable; no impossible jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore temporal engine or leave world gearless—is signaled early and tightens when mirrors reveal the clockmaker’s entrapment. One meaningful deepening: the gears’ hum shifts from curiosity to custodial burden. Cost is present (Elias forfeits ordinary life-path shown in child-reflection), but pressure plateaus after the kneel; no second fork where failure feels imminent. Sufficient for length, yet short of the visceral price that would punch 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “repair as remembrance” emerges through image pattern—gears, mirrors, driftwood nostalgia—without moralizing. Final reconfiguration reweights “rhythm of repair” from personal skill to inherited responsibility, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers: will Elias someday scatter like the clockmaker? Subtext operates in silence when Elias avoids his older reflection, implying dread of full circle. One decorative echo: “driftwood nostalgia” is lovely but never tied to a concrete memory, slightly diluting specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—sound of frost, metallic taste of oil—and modulates rhythm: long clauses for wonder, staccato for gear clicks. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Diction remains within locksmith lexicon; “vial,” “teeth,” “bridge” carry double duty. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” notion feels academic for the lyric texture, but it surfaces only in final sentence and reads as conscious elevation rather than lapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is selective—mirrors “windows into possibilities,” oil “captured sunlight”—and drops away during high-pressure gear placement to keep causality clear. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances placement or knowledge. Minor scaffold: “gears began to turn / Not all at once, but slowly” could compress to one clause, but the pause mirrors mechanical lag and thus earns its breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frozen cloud-library plus mirror-forge is fresh synthesis; clockmaker-soul-in-gears avoids steampunk cliché by lyric compression. Risk lies in accumulative lyric structure rather than twist, and closure justifies the pattern. Driftwood nostalgia motif is original yet under-exploited—never weaponized against Elias—so ingenuity stops just short of explosive. Still, the piece feels singular, not stitched from prompt parts.</comment>
