<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-anchored vocation and retro-visions give him texture, but the interiority leans on abstract labels (“shard of hush,” “prove coincidences”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final laugh and walk-off register as release, yet no micro-choice on the page visibly costs him anything or forecloses an alternative path—he simply exits. The prism quiets thought, but this passive effect never forces an active decision that reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Motivation is declared, not dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the horizon flicker re-weights the premise from “last light is dead” to “light is waiting,” and Elias’s solitary walk carries the conceptual cost of abandoning the only home he still tends. Causal chain is thin—prism → momentary refraction → distant pulse—but the accumulative pattern of star-charting and memory-visions supports the final shift under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass pavilion’s wind-song and salt-crusted panes are filtered through Elias’s custodial reflexes—lighting lanterns “to remind the stars” anchors place, body, and purpose in one motion. The broken prism’s tactile danger (sharp enough to draw blood) and light-splitting effect constrain the climactic gesture on the platform, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is spare but coherent: table → coat → platform → horizon. Weather and alkali scent serve as immediate pressure, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle the idea of light”—is signaled early; the horizon flicker supplies one decisive intensification that reweights options from futility to possibility. Pressure is largely atmospheric rather than tactical; no credible loss (time, blood, shelter) alters his method. The prism’s hush complicates interiority but never blocks or enables a specific action that forecloses a path. Escalation is present but gentle; cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the human need to impute pattern onto ruin, to keep watching even when no one watches back. The prism’s silence and the pavilion’s song form a quiet dialectic of absence and persistence; the final gold pulse answers with possibility, not certainty. No character sermonizes the moral; meaning stays lodged in image. Ambiguity is purposeful—coincidence may be real or self-willed—but the emotional aftereffect lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s diction—“shard of hush,” “taste of old rain”—creating a perceptual signature that is elegiac, slightly archaic, yet precise. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for memory, staccato for the climb and final laugh. No dialogue, so voice convergence is moot. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory detail is immediate. The wind-scraped glass song becomes a refrain that mirrors his internal drone without overt statement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences carry double duty (“its edges still sharp enough to draw blood if he wasn’t careful” reveals object danger and custodial caution). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“light fractured into a dozen tiny suns”—is minor. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases with forward motion. Minor elevated diction (“alkali crust,” “retro-cognitively”) fits the custodian’s bookish solitude.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Post-collapse beacon custodian is familiar SF stock, yet the prism-as-hush and glass pavilion that sings with wind feel specific and sensorially fresh. Star-path tracking as a form of retro-cognitive archaeology offers a non-obvious synthesis of mysticism and astronomy. The ending’s refusal to confirm whether the flicker is real or wish-fulfillment avoids tidy catharsis. Risk is moderate—lyric stillness over plot pyrotechnics—but coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
