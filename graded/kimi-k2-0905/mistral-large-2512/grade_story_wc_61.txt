<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—sentimental preservation vs. generational rupture—are dramatized in the gear-press micro-choice; the final renunciation of fire costs him Kael’s immediate allegiance and is legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“teeth biting into his skin”) and avoids label-speak. The single-scene crucible with Kael forces a visible shift in their status dynamic: weapons down, silence up. Missing only a hairline deeper glimpse of what “light without fire” personally costs Elias beyond the grandson’s glare.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nebula’s lingering light reconfigures the cycle without guaranteeing victory; cost is the powered-down warship and Kael’s wordless swallow. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore linked to the gear activation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“viewport”) and never breaks. One persistent constraint remains: the gear is now spent/still, a price that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The nebula-garden is not postcard scenery; its petals physically respond to sonar pings, constraining Elias’s tactic and charging the final image with remembered light. Micro-setting of the brass gear likewise constrains skin and console. Sensory selection stays urgent—only violet/gold, teeth-bite, engine hum—filtered through Elias’s sentimental gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: gear pressed, ship powers down, petals close.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break the generational cycle of fire—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s weapons flicker out; the price is Elias’s vulnerability (unarmed, drifting). One meaningful reversal: hostile ship → neutralized witness. Escalation is causal under the lens: each gear rotation increases petal response and narrows Kael’s options until fire is foreclosed. Cost is visible on-page: Kael’s ship dark, Elias’s gear still.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete image-set of fire vs. light; no character sermonizes the moral. Subtext lives in Kael’s silence after “You’re insane”—wonder edges out rage. Final image of lingering nebula-light reweights the premise: transmission may outlast conquest. One hairline slip: “cycle wasn’t broken” edges toward explicit thesis, but is saved by the immediate sensory follow-up of the last sonar ping.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias with perceptual signature—petals “shiver like wind-touched leaves,” a simile only a sentimentalist would choose. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for memory, staccato pings for tension. No head-hopping; Kael’s interior accessed only via audible silence. Compression (“He had watched empires…”) is taught early and paid off in the final blur of gold streaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—one simile per beat, never stacked. Information density high: “brass teeth spinning… approximated infinity” does world-building, stakes, and sensory work in one line. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor hedge “just enough to remind” could be cut, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “quantify the unquantifiable” relic-currency and light-without-fire transmission feel fresh, not trope-checklist. Risky choice to resolve conflict via nebula empathy rather than blast-out pays off because the garden’s responsiveness is seeded early. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic space battle—petal-memory is irreplaceable. One fresh inflection: sonar-as-heartbeat turns surveillance into courtship.</comment>
