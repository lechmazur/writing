<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays in one emotional register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned in-scene. Micro-choices are missing: he folds, exhales, releases—each is calm, none narrows or costs. The prophecy-as-wound idea is evocative yet never tested against an alternative action, keeping motivation static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the paper dissolves, silence is re-weighted, cost is the loss of coded certainty—felt in the final “darkest light” image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of quiet intensifies, then the bleed of ink breaks it, reconfiguring meaning. One causality gap: the prophecy’s content is withheld, so the stakes’ narrowing is abstract, not concrete; still, the lyric design lets the dissolve carry weight.</comment>

<comment>Brook, damp earth, and origami form a tight micro-setting that constrains the final gesture—water must be present for the dissolve. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and coolness, mirroring internal calm without over-symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → place → release → walk away. Nighttime “nocturnal haven” is generic, but selective detail keeps it from white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quiet the prophecy—signals early; pressure is the fear that words still echo. Escalation is textural: silence deepens, paper darkens, but no new external or internal obstacle complicates the choice; options do not visibly narrow. Cost is present yet diffuse—loss of the parchment—rather than a tactical forfeiture that alters next moves. Sufficient for short lyric mode but not sharpened to a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as silence > prophecy: knowledge wounds, release heals. Subtext operates through the paper’s darkening rather than statement; final “darkest light” reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids tidy closure by leaving the prophecy’s text unknown, preserving ambiguity. No recurrent image shifts meaning—crane wing simply leaves—so resonance is single-note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to summoner’s perceptual filter: pulse, breath, earth-hum. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic hush; diction stays within plausible contemplative lexicon. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. One minor drift: “terrestrially cosmic” edges toward abstract thesis, but occurs only once and is quickly grounded in knee-against-soil.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, sentences vary, no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“smoothed hush,” “dying-fire breath”) and pays off in final star image. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. One scaffold: “not a warning, but a wound” is immediately restated; could compress. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and closure-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Folding a coded prophecy into a crane and dissolving it in brook-silence offers a fresh ritual; avoids stock fantasy summoner tropes. Conceptual risk—quiet as active magic—commits fully and follows to star-metaphor end. Specificity of parchment warmed by remembered words lifts the device above mere symbol. Could push further if the code’s content or cultural context were hinted.</comment>
