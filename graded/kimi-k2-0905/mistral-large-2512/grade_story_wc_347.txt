<comment>Mira’s reluctant guardianship is viscerally embodied—her fingers brushing the withered bark, the stone of guilt in her chest—yet the interior contradiction between contempt for the lost and the curse’s demand for balance stays mostly asserted. The decisive micro-choice (scattering the nuts rather than guiding by touch) crystallizes her values, but the beat lands late; earlier beats show endurance more than active hierarchy. Still, the cost of another night’s survival is felt in the frost-silvered, inedible fruit, earning a credible renunciation.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: nut-map discovery → blueprint correlation → silent breadcrumb tactic → traveler spared → curse held for one more night. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80; cliff-edge orchard, mechanical birds, and frost deadline are legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s burden persists, but Mira’s tactic has re-priced her role from hands-on savior to invisible sign-post, cost visible in the final image of uneaten fruit under frost.</comment>

<comment>Environment is never backdrop: the cliff’s stone cracks determine root-growth, the frost clock forces hurried scattering, the brass birds’ shadows dictate stealth. The warm nut-as-micro-setting literally rewrites navigable space. Selective sensory filtering—damp soil, dying light, shriek of wings—keeps detail urgent and POV-bound. One minor spatial drift: the man “stumbles into view” yet Mira remains kneeling; relative distance unclear for half a beat.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—spare one life before frost—signals early and tightens with each patrol pass. The meaningful turn is Mira’s shift from direct intervention to trace-less guidance, narrowing her future options (she can no longer claim ignorance). Cost is legible: another stranger lives, but the orchard’s hunger and her guilt remain, guaranteeing tomorrow’s repeat. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of indirect responsibility emerges through concrete recurrence: the unripe fruit, the unreadable map, the nut that must be read without touch. Final image of frost on useless produce reweights the premise—salvation is possible yet barren. No moral is stated; the tension between mercy and futility lingers. The graceless-beauty mandate is embodied, not labeled, in brass predators circling above doomed blossoms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature—gnarled roots like beggar fingers, guilt as stone—syntax tightening under pressure (“She worked quickly…”). No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal, indirect, goal-driven (“Follow the nuts”). Rhythm mirrors stealth: long sensory clauses, then staccato orders. One clause edges toward poetic overwrite (“branches heavy with fruit that would never ripen”) but remains within POV’s bleak lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The mechanical birds patrolled… their brass wings glinting” advances stakes and paints dusk. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph cuts cleanly. Metaphors stay coherent (beggar’s grip, stone of guilt) and serve emotional pressure. Only minor filter verb (“She realized”) could be excised, but it occurs in a low-pressure beat and doesn’t dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing orchard-gothic with clockwork predators feels fresh yet inevitable; the nut-map micro-device turns a fairy-tale breadcrumb into a tactile cipher. Curse-as-ecological-balance avoids generic morality play. Risky second-person address is avoided; instead, the lyric compression and oblique guidance tactic offer a non-obvious solution that would collapse if swapped for any other object or method.</comment>
