<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is evocative but drifts into thematic summary (“the rebellion had forgotten its own magic”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final palm-to-stone beat earns a micro-choice with cost, yet her awkward confidence is told once and never tripped by action, so the trait stays ornamental.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum’s roar crystallizes hope with tangible vibration-through-bones cost; causality holds under an Accumulative lens (density of image and sound intensifies), but the rebellion backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that slightly delays present pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Repair-bay rust, ozone scent, and cracked skylight are filtered through Lira’s barefoot attention; opera glasses act as micro-setting that constrains perception and re-appear to sharpen the monoliths, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the field approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find meaning in the mess”—is signaled early; escalation is atmospheric (hum grows to ache) rather than causal, adequate for Accumulative track. One visible tightening: stones’ pulse forces the palm contact that forecloses isolation; price is the bodily ache, but no option is explicitly closed off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of reigniting forgotten magic emerges through stone-hum and opera-glass optics rather than exposition; final image reweights rebellion’s failure without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit, though “thunderous serenity” is named aloud, slightly thinning the veil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is specific—“toes curling against cold,” “light like spilled mercury”—and rhythm modulates from languid to vibrating. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; free-indirect skips cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence ingress; a few lyrical stacks (“dying light pooled… like spilled mercury”) border on density but stay tied to POV. One paraphrase loop on “hum” vs “vibration” in adjacent clauses; otherwise high information density and zero scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Stone-circle-as-rebellion-magic is fresh synthesis; opera-glass optical link to stargazer lineage particularizes the trope. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric escalation rather than plot twist—but execution coherent. Would lose charge if transplanted to generic ruins.</comment>
