<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena’s lineage is signaled early and her father’s watch fob anchors memory, but interiority stays safe: “unease coiling,” “pulse pounded,” no embodied contradiction under knife-point. The final stance—delaying betrayal rather than stopping it—reads as competent calculation, not costly renunciation; the brass token persuades but doesn’t visibly tax her. Competent, not yet crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: false starts cue tension → overhear double-cross → intervene with heirloom → truce holds. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “fragile, stubborn hope” reweights earlier silence, cost felt in the still-warm fob. One scaffold loop (“the night itself had paused… the night itself had paused”) and a soft time-stamp delay the orientation anchor to ~140 words, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<comment>Salt-rust-rum triad and lantern fingers give tactile noir; the pier’s rot and market geography stay coherent, guiding stealth movement. The watch fob’s brass glint becomes micro-setting that constrains the final negotiation. Weather and wider town remain off-stage, acceptable at this length; one adjective stack (“damp chill creeping through her wool coat”) slightly blurs sensory hierarchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is declared early; escalation tightens when the knife appears and Lena’s interference risks her father’s name. The reversal (delay, not prevent) narrows her options and keeps the truce intact, paying a social cost of future exposure. Stakes stay personal; no larger systemic loss is risked, capping intensity just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited trust vs. necessary betrayal emerges through heirloom and market silence; subtext lives in the fob’s gleam rather than exposition. Final hope is understated, avoiding moral lecture. A touch of genre noir familiarity keeps the insight from feeling entirely new.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Lena; perceptual signature favors metallic, maritime, nocturnal images. Syntax keeps noir cadence without monotony; one filter-verb cluster (“She saw them then”) slips in during peak beat. Dialogue is minimal but idiom-true: “This ain’t your business, girl.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; metaphor count stays selective. One paraphrase loop (“the night itself had paused”) and a simultaneous participle (“pressing it into her palm with a look”) create minor turbulence. Otherwise clauses stay crisp, verbs strong, no scaffolding clutter.</comment>

<comment>Smuggler-daughter mediating a pirate-market truce remixes familiar noir tropes; specificity of the audible silence and heirloom fob gives local color. The delayed-betrayal twist feels fresh enough for flash length, though lineage-and-token device is well-trodden. Risk level moderate; execution competent.</comment>
