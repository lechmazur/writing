<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s desire to “find where unused love is stored” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why this obsession matters now—never crystallizes; the grandmother locket beat is backstory, not present pressure. She makes only one micro-choice (reaching for the pen), so the promised cost feels symbolic rather than personal. Still, her perceptual filter is specific and the embodied “weight of a held breath” keeps her from abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the projector flares, lyrics appear, Mira claims the composer’s pen—an undeniable reconfiguration with conceptual cost (she’s now custodian of ghosts). Causality is lyric-accumulative, not strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and held. The single-scene anchor is clear by word 80; no orientation debt. One minor causality wobble: the pen “stolen from the vision” materializes without prior rule cue, but the final image absorbs the surprise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The booth’s celluloid dust, dormant gears, and light-leak geometry act as both temple and trap; every sensory pick is filtered through Mira’s synesthetic gaze. The film strip itself functions as micro-setting—its frayed hem and warming perforations constrain how she can touch time. Spatial choreography is immaculate: corner blanket, lap-held reel, wall-cast lyrics track cleanly. The environment literally projects the final image, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“retrieve the lost tune or surrender the letters to oblivion”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: the strip blackens, forcing her spoken promise. Pressure is accumulative-textural; no external antagonist, but the stakes become visceral when the film begins to burn. The price (she may destroy the last carrier) is legible on the page. One beat shy of 8.8: we don’t feel the cost translate back to her body or future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the conservation of emotional residue: songs and love letters persist until someone bears the weight of singing them. The refrain “Where do the songs go…” reweights from marginalia to projected light without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—tapping armrest, curling ember—never explanation. Final image offers conceptual repricing: Mira inherits an unfinished duet, resonance intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mira’s synesthetic diction—“scent clung like a second skin,” “hollows between breaths”—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: longer, breath-held sentences build to the staccato promise “I’ll find you.” No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. One clause drifts toward poetic template (“light spilled…in jagged, dancing letters”), but cadence recovers before closure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet sonorous; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent (celluloid hem, hibernating heart) and serve Mira’s tactile ontology. A single mixed image—“hushed thunder”—reads as intentional tonal oxymoron rather than slippage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Psychometry-as-cinema is fresh: the reader watches memory being projected back through the same aperture that once showed it. The “love letters never sent” concept is universal, but locating them in a silver cavity behind the screen feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk is taken with lyric causality and pays off. Could push higher if the pen’s trans-dimensional theft were seeded earlier.</comment>
