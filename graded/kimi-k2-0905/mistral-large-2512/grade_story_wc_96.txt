<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lumen’s contradictory impulses—yearning to belong yet denying identity—surface only in summary; the moment he hands Neruda to Elias is the first embodied choice that costs him his “vagrant” mask, but the monthly molting trait never constrains action on-page, keeping the arc one beat short of full earn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library breathes, the key’s purpose is fulfilled, and Lumen’s refusal to name himself yet feels like forward motion; causal chain holds—key → library → resistance shelf—though the prison-to-street ellipsis leaves one minor kink in linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rusted ribs of the library, coffee-tin weight in the coat, and mildew air are filtered through Lumen’s tactile sorting; the skeletal metal frame literally cages then releases him, charging the final image without ornamental detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging to the word-resistance—tightens once: the click of the padlock forecloses the safety of anonymity; cost is the exposure of staying inside the ruin, but escalation is single-thread, not compounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding identity through shared language emerges via shelving action and the Neruda gift, never named aloud; the final “luminous fracture” is the moonlit library itself, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Lumen’s sensory filter—“metal bones creaking,” “moon hung fat”—with rhythmic compression and no head-hop; diction stays within a poet-vagrant’s lexicon, modulating from wary spare to tentative uplift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action plus metaphor—without purple drift; only minor scaffold (“he’d...he’d...”) in the prison flashback, and the final clause “he didn’t feel like molting” is crisp, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Resistance-via-shelving a ruined library is fresh; the monthly molting idea stays conceptual, not operational, trimming the wow factor, yet the synthesis of prison key → public poetic sanctuary feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
