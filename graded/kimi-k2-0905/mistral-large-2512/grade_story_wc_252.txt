<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lirien’s interiority is concrete—bare feet, thumb on bone, pulse in ribs—and her shift from self-erasure to self-claim is legible in the final walk back. Yet the mother’s “Violence became impossible here” is delivered as exposition, not embodied contradiction, so the emotional cost feels administered rather than dramatized. The micro-choice to pocket the scrimshaw is perfect; the later choice to “stop fighting what you are” is asserted. Still, the arc lands with visible weight: she no longer makes herself small.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the island dissolves, the map blanks, Lirien returns lighter—an undeniable after-state. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the scrimshaw’s warmth and whale-call summon the island, and renunciation (not seizure) keeps it. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. The only wobble is the mother’s explanatory monologue, but the final image recharges the opening “ghost” motif, so the cost is felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Port Veyra’s salt-soaked docks and the black-sand island are sketched with sensory economy; the scrimshaw itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final lock. Whale-song vibrating through ribs body-bridges sea and self, charging the last beat. One nit: the temple’s “seaweed and bone” figures verge on Gothic catalogue, but the coral-and-driftwood architecture stays specific. Environment materially shapes access and choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging vs. erasure—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the island solidifies only if she wades unarmed. The decisive deepening is the moment she presses the scrimshaw into the whalebone lock: a non-violent key that forecloses force forever. Cost is the map’s blankness and the mother’s permanent detachment. Pressure is coherent; no reversal is needed beyond this single, narrowing threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—freedom through relinquishing force—emerges from the island’s rule and the scrimshaw’s dissolution, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: coiling rope “no thicker than her wrists” mirrors later uncoiling of self. The whale’s call as maternal summons reweights maritime folklore without cliché. Final image of “lighter” body offers non-literal resonance; only the mother’s spoken thesis slightly dilutes ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lirien’s perceptual filter—cold ankles, bone warmth, salt grief. Syntax is lean, dancer-precise, with rhythmic lift at the breach: “its call a deep, resonant pulse that vibrated through her ribs.” No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Voice modulates from stealth to open grace without register drift; the whale-song idiom feels native to her world.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut: “she slipped the scrimshaw into the pocket of her apron, knowing it was meant for her” does three jobs in sixteen words. Figurative control holds—mirage, salt dissolution—until “temple walls began to dissolve like salt in water,” a mild echo of prior salt motif. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph breathes with sentence variation; momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The disappearing anti-island that admits only the non-violent is fresh mythic logic; whalebone map as key deepens it. Ghost-to-presence arc avoids stock “found family” by making reunion explicitly partial and chosen. Combative tenderness is embedded rather than labeled. Risk is moderate—lyric fabulism in under 800 words—but execution stays coherent, so originality feels earned, not grafted.</comment>
