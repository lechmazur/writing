<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s reckless streak and skeptical bent are shown through action and memory, but the swallowed-truth motive stays abstract; the final gesture of handing over the valve reads as symbolic rather than a choice that costs him something we can feel. Interiority is vivid (“hair on his arms prickled”) yet never pits contradictory impulses against each other in the same beat, so the arc flattens into observation rather than self-revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush after the wheel is returned reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—the mill’s ghost labor is acknowledged and Elias’s trespass is silently judged. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory beat thickens the ghost-shift memory until the final cessation of clanking crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting: its heft, brass dullness, and final re-installation constrain Elias’s gesture and charge the closing hush. Selective sensory detail (wet concrete, cold tunnel air) is filtered through his explorer bias and keeps the mill’s geography legible without exposition dumps. Spatial choreography is coherent across the single scene; no environmental detail is wasted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reckless curiosity versus swallowed guilt—tightens once when Elias chooses to watch instead of flee; the cessation of clanking forecloses escape and leaves him in charged silence. Escalation is textural: each metallic echo increases density until the final quiet reweights the stake with felt cost. No reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: industrial memory outlives capital abandonment, and trespass cannot be undone by mere witnessing. The valve’s return acts as a non-literal answer—restoration without absolution. Subtext resides in the faceless worker’s caress of the wheel and Elias’s held breath, avoiding moral statement yet leaving residual unease.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is skeptical, tactile, alert to rust and weight. Syntax lengthens under drowsy alertness, then fragments (“He should have run. / But he didn’t.”) to mirror flickering flashlight and rising dread. No head-hop; diction stays within his vernacular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Metaphors (“knife through stale bread,” “lover’s touch”) are spare, purposeful, never stacked. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final line’s monosyllabic hush earns its cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The ghost-shift premise refreshes standard haunt tropes by treating residual labor as unpaid persistence rather than vengeance. Specificity of the beaded valve and the faceless worker’s calloused hands grounds the concept in tactile detail, though the talk-radio psychic angle feels under-exploited. Risk is moderate; transformation sufficient to avoid template feel.</comment>
