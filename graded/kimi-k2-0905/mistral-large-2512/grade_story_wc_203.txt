<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s observant trait is embodied in tactile dust-reading and the mainspring test, but her interiority drifts into abstract “theories” rather than contradictory impulses under fire; the final lift feels more symbolic than personally costly, so the arc hovers at competent rather than revelatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust layers, the mainspring, and the ceiling fracture tighten the same stake—time leaking—until the sealed crack and caramel-corn scent deliver a Charged Poise with conceptual cost; causality is thin (why the barrel seals the wound?) but the pattern is taught early and paid off in image, satisfying closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Ticket-office detritus—peeling marquee, dust strata, child-sized print—grounds every beat; the mainspring itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single shard, though exterior circus district is only gestured at.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“ghosts bleeding through time”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory intensification rather than causal turns, narrowing to the fracture moment. The tightening is meaningful but the price (lifted weight) is more atmospheric than tactical, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of “repairing historical wounds” emerges through dust archaeology and the mainspring suture; the final scent-image reweights prior dust motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity about whose childhood laughter lingers invites counter-readings, though the conceptual cost is gentler than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains a restrained technician’s perceptual signature—flashlight angles, gear teeth, dust spirals—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax breathes with Mira’s steady pulse; no dialogue means voice coherence rests on tactile diction and it holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and clause, propelling the beat; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. One mixed metaphor (“darkness like a held breath” alongside “wound”) barely grazes the climax, so the high-band stays intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Time-leak repaired by clockwork” feels fresh, and the circus residue grounds it in specific decay. Risk is moderate—lyric ghost-tech rather than radical form—so the score sits at strong but not yet unforgettable.</comment>
