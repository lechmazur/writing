<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mira’s involuntary-truth trait and safety-seeking are concrete from the first paragraph; the glass-eye trial forces a visible micro-choice (tear it away) that costs her illusion of silence. Interiority stays embodied—“her stomach tightening,” “hands shaking”—and the final stance (“fear remained and that was the point”) is earned renunciation with cost. No contradictory impulses are shown simultaneously, so the arc is slightly tidy; still, the change is credible and scaled to length.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: find eye → test eye → reject eye → bury eye, each beat altering her options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the “safe silence” path and accepts permanent fear; cost is legible in the final line. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. One minor soft spot: the textbook citation triggers the trial but the page is not shown, a slight ellipsis that weakens motive immediacy, yet causality survives.</comment>

<comment>The hanging orchard is not backdrop: slick paths keep others away, storm-gnawed roots supply the burial hole, and the wind’s voice becomes the eye’s chorus. Sensory triangulation—damp loam, flicker-shadows, groaning trunks—mirrors her internal slip toward exposure. The glass eye itself serves as micro-setting that constrains perception and final choice. Environment is indispensable to the climax image: “the orchard sighed” when the eye returns to soil, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can I regain safety by hiding truth?”—is signaled early and tightened in one decisive cycle: eye promises occlusion → delivers unbearable amplification → refusal. Escalation is causal and visible; each wearing of the eye raises psychic cost until burial becomes the only remaining tactic. No external antagonist is needed; internal conflict suffices. Price is felt (“she woke gasping”) and persists, meeting the 8+ bar for visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: safety-through-silence is a self-deception; real safety requires owning fear. No character sermonizes; the orchard’s sigh and the final acceptance of fear reweight earlier images without moralizing. Subtext in the eye’s “witness” quality hints at collective guilt post-virus, but the piece lets the reader connect trauma to truth. Final image crystallizes meaning without abstraction, satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mira’s perceptual filter: “colors too vivid, sounds too crisp” under glass. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures—“She tore the eye free, her hands shaking”—matching pulse. No dialogue appears; therefore no voice-drift penalties. Free indirect thought is clean, and diction never exceeds her self-taught forager lexicon. Distinct rhythmic control under pressure meets the 9- gate; only absence of spoken lines keeps it just below.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “the orchard’s branches groaned like a living thing” does double duty—atmosphere and foreshadowing. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Figurative vehicles stay coherent (storm, roots, chains) and never invade the final beat. One tiny filter cluster—“she realized”—is justified by the quiet epiphany cadence. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; no mechanical patterns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic empathy-virus is familiar, but grafting it onto a solitary truffle-forager who seeks an “occlusion” relic feels fresh; the orchard-as-safe-zone and eye-as-truth-amplifier invert expected treasure-hunt beats. Specificity of the ravine micro-culture and the discredited textbook rumor keep the concept from sliding into generic. Transformation is evident: swap Mira’s profession or setting and the emotional arc collapses, proving integration. Risk is moderate but successful.</comment>
