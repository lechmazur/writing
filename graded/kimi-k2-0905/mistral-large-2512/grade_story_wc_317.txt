<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tremble, her pulse quickens—but the “notably receptive” trait is asserted rather than dramatized in a contradictory moment. The childhood greenhouse memory is the only micro-choice that tilts her stance, and it arrives late; earlier she simply obeys each box. The final smile-in-the-dark turn shows earned composure, yet the cost (losing quiet life) is only implied. Still, her protective drive feels individual, not generic, keeping the score solidly mid-high.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: seed → soil → note → redesign → final stake. Each gift mechanically forces the next move, but motivation for the sender and the “they” remains off-page, so the ultimate threat is abstract. Closure lands as Charged Poise—lantern off, petal unfolding—reconfiguring her safe space into battleground with visible cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Brook, storm silence, and lantern flicker are filtered through Lena’s hyper-attentive mood; sound and light constrain her pacing and final decision to kill the light. The escape-room blueprints act as micro-setting, doubling as map and shield. Weather and water stay consistent, never decorative. Environment is not merely mood-board; it supplies the cool air the flower needs and the acoustic warning of approaching footsteps, nudging tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—safeguard innovation—emerges on day 7 and sharpens with each boxed threat. One meaningful tightening: the pinned warning relocates the plant indoors, turning her design studio into fortress. Cost is legible—she forfeits the solitude she bought—but the external antagonists remain unnamed, so pressure is atmospheric rather than interpersonal. Sufficient for this length, yet not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of creation demanding protection grows organically from corpse-flower paradox: life that smells of death. Final dark-bloom image reweights the earlier “quiet haven” into contested ground without moralizing. Childhood greenhouse memory supplies personal stakes, but theme stays implicit. No echoing thesis statements; resonance is quiet but present.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s perceptual filter: lantern shadows “cast long” only because she notices. Syntax lengthens during vigil, shortens at knock—rhythmic mimicry of breath. No dialogue to test voice divergence, yet courier’s whisper lands distinctively. Free-indirect diction (“She decided to flow with the mystery”) captures her puzzle-designer mindset without drifting into corporate speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. No loops or synonym churn. Occasional poetic uplift (“storm-born silence”) stays purposeful and pattern-taught early. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“shattered,” “traced,” “plunging”) propel. Only minor scaffold: “she rushed outside to find” could compress, but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Escape-room designer + corpse-flower + anonymous courier is a fresh triangulation; orthogonal thinking motif is baked into her profession and mirrored by the flower’s lifecycle. Threat-through-parcel recalls Eco’s rose, yet the bloom-as-bait twist feels specific to Lena’s innovation ethic. Risk is present but not spectacle-driven; concept stays human-scaled. Could push further into grotesque botany, but remains memorable.</comment>
