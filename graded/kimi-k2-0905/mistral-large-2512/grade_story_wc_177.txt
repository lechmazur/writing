<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his fingertip tracing of cracks, the dream-figure’s smile that unsettles him—but the contradiction between “foresight enough” and “hindsight was his true companion” is asserted, not dramatized in a micro-choice. The final beat (accepting the key) is a conceptual yes, yet the cost is only abstract “endurance”; no immediate bodily or social price is shown. The woman acts as oracle, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent. Still, his perceptual signature (edges of order/chaos) stays consistent and steers action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the directive flips from preservation to choice, the key materializes, and the storm-walk carries felt exposure. Causal chain is thin—dream woman’s gate appears by invitation, not by Elias’s prior tactic—so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of seal imagery and vine guidance reweights stakes rather than narrows options. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One micro-turn (seal fragments → key) suffices for this length. Cost is more atmospheric than consequential, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and storm form a living pressure system: roots “reclaim concrete,” rain is “heavy and deliberate,” the oak door shimmers under palm. These details are filtered through Elias’s edge-seeking bias and constrain movement—vines “guide,” storm enforces forward motion. The wafer seal serves as micro-setting that evolves from broken insignia to malleable key, directly enabling closure. No spatial drift; all anchors (who/where/when) hold. Environment charges the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and re-stated in dream. Pressure escalates through accumulative imagery: decayed directive, broken seal, storm’s approach, final key; each layer reweights the same question rather than narrowing tactical options. Elias’s agency is largely receptive—he follows vines, accepts key—so the tightening is tonal, not decisional. Cost is atmospheric (storm, exile) rather than a concrete forfeiture, capping the score short of 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: preservation myths calcify into coercion; living choice requires embracing decay. Subtext lives in gesture—crumbling wax, vines that “guide” rather than bind—avoiding explicit thesis. The final image (key warm in palm) quietly reframes the earlier oath without moralizing. Some abstraction (“the path is alive, and the walker is its echo”) edges toward Echoic Thesis, but the line is brief and counter-balanced by tactile payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s sensory filter: “ceiling … map of time’s slow unraveling,” “storm’s breath a damp chill.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during dream jolt, mirroring attention. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Occasional elevated diction (“precisely playful”) risks register drift but reads as character irony rather than narrator intrusion. Perceptual signature remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: opening sibilance gives way to hard consonants as storm nears. Figurative density is high but patterned—concrete/root, wax/oath—so the accumulative design justifies it. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tactile or causal news. One mixed vehicle (“ribs of some great, slumbering beast”) slightly strains physical logic, yet it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “living path” trope is familiar, but here it is literalized through ecological reclamation: vines rewrite concrete, seal wax re-forms under touch. Dream-oracle woman risks archetype, yet her smile is specified as “not warmth but quiet certainty,” giving unsettling edge. Synthesis of post-collapse bunker + rewilded forest + mutable oath feels particular to this narrator’s edge-seeking psyche. No bold structural risk, so the score stays moderate-high.</comment>
