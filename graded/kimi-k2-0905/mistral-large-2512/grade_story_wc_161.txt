<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-sharpened obsession with lost songs is palpable in tactile micro-choices (tracing spines, trembling at the lyric sheet). The reinvention trauma is sketched more than dramatized; we’re told he “buried the scholar” but never see the lie strain a present beat. Interior contradiction surfaces only in the final sentence—too late to pressure earlier tactics. Still, the ending choice carries credible cost: he abandons flight for salvage, meteorite warm in palm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elias refuses further self-erasure and stays to reconstruct the Lament, cost legible in the pigeon left cooing outside. Causal chain—ledger → lyric sheet → offer to collaborate—tightens once and suffices for 700 words. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. One minor lapse: the fire is retroactively introduced as total loss, but the ledger’s survival is never explained, a teleporting-prop nick that keeps this just under the 9-gate.</comment>

<comment>The attic’s warped boards, dust galaxy, and false-panel cache are not backdrop but tools that constrain access and discovery. Skylight geometry literally shapes Elias’s mapping method; the velvet box gives the meteorite weight in hand at the exact beat choice crystallizes. Sensory hierarchy—paper rot, rust-red chip, boot-kicked dust—mirrors internal decay and possible renewal without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless across two bodies and hidden compartments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover or relinquish the lost song—surfaces early and re-weights at the lyric-sheet reveal. Pressure tightens once: the prior collector’s note proves Elias is not alone, forcing stay-or-flee. Cost is conceptual (identity exposure) rather than visceral; no concrete loss (money, safety) is risked, capping intensity below 8.8. Still, agency is his: the final hand closing on the meteorite is the decision to endure reconstruction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—can erased art (and people) be re-inscribed—emerges through ledger ash and meteorite survival rather than exposition. Subtext lives in Lena’s silent hand-off of the lyric: trust offered without insurance. Final image of the homing pigeon excluded while the man chooses archive over sky re-prices “home” as artifact, not escape. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s synesthetic perception: paper smells like “slow decay,” songs vanish “like smoke from a snuffed candle.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at the lyric reveal (“Elias’s hands trembled”) to mimic cardiac spike. No head-hops; Lena’s skepticism is filtered through his read of her “eyes soft in the way of things that had learned to trust again.” Voice is consistent, compressed, and musical without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “dust motes swirled faster, as if stirred by an unseen breath” performs double duty—setting shift and omen. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay physical and coherent. One scaffold paraphrase—“Some things survived. Some things found their way home”—could be cut, but it lands as deliberate anaphora that charges closure. Otherwise, clauses are varied, nouns specific, and momentum clean to final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Folklore-loss meets antiquarian noir is fresh enough, but the burned-archive trope and meteorite-as-hope symbol are familiar. Specificity of the *Lament of the Hollow Men* and courier-pigeon alibi elevate the concept above template. Risk is moderate: quiet interior arc rather than thriller, but execution commits fully. Could swap meteorite for any heirloom with minor edits, keeping score south of 8.5.</comment>
