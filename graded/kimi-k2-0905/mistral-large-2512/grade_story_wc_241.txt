<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven need to “burn the numbers” is palpable, but her interiority drifts into inherited aphorism (“probability was just a language for the universe’s cruelest jokes”) rather than fresh contradiction under live pressure; the final resolve is credible yet leans on summary, not a micro-choice we watch her body make.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the lantern burn rewrites the father’s equations and reframes the stake from “pay debts” to “seize the seams,” a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causal chain holds—ticket scrawls → archive book → lantern ignition—though the midpoint traversal beats are compressed into montage, slightly thinning escalation before the final flare.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rain-slick stone, mildewed air, and mica-pane glow are filtered through Elara’s gambler’s eye for refracted odds; the lantern’s physicality—cracked spine, white-hot flare—constrains the decisive act, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking stays clean in a single basement locus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether the father’s curse can be broken—tightens when the lantern reveals “the house doesn’t always win,” a meaningful reversal that forecloses the poker-table path. Pressure is coherent but carried more by image density than by external opposition; the cost is conceptual, not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: systems appear invincible until perspective widens enough to spot the seam. The lantern’s refracted light reweights the father’s fatalism without a closing moral, letting the reader feel the conceptual shift; no thematic echo pollutes the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s probability-tuned perception; diction (“clover melancholy,” “lucid contradictions”) is character-specific rather than writerly flourish. Rhythm accelerates into short, staccato observations as the lantern flares, mirroring the white-hot reveal without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; only one paraphrase loop (“the house always winning, but only if you let it” echoed two beats later) momentarily dulls momentum. Figurative language is selective, never stacked, and the final sentence burns clean without metaphor clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “math as magic trick” angle freshens the tired gambler-redemption arc; integrating subway graffiti into a bibliographic treasure hunt feels specific to this city and this daughter. Risk is moderate—lyric compression over plot surprise—yet the synthesis lands as inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
