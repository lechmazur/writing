<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—needing to face darkness yet recoiling from its sentience—drives every beat; the tarot re-naming and erasure of the portrait are concrete micro-choices that externalize the split. The final “shape of the ache” renunciation costs him the last relic of the relationship, earned by prior causal chain. Interiority stays embodied (trembling fingers, salt-thick lungs) and avoids label-speak. Only minor slip: no second character on page, so status/relationship crucible bullet is moot but not penalized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library re-expands and the portrait is re-born as non-figurative storm, re-weighting the premise from recovery to acceptance of unfillable absence. Causal lens holds: each rewrite (cards, canvas) is a “therefore” response to the tightening room. Cost is visible in the final image—he forfeits likeness itself. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 15; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is not backdrop but hydraulic force: shelves inch, air thickens to seawater, constraining his tactics—he lies down inside the crush rather than flee. Micro-setting (warped tarot, ledger paper glue) doubles as tool and tactile obstacle. Salt-and-parchment scent carries through every beat, marrying external atmosphere to internal suffocation. Final image of “storm with no center” is charged by this exact room’s prism-fractured light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he reassemble meaning after abandonment—tightens when the room literally shrinks, forcing either surrender or re-creation. The midpoint reversal: erasing the portrait face narrows options from recovery to reinvention. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of decay, claustrophobia, and charcoal dust layer until acquiescence feels inevitable. Price is the forfeiture of representational art itself, legible on the final canvas.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief is not a puzzle to solve but a space one must learn to inhabit. The tarot re-naming and portrait erasure enact the conceptual re-pricing—meaning is made, not found. No moralizing; the storm-center image invites multiple readings (void, freedom, perpetual weather). Subtext resides in silence of absent lover and muteness of redesigned cards.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is maritime-vision—everything seen through salt, fog, prism. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath: short clauses under pressure, longer reflective cadences during card gluing. No head-hopping or register drift. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “charcoal strokes that refused to capture the way her eyes had dimmed” advances portrait action while stating emotional shortfall. Figurative language is selective: lighthouse beam “like a blade,” air “thick with salt and old parchment,” no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph adds new sensory or causal layer. Final line (“the shape of the ache”) lands clean, unadorned, letting image resonate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse-that-eats-itself is fresh twist on sentient-structure trope; tarot re-coding feels idiosyncratic to Elias rather than occult set-dressing. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic room; salt-prism geography and sagging shelves are integral. Risk in letting protagonist surrender rather than escape is bold and coherent. Minor echo of “darkness as living current” trope, but local detail keeps it from cliché.</comment>
