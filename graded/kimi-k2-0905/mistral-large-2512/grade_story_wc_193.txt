<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “virtuously mischievous” trait is shown only once—laughing at the 3:17 AM text—then abandoned; the final pivot to educator is declared, not dramatized. Interiority is evocative (“weight of every ‘what if’”) but drifts toward label-speak (“he realized…”). The bolt-diamond transfer externalizes change, so the cost is felt more by the prop than by the body. Still, the contradictory impulses (escape vs. repair) are legible and the closure choice is credibly irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: bolt → texts → coordinates → porthole → renunciation, each beat tightening the supernatural contract. The midpoint “quantum promise” reveal re-orients stakes without breaking continuity. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: counter-turning the bolt seals the portal and forecloses the swap; the warm diamond in pocket is visible cost. One minor causality bump: the phone messages stop instantly after the refusal with no in-world cue, but this does not derail the final lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm is sketched with sensory economy—“damp earth,” “ozone,” “spirals”—and the tunnel’s porthole is precisely anchored in space. The bolt’s temperature shifts act as micro-setting, constraining the final hand-to-diamond choice. No orientation debt; who/where/when are clear by line 40. While broader ag-tech or mycelium logic is absent, the selective detail feeds the fungal uncanny without stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair the self-scam damage—surfaces early and escalates from curiosity to existential swap. The bolt’s warming/cooling provides a tactile meter of rising cost. One meaningful tightening: the porthole offers literal self-replacement, narrowing options to stay or vanish. The refusal costs the alternate life, paid on-page; pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping this just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—pressure as metamorphic force—emerges through Mara’s diamond metaphor and the final crystallized regret, never sermonized. Subtext lives in the bolt’s temperature and the unspoken guilt of surviving the scheme. The ending reweights “pressure” from trauma to pedagogy without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: we don’t know if teaching others will heal Elias, but the thematic question is satisfyingly repriced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature filters world through scam-reflex (“system was rigged”) and fungal otherness. Syntax modulates—long reflective sentences early, clipped clauses during portal beat—mirroring tension. No dialogue, so voice carries all differentiation; it succeeds. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“he wondered if…”) but immediacy recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; mixed metaphors avoided. Occasional scaffold (“the bolt… the bolt…”) but never in the closure third. Figurative control strong—“glass peeled back like a living thing” is precise. One paraphrase loop (“pressure isn’t just force. It’s potential”) echoes Mara verbatim; trimming would sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Farm-as-quantum-forge feels fresh; portal-as-submarine-screw is an arresting visual mash-up. The scam-survivor psyche literalized as inter-dimensional repair job transforms familiar trauma arc into speculative metaphor without gimmickry. Risk taken: folding multiverse inside mycelium noir pays off and reconfigures the premise. Could edge higher with more idiosyncratic farm lore, but originality is already above market median.</comment>
