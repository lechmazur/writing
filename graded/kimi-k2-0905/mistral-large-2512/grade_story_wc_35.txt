<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s tactile grief-skill and Kael’s contagious sorrow are embodied in every beat; the shared hand-clasp turns memory into visceral cost. Interiority stays concrete (“phantom ache…clinging to her bones”) and the final stance—carrying pain without drowning—earns its keep through prior micro-choices. Minor slip: “sturdy brittle” is repeated label-speak at the climax, blunting the edge of contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: tidal patterns, rain, coral pulse reweight grief’s stakes without causal reversals yet closure lands via Charged Poise—shared burden felt in the warming coral. Orientation is swift; only one transition (pavilion interior) and it’s legible. Cost is visible in the final image (“the tidal formations pulsed…warm for the first time”), locking the before/after shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Desert-fortress, salt-rain, coral ice—each filters through Maren’s chef-perception (“taste the rain’s memory”) and constrains the final choice: the warming coral under her palm literalizes the thaw. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room moments. Micro-setting (her own body as tasting instrument) charges the closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will shared grief drown or be carried? Pressure tightens once—hand-clasp forces Maren to ingest Kael’s loss, narrowing options to “carry together or die alone.” No reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens and the cost is legible in the warmed coral beat. Coincidence is absent; escalation is emotional density, not plot twists.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through tidal imagery: grief is not static monument but returning tide—leave or be submerged. No moralizing; final line (“It’s a promise”) reweights the pavilion from tomb to covenant. Subtext lives in gesture—hand squeeze versus spoken plea—avoiding sentimentality. One near-miss: “Grief isn’t a monument” borders thesis-statement but is saved by immediate tactile follow-through.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s synesthetic palate; perceptual signature is consistent (“salt still stinging her fingertips”). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for memory surges, clipped fragments at climax (“How?”). No dialogue contamination; sparse speech carries subtext. Filter verbs are scarce and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. One tiny register drift: “conceptual repricing” vibe in “reweights the premise” leaks in via thematic echo, but it’s a single clause and doesn’t dull the final image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the emotional swell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Chef who tastes memories + contagious grief + coral ice pavilion synthesizes into a fresh emotional physics; removal of any node collapses the story. Tropes (desert miracle, shared trauma) are re-inscribed through gustatory synesthesia and geothermal coral, avoiding cliché. Risky compression to one beat succeeds, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
