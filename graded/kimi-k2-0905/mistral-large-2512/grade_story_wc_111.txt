<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet, ritualized tending and the incremental give-and-take with the garden create a believable interior life; the contradiction between control and surrender is embodied in every micro-choice. The final renunciation—carrying the seedling away, leaving the marbles—pays off the lifetime of self-deception with a tangible, scaled cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the solo arc is complete. Hairline slip: “mended deception” is named once in interiority rather than purely dramatized, stopping just short of 9-band purity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden’s final gift reconfigures the entire 40-year struggle, and the cost is felt in the empty fountain and the gardener’s emptied pockets. Causal chain holds: each marble placement → garden response → map marble → seedling, all under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. One sentence of overt thesis (“Mended deception, he thought”) is the single cosmetic blemish, not enough to breach 9-band integrity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The maze is not backdrop; its shifting paths and dry fountain actively constrain Elias’s movement and final decision. Cracked marble, metallic seedling, and withered hedge are tactile micro-settings that charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through an aging gardener’s priorities—touch over sight, texture over color. One minor spatial vagueness: “entrance of dead-end paths” could be sharper, but never obfuscates choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—garden’s recognition—signals early and tightens through each marble exchange; the final seedling forecloses the option to keep controlling the maze. Escalation is textural: each new bloom or shifted hedge increases the density of reciprocity until the map marble crystallizes the last move. Cost is visible: Elias relinquishes the marbles and abandons ownership. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of surrender versus mastery emerges organically from pruning, polishing, and finally relinquishing; no authorial statement imposes it. The cracked marbles reprice meaning: what was once a flaw becomes the map that leads to trust. Final image—seedling in a pot, marbles left behind—offers a non-literal answer: tending is not owning. Ambiguity remains: garden may still outlive or outwit him, inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s gnarled perceptions; diction (“brittle as old parchment,” “knees popping like dry twigs”) is sensory, never decorative. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for ritual polishing, clipped fragments for discovery. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets are waived. One filter verb cluster (“he thought”) is minimal and voice-motivated, not enough to cap 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and internally consistent—no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges marbles and seedling. Proofing is clean; no typos, tense drift, or pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The measurable-luck world is hinted, not dumped, letting the garden’s sentience feel mythic yet fresh. Cracked marbles as reciprocal currency and the metallic seedling are specific inventions that could not be swapped without collapsing the story. Risk is taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist—appropriate to theme. Minor familiarity: “garden that judges” echoes mythic tropes, but tactile detail transforms it.</comment>
