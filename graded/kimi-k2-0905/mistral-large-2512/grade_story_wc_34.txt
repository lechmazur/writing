<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—music as instinct, silence as itch—yet the decisive moment (pressing the bolt-plate into the ghost) is externally prompted, not wrestled from contradictory impulse; the cost is felt but not internally foreshadowed, so the arc reads as tender rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ghost’s “Enough” reweights the courtyard graffiti into Earned Stasis, the bolt-plate fused as visible price. Causal chain holds—lute call answers graffiti plea, iron key completes encoding—though the ghost’s prior agency (how she can rearrange paint but not speak) is elided, a minor fracture under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mist, altitude chill, and phosphorescent paint are filtered through Elias’s musician senses; the bolt-plate’s rust-bloom mirrors the ghost’s fading memory and physically enables the final merge. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the courtyard never dissolves into white-room, but weather remains backdrop rather than tactical constraint, capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to give the ghost voice”—tightens once: graffiti plea → music → iron key. Pressure is textural, accumulating luminescence and sound rather than narrowing options; the final chord simply completes the ritual without new jeopardy, so escalation is present but modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges through sensory particulars: pressed flower iron, wind-warped notes, graffiti that rewrites itself. No character moralizes; the closing “Enough” lets the reader feel the cost of being archived. Ambiguity lingers—was the ghost freed or merely satisfied—creating resonance without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s synesthetic ear; diction—“tinkersong,” “shimmer as graffiti”—is consistent, lyrical yet precise. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally as lightning nears. Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing without monotony, sustaining a hush-of-wonder timbre that modulates into triumphant release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean: every clause adds sensory or causal value. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—sound-as-light, mist-as-listener—so density reads intentional, not purple. One scaffold loop: “the mist coiled tighter, as if listening” echoes earlier “mist curled…like a living thing,” a hairline slip that does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sky-courtyard balladeer who encodes ghosts via graffiti-lute duet feels fresh, yet the core trope—musician gives spirit voice—leans on familiar bones. Specificity of the rust-flower bolt-plate and phosphorescent code lifts the concept; risk is moderate, not radical. Transformation is local but memorable.</comment>
