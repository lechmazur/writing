<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s fear-of-heights label is declared, never embodied under pressure; the stunt-double past stays off-stage and therefore fails to complicate present choices. Interiority is vivid (“gnawed at her ribs like a trapped rat”) and her micro-choice to lunge toward, not away from, the caretaker shows adaptive grit. Yet the climactic forgiveness (“let’s start over”) feels sudden because no prior beat dramatizes her re-valuing vulnerability; the emotional cost is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shell → cast → box → photo → recognition, each link forcing the next. The photograph delivers a decisive change that reconfigures both relationship and self-definition, paying the cost on the page. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only the caretaker’s late arrival feels slightly convenient, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library is more than backdrop—its groaning shelves, loose floorboard, and starlit roof physically enable the discovery and final tableau. Sensory detail is selective: cold glow, damp paper, rust, all filtered through Mira’s hyper-alert POV. The child’s cast acts as micro-setting that literally bears the map, constraining her decryption moves and charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity survival—tightens when the shell’s whispers force her to confront the caretaker and pry up the floorboard; each step forecloses retreat. The photograph raises the cost: her entire heroic self-narrative was built on theft, not talent. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence solves the problem, and the final alliance is earned, not gifted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as power—emerges through the shell’s murmurs and the broken cast, not thesis statements. The photo reweights “stolen” versus “chosen” identity, letting the reader feel the moral ambiguity rather than judge it. Only the caretaker’s compressed apology keeps the resonance from deepening further; a gesture or withheld detail could have let subtext speak even louder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: maritime metaphors, stunt-worker body awareness, selective auditory focus on whispers. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into short beats (“She opened the box.”) to mirror breath control. No head-hopping; the caretaker’s shock is read off his flinch and truncated speech, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within the shipwreck/library frame; no mixed vehicles. Only one scaffold loop—“the betrayal should have broken her, but instead it had sharpened her”—restates the same idea; a minor trim would polish the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The whispering seashell half and child’s cast fuse identity-heist with maritime gothic, giving a fresh slant on the found-family trope. Specificity—circus acrobat legend versus soot-smeared arsonist mother—prevents generic swap-out. Risk is present but not extreme; the concept excels through execution rather than radical reinvention.</comment>
