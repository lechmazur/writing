<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-rooted need to mend the past is viscerally embodied; the photograph-burn moment externalizes loss without label-speak. Her choice to press the shard to her mother’s chest crystallizes a hierarchy of values—creator vs. daughter—at palpable cost. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the beat where she “touched the texture of time” edges toward abstraction yet is saved by tactile payoff. Closure renunciation is earned: the lost stay lost, her aging is the price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fading photo → shard discovery → reversal → garden doorway → sacrifice → restored photos with her own aging as cost. Each beat tightens because/therefore links; no teleporting props. Orientation is swift—name, vocation, cottage—within first 100 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of her older hands is the irreversible toll, legible and felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Living bridge garden is not backdrop but active agent—roots shape doorway, hedges guide, willow cradles—directly enabling climax. Micro-setting of the shard pressed to a dissolving chest constrains the decisive act. Sensory triage narrows to heartbeat warmth and scorched-paper smell under crisis. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cottage to maze core to gas-lamp street and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she resurrect the lost without erasing herself—signaled by curling photographs. One meaningful tightening: the shard’s reversal shows the scream, forcing the choice to enter the maze. Price is immediate: mother’s disintegration and Elara’s accelerated aging visibly foreclose retry. Pressure stays causal; garden’s sentience complicates but does not rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: creation demands relinquishment—maze-maker un-makes her own youth to spare the past further haunting. Subtext in the garden’s “quaking reverie” mirrors her trembling refusal to possess. Final image of older hands reweights earlier design pride into mortal humility without moralizing. No thematic echo; insight stays embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited voice maintains steady psychic distance; diction—“coaxing ivy into arches”—signals artisan precision. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentary clauses during street scene, then exhales into longer cadence in willow cradle, mirroring shock and aftermath. No head-hopping; echoes’ layered voices remain external. Filter verbs serve POV: “she knew” is justified by her scholarly background.</comment>

<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “petals curled inward, the child’s grin melted into a scream” shows reversal and stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or causality. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—time as fabric, shard as needle—without mixed logic. Only hairline slip: “texture of time” is nearly cliché, but immediate tactile follow-through rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Retrocognitive haunting via hortitecture is fresh synthesis; garden as mnemonic jailer flips the idyllic maze trope. Hyperbolic geometry doorway is taught early and paid off in spatial distortion, not gimmick. Risk of aging self-sacrifice inverts typical rescue fantasy. Specificity—willow-root doorway, gas-lamp street—anchors novelty in sensory memory.</comment>
