<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—capture echoes as tactile memory—stays consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract gloss (“she didn’t believe in curses, only in patterns”) without bodily contradiction; the final beat registers triumph yet no micro-cost is shown on her, so the endurance feels performative rather than paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: canyon falls silent, diamond now vessel, language death reframed; cost is conceptual (echoes displaced into gem) yet not felt on Elara’s body or future. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density rises from starlings to bone grooves to refracted cracks—one transition, single scene, so structure defaults are met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bone towers, wind-scoured grooves, and pulsing diamond are rendered with selective sensory economy; the tunnel’s breathing wall literally guides her fingertips toward the harmonic pitch, constraining the final act—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trap texture of a dying language—signalled early; tightening occurs when diamond warms and canyon answers, foreclosing the option to keep listening. Price is off-loaded onto the landscape (silence) rather than the agent, so escalation is legible but not viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of translation-as-transmutation emerges through echo-to-light shift; no explicit thesis stated, final image reweights loss into artifact. Complexity acknowledged—language death not reversed but re-embodied—yet subtext stays cerebral, not ethically thorny.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—copper-veined, pattern-seeking—and modulates rhythm: long clauses for starling murmurs, clipped fragments at thermal flash. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; prose texture mirrors her sonic obsession without self-explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong verbs (“harness,” “refracted,” “breathed”) and varied sentence rhythm propel forward; occasional adjective drift (“eerie light,” “quietly articulate”) slightly dilutes peak beat but does not loop or obscure causality. No scaffold sentences; metaphors stay internally consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Acoustic palimpsest carved into bone towers feels fresh; starling-murmur mechanics repurposed as recording method avoids stock magic. Familiar “cursed gem” frame is subverted by turning it into archive, not weapon—transformation is specific to Echo-Canyon ecology.</comment>
