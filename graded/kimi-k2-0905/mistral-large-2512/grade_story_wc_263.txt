<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora’s longing is lyrically evoked, but interiority drifts into stock “cosmic whispers” and “stardust” shorthand; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the climactic release feels foregone rather than earned. Micro-choices are limited to looking, reaching, kneeling—none test a hierarchy of values. The arc is recovery, not transformation; cost is aesthetic, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the aurora accepts her, stories “already written,” exhaustion soothed. Causality is accumulative/textural—density of celestial imagery reweights the stake—but the decisive release is narrated, not forced by an irreversible action she takes. No new constraint or price crystallizes; the lens holds, yet the cost is only implied fatigue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archway, instrument, and aurora are vividly rendered through Liora’s synesthetic attention; cold brass, color shifts, and star-scratches anchor every beat. The setting is the antagonist and ally, guiding her gaze and finally “accepting” her. It meets the 9+ gate by charging the final image, but micro-setting dominance keeps it just below exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unblock creativity—is signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory accumulation rather than narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the aurora simply returns what was lost. Agency is receptive, not active, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of inspiration as cosmic gift emerges through auroral imagery rather than statement. Final image reweights prior knots as “already written,” offering quiet irony about authorship. Ambiguity is present but thin; no counter-readings complicate the gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s moonstruck diction; syntax lengthens and contracts with breath. No head-hop or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature—star-scratches as pen marks—carries through, though occasional “cosmic whispers” flirt with cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates well; sentences breathe with aurora flares. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, taught early, so it reads as voice rather than clutter. One paraphrase loop (“stories…written in the sky…in the aurora…in the path”) slightly dulls the crest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Celestial portal as muse is familiar; freshness comes from astronomical instrument as pen-surrogate and star-scratches as ink. Specificity of brass lenses and color shift lifts the trope, but the recovery arc remains standard.</comment>
