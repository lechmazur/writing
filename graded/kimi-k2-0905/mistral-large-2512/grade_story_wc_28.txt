<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—guilt over past inaction versus present compulsion to rebuild—drives every micro-choice; the moment she presses lapis into the stone, the cost (blood, kneeling labor, the name *Amira* left exposed) crystallizes her Earned Stasis. Retrocognitive burden is more label than lived constraint; we’re told it “traps” but never see it warp a present decision. Still, the single-POV embodiment is vivid and the final refusal to erase the name is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the renamed plaza and the re-inlaid stone reweight the entire past, with the retained name *Amira* functioning as undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—finding the stone → reading the name → choosing to keep it while renaming the place—each step because/therefore. Orientation is swift (plaza, post-fire, night) and the lens (Causal) holds without wobble. Only a trace of outline sequencing (“She had done nothing” told, not shown) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Charred cedar, damp stone, and the lantern’s single glow narrow perception to the ruined minaret; every sensory pick is filtered through Liora’s guilded-rebuilder bias. The shattered sky and scattered tesserae evolve from backdrop to tactical map—she uses their edges, their patterns, their negative space to decide the world’s new name. Micro-setting (the stepping stone) literally cuts her palm, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as she kneels, turns, presses—bodies and fragments track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the plaza will be allowed to forget *Amira*—is signaled by word three and tightens when the name is uncovered. One meaningful turn: instead of erasing, she inlays the shard, foreclosing vengeance without sentimentality; the price is blood on the stone and the permanent visibility of the name. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence intrudes. Could use one more intermediate obstacle (physical or social) to push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through the stone’s refusal to be effaced; no character sermonizes. The final image—*Amira* embedded in the Unbroken Name—reweights the entire moral calculus without a stated moral. Subtext in the chipped spiral and the blood bead carries the ethical load. Only a hairline slip into abstract label “aberrant mercy” in exposition nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a distinct perceptual signature: sky “split like broken glass,” tesserae “fallen stars,” diction precise yet tactile. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for memory, staccato beats for shard-work—mirroring her physical labor. No filter-verb clutter; metaphors stay physical and consistent. Voice remains stable; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “She pressed it into the stepping stone’s empty space, where *Amira* had once been” advances action, reifies cost, and renames in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new tactile or emotional data. One mixed metaphor—“heart a quiet furnace of defiance”—is minor enough to keep clarity intact. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the kneeling labor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Post-catastrophic reconstruction stories are common, but the retrocognitive curse used to justify holding the literal fragment of the arsonist’s name feels fresh. The inversion—naming the plaza after the un-erased perpetrator—grows inevitably from the setup. Specificity of lapis shard, spiral path, and blood bead prevents generic allegory. Risk is present and paid off.</comment>
