<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrically textured—“breath curling into the still air like a question”—but his contradictory impulses (stay/enter) are stated rather than dramatized in-scene; the final “smile” signals acceptance without embodied cost. The arrowhead and skimmer act on him more than he acts on them, so agency feels faint. Still, the hierarchy of values (solitude vs. initiation) is legible and the endurance of centuries lands as credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the seam-door opens, the skimmer’s chord rewrites the canyon’s echoes, and Elias steps into “the spaces between steps”—a conceptual cost that forecloses ordinary motion forever. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because-therefore, but the pattern is taught early and the final image reweights all prior echo imagery without contradiction. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canyon is not backdrop but instrument: the bone towers’ etched symbols supply the literal lock the arrowhead fits, while the flock’s split formation triggers the decisive move. Micro-setting (skimmer warmth against skin) constrains timing and signals harmonic alignment. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s listening bias; no white-room syndrome. Environment, tool, and body together charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tightened once: the birds’ ruptured pattern forces Elias to stand and act. The price is conceptual rather than visceral—he forfeits normal locomotion—but the cost is legible in the final “spaces between steps.” No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational-coherent. A second tightening beat would have pushed this into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of listening vs. stepping: the skimmer’s song and birds’ wings reweight “navigation” from physical to acoustic, culminating in the silent doorway. No moral is stated; the canyon’s echo becomes a non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—does Elias live or dissolve?—without confusion. The particulars (arrowhead as map fragment) keep the abstraction grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “invisible roots,” “ghost’s sigh” reflect his attuned ear. Syntax lengthens during listening beats, then fractures at the seam-door—“A seam appeared, a door long sealed...” mirroring rupture. No head-hopping; diction remains within his archaic-hermit lexicon. The voice is distinctive enough to risk 9.0, but one clause drifts toward editorial gloss—“he realized” could have been cut.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering serves the accumulative lens. No template cadence or synonym loops; each metaphor extends the acoustic motif. The single strike of the skimmer in the final paragraph lands with monosyllabic force after longer sentences, creating rhythmic closure. A marginal purple tint (“weight of centuries settling into his bones like dust”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “navigate without moving” conceit fuses geomancy and ornithomancy in a fresh synthesis; the arrowhead-as-map-fragment reverses the usual weapon trope. Risk is taken with lyric stasis, but coherence under pressure holds. While echoes and bone towers flirt with familiar epic-fantasy scenery, the acoustic mechanics and birds-as-historians angle particularize the world. Not quite 9.0 because the core insight feels foreshadowed by existing mystic-tradition narratives.</comment>
