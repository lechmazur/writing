<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—equations vs. wonder—grounds every beat; the kneel-to-plant micro-choice visibly costs her former identity. The “secretly sentimental” trait moves from label to engine when she buries the crystal, trading control for felt risk. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is waived; interior arc alone earns the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (crystal, starlings, waterfall hues) layers density until the pattern break of shattering ice reweights stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: options reconfigured (“let them dance”) with conceptual cost—she abandons quantified certainty. Orientation anchored within 50 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prismatic waterfall, frozen dew, and starling murmurations are filtered through Liora’s alchemist gaze, each detail constraining her shift from distillation to surrender. The crystal’s tactile cold and eventual fracture directly enable the final image; environment is not backdrop but catalyst. Micro-setting (crystal in soil) charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she master or release wonder?—tightens once: pressing the crystal into earth forfeits the old methodology. Under Accumulative lens, the escalating density of sensory images (ripe apple, bee hum, starling choreography) reweights the cost of surrender; no reversals needed. Price is legible in the shatter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge vs. felt mystery. The flame inside the crystal literalizes her past failure; its burial enacts the thematic shift without sermon. Final image of embers scattering into soil offers resonant, non-moral reconfiguration. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Liora; perceptual signature—quantifying color, mapping starlings—remains alchemist-specific. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under memory of fire; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry dual duty (action + image). One scaffold loop: “she had… she had…” repeats at 120-word mark but does not touch closure. Mixed metaphor check clean. No filter-verb stacks in peak beat. Density high without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fantasy orchard + alchemist is familiar, yet the frozen dew as bottled failure and starling patterns as unreadable code feel freshly synthesized. Transformation test passes: swap alchemist label and the entire emotional machinery collapses. Risk is moderate; no gimmickry.</comment>
