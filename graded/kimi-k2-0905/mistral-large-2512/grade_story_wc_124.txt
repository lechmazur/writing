<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s trembling fingers, flinch at citrus, and final steady grip on the lantern embody contradictory impulses under pressure. The vial’s scent triggers an embodied collapse on-page, not label-speak. His micro-choice to keep the vial—renouncing erasure—pays the closure cost foreshadowed by years of avoidance. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts to therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias shoulders grief with the vial no longer a wound but a whisper—cost legible in the prism-tear and steadying lantern. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent-density increases, UV glow reweights the stake, final dawn softens shadows to crystallize acceptance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50; no penalty. No causality breaks; father’s absence motivates every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s extinct flora, UV lamps, and crystal vial function as micro-setting that constrains Elias’s choices—he kneels, inhales, decides among actual leaves and glass. Sensory hierarchy obeys his aromatic caution: smoke and bergamot spike before visual detail. Spatial choreography clean: woman crushes pod, hand on shoulder, lantern steady. Final image of dawn through glass recharges “crystal shadows” without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he keep or discard the scent-key—signaled in paragraph 3. Mid-story tightening: gardener’s line “scent is the last sense to fade” deepens knowledge, narrows options to endurance only. No reversal, but deepening sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost visible in on-page tear and resolved stance; closure not diluted by coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as portable light, not wound—emerges through vial-to-lantern image chain, never stated. Final dawn reconfigures “crystal shadows” from menace to tender filter, reweighting premise without moral. Gardener’s aphorisms carry subtext of shared exile; no echo-penalty because they complicate, not summarize. Resonance lingers in olfactory afterimage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “aromatically cautious,” “scent coiled,” syntax lengthens under UV glow to mimic thickening air. Gardener’s diction—dry leaves, plant metaphors—contrasts without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors grounded in greenhouse lexicon. Voice modulates from brittle caution to steady breath, mirroring arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose shows rhythmic variety: short sensory spikes (“bergamot and smoke”) against longer reflective coils. No synonym churn or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors absent; “crystal shadows” and “liquid twilight” stay within optic/olfactory domain. Final paragraph breathes without slack—closure image sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Scent-driven grief therapy is familiar, but lantern-broker profession and extinct-plant greenhouse provide fresh ecological frame. UV reveal pattern taught early and paid off in final color-surge. Risk: quiet ending without twist, yet stance feels earned. Specificity of vial-found-in-attic and father’s coat elevates above generic aroma-nostalgia trope.</comment>
