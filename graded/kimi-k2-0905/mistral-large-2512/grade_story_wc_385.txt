<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora’s longing is lyrically sketched, but her interior contradiction—why she risks joining Veyan—never crystallizes in a single, pressured micro-choice. The shell’s pull is asserted, not embodied; we see no moment where her body betrays caution. The final assent feels gentle rather than costly, so the arc lands as mood, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fused shell becomes a bridge and the couple cede their own voices to release the lost, a visible conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each station (merchant, storytellers, Veyan) layers density until the split object reweights the stake. The Orientation Test is waived: the nexus stays dreamlike yet legible, and the final image pays off the haze.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Starlit serpentine stone, ozone, shell-edge biting skin—details are selective, tactile, and filtered through Liora’s echo-tuned senses. The nexus functions as micro-setting: its humming ground and shadowed alcoves supply the progressive disclosure path that literally steers her steps. The fused shell in the final image is the charged object that reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the lost be called back?”—is signaled once the shell whispers a face. Pressure tightens when Veyan reveals the fragments’ nature, forcing Liora to decide whether to surrender her solitary voice. The cost is conceptual but legible: she and Veyan permanently trade their future songs for the chorus of others, a narrowing of option that satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: voices severed by unbearable truths can only return if the living consent to be hollowed out. The refrain of echo vs. void reweights at closure without moralizing. Subtext in Veyan’s “reed-blown melancholy” and the shell’s sigh implies sacrifice is the price of hearing the silenced, leaving plausible counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Liora’s synesthetic perceptions—echoes taste, the universe hums through soles—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax stays controlled: no filter-verb stacks, no head-hopping. The lyric cadence escalates into the final choral thread without losing clarity, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“stone paths coiled like frozen serpents” anchors mood without clutter. High information density: every paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The split seashell as sonic reliquary feels fresh, and the idea that truths too large amputate people into stranded fragments offers a non-obvious angle on the afterlife-of-voice trope. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than twist—but the synthesis of canyon singer + lost-sound collector + fragment-bridge is specific enough to avoid template drift.</comment>
