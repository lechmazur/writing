<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s dread and compulsive mapping of scars to pockmarks are vivid, but the climactic “narration” is an interior abstraction rather than a volitional act; the emotional cost is felt yet not dramatized through a micro-choice that visibly seals his path. Interior contradiction is strong early—uncertainty vs need for meaning—but the final beat shifts to passive reception of memory-flood rather than an active decision that forecloses a live option. Earned stasis is implied, yet the absence of an on-page fork or irreversible act keeps the arc just shy of the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s golden fissures reweight Elias’s fragments into a coherent self, the cost the acid sea still waiting below. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern recognition and sensory echo build to the cadence shift. The orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One minor causality wobble: the charm’s sudden glow is unprimed, but it doesn’t break the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Workshop gears, acid-sea spray, and the statue’s pitted cheek are tactile, selective, and filtered through Elias’s obsessive gaze; every described surface either mirrors his scars or constrains his movement. The micro-setting of the cracked vial pressed to stone supplies the final trigger, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, pressing forehead, scrambling for notes—within a single tilted room. Environment and body interleave without descriptive stall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conjure meaning before dissolution—signals early and tightens when scar-to-pockmark mapping becomes the last viable method. One meaningful deepening: realization that patterns are a map narrows options from blind groping to singular act of “narration.” Cost is conceptual—the irreversible knowledge that memory can be gilded yet still cracked—but not viscerally re-staged in final beat; hence stops short of 8.8. Pressure is coherent, acid sea always audible, gears always threatening collapse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of repaired fragility emerges through the statue’s gold-filled fissures rather than authorial statement; kintsugi is dramatized, not declared. Subtext resides in the matching of skin to stone—identity literally poured into damaged relic. Final image reweights earlier failures into luminous cracks, offering non-literal answer: meaning is the gilding, not the wholeness. Avoids moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s sensory filter; diction—“spectral fingers,” “quilt of half-remembered dreams”—is consistent with an alchemist-poet mind. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses build dread, then staccato scrambling accelerates at recognition. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. One micro POV slip: “liquid gold” may exceed his immediate perception, but it aligns with alchemical lexicon and closure iconography.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, and propulsive; sentences carry dual duty—action plus metaphor—without scaffold. Occasional adjective pairing (“damp, metallic air”) borders on purple but stays within POV’s sensibility. No loops, no template cadence, no mixed metaphors. High-band gate met; minor luster keeps it just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing kintsugi with post-apocalyptic alchemy workshop on acid sea feels fresh; statue-as-external-hard-drive for memories is specific and non-obvious. Risk taken in quiet, interior climax pays off via golden fissure image. Could swap “acid sea” for any corrosive void, so not fully irreplaceable, but synthesis of scar-mapping and gold-repair yields memorable inflection.</comment>
