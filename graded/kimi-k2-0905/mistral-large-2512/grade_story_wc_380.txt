<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlowe’s grief-riven obsession is palpable; the wildflowers, coffee dregs, and journal anchor contradictory impulses—forget vs recover—under escalating pressure. The final step toward the chamber’s gravity well is credibly foreshadowed, yet the interior contradiction could be sharper in the moment he decides to “answer” the whale; it edges toward declaration rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the choice to step into the gravity pocket reconfigures options and carries undeniable cost—he may never return. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: accumulative patterning (spiral, salt, echo) tightens until the causal leap into the chamber feels inevitable. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salt-choked docks and crystal vats are filtered through Marlowe’s ritualized attention; every sensory note—ozone, brine, condensation—guides his next move. The chamber itself becomes a micro-setting that actively pulls his body, constraining the final choice. One more tactile beat inside the vats’ pull would have nudged 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost sister/self—surfaces early and tightens when the spiral reappears in coffee and journal. The gravity fluctuation is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses retreat; cost is visible as boots slide and wildflowers scatter. Pressure is coherent, but a second micro-cost (physical strain, social risk) would have sharpened the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emergent theme: memory as echo that demands re-inhabitation rather than erasure. The whale, salt, and spiral refract this idea without authorial thesis. Final image of Marlowe “answering” reweights earlier silence, though a hint of what answering might entail would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marlowe’s perceptual signature—salt crust, lantern flare, coffee grit—syntax lengthens and compresses with dread. No head-hop; psychic distance clean. Distinct diction (“gleaming silence,” “crystal chambers humming”) risks lyric overload yet remains motivated by his ritual gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative layering (salt, echo, spiral) recurs with variation, not clutter. One scaffold pair—“the night his sister vanished, the night the whale’s song…”—repeats information without new pressure. Otherwise rhythm modulates, no mixed metaphors, and the final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Salt-crystal gravity docks feel fresh; the whale-as-vessel for deleted memories reconfigures familiar maritime gothic into speculative mourning. Specificity of lantern ritual, coffee-ground divination, and pressurized salt vats prevents template drift. Risk is present; a bolder conceptual reveal of what “answering” entails could push 9+.</comment>
