<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession is sketched through tactile micro-choices (reshelving, sniffing the scarf), but the decisive leap—donning the scarf and crossing the threshold—lacks prior interior contradiction; the risk/cost of abandoning his post is only lyrically implied, not dramatized. The woman remains a symbol; her recognition line supplies expository symmetry rather than fresh pressure. Earned stasis is gestured at but not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scarf stays warm, the door vanishes, options re-weighted. Causal chain is thin—scarf as key is asserted, not tested—but the accumulative pattern (repeated Tuesday visits, scent cues, geometry metaphor) holds together under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One persistent constraint (the scarf tether) shapes the final image, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library atmosphere is filtered through Elias’s synesthetic cataloging—lavender, ozone, cracked spines—each detail tethered to his longing. The hyperbolic-geometry threshold is sketched with just enough spatial coherence to keep the star-field legible. The scarf’s tactile reprise in the final line charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to the story-realm—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the scarf becomes portal key, forcing Elias to choose abandonment of his known post. Cost is poetic (loss of certainty) rather than concrete; escalation is lyric, not tactical, fitting Accumulative lens but capping entry into 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—stories as living, reachable dimensions—emerges through Elias’s sensory cataloging rather than thesis statement. Final image of shared warmth reframes prior solitude without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is he now exiled or finally home? Complexity is invited, not explained away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s book-scented perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“analog memories,” “geometry of longing”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at threshold crossing, longer lyrical ones in void. No head-hop; scarf POV intrusion is metaphorical, not literal slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor extends the bibliophile sensorium without crowding beats. One mixed vehicle—“angles bent like reeds in wind” beside hyperbolic math—barely grazes clarity. No loops or scaffold; final sentence lands clean, recharging scarf warmth.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Scientific-poetry library” and “hyperbolic geometry as portal” synthesize fresh aesthetic space. Scarf-as-anchor repurposes the lost-object trope into dimensional tether. Risk is moderate—lyric portal fantasy in under 800 words—but execution remains coherent. Not radically new, yet specific enough to avoid template feel.</comment>
