<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s albino eyes and “consciously wild” label are vivid but never complicate his choices; the grab at the ink-smoke is the only micro-choice and it succeeds without cost or contradiction, so the ending’s resolve feels unearned. Interiority is atmospheric (“serene anger”) yet never splits him against himself. The child and mother act as stimuli, not relationship crucibles, so no status shift occurs. The 9+ quick test fails: no prior flaw or conflicting impulse makes the final vow feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses retreat by deciding to hunt the time-thieves, and the cost is legible in the drained ink and the boy’s returned breath. Causal chain is thin—why the drone lands on the child or why touch solidifies the ink is unexplained—but the lens is Situational: pressure crystallizes stance, coincidence only complicates. Orientation is complete by line 5; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the message “They’re taking the time” re-weights the eclipse from backdrop to antagonistic force. Meets 9+ quick test but capped at 7.4 because the causal gap between ink-grab and decision weakens the “persistent constraint” requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mesa, canvas tents, solar film, and sandstone grooves anchor place and social stratum in the first 120 words; wind and dust affect gait and breath throughout. The drone’s iridescent wing-flash on sand and the ink’s smoke-rise supply kinetic, multi-sensory specificity. Environment does not constrain tactics—Elias could lunge anywhere—but the ink-pool rising “like smoke” re-appears in the final image, recharging the eclipse residue. Misses 9+ gate because no environmental feature alters the physical choices; still, micro-setting (the boy’s wrist) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will Elias intervene?”—is signaled by the scream at word ~200; the tightening beat is the ink-message that reframes child-poisoning as time-theft. Agency is present: he lunges, grabs, and vows pursuit. Cost is conceptual (time itself is stolen) yet viscerally felt in the boy’s blue breath; however, no personal price (tool lost, social credit burned) is shown. Escalation is single-step, adequate for 700-word scope; coincidence (drone lands exactly here) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: time is a consumable resource and crisis slows it because someone is stealing it. No character moralizes; the eclipse residue and ink-smoke carry the idea. Final image of Elias exhaling “something quieter, something more dangerous” reweights the earlier “serene anger” into sustained resolve, supplying non-literal resonance. Avoids explicit thesis, but the conceptual leap is so sudden the reader must assemble meaning post-closure, trimming the upper band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is sharp—“wind-carved encampment clung… like a half-remembered dream” sets lyric yet grounded cadence. Syntax lengthens under tension then fractures—“He lunged… his fingers closing…”—mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral,” “conceptual alignment”) fits a tracker who notices pattern, but stays within plausible lexicon. Meets 9+ quick test: rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean: 697 words, no paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“wind-carved,” “half-remembered dream,” “sharp as broken glass”—so it reads as taught texture, not clutter. One mixed metaphor risk: ink “pooled… then rose like smoke” is physically impossible yet justified by supernatural rule. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. High information density: each sentence advances scene, image, or character.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Combines climate-scruff solarpunk (solar-film tents) with cosmic-horror time-theft delivered by nano-hummingbird: fresh synthesis. Albino tracker is familiar, but here his light-sensitivity pairs thematically with eclipse aftermath. Disappearing-ink-as-stolen-time reconfigures a courier gimmick into existential stakes. Risk-taking (lyric compression, single-scene, no antagonist body) heightens mythic tone without losing clarity. Transformation test passes: swap Elias or drone and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
