<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s trembling fingers and her shift from quiet observer to clandestine messenger give a credible arc; the interior contradiction between fear and duty is present. Yet her emotional palette stays safe—no genuine misstep or irrational impulse complicates her ascent, so the cost feels pre-packaged rather than earned. The disguise beat is efficient but sketched in summary, muting the embodied risk. Still, within the word count, her motive holds and the final stance is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain—discrepant star maps → pattern recognition → encoded date → whisper-campaign → thwarted coup—lands cleanly, with a visible conceptual cost: the observatory’s isolation becomes the very lever that moves the city. Closure is a Charged Poise: Liora at the window, candle steady, revolution echoing—options re-weighted, her safety foregone. One minor warp: the “synchronized errors” leap is asserted more than demonstrated on the fabric itself, a thin spot in the linkage. Otherwise the lens holds and the ending reconfigures stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dome, parchment air, and eternal candle create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Liora’s reach—she can only leave by disguising herself among the very maps she’s made. Autumn’s golden leaves return in the final image, re-pricing the season as aftermath rather than ornament. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single location and her brief street foray. While the city beyond is sketched in silhouette, the observatory’s sensory grip is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the hidden coup—surfaces once the stellar code is cracked; pressure tightens when the equinox becomes a live countdown. The meaningful turn is her choice to seed the truth via embroidered scraps, narrowing her options from private study to public endangerment. Cost is conceptual but legible: her sanctuary is forfeited, the candle’s eternal flame now witness to irrevocable exposure. Escalation is linear rather than iterative, yet sufficient for the compressed arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the political potency of “minor” women’s labor—stitching reclassified as intelligence warfare—without overt thesis. The eternal candle’s mute endurance against the shouted revolution offers a resonant counter-image, re-weighting silence as agency. No moralizing line intrudes; the final image lets the city and stars remember, inviting the reader to complete the calculus. A hair’s-breadth slip: “unheard stories” is repeated rather than deepened, a faint echo of prompt-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Liora’s perceptual filter—silver thread smells like comet ice, maps feel heavier than metal. Syntax lengthens during discovery, then fragments into short beats on the street, mirroring risk. No dialogue to test voice divergence, yet internal diction remains consistent with an artisan who thinks in warp and weft. The only micro-drift is one elevated clause—“conceptual repricing of silence”—but it lands inside her reflective moment and is swiftly grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences pull double duty (action + atmosphere) without clutter. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent—stars as shifting text, candle as witness. Opening and closing lines bracket the arc with autumn leaves and echoed shouts, creating cadence symmetry. A single participle opener slips into simultaneity (“Watching the stars, her breath caught”), but causality remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of embroidery, astronomy, and espionage feels fresh and specific; the “eternal candle” sidesteps cliché by functioning as both tool and silent chorus. Risk is taken in keeping the coup off-page, focusing on the quiet catalyst—an old woman with a basket of cloth stars—yet the closure justifies the narrow lens. Transformation is evident: celestial navigation re-coded as grassroots intelligence. While the “stars moved to hide truth” premise flirts with abstract conspiracy, the grounded stitch-work keeps it particular.</comment>
