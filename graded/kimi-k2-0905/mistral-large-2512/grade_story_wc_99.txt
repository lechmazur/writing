<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s slow-spoken trait is shown through measured gestures and the trembling hand on the maple, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final “mend” is asserted rather than forced by a visible choice with cost. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“color of unspoken apologies”) instead of embodied contradiction. The compass/lace act as externalized will, so agency feels symbolic, not pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the thread snipped from regret-diffusion lace and woven into the bonsai reweights the premise—regret becomes material he can redistribute, not erase. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the compass-plus-lace path is taught early and returns to crystallize options. Cost is conceptual but legible: the severance remains, yet its weight is now portable. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens contradiction at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Salt-air pine, frayed hat brim, and rain-drip cadence are filtered through Elias’s tactile attention; the antique lace’s stitches function as micro-setting that constrains his finger-movement choices. The compass’s cold hum and the maple’s wet leaf give sensory hierarchy, but environment never actively blocks or endangers him—setting informs, doesn’t test. Final image of thread catching light reprises the islet’s shimmer, so atmosphere charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—diffuse the weight of severance—signals early and tightens once: the lace path forces him to re-touch each memory knot, deepening rather than reversing options. No external antagonist or reversal; pressure is accumulative-textural, not causal escalation. Cost is conceptual (he gives up the fantasy of erasure) but not viscerally felt on the page; hence stays below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of regret-as-material emerges through lace diffusion and thread-transfer, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image reweights prior motifs (compass, maple, lace) without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence of departed students and unread stitches, but insight borders on poetic abstraction; specificity of bonsai craft keeps it grounded. Ambiguity is coherent, not confusing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: frayed hat, salt scent, stitch tension. Rhythm mirrors his slow cadence with long sentences that breathe; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression (“color of unspoken apologies”) is taught as his private idiom early, so lyrical heightening at end reads earned rather than imported.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or symbolic density without scaffold. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors (compass caught in tides of remembrance) stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) but justified by tutor’s reflective lexicon. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, letting thread-catch-light image carry weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bonsai pruning with antique lace cartography feels fresh; regret-diffusion via stitch-path is a non-obvious synthesis. Ghost-compass that spins in memory-tides rather than pointing north repurposes familiar maritime trope. Risk is contemplative rather than plot-twist, but specificity of craft details prevents generic allegory. Could swap “cerulean regret” for any hue without structural change, slightly diluting irreplaceability.</comment>
