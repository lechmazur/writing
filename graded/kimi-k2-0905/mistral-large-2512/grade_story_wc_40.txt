<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and reverence for knowledge are shown through tactile ritual, not label. The crystal test sequences give him micro-choices (whisper, hum, press to temple) that escalate commitment, and the final “silence is not absence” realization costs him his prior scholarly detachment—an earned shift. Interiority stays concrete, though the emotional contradiction between obsession and scholarly restraint could be sharper under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gardens are “remembering,” re-weighting the world-rule with visible conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each crystal interaction layers density until the final pattern break. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt applied. One minor soft spot: the “testify” stake is declared early but not dramatized as an external imperative, so the cost feels intellectual rather than relational.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library micro-setting—beeswax scent, groaning timbers, slanted dawn light—filters through Elias’s selective attention and directly enables the sonic experiment. The crystal functions as portable setting/tool that constrains every tactical move. Spatial choreography remains clean across desk, shelves, temple-press. Meets 9+ gate: the crystal’s sonic properties charge the final image; no cap applied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the growth pattern—tightens through each crystal trial; options narrow from observation to bodily risk (pressing shard to temple). Escalation is textural: density of sound, light, and botanical impossibility increases until the silence-beneath-noise reconfiguration. Cost is legible as forfeiture of scholarly distance. Could use one tangible external consequence (library lock-in, institutional censure) to raise pressure past the intellectual plane.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge is not archived but acoustically alive, and gardens remember like libraries. Subtext resides in gesture—crystal to lips, to temple—rather than exposition. Final image reframes earlier “fractured sequences” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: who else will listen? Complexity acknowledged, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—sound-colour synaesthesia, bibliophilic diction (“spines he had long since memorized”). Rhythm modulates with experiment: short declaratives under crystal pulse, longer reflective cadences in library hush. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under peak sensory overload. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and information-dense; figurative language serves sonic theme without purple drift. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “botanical impossibility”) stays within scholar-POV lexicon. Final paragraph crystallizes prior motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: botanic memory + acoustic archaeology in a post-dictionary world. Crystal shard re-visions chandelier debris as sonic hard-drive—specific, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (sound as growth-code) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Could push further by letting city gardeners or archivists intrude to test the discovery under social pressure.</comment>
