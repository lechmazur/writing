<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena’s “persistently curious” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—kneeling, palm to floor, adjusting the aid—each escalating risk. The interior contradiction between fear and compulsion is embodied, not labeled. Final smile is credible renunciation, but Miriam remains a symbol rather than a relationship crucible, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s smile accepts merger with the chorus of dead voices—cost is the forfeiture of safe return, legible in the mist’s recoil. Causal chain holds: photograph → Elias → corner → Miriam → acceptance. Orientation anchors by line 5; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “last photograph in her pocket” repeated twice within 30 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atrium’s marble rail, mist-coiled corner, and the crackling hearing-aid static are filtered through Lena’s sensory hierarchy and constrain her path. Glass ceiling drip and twilight hue mirror internal bleed-through without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the aid as conduit) directly shapes tactics and charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find Miriam/protect unheard voices—tightens when Elias warns “they’ll take you,” foreclosing retreat. Hearing-aid pulse accelerates from faint to frantic drumbeat, a causal meter of rising cost. Agency is active: Lena runs toward the chorus; no coincidence resolves. Price is implicit in irreversible merger with the dead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening as existential duty emerges through image (photograph, static, chorus) rather than statement. Final smile reweights earlier assurance: protection now means joining the unheard, not rescuing them. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers whether merger is salvation or second death. Miriam’s symbolic role keeps thematic complexity mid-high, not apex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is auditory—crackling aid, static voices, pulse as heartbeat. Syntax compresses under stress (“Lena ran.”). Elias’s rasp of static distinguishes his single line. No head-hopping; filter verbs serve voice (“She saw Miriam now”). Rhythm mirrors escalating throb, earning high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “the decades-old hearing aid crackling like static from another era” does triple duty. No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors (mist like living thing, smile fragile as mist) stay coherent. One paraphrase loop on photograph pocket; otherwise zero scaffold. Final line lands with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” and auditory haunting synthesize fresh mythos; trope of ghost-whisperer is tilted into bureaucratic intimacy. Risk-taking in merging tech-wearable with necromancy pays off. Specificity of atrium-as-former-hospital and cracked aid prevents generic overlay. Transformation test fails if names change, confirming organic freshness.</comment>
