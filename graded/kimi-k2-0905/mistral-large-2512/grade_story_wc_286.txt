<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ren’s interiority is textured—his hands shaping clay while the lantern glass thrums—but the final “understanding” arrives as a summary epiphany rather than a pressured choice; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the closure beat, so the cost feels declared, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glass heals and honey appears, reweighting the premise that the oasis “remembers.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of fracture/repair and echoing hum tightens once—and the cost is legible in the smoke-flattened sky image that forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cracked earth, bleached hive-wood, and the lantern’s shifting cracks are filtered through Ren’s potter-eye; the micro-setting of the bowl and brazier constrains the final ritual, while the smoke-flattened sky charges the healed glass—environment directly shapes the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why the oasis resists change—escalates through sensory echoes (honey scent, bee hum) that intensify density rather than causal turns; a single deepening at the hive base reweights options, but the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical, keeping pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges from the glass’s fracture-heal cycle and the ghost hum of absent bees; the final honey-filled bowl offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, though the middle reflection on “fractured timelines” flirts with overt cueing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Ren’s potter-perception—clay curves, light through cracked glass—syntax mirroring his tactile rhythm; no head-hopping, and the lyric compression is taught early (“as if it were a sleeping child”) and paid off in the healed-glass image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensorily rich; only minor loop risk in repeated “as if” constructions, but each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No mixed metaphors, and the final sentence (“The bowl he had made was filled with honey”) lands with crisp resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic bee-ghost oasis could feel familiar, yet the potter’s phototropic kindness and the lantern-as-memory-core give a fresh inflection; the fracture-heal glass reconfigures the trope into a meditation on persistence rather than mere ruin-porn.</comment>
