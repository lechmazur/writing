<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s survivor guilt and refusal of “healing” are embodied in micro-choices (burying the photo, steady watering) that earn her final stoic stance; the contradictory impulses—fleeing vs. tending—co-exist in scene. Mira functions more as oracle than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each shard (photo discovery, orchid vibration, cutting sprouts) tightens the same stake—how to live with unhealable loss—until the buried photograph re-weights meaning in the final image. Causality is lyric yet coherent; the orchid’s sway as listening device is the taught pattern that pays off at climax, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: “She didn’t believe in miracles. But she believed…in the way life persisted.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass arboretum, salt-fogged panes, and chlorophyll-stained hands are selective, tactile, and filter through Lena’s wariness; the terrarium becomes micro-setting that constrains her final choice. Coastal cliff wind and drone hum integrate into bodily tension, charging the orchid’s fragility with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—enduring memory of massacre—tightens once: drone-hum triggers freeze, orchid vibration reframes threat into fragile attention, narrowing options from flight to stewardship. Cost is legible (photo buried, refusal of celebration), though escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal or resource loss beyond emotional stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of persistence-without-hope emerges through orchid image and photo burial; no explicit thesis, final line crystallizes reweighted meaning. Ambiguity is purposeful—growth is evidence of endurance, not redemption—yielding resonant aftereffect without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s perceptual filter; salt, bone meal, and ledger details carry her idiom. Compression (“the bride’s smile was a knife twist”) is voice-motivated, rhythmic control heightens under drone-hum without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; information density high—each line advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor (“pearl of stillness”) is minor; no loops or scaffold, diction stays within Lena’s lexicon, final image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-drone grief with orchid cultivation feels fresh; “plant listens to drones” reconfigures familiar trauma-survivor trope through botanical specificity. Risk is moderate but successful; no derivative echo, though concept could push further into speculative botany.</comment>
