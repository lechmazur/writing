<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s pacifist-tinkerer identity is embodied in the solder-scented workshop and the gentle refusal of force; his micro-choice to “listen with his hands” shows a consistent, character-specific sensorium. The return of Liora lands as credible renunciation rather than reunion: she offers the tuning fork that completes his experiment, proving her earlier silence was not abandonment but parallel research. Interior contradiction is present—yearning versus residual hurt—yet the emotional cost is slightly under-dramatized in their single beat of reunion, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the clasp opens not by violence but by shared frequency, reweighting the premise that silence must be broken to be understood. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each failed frequency adds density until Liora’s arrival crystallizes the pattern. The only abrasion is a mild coincidence—her entrance at the exact experimental moment—which slightly dilutes the cost legibility, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The slanted star-latticed roof, solder smell, and lantern shadows create a tactile micro-setting that literally hums under the oscillator; the workshop’s acoustic properties constrain how Elias tests pitch. The diary clasp itself functions as setting-in-miniature, its grooves and brass temperature guiding fingertip attention. Final image of fireworks light splashing over the open diary fuses external and internal atmosphere, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the last image through environmental overlay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hear Liora’s voice in silence”—tightens when each failed frequency narrows options; the oscillator’s rising pitch is a visible proxy for escalating pressure. The meaningful turn is Liora’s fork gift: it forecloses the path of solitary deciphering and makes the reunion the price of success. Cost is felt but modest; fireworks thunder exteriorizes the achieved silence yet doesn’t exact a tangible loss, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: empathy is resonance, not extraction—silence shared rather than broken. The diary’s final line reweights prior beats without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers in whether the pair will resume partnership or remain in parallel, giving the reader productive aftershock. No thematic echo or platitude intrudes, keeping the score high.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual signature—copper grooves “like living thing,” listening through finger pads—maintaining psychic distance. Syntax lengthens during tuning attempts, then fractures into short beats at the click, mirroring tension. Liora’s diction is sparer, signaling her Arctic austerity without voice convergence. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language appears sparingly and only when it advances texture (“air itself seemed to shimmer”). No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image, stakes, or atmosphere. The single adverb “almost reverent” is justified by Elias’s stunned vantage. Clause variety and paragraph cuts create forward propulsion, earning high-band placement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “unlock with resonance not force” premise refreshes the familiar mentor-return arc; the radio-tinkerer silence-curator fusion feels idiosyncratic rather than checklist. Arctic quiet as inverted sound and fireworks as acoustic intrusion offer fresh sensory inversion. Risk is moderate—quiet sci-fi in miniature—but not boundary-shattering; specificity and earned causality lift it above mid-market freshness.</comment>
