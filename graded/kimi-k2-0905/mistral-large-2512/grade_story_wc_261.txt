<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s plant-telepathy and scar-reading are vivid, embodied traits that tilt two micro-choices (entering the tunnel, turning the cup), but the interior contradiction between “closure” and “listening again” is asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final beat registers as calm acceptance without visible cost; the scars stop aching off-page. Still, the perceptual signature is specific enough to keep him above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frozen hourglasses shatter and the coffee rings re-weight Elias’s “reading” gift, making the before/after legible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each frozen cascade thickens pattern until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean by line 5; the tunnel discovery is a mild coincidence that complicates rather than resolves. Cost is conceptual but undeniable in the last two sentences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower, garden, and tunnel are sketched with selective sensory strokes that filter through Elias’s plant-tuned attention. The hourglass and coffee cup function as micro-settings that constrain the final choice. Spatial choreography stays coherent; moss under the palm hums, anchoring orientation. While no environmental detail forces a tactical shift, the cup’s concentric rings charge the closure image sufficiently for high-band proximity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he keep listening or seal the wounds?”—is signaled early and tightens when the tunnel mouth appears. The shattering hourglasses provide one clear escalation that reweights options under the Accumulative lens. No visible price is extracted on-page (no wound reopened, no voice lost), so the beat falls short of 8.8 territory, but pressure coheres throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the cost of reading pain versus the mercy of letting it speak. The frosted hourglass and coffee rings act as returning images that shift meaning without authorial comment. Final image reframes earlier scars as texts that no longer ache—an earned, non-moralizing resonance. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—plants murmur, glass “catches light like shattered glass,” coffee rings are “stories waiting to be read.” Syntax breathes with dawn quiet; no filter-verb clusters or register drift. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness rests on interior diction alone, which remains idiosyncratic and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to clipped beats inside the tunnel; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“sand…like shattered glass” anchors the frosted motif. One mixed micro-image (“tower groaned…like a held breath”) is allowable at this intensity. Information density is high; every paragraph advances pattern or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plant-telepathy + scar-reading synthesis feels fresh, and the frozen-hourglass archive offers a non-obvious spatialization of displaced miracles. Coffee-ring bibliomancy is an inventive final pivot. While “ruined chapel, secret tunnel” is familiar gothic furniture, the vegetal consciousness reconfigures it. Risk is moderate but successful; the concept commits fully without late rule cheats.</comment>
