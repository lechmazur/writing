<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s sculptor identity is vivid—his hands “itch” to carve—but interior contradiction is only asserted (“always learning”) rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The final carving of the light-bridge is an embodied action that retroactively justifies his trait, yet the stakes of that act feel abstract because no personal cost is rendered on the page. He moves from observer to participant, but the emotional price of staying in the timewoven cavern is told, not felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the lantern-slide shatter → mosaic woman → arch passage → cavern tableau accretes density until Elias’s bridge crystallizes the pattern. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bridge flares, turbines deepen, and “he didn’t know how long he’d stay” forecloses a return path with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by line 5; the one transition (arch-crossing) is legible. No causal break, though the cost is more atmospheric than tactile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-slick stones, ozone-and-paper air, and driftwood edges “worn smooth by centuries” are selective, POV-filtered details that guide Elias’s haptic attention toward carving. The archway’s turbine hum and the cavern’s pulsing walls function as micro-setting that directly supplies the material and motive for the final bridge. Spatial choreography holds: slide shatters at threshold, pieces rearrange underfoot, bridge is placed center. Environment constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will step into stewardship of the world’s hidden seams—tightens once: the slide’s reassembly forces the choice to follow Mara. Pressure is textural rather than causal, but the deepening hum and collective labor inside the cavern make refusal unimaginable. A visible price is missing; we aren’t shown what Elias forfeits by staying, only that the option of leaving narrows. Sufficient for this length, but not piercing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—craft as temporal repair—emerges through the driftwood bridge that literalizes “scaffolding complexity with simplicity.” The lantern-slide mosaic and turbine-hum motif reconfigure at the end to suggest art as joint that holds time together, avoiding overt thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is Elias conscripted or freed? The resonance is earned, though the absence of a personal wound keeps it cool rather than searing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “his hands itched,” “pieces fit together in his mind.” Syntax lengthens during the cavern tableau, mirroring hypnotic awe, then contracts for the final flare. No head-hopping; Mara’s dialogue is spare, sub-textual (“this arch is a door”), distinct from the lyrical narration. Voice modulates with pressure while retaining maritime cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense: “the waves gnawed at the cliffs” does double atmospheric and emotional work. Occasional poetic uplift—“time pretending to be still”—is earned by grandmother authority, not writerly flourish. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; turbine hum recurs with accruing weight. One clause (“spirited in the way of those who carve…”) flirts with abstraction but is anchored by immediate tactile action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The timewoven repair-cave feels fresh because the mechanism is artisanal—driftwood, paint, gears—rather than techno-mystic. Elias’s sculptor lens reframes familiar “chosen ally of time” trope into material poetics. Risk is moderate: lyric ellipsis replaces hard rules, but pattern is taught early and closure holds. Not radically new, yet the synthesis is memorable and specific to this voice.</comment>
