<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—impatience vs patience dramatized through tactile ice tests and the refusal to draw his knife—but the arrival of the second figure compresses relationship pressure into a single handshake; no contradictory impulses play out between them on the page, so the crucible never ignites. The final choice to “turn toward the lake” reprises earlier imagery yet costs nothing visible; it’s a stance, not a renunciation with sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the joined gaze at glowing ice reconfigures the revolution from shout to tide, cost felt in the hush. Causality is sound—viaduct hum → stranger → shared stance—but the stranger’s appearance is pure arrival, not earned by Elias’s prior acts; the pivot therefore feels situational, not consequential to him alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Basalt spires, ozone scent, and moon-fractured ice are filtered through Elias’s tracker gaze; the lake’s “skin” metaphor governs the final step, turning setting into hazard and promise. Micro-setting succeeds; macro geography (city, valleys) is atmospheric only and never constrains tactics, capping the score short of exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to act or keep waiting—tightens once: the viaduct’s pulse forces acknowledgment of the revolution’s immediacy. Yet Elias neither jeopardizes his twelve-winter vigil nor stakes tangible capital (tools, safety, reputation); the handshake registers as recognition, not escalation with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient insurrection emerges through recurrent tidal/moon imagery rather than statement; the final image of “quiet certainty of the tides” reweights the earlier “broken promise” moon without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will passivity suffice?—but the conceptual cost is oblique, not yet socially priced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual cadence—wind direction, snow whispers, viaduct vibration—syntax lengthens and contracts with his breath. No head-hop; diction remains within his tracker lexicon; the single line of dialogue is spare, sub-textual, and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and information-dense; figurative layering (“jagged crown,” “broken promise” moon) is selective, never crowding a single beat. Occasional scaffold—“he had… he had… he had…”—recycles openings but stops short of marring the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Post-climate ruin with magnetic viaduct and insurgent quietude feels fresh, yet the stranger-as-messenger device is familiar; specificity of basalt sanctuary and moon-path tracking supplies the needed inflection to escape template territory.</comment>
