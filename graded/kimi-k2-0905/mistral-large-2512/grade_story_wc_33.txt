<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jace’s worn-mailman fatigue and Mira’s half-starved defiance read through concrete gesture and history-laden objects; the thunderstorm bottle refusal crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays spare, never diagnostic, and the final beat of “carrying a little longer” earns credible Earned Stasis. Minor slip: the smuggler-helper motive is asserted not tested in-scene, so the cost feels generalized rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jammer click, rain start, and bottle stowed reconfigure options with felt cost. Causal chain holds—undeliverable letter → Mira’s run → shared risk—though the watchmaker letter never loops back to tighten the final choice. Orientation is clean within 120 words; one-scene default met. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of absences intensifies to the final image without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Neon arcade, cracked dome observatory, and border blind-spot are sketched with sensory economy and immediately filter through Jace’s postal fatigue. The thunderstorm bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains his refusal, qualifying for 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single room and exit to rain. Only the drone’s exact vector remains slightly vague, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the undeliverable—tightens when the jammer activation makes complicity irreversible. Pressure escalates via accretion: each named absence (watchmaker, vanished parent, deportee) adds weight until the final refusal carries collective cost. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices for 600-word scope. Cost is legible in the shared silence and the bottle’s transferred weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of carrying absence emerges through iterated postal ghosts rather than exposition; the thunderstorm bottle re-prices “some storms aren’t meant to be unleashed” in the final stow. No moralizing line breaks the spell. Ambiguity lingers about whether preservation or postponement is the real rebellion, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Jace’s perceptual fatigue: “ghostly glow,” “weight like a secret.” Syntax lengthens under melancholy, shortens at the jammer flick—rhythmic control without drumbeat. Dialogue between Jace and Mira carries subtext of mutual recognition; idiom distinguishes weary courier from teenage operative. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and double-duty: “ink bleeding into the paper like a bruise” advances both setting and theme. No synonym loops or scaffold; figurative density drops at climax to let the final image breathe. One mixed metaphor—“border town… stretch of pavement where two nations had once carved their names”—barely grazes clarity. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic postal noir is familiar, but the fusion with bottled weather as unspent rebellion and automated border absences feels freshly synthesized. Specificity of the burned watchmaker shop and the drone blind-spot prevents generic overlay. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks, but the charged refusal elevates the premise beyond standard dystopian courier tale.</comment>
