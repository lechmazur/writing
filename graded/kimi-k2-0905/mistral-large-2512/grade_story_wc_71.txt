<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific—cataloguing the unremarkable, pocketing the orris shard—and his embodied dread (“pulse loud in his ears”) is felt. Yet the decisive moment (slipping the shard) is under-motivated: we’re told he “didn’t know what he expected,” so the choice reads exploratory rather than compelled, softening the cost that closure claims.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the house’s resumed, heavier breath reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin—no prior beat shows Elias intending to “pause” rather than cleanse—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the final image crystallizes the pattern of listening silence. Orientation is swift; bay, dock, lane anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Bay, dock, warped door-gap, and pocketed shard are tactile and selective; salt air and violet dust constrain attention. The leaning house is a micro-setting that literally pressures choice. While no object alters tactics after insertion, the shard’s residue in the closing breath keeps the environment charged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single stake—will Elias silence the living house?—tightens when insertion “pauses” rather than purifies, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (he’s released a slower, heavier awareness) but not viscerally paid by Elias; pressure plateaus rather than escalates after the pause.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of anthropocentric listening emerges through image, not statement: houses listen to themselves, humans merely overhear. Final breath reconfigures the reader’s prior bay-and-house perceptions without moralising. Ambiguity is productive—no tidy epiphany—creating lingering unease.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature (“cataloging the unremarkable until it became unsettling”) is distinct. Rhythm modulates—long languid clauses mimic held breath, then staccato fragments (“The house stopped.”) under stress. No dialogue, so voice remains pure and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; mixed-length sentences create natural ebb. One scaffold pair (“Not a sigh, not a groan, but...”) is purposeful emphasis, not loop. Figurative language is spare and precise—“shadows rearranged” conjures the uncanny without purple overlay. Clean copy, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Houses breathe and listen to themselves” is fresh cosmic horror, grounded in sensory specificity. Orris root as silence-fixative re-enchants an everyday botanical. Risk is quiet—no gore, just ontological tilt—yet coherence stays intact. Could publish now with minor motivational tweak.</comment>
