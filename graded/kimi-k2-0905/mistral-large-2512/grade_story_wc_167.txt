<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s reflective nature is shown through sensory attention (glass grain, voice tension) and the dream that seeds restlessness, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible micro-choice that costs him something on the page; the final “understanding” is asserted rather than dramatized through a forked decision or renunciation, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: dream → dock → atrium → stone-throw → vision → insight; each step is legible and the closure image (light always waiting) lands as Conceptual Repricing with quiet cost. However, the dream’s propulsion is thin—no concrete constraint or ticking clock—and the old woman’s entrance gifts the final cue rather than forcing Elias to test his stance, so the tightening is soft, not urgent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Harbor dawn is anchored fast (cold breath, salt ledger scent, groaning walkway); glass, water, and mist recur as tactile filters that guide attention toward the prism atrium. The prism’s fractured panes and the stone’s ripple pool are micro-settings that literally refract meaning, charging the final image; occupational detail (lantern-pane as “tiny prison for light”) fuses setting with theme, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elias heed the omen and discover what the world is telling him?—is signaled early but pressure plateaus: no time limit, no social risk, no competing obligation. The stone-throw produces a vision, yet Elias never faces a fork that could fail; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, so the cost feels prospective, not paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—finding the extraordinary inside the habitual—emerges organically through glass-light imagery and the ledger archive of forgotten stories. The final re-framing (“the light had always been there, waiting to be seen”) lands as earned CR, but the absence of a tested choice keeps the insight gentle rather than searing; ambiguity is present yet not unsettling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s glazier eye: angles, refraction, grain, “prison for light.” Syntax lengthens with wonder, shortens under surprise; no filter-verb clutter. The woman’s diction is distinctively tidal (“sky and sea trade secrets”), avoiding voice convergence; perceptual signature remains consistent and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense: each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (breath like mist, cathedral of glass) are coherent, not stacked; no synonym loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“spectral shards,” “noctilucent reckonings”) fits the glazier’s ocular precision; rhythm modulates without monotony, sustaining momentum to the resonant close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The prism-atrium as archive of unread maritime futures feels fresh; coupling a tradesman’s micro-craft (lantern panes) with cosmic augury through water-pattern literacy offers a specific synthesis. While the “omen in ripples” device is familiar, its application through glass-worker perception re-weights it; risk is moderate, not radical, keeping the piece memorable yet not startlingly unforeseen.</comment>
