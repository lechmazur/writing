<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s solitary ritualism and sensory acuity are vivid; the moment he presses the revived boutonnière between his fingers crystallizes a believable shift from custodian to inheritor. Interior contradiction—duty versus curiosity—remains present but could be sharper under the memory surge; the epiphany feels slightly foregone rather than wrested. Still, the final micro-choice to “tend” the stranger’s story carries visible cost in the lighthouse beam’s sweep, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s acceptance of custodianship for alien memories is charged by the image of the mist-revived flower, cost legible in the shift from routine to lifelong vigil. Causal chain is light but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory shard adds weight until the keeper’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the stranger’s death is observed off-page, slightly blunting the causal pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opal dock, salt-crusted glass, and tuning-fork hum are filtered through Elias’s professional eye, constraining his movement to a narrow stage that sharpens the final image. Mist breathes life back into the boutonnière—environment directly altering object state, which in turn alters Elias’s choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys lighthouse logic: sound and light override taste until the alpine scent breaches, marking the breach of memory. Micro-setting (body + tool) satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a passive observer or accept custodianship of another’s grief—tightens once, signaled early by the empty bench. Pressure accumulates via sensory intrusion: each ghost-sound narrows his options until refusal becomes impossible. Cost is felt in the final beam-sweep that now includes “those who still wandered in the dark,” expanding his vigil. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited memory as communal burden emerges through the flower’s rehydration rather than exposition. Subtext resides in Elias’s silence: the unspoken vow to “tend” replaces any moral statement. Final image reweights the lighthouse from warning to welcome, a conceptual repricing that reframes earlier routine as prelude to guardianship of strangers’ ghosts. Avoids thematic echo; ambiguity lingers about whether the memories will drown or illuminate him.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual bandwidth; diction—“ghostly fingers,” “tuning-fork hum”—is salted with maritime idiom. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mimic tide, then fracture into fragments under memory surge. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A; internal voice remains coherent and specific. Purposeful elision of stranger’s backstory is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every image does double duty (mist revives flower + signals memory breach). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-overwrite: “bruised sky” edges purple, but the bruise palette fits twilight and is isolated. High information density maintained; final line recharges “burning” from lighthouse’s literal flame to metaphorical vigil.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse keeper as unwilling confessor to imported alpine grief, merging maritime and mountain iconographies. Risk lies in eschewing dialogue and external conflict for pure sensorial transfer; coherence survives. Not radically novel, but specificity of Edelweiss rehydrating in sea mist transforms familiar “lonely guardian” trope into memorable image. Transformation test passes: swap flower or setting and the emotional algebra collapses.</comment>
