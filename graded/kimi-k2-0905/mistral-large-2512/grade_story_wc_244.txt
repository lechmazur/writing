<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “desperately jocular” shield is shown in his opening pigeon-grin and self-aware banter, giving us contradiction-in-scene rather than label. The interiority stays concrete—his pulse quickens, his palm feels the rock’s hum—so emotion is embodied. The final beat crystallizes a credible renunciation: he accepts the debt-forward lesson, foreclosing his original “cure” quest with visible cost (the rock gone, the slip “later” in hand). The only drag is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“he needed connection more than air”) that slips into near-label-speak just before the midpoint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the station’s rule-set flips from “trade for a cure” to “pay loneliness forward,” with the moon rock’s forfeiture as felt cost. Causal linkage holds—every beat is “because Elias still hopes”—until the logistician’s refusal re-weights meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (platform, ivy, dusk), well inside the 120-word window. One minor elasticity: the rumor chain is recounted rather than tested on-page, but since the closure doesn’t rely on verifying the rumor, causality remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ivy-choked platform is not postcard scenery: its cracked surface forces Elias to stand, the gloom hides the logistician’s entrance, and the overgrown clock tower provides the exact slant of rust-gold light that frames the hand-off. The moon rock itself serves as micro-setting, handled twice and re-charged at the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s bias—smell of damp stone, faint hum in his palm—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: distance closes from far wall to arm’s-length exchange without teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“cure the hollow ache”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened once: the logistician refuses a direct trade, forcing Elias to accept an intangible debt instead. That single deepening narrows options under the Causal lens and carries visible price (loss of the rock). No reversals are needed at this length; the pressure coheres through his escalating need versus the shrinking possibility of payoff. Coincidence is absent; the encounter is motivated by three years of agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: loneliness as circulating debt rather than private disease. Subtext lives in gesture—the rock passed like a relay baton, the word “later” as promissory note—never sermonized. The final image re-weights all prior imagery (ivy, pigeons, timetables) from decay to potential regrowth without stating a moral. One tiny echo of pseudo-profundity—“the story had changed”—is uttered by the logistician, not the narration, so it reads as character rhetoric rather than authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—he notices frayed cuffs, pigeon motion, the rock’s “frozen starlight” shard. Syntax tightens under stress: clauses shorten when the logistician turns away. Dialogue is minimal but voice-differentiated: Elias’s forced jocularity (“Trains don’t run on time here”) contrasts with the logistician’s dry paper tone. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; psychic distance compresses exactly as desperation peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long lyrical opener, clipped beats at hand-off, then a resonant single-sentence close. Figurative language is selective—moon rock as “shard of frozen starlight” appears once and recurs literally at exit. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One paraphrase loop (“he didn’t care about curses… he cared about the way the rock hummed”) could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat. Grammar, tense, and pronoun reference are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “disaster-relief logistician who trades in intangibles” is a fresh inversion of both mercenary and miracle-worker tropes. The moon rock as currency and the station-as-lesson synthesize into a singular image set that would collapse if swapped for generic gems or alleys. Risk is taken: the protagonist pays to *not* receive what he came for, yet the choice feels inevitable in hindsight. No echo of famous scenes; the final slip “later” reconfigures the entire rumor pattern without gimmick.</comment>
