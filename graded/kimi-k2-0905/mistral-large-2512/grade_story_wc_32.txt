<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s buried sensitivity and twenty-year obsession are credibly embodied in acid-stained hands and tremor; the pivot from “perfection” to “breaking” is an earned interior reversal. The shard he lifts in the final beat shows visible cost—his life’s work reduced to jagged scrap—so the renunciation lands. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; interior contradiction alone drives the turn. Micro-choice to pour mercury into the exploding crucible crystallizes his new hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the goal is redefined from gold to newness itself, and the cost is the annihilation of the mentor’s relic. Causal lens holds: each explosion follows because Elias keeps feeding the fire; the final image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and remain stable. One minor loop—“the second explosion came, then the third”—but causality is intact and the ending image is untouched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Workshop, ember nexus glow, and twilight sky are sketched with selective sensory strokes that mirror Elias’s narrowing focus. The broken crozier functions as micro-setting: its snapped shaft is handled twice and finally consumed, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear—bench, crucible, floor—no floating props. Weather/light changes track with internal shift, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“transmute or break”—is signaled early and tightens when he chooses destruction over refinement. One meaningful deepening: realization that failure itself is the path. Cost is legible in the relic’s loss and the risk of self-immolation. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence absent. Sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete arc: alchemy as creative destruction rather than perfection. Subtext resides in the crozier’s transformation from ecclesiastical order to jagged weapon of change. Final image of the twisted shard offers non-literal answer—value lies in the irreversible break, not the intended gold. No sermonizing; resonance is carried by object and fire.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—acid, soot, mercury hiss—without head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Elias didn’t flinch.”), mirroring his newfound steadiness. Diction remains within alchemist’s lexicon; no register drift. Voice is distinct enough to survive the final explosive beat without flattening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. One paraphrase loop on explosions (−0.2) but no scaffold clutter. Opening and closing lines anchor and reweight the stakes cleanly. High information density without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar alchemist trope is refreshed by reframing failure as the intended product; the broken crozier’s sacrificial burn provides specific, non-generic payoff. Risk taken in letting explosions replace human antagonist pays off under the Accumulative lens. Transformation test passed: story collapses if the shard is gold. No close echoes of famous alchemical scenes.</comment>
