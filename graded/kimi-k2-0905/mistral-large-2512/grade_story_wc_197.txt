<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through hoarded truths and the key, but interiority drifts into editorial tag-lines (“tyranny of indifference”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile and step forward register as earned, yet the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table. Cost is present—capture imminent—but the emotional price feels asserted rather than viscerally tasted. Voice remains consistent; competence is balanced by genuine risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: key → hatch → console → broadcast → hesitation of enforcers. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (capture inevitable, but illusion cracked). Orientation is clean within 120 words; the single-scene default is met. One meaningful tightening—uploading the drive—reconfigures the world’s knowledge state. No lens ambiguity; the boot-level resistance plot stays legible throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Auric lagoon, reeds, rusted hatch, and server chamber are sketched with selective sensory detail; starlight on water and damp metal anchor mood without catalog bloat. The “puddle-map” micro-setting directly guides Lira’s path, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent—no impossible moves. Economy is good; only the lagoon’s “liquid fire” flirts with cliché, but the image is immediately functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose erased history—surfaces early and tightens once: the upload narrows options to “press ENTER or fail.” Cost is legible: exposure guarantees capture. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700 words; the enforcers’ hesitation shows the reversal lands. Could use one earlier micro-loss (tool, time) to sharpen tactics, but the beat still bites.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges through action, not sermon: the key, console text, and final white screens reweight meaning. The closing line “so was she” reprises revision as self-authorship—an earned conceptual repricing. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance stays implicit. Ambiguity lingers: will the broadcast take root? Complexity intact, tidy moral absent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Lira; perceptual signature favors light-fracture imagery and tactical cataloging (“coins in a beggar’s cup”). Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly elevated but consistent with a reflective rebel. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay within POV lexicon. Final image of golden path maintains cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences advance multiple jobs (action + atmosphere + interior). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor cluster (“liquid fire,” “golden waters,” “puddles fracturing sky”) risks purple but is brief and functional. Opening and closing lines are sharp; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor: “the slow erasure of the neck itself” is vivid but edges toward epigram; still, it pays off thematically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar dystopia of memory-control is refreshed by the obsolete phone-network MacGuffin and puddle-map navigation. The key’s reprise as literal and symbolic ignition gives specificity. Risk is moderate—linear infiltration, single POV—but execution is confident. No close echoes of famous scenes; the “upload to dying screens” beat feels particular to this world. Could push further into tech or bodily cost for higher band.</comment>
