<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—wanting to remember while denying he needs memory—surfaces early and charges the final renunciation. The embodied “weight of centuries pressing against his ribs” and the micro-choice of whispering stolen names give concrete access to his state. Yet the heartbreak of a reaper is asserted rather than dramatized in relationship; no second character tests him, so the crucible is purely internal and stays one-note. Still, the endurance costs him the atlas monsters and his own voice, producing a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds through repeated naming, listening, and light-fracturing until the blank page reweights meaning. Orientation is swift—who, where, when land in the first 60 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atlas blanks, the beam vanishes, Elias is “silent,” and the cost—his hoarded names are spent—hits on the final line. One minor causality gap: the mechanics by which “scattered light” crystallizes into solid form are not seeded, but the lyric pattern absorbs the moment without breaking the frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory’s dust-choked lenses, groaning dome, and fractured amber beams function as both atmosphere and tool: the prismatic light literally enables the crystallizing act that drains the atlas. Micro-setting—the frayed page, wax cylinders, brass lectern—constrains action: Elias must handle each object to extract names. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and light beams track across the single room. The setting evolves as the beam pierces the dome, charging the final image and meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to give names to nameless fears”—is signaled in paragraph four and tested when Elias must spend his stolen names to quiet the monsters. Pressure tightens through each whispered label; the atlas loses ink, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: the page ends blank, the beam consumes the light he had gathered. Under the Accumulative lens the deepening is sufficient, yet the external risk never escalates beyond the observatory walls, keeping the score below the 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse economy of memory: the dead must be seen, not mourned, and naming is expenditure, not gift. Subtext resides in the silent transfer of ink to voice to blank gold—an unspoken trade that reweights sacrifice from living tears to reaper breath. The final phrase “The stars remember, and so do I” lands as Conceptual Repricing rather than moral assertion, letting the atlas’s blankness argue that remembrance is finite. Ambiguity lingers: whether silence is peace or erasure remains legible but unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: skeletal fingers, hollow bones, the hymn-like pressure against ribs. Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual cadence—“He had come here not to reap, but to remember”—then fractures into imperative whispers, mirroring the light-splitting prism. Diction stays within a necromantic register without slipping into modern abstraction. No dialogue appears; the narrative voice carries subtext through negative space and silence, satisfying the single-POV baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from amber-tinged description to staccato naming beats, propelling the final beam. Figurative density is high but patterned—ink, light, glass, hymn—teaching the reader early and paying off in the crystallized beam. One scaffold loop—“I see you” tripled—reads intentional as incantation rather than redundancy. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clusters obscure causality; the closing image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The reaper-as-archivist angle refreshes familiar psychopomp tropes by coupling cartography with necromancy. Sea monsters as unlabeled fears is not new, but binding them to an astronomer’s atlas and requiring spoken names drained from the dying gives the idea tactile novelty. The risk taken—lyric accretion instead of external jeopardy—mostly succeeds, though the piece edges toward safety by keeping stakes interior. Specificity of wax cylinders and brass lectern anchors the concept in a lived world.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Setup and closure present; middle development limited to interior ritual. Heartbreak is asserted, not relationship-tested, so the element shapes only the final renunciation beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Atlas page drives every beat: discovered, handled, ink consumed, blanked, rolled into pocket. Without it the crystallization and naming sequence collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Sacrifice concept seeded early—“echo of sacrifice hummed in the air”—and reprises when Elias spends his hoarded names, but no secondary cost (pain, memory loss) is dramatized on him.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Forgotten phrases are the currency: he steals them from the dying and must surrender them to the atlas. The trait enables the climax and vanishes with the blank page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Crystallize is the pivotal act that converts scattered light into the beam sealing the monsters. Mechanics lightly glossed, but the verb names the decisive transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Scattered light is signaled in the opening dusk image and returns as the prismatic lens effect that permits crystallization; method and moment are inseparable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Observatory provides the dome aperture for the final beam and the lectern that holds the atlas; architecture enables both the fracturing and the release of light.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Recordings are mentioned as prior catalyst but occur off-page; they tighten backstory, not present tactics, so the live-clock function is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Naming fear is stated motive and is tested when each whispered name depletes his store, forcing the final silence. Desire directly shapes the climax.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Distant intimacy maintained through tactile necromantic detail and restrained interiority; tone modulates from amber melancholy to incantatory hush, charging the blank-page exit.</comment>
