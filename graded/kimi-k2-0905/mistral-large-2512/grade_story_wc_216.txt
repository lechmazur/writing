<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—watch-ticking, dust-tracing, urn-hum—but the moment he decides to “stitch time back together” arrives as declaration, not dramatized contradiction; the cost of becoming keeper is asserted, not embodied. No micro-choice on the page shows him relinquishing a concrete prior want, so the renunciation feels conceptual rather than paid for in flesh.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final tagline “For the one who arrives too soon” reweights the premise from linear to circular time and Elias’s role from seeker to donor. The urn’s glow and the dream woman supply the felt cost, but the causal leap from “found fragment” to “I will seed garage sales” is compressed; one intermediate beat of resistance or failed alternative would have locked the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s jade decay, the cracked-ice glaze, the scent of approaching rain—each detail is filtered through Elias’s haptic obsession with time’s texture and returns in the final image of the restored field. The silo doubles as micro-setting and temporal lung; its dust and echo constrain every action, while the urn fragment literally alters atmospheric density, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rediscover what had been lost” before backward clocks erase personal continuity—tightens when the urn reknits itself after the dream, forcing Elias from observer to donor. The escalation is textural rather than causal: each garage-sale artifact thickens the pattern but never threatens failure or resource loss; the cost is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping pressure just below the 8.8 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the circularity of memory versus the arrow of loss; the urn’s ashes-of-time metaphor reconfigures in the final tagline without moralizing. Subtext resides in the garage-sale elegies—objects carrying strangers’ last moments—yet the story stops short of letting those borrowed memories collide with Elias’s own, leaving thematic resonance rich but not intricate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual gear-grind and synesthetic time-sense; diction (“frayed edges in the dust,” “air thickened into honey”) is consistent and rhythmic. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is high; one clause of abstract self-diagnosis—“by curse, by the weight of seconds”—slips toward label-speak but is immediately re-grounded in tactile image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences vary in length and avoid scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“time slipped like sand” beside “air thickened into honey”—momentarily blurs viscosity, and the phrase “texture of time passing” is repeated without re-inflection, but these are minor artifacts that never touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The backward-counting clocks and garage-sale memory-elegies fuse into a fresh elegiac time-capsule myth; the circular closure feels inevitable yet not borrowed from familiar tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but the specificity of the emerald silo and cracked-ice urn prevents abstraction from drifting into generic surrealism.</comment>
