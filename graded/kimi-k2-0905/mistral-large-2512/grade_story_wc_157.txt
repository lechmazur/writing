<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s reluctant re-entry into subversion is credibly grounded in past trauma; the “spark of defiance” line crystallizes motive. Interiority stays concrete—spectacles fog, breath catches—yet the turn from fear to complicity could carry more embodied friction. Quill’s charm is shown through action (ease under inspection) rather than told, but his personal stakes remain off-page, muting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: gourd → warp plan → first garden message → inevitable spread, each step tightening risk. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias accepts surveillance exposure by pocketing the map; cost is legible in the inspector’s lingering gaze. Orientation is swift—greenhouse, cicadas, taxed-thought city rule by line 6—so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: humidity fogs lenses, vines curl into runes, bees act as pollinating code—each detail later weaponized in the warp scheme. Sensory triangulation (hum, scent, glass) stays filtered through Elias’s entomologist bias. Inspector’s boots on tile provide one sharp auditory anchor that shifts power instantly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent rebellion versus thought-tax regime—tightens when Elias takes the map, trading safety for possibility of exposure. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: inspector visit raises concrete threat, map hand-off forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: Elias’s forced smile and sagging relief show bodily price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: coded beauty as resistance—language hidden in petal twist, basil curl. Final image of “sound only the defiant could hear” reweights the gourd from toy to clarion without moralizing. Subtext in inspector’s narrowed eyes and Quill’s unwavering grin carries the unspoken calculus of risk better than exposition could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person stays close to Elias, perceptual signature filtered through insect-level attention: wings as metronome, spirals as syntax. Compression like “city where thoughts are taxed” teaches world rule in nine words. Dialogue carries subtext—Quill’s “harmless” and inspector’s reminder—without losing natural rhythm; voices remain distinct in diction and tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “living metronome,” “candidly cryptic,” each phrase doing double duty for sound and sense. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; sentences vary in length to mirror cicada hum versus human pause. One mixed image—“symbols shifted as if alive”—is minor but doesn’t cloud causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing botanical steganography with fiscal surveillance feels fresh; the concept commits fully without winking. Transformation test fails if gardens swapped for graffiti—plant biology is integral to encoding. Risk in compressing rebellion into flora pays off: final rattle seed becomes sonic emblem of invisible network, not gimmick.</comment>
