<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is textured—her fingers on the moth wing, the loose knot as tactile signature of “transiently rooted”—but the only pressure she faces is the possibility the butterflies may not arrive. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; she simply watches, records, accepts. The final renunciation feels pre-decided rather than forged under duress, so the cost is elegiac, not personal. Still, her perceptual idiom is consistent and specific enough to clear the 7-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the monarchs lift, the grotto “forgets,” and the signal’s impermanence becomes the felt price. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each fragile structure adds density until the final cadence shift—so the lens is coherent. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no teleporting props or retroactive fixes. One tightening beat suffices at this length, and the ending image (“the space between the beats of a heart”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, moss, and altitude are filtered through Liora’s esoteric gaze; every sensory note (moth-wing iridescence, reed lattice sag) is purposive. The stacked-stone tower and loose-twine knot function as micro-setting objects that constrain her ritual choices and charge the final image when the wind is expected to undo them. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Weather is not just mood but timer—monarchs leave at dusk—so environment shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake: witness and honor the last monarch passage; pressure tightens from solitary arrival to final lift-off. No external antagonist—escalation is Accumulative: each fragile signal heightens the stakes of impermanence. The protagonist’s agency is observational, not interventionist, which caps intensity yet fits the elegiac lens. Cost is conceptual—the signal will dissolve and memory will fade—visible in the final image, satisfying the 8-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through ritual objects that are built to fail; no authorial thesis is declared. Subtext lives in gesture—loose knot, unbound twine—rather than explanation. Final image reweights earlier motifs (moth wing, stacked stones) without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: “they are waiting for the wind to remember” invites multiple readings yet remains anchored in concrete ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Liora’s perceptual signature: “esoteric realist” is enacted via synesthetic detail (shadow weight, name vibration). Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences in calm, clipped fragments at arrival—without drumbeat monotony. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Diction (“transiently rooted,” “blushing stillness”) is character-bound, not ornamental. Compression (“the grotto would forget her”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, atmosphere, and character stance. No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent within the elemental field (stone, wing, wind). One paraphrase loop (“they are not lost… waiting for the wind to remember”) is purposeful reprise, not scaffold. Final paragraph earns its slow fade without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The “temporary signal altar” conceit freshens the familiar climate-elegy; monarch migration framed as interrupted cadence supplies conceptual novelty. Risk is taken with a passive protagonist, yet the choice aligns with theme of witness. Specificity—Oaxaca elder lesson, twine looseness—prevents generic eco-lit template. Transformation test passes: remove Liora’s esoteric realism and the ritual logic collapses.</comment>
