<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena’s grief-stricken vocation is vivid, but her interiority alternates between lyric summary and diagnostic label (“hollowed out”) without embodied contradiction in the garden moment. The stolen thread micro-choice is present, yet the stakes jump from souvenir to kingdom-healing without an intermediate beat that shows her risking anything tangible now. The final renunciation—keep writing, keep burying herself—lands as a restatement of opening stasis rather than a new cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: grief-density increases until the final Charged Poise. Anchors are clear within 120 words; orientation test waived. Closure is valid—she presses the thread into soil, crystallizing her perpetual self-burial—but the cost is conceptually rather than viscerally felt. One causal gap: the thread’s leap from memento to suture is asserted, not dramatized, slightly dulling the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Garden decay is selective and POV-filtered; damp earth scent and spiraling leaves mirror her fatigue without overt symbolism. The golden thread serves as micro-setting/object that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean in the single-scene frame. A hair more tactile interaction with the soil during burial would have tightened environment-to-choice linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she mend the kingdom’s wound—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than narrowing options; no second beat complicates her tactics. The final poise reweights absence as eternal labor, but the price is abstract; no concrete choice is foreclosed on the page. Sufficient for short-form textural escalation, but lacks a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—writing as living burial—emerges via recurring images of weaving, gardens, and hollowed-out breath. Subtext in the thread’s burial is strong: she literalizes the metaphor of stitching lies. The closing image reframes earlier material without moralizing. One near-echo: “obituaries for the living” is restated late; trim would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lena’s fatigue-filtered perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“autumn’s breath curled…too tired to finish”). Rhythm modulates with clause length, mirroring her slowing pulse. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful. Voice never breaks register under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“thread…veins of the earth”—and do not overcluster. One mixed vehicle: “shadows clung…like old grief” adjacent to “thread…hummed” slightly blurs tactile vs. auditory, but not at closure. Strong read-aloud flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The living-obituary conceit is fresh and fused to setting through the carpet thread. Familiar autumn-garden backdrop is re-specificed via loom geography. Risk is moderate—lyric stasis over plot—but coherence justifies the choice. Not transformative enough for top band yet memorable.</comment>
