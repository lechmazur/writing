<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrically specific (“curator of fleeting light”), but the decisive refusal of the train is under-motivated: no prior flaw or fear of permanence is dramatized, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personal. Kael remains a cipher; his “quietly savvy” trait never complicates or endangers the moment. The earned stasis lands, but only on poetic assertion.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the couple’s renunciation of the train crystallizes a new collaborative stance, the jar’s glow supplying visible conceptual cost. Causality is thin—no prior tether to the train’s destination or stakes—yet the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the repeated light imagery tightens into the final shared illumination. One transition (train departure) is legible; orientation is swift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The emerald tiles and moonlit glass give tactile specificity; the station’s spatial logic is tracked cleanly across the single beat. Environment never actively constrains choice (no timetable, guard, or barrier), so the setting decorates rather than pressures. Micro-setting success: the jar-as-lantern reconfigures the platform light, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—steal vs. create light—surfaces early and tightens once: Lira shifts from hoarding to co-creating. The reversal is entirely internal, lacking external friction or forfeiture; cost is aesthetic, not tactical. Situational lens: coherent pressure of the departing train forces stance crystallization, but coincidence (meeting Kael) supplies the pivot rather than prior agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—light as collaborative memory—emerges through the jar’s re-illumination rather than authorial statement. Subtext in flower code is hinted but never decoded, muting thematic depth. Final image of merged shadows offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test for non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lira’s perceptual filter: synesthetic metaphors (“windows glowing like fireflies trapped in glass”) are consistent and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates from long, breathy sentences to fragmentary exchanges under pressure. No dialogue over-articulates; Kael’s indirection suits the flower-code premise. Clean free-indirect control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but not purple; each image advances atmosphere or character. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Occasional stacked similes risk overwriting (“golden-hour portrait thief… curator of fleeting light”) yet remain within lyrical contract taught in opening. Final paragraph breathes, letting the image carry closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Moonbeam theft and floral cryptography synthesize into a fresh metaphoric engine; the trope of “last-train decision” is subverted by staying on the platform. Conceptual risk—light as collaborative art—pays off in the final shared glow. Slight deduction for Kael’s under-developed interiority, which keeps the emotional calculus one-sided.</comment>
