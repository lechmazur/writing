<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is viscerally embodied (the heart’s ticking as “metronome for guilt”), and his decision to act is credibly foreshadowed. The internal contradiction—priest of forgiveness now needing justice—drives every beat. Kael remains functional, but the single-scene focus keeps relational pressure minimal yet sufficient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: discovery of heart → doubt → second opinion → resolve to prove innocence. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elias steps into rain clutching the heart, abandoning safe absolution for uncertain justice. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shop’s lemon-oil scent, ticking shelves, and Kael’s spider-leg fingers are selective and POV-colored. The heart itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Storm light breaking through clouds is reprised as the last image, recharging the opening atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s complicity in a wrongful execution—tightens when Kael confirms the heart was post-mortem. One meaningful reversal: “It’s not meant for the living” collapses Elias’s self-absolution and forces active restitution. Cost is legible: he exchanges clerical safety for public accusation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of absolution versus justice emerges through the heart’s literal inability to beat for the living. Final image of rain and light reframes earlier “broken promises” without moralizing. Subtext in Kael’s silence and the heart’s ticking lets guilt resonate off-page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is metallic, ecclesiastical, guilt-ridden. Syntax lengthens under pressure then fractures—“rain slicing… like a blade”—mirroring resolve. No head-hopping; Kael’s dialogue carries subtext (“What will you do now?”) without stealing focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from measured opening to staccato final paragraph. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful: “time itself were a thread he could unravel” fits Kael’s deliberation. No loops or scaffold; pronouns clean. One near-miss: “weight pressing against his ribs” borders cliché but is immediately re-seized by the heart image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clockwork heart as evidence of post-mortem implant is fresh noir-meets-gothic. Priest protagonist forced into detective role flips the usual “clerical confession” trope. Risk is moderate; concept stays internally consistent, though the vanished-surgeon backstory nods to familiar mad-scientist beats.</comment>
