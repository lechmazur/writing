<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s occupation-driven need to map the “singular convergence” is concrete, but interiority drifts into atmospheric lyric rather than contradictory impulse; the final demand to reach the lake-center is earned yet the keeper’s single muttered line is too slight to test status or motive under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lake journey crystallizes options with conceptual cost—the ice may remember or forget, narrowing her atlas certainties; causal chain (message → phrasebook → pattern → demand) holds, though keeper’s late entrance slightly dilutes motivation clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frozen outpost, splintered barrel, condensation map, and blank atlas page are selective, pressure-responsive details; the lake’s white expanse and rusted beams constrain movement and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate origin where maps collapse—tightens when condensation reveals a temporal map, foreclosing desk-bound safety; escalation is textural (pattern density) rather than causal reversal, but cost is legible: she risks the unseen blank labeled “nothing.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of readable absence (“nothing” as unseen) emerges through recurring blanks—empty lake page, smudged ink, condensation map—without moralizing; final image reweights “Here be nothing” as invitation, not void, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains crisp, map-maker perceptual signature—precise yet metaphoric; rhythmic control in “ice forgets / ice remembers” counter-point; no head-hop, no filter-stack, voice modulates from observational cool to quietly charged conviction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—each sentence layers chill, object, and thought; occasional poetic overlap (“weight of silence,” “bloom on the windowpane”) flirts with overwriting but stays purposeful; no loops, clean grammar, prop tracking intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Cartographer chasing a lacustrine origin-point feels fresh; condensation-as-temporal-map and phrasebook marginalia transform familiar Arctic-gothic tropes; risk in blank-page ontology pays off, though falcon herald edges toward stock mystic device.</comment>
