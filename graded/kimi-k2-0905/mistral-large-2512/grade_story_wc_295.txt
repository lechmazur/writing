<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is evocative—"fingers trembling not from the cold"—but the decisive shift from solitary decoder to communal caller is declared rather than dramatized; we never see him weigh the personal cost of surrendering interpretive authority, so the closure feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative pattern (three dreams → telegram → epiphany) tightens once when he realizes the inscription is "an invitation," producing a Resonant Reconfiguration; causality is soft—dreams supply knowledge without testing agency—yet the lens holds and the cost (loss of sole ownership) is legible in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Iron observatory ribs, brass eyepiece, and brittle daylily petals are sharply filtered through Elias’s professional gaze; the dome’s midnight groan mirrors his internal pressure, and the telegram’s texture returns to charge the final image—environment consistently constrains mood and choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stake—"decode or be crushed by the burden"—is clear early; pressure intensifies once when dreams converge on the temple, but the escalation is informational rather than tactical; no visible resource is lost or risked, so the tightening is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared burden emerges through the shifting valence of the daylily (fleeting → communal) and the inscription’s reversal; no moral is stated, but the insight feels slightly abstract because the communal solution is projected, not tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains astronomical precision—"light bending through the observatory’s lens"—with rhythmic, slightly archaic cadence that suits the guild world; no POV slippage, and psychic distance compresses effectively under the midnight bell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive—"the stars wheeling in their ancient dance"—with only minor filter-verb clusters; no mixed metaphors or loops, and paragraph cuts are purposeful; one scaffold phrase ("the dreams had been trying to tell him") could be trimmed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lucid-dream chronicler as healer-linguist is fresh, and linking star-maps to shifting temple glyphs offers a novel epistemic frame; the communal turn, while thematically satisfying, is conceptually foreseeable, muting the surprise quotient.</comment>
