<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is sketched in lyrical abstractions (“broken-hearted,” “chest tighten”) rather than embodied contradiction; the button choice is passive finding, not a pressured micro-decision, so the final note-writing feels predetermined, not costly. No interior clash is staged in-scene; empathy substitutes for agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the returned button + note reweights the archive’s purpose under Accumulative lens. Causality is thin—postcard discovery is serendipitous—but the pattern of dust-to-postcard accumulation is taught early and pays off in the final image with felt cost (“weight…no longer a burden”), satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>File-room dust, glue scent, and button tactility anchor POV attention and constrain action (Elias reads grief through smudges). The boarding-house shard reuses sensory selectivity (“sharp eyes and a soft voice”). Environment never forces a tactical change, so capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Daniel’s erased humanity—signals early. Pressure escalates only once: button → boarding-house → postcard; each step is luck, not Elias’s active trade-off. No option narrows; cost is retrospective sentiment, not a foreclosed path, keeping entry mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of archival resurrection emerges through concrete particulars (dust, brass, postcard). Final note avoids moralizing; resonance rests in the image of returning the button. Ambiguity lingers—did Daniel find peace or merely escape—yielding plausible counter-readings, though emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature filters world through archival melancholy (“yellowed paper and old glue”). Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Elias’s contemplative register; postcard dialogue is brief, idiomatic, sub-textual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional softeners (“the thought made Elias’s chest tighten”) flirt with cliché but are isolated. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph achieves cadence lift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Foster-care archive + WWI button is fresh combinatorial space; accumulation-of-dust-as-reading-method supplies a specific, non-obvious procedural. Yet the plot arc—lonely archivist finds postcard proving orphan survived—leans on familiar sentimental scaffolding, muting risk. Specificity of dust-reading keeps it above mid-band.</comment>
