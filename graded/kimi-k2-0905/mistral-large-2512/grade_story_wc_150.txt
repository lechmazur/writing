<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“warmly curious hum settled in my chest”), actions track with motive, and the final kneeling is earned. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, and the 20-year gap is asserted rather than dramatized, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each unearthed fragment tightens the stake of “restore lost faith.” Closure lands with CR—roots blooming from bones re-weight the premise. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image. Orientation is clean by line 3; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is tactile, smells of myrrh, and constrains movement; the sundial pedestal literally shapes the final act. Selective detail—pomegranate roots on finger bones—mirrors interior state without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (sandal, censer) doubles as plot engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore lost faith”—is signaled early and deepens through each unearthed relic. The seventh-day tightening (placing relic triggers bloom) is a single decisive intensification; no second reversal is needed. Cost is conceptual but visible in the blooming bone mosaic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the orchard’s inversion: faith is not rebuilt but revealed as still-living root. Final image of green roots threading skeletons reweights earlier “interrupted journey” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the goddess real or projection? Resonance sticks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice is textured, rhythmic (“salt spray stung… but I barely noticed”), and stays within diaspora returnee’s perceptual range. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Compression in days-bled-into-nights montage is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no scaffold loops. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. High information density: “library of the dead” collapses setting, stake, and metaphor in three words. No artifacts touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Necropolis orchard + sundial relic + living roots through bones synthesizes tropes into fresh mythic archaeology. Risky enchantment is sustained without ironic retreat. The “faith as living root” reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
