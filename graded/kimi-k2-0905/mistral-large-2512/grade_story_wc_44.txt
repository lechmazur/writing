<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora’s curiosity is clear, but her interiority stays generic: “she understood,” “she smiled” substitute for embodied contradiction. The key turn—accepting shadow reclamation—lacks micro-choice dramatized on the page; agency is asserted, not shown. No cost stains her body or future; she exits unchanged except for knowledge. The journal/hand that isn’t human hints at status tension, yet no second character applies live pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: key discovery → journal clue → descent → mirror revelation → key-turn → shadow return. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: shadows re-enter the world, reweighting reality; cost is cosmological, not personal. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The “because” links tighten once; sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating isle, brass telescope, ozone scent, and mirror-chamber are sketched with selective sensory strokes that feed mood. The observatory’s circular depression and key-slot constrain the decisive action, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking stays coherent through descent. Detail never stalls momentum; world rules remain internally consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled early. Escalation is single-cycle: mirrors reveal personal shadow fragments, forcing recognition. The tightening narrows options from investigation to reclamation, but the price is off-loaded onto the world, not the protagonist, limiting felt cost. Agency is present but low-stakes for Liora herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation versus erasure emerges through mirror images and returned shadows; no moral is stated. Subtext lives in the guardian’s cracked-window voice and ink-spill release. Final image of unbroken noon shadows reconfigures meaning without sermon. Complexity is present but leans conceptual rather than emotionally textured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is light but consistent—brass eyepiece, rune etchings, ozone scent filtered through scholar-bent attention. No head-hopping. Syntax modulates from measured descent to short release at shatter moment. Voice avoids generic fantasy cadence; diction stays within rune-scholar lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; occasional minor scaffold (“she understood,” “she smiled”) slightly dulls final beat. Metaphors are coherent—ink into water, cracked-window voice—and do not clog high-pressure moment. Sentence variety propels descent. One paraphrase loop costs −0.2; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Shadow-eating noon and spoon-bent reality fracture offer fresh cosmology; spoon callback is brief but memorable. Mirrors reflecting lost shadow-selves refigures familiar trope into personal reclamation. Concept commits fully without late rule patches. Risk is moderate; emotional payoff could be sharper, but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
