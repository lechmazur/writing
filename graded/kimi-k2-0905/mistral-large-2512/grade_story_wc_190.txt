<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet expertise and embodied micro-choices (watching the vial, poling to stillness) give him credible interiority; the passenger’s arc is thinner, sketched mostly through Elias’s diagnosis rather than her own contradictory impulses. The final “thank you” signals relief but no visible cost or irreversible change for either rider, so the closure feels gentle rather than earned under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single scene, single POV, clean orientation by 50 words; the Accumulative/Textural pattern (spiraling glass, prismatic light, returning whistle) tightens once when Elias stops the boat and the glass stills, landing a Charged-Poise closure with felt quiet as cost. No causal reversals are required under this lens; the deepening cadence suffices and is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prism terrace, floating lanterns, and the storm-glass micro-setting are sensuously filtered through Elias’s professional eye; the glass’s shifting liquid physically mirrors the passenger’s tension and charges the final still image. Spatial choreography is clear across the single gondola space; environment guides the choice to drift and listen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence be taught to comfort?—is signaled early; pressure escalates once when the glass darkens and Elias halts the boat, forcing the passenger to endure stillness. The tightening is textural, not causal, fitting the lens; cost is the shared vulnerability of remaining un-filled, not an irreversible loss, so intensity plateaus just shy of high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accruing pattern of refracted light, hush, and the glass’s stillness; no character moralizes. The final image reweights the premise: comfort is not injected into silence but discovered inside it—an insight earned through the passenger’s bodily exhale and the glass’s visible arrest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature (pressure shifts, lantern gleams on water); syntax lengthens and shortens with the gondola’s glide. No dialogue over two lines, yet each exchange carries subtext; the woman’s single laugh dissolving “like sugar in water” is vivid, idiomatic, and voice-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: selective metaphors (light as needle and thread) serve the beat, no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“silence had learned to comfort” repeated in closing lines—dings −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with the scene, information density stays high, and no filter-verb clusters stall immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fantastical prism terrace and empathic barometer glass freshen the familiar “wounded stranger on a boat” frame; the speculative water-city and meteorological vial feel specific rather than bolted on. Conceptual risk is moderate—quiet as palpable weather—but execution commits fully, yielding a memorable, non-generic miniature.</comment>
