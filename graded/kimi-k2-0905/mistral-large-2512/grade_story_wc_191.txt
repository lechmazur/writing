<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra’s motive—save a fracturing world—remains abstract; no concrete symptom of collapse appears, so the cost of refusal never lands. Interiority is atmospheric (“pulse quickened,” “breath misting”) rather than contradictory or embodied under threat. The final sit-down is earned only by riddle logic, not by a prior micro-choice that visibly risks anything personal. She never misreads, hesitates, or forfeits an alternative path; the throne simply accepts her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: mural clue → peel → stair → throne. Orientation is swift; kaleidoscopic waterfall and silver leaves anchor us by line 5. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn light reweights the grove—yet the cost is world-abstract, not character-sharp. No persistent constraint or price is carried forward by Veyra herself.</comment>

<comment>Neon Grove is rendered through motion—water parting, flake drifting, bark peeling—so description never stalls plot. The living-wood throne and pulsing fruit are tactile, not tourist postcard. Micro-setting (ruby flake in palm) literally unlocks the staircase, satisfying the 9+ gate. One minor slip: “city of glass and steel” flash is unmoored from POV’s knowledge horizon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“world unraveling without steward”—is declared, never dramatized; no on-page symptom escalates. Pressure plate is the mural test; it deepens knowledge but costs her nothing tangible (time, blood, ally, tool). The sunrise deadline appears only in the final paragraph, too late to tighten tactics. Escalation is intellectual, not consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “seeing beyond surfaces” emerges organically via peeling paint and shifting murals; no character sermonizes it. Final image of dawn-bathed orchard reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Yet theme stays single-note; no counter-reading or personal cost complicates Veyra’s ascension. Ambiguity is present but thin because stakes are cosmic, not intimate.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited voice is consistent, lyric, and filtered through a tech-archivist’s eye: “cracked lenses,” “ozone and old magic.” Syntax flexes—long breathy sentences for wonder, clipped fragments for discovery. No head-hop or register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice carries all; occasional poetic overlap (“kaleidoscopic waterfall roared”) edges toward purple but stays within POV’s wonder threshold.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive, sentences vary, no scaffold loops. Figurative layering is dense—prismatic sheets, liquid stained glass—but pattern is taught early and sustained. One mixed metaphor: “water parting like old parchment” conflates liquid and paper. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or plot. No typos or tense slips.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combining biopunk neon botanics with root-throne myth feels fresh, not checklist. “Peel of paint revealing murals” is a tactile, non-digital puzzle that subverts typical key-and-lock. Transformation test passes: swap setting or object and the riddle collapses. Risk is moderate; could push further by letting the grove fight back or demand sacrifice.</comment>
