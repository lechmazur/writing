<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory yet surrendering it—are dramatized in the final beat; the cost of forgetting her brother’s voice is felt on the page. “Patchwork Girl” is more label than lived, but the embodied gesture of opening her palm sells the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into therapy-speak. One more micro-choice mid-scene would have pushed her to 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the seed takes the memory, roots tremble, Liora walks away lighter-heavier—cost is visible and irreversible. Causal chain holds: burned card → stranger → seed → forfeited memory → orchard response. Orientation is swift: underground, night, single POV within first 60 words. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop—it demands the bargain, drinks the memory, and its root-tremor certifies the deal. Sensory triad (wet earth, rot, dusky glow) is filtered through Liora’s urgency, never touristic. Spatial ground holds: she crouches, stranger steps, seed vanishes—bodies track clean. Environment literally rewrites destiny; without it the story collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve brother—narrows to “keep his voice or save him”; the tightening is the stranger’s price. One decisive reversal: she yields the memory, options foreclose instantly. Pressure is causal, personal, final. A visible price (card → dust, memory → void) alters tactics on the spot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: memory as the un-patchable hole; the more you sew, the wider the tear. Subtext in the orchard’s ledger of bones—some debts can’t be rebalanced. Final image of “lighter soul, heavier absence” reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; silence does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter: marrow-scent clings to throat, card edges “like scorhed petals.” Rhythm accelerates into short clauses as the bargain snaps shut. No head-hop; stranger’s dialogue is leaf-skitter, not ventriloquism. Voice is consistent, compressed, lyric—yet always in her body.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath of opener, staccato at hand-off. Figurative load is high but patterned—orchard as lung, card as petal—taught early and paid off in root-tremor. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor (“ledger of lives” beside “marrow of the dead”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Underworld arboretum fed by traded memories feels fresh, yet grows from ancient bargain myths. The tarot-as-seed, memory-as-water twist is inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: quiet renunciation instead of rescue—stakes invert genre expectation. Specificity of “moth-wing cloak” and “black void seed” anchors the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
