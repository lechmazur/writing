<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ren’s quiet philosopher-mender persona is consistent, but the interior contradiction promised by “demure audacity” is only asserted, never dramatized in a micro-choice; the final invitation to Mei is sweet but cost-free, so the arc feels more mood-shift than earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: two figures poised on the parapet, life patterns re-weighted by companionship; the cost is the solitude Ren relinquishes, felt in the final hush. Causality is light—Mei’s arrival is externally triggered by her own whim, not Ren’s prior actions—so the lens stays Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal, but the image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mountain village, rain-slick stones, firefly constellations, and the bamboo whisk as micro-setting are vividly filtered through Ren’s mender-eye; the parapet’s height and whispering wind materially shape the final hush, giving the closing image its hush-charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stake—Ren’s desire to share his hidden-pattern world—only surfaces once Mei appears; pressure is gentle and one-directional (she arrives, he asks her to stay) without a narrowing choice or trade-off, so escalation is atmospheric rather than consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of “seeing invisible effort” is threaded through nets, moon paths, and the whisk, but the final emotional re-weighting is left implicit; the sketch gift is lovely yet states its meaning aloud, slightly blunting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Ren’s tactile, wind-borne perceptions; syntax is calm, slightly elliptical, mirroring a mender’s patience; no head-hopping, and the hush-toned diction holds steady through the final invitation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold, only one mixed metaphor (“moon path pooled on stones”). Sensory nouns and strong verbs carry the lift; paragraph cuts are purposeful, propelling the quiet accretion toward the final shared stillness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The “net-mender philosopher” angle freshens the familiar mountain-romance frame, and the whisk-as-telescope-on-patterns is a nice specific inflection, but the overall arc—loner joined by perceptive beloved—remains within expected contours without a surprising turn.</comment>
