<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile world is vivid—his fingers “tracing the cracked ceramic plate,” feeling the drone “like a second heartbeat”—and the final release of the bird crystallizes his quiet authority. The interior contradiction between serene certainty and the risk of irreversible failure is present but underplayed; a sharper moment of doubt would have pushed him past the 9-line. Mara functions mainly as witness; her one micro-choice (handing the tool) is too light to act as crucible. Still, the earned stasis lands with cost: the drone’s pulse now matches the ship he can never see depart.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the returned drone’s steady pulse re-weights the earlier “stutters and gaps” into navigable direction, proving Elias’s credo on the page. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each tactile repair beat thickens stakes until the water-refraction test gives permission to launch. The single causal micro-turn (drone leaves / drone returns) is sufficient for 700-word scale. Cost is felt in the final image: the humming wings against his palm while the ship vanishes beyond sight—an irreversible parting he chose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The depot’s salt-oil air, still basin, and creaking anchor chain are filtered through Elias’s non-visual senses, constraining every decision. The water feature is not backdrop but tool: its unrippled surface withholds approval until the instant he dunks his fingers—an environmental gate that directly governs launch. Mist softens distances and justifies the drone’s sonic mapping, knitting atmosphere to plot. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies, drone, and ship remain trackable without visual cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the drone’s broken feedback before the ship sails—is signaled early and tightens once: still water → ripples → launch. The pressure is situational but coherent: the literal rising anchor sets an external clock that cannot be negotiated. Elias’s agency is expressed through patient patching and the final refraction test; the cost is the unspoken possibility that the drone never returns and the mapping dies with him. A slightly higher pulse of jeopardy—one dropped tool, one snapped filament—would have nudged this into the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the transmutation of absence into guidance: blindness and data-noise alike become navigable when attended to on their own terms. The refrain “feedback isn’t noise” is spoken once and then embodied by the drone’s return, avoiding thematic echo penalty. Subtext resides in gesture—the shared breath, the brush of fingers—rather than exposition. Final image reweights the premise: the unseen horizon is not loss but completed circuit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s tactile ear: “his breath steady despite the weight,” “the hum…a quiet, rhythmic pulse.” Syntax lengthens during calm, then shortens at launch—“He released the hummingbird”—mirroring heartbeat. No filter-verb stacks; every verb is kinesthetic. Dialogue is sparse and idiomatic, distinguishing Mara’s practical diction from Elias’s oracular brevity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, each sentence doing double duty: “mist curled…softening the clatter” sets both soundscape and metaphoric softness. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; the single extended metaphor of pulse/heartbeat/anchor chain is sustained without strain. Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph lengths breathe. Only a faint cadence repetition (“the drone… the drone…”) keeps this from a 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blind engineer who maps by sound and ripple, the hummingbird drone that listens to chains—these are fresh yet inevitable syntheses of steampunk and sensory ethnography. Tropes (maiden voyage, sentient drone) are re-wired through tactile epistemology. Risk is taken in quietude: no villain, no explosion, only the wager of interpretation. The concept feels singular, not checklist-assembled.</comment>
