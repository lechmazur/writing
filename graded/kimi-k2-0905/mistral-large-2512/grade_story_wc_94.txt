<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile engagement with railing and timer, the laugh swallowed by storm—but the photograph never tests him in a visible choice; he only “waits” and then “turns away,” so the cost is atmospheric rather than embodied. The contradictory impulse (to read vs. to carry unread) is named late but not dramatized under pressure, keeping the arc just short of earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map is not decoded but pocketed, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (“some maps were never meant to be read, only carried”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm, timer, photograph layer until the final lightning flash reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; causality is intact, though the tightening beat is single and interior.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass railing, storm-lashed glass, and the timer’s warm plastic are selective, body-scaled anchors that constrain gesture and attention. Lightning’s flash literally enables the pattern recognition beat; the micro-setting (photograph held to flickering light) charges the final image. Weather stays causally active, never postcard backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he decipher or accept the map of scars?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: lightning flash reveals the pattern, foreclosing the need to decode and shifting him to carrier stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, sufficient for this length but not multi-beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cartography-as-survival emerges through concrete scars-as-territory image rather than statement. Final line’s refusal to read the map offers resonant, non-moral answer to the envelope’s question. Ambiguity lingers without confusion—borders vs. land stays unsettled, earned through sensory particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is poet-sensory (“as if it were the spine of a book he could not yet read”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, breath-held sentences break into staccato realization. No head-hopping; register stays within Elias’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; mixed metaphors are controlled (“storm outside was furiously tranquil” is taught early and paid off). One paraphrase loop (“he had come here not to observe… but to wait… though for what, he wasn’t entirely sure”) could be trimmed. Otherwise density is high, rhythm varied, no scaffold in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusing censored poet, darkroom timer, and scar-cartography yields fresh angle on embodied memory. Stormlit observatory as exile-watchtower feels specific rather than borrowed. Risk is present—lyric stillness over plot—but coherence holds.</comment>
