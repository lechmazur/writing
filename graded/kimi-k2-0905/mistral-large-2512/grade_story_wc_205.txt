<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic preservation vs. revolutionary destruction—are dramatized in the shard-handling and mirror-ritual beats; the final renunciation (exhausted collapse while clutching the shard) is earned and visibly costly. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is Liora’s functional flatness; she serves more as thematic foil than pressure source, so relationship-as-crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors blank, Elias spent, the asteroid’s voice restored—cost is legible in his rasp and empty glass. Causal chain holds: shard → ritual → voiced verse → Core team halted. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices; no teleporting props or causal amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The shard functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; its light angles dictate mirror placement and final ritual success. Baroque asteroid is sketched via selective barbs—“ribs of some great beast”—rather than catalog. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s poet-eye: light fracture over acoustics. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the civilization’s poetic memory—signaled early. Escalation: academic erasure → mirror ritual → voiced verse; each step narrows Elias’s physical stamina and Liora’s options. Cost is cumulative and visible (shaking hands, shallow breath). No coincidence resolves; the storm complicates but the ritual converts it into resource.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory versus data—emerges through the shard’s journey from souvenir to conduit; no final sermon. Subtext in Liora’s silence at dawn implies concession without statement. Final image reweights prior material: blank mirrors = erased spreadsheets, but now also empty palimpsest ready for verse. Ambiguity lingers—will the Core really stop?—yet feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s poet-perceiver: “light fractured through the shard” is idiosyncratic noticing. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for nostalgia, staccato during ritual. No head-hopping; Liora’s interior is never breached. Register consistent—no corporate drift. Dialogue sparse but subtextual: “You’re erasing it” carries entire ideological clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with diverse syntactic shapes. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Strong verbs (“slumped,” “rippling”) replace modifiers. One mixed metaphor catch: “sky writhing with visible threads of time” is borderline, but context teaches the temporal-storm rule early, so clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines temporal-storm, baroque asteroid, and poetry-as-data in a synthesis that feels specific to this text. Mirror-coverage ritual is fresh inversion of vampire trope—here the danger is recursive memory, not death. Risk taken with lyric closure instead of physical showdown; coherence maintained. Not a recombinant checklist; the shard’s reprise makes the turn feel inevitable.</comment>
