<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory fear/regret cycle is embodied (shallow breath, clutching shard, pressing it to scar). Micro-choices—wiping droplets, speaking into humid dark—track value hierarchy with cost. Apparition functions as projected self under pressure, forcing crystallized stance. Earned softening of scar and shift from failure to “first step” land as tangible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of condensation messages, shard pulses, and song density tightens stakes until spoken confession reweights regret. Closure is Charged Poise—options re-cast, apology still unsent yet no longer failure. Persistent constraint (shard’s weight, spirit vigil) shapes final image. Cost: acknowledgment of fear aloud in hostile liminal space, felt immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mangrove roots, brackish water, and boardwet condensation act as proximate cage; every tactile detail is filtered through Liora’s regret-narrowed attention. Shard serves micro-setting, constraining when she presses it to flesh and later glows in reflection. Spatial choreography clean: crouch, wipe, stand, tuck—bodies track without drift. Atmosphere mirrors internal humidity without overt symbolism, charging final “cool moisture” touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberation from unsent regret—signals early and intensifies via spirit chorus and droplet warnings tightening the noose. One decisive deepening: speaking fear aloud shifts song to “relief,” reconfiguring value of letter. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. Visible price: apparition’s touch leaves cooling trace, marking irrevocable exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as self-drowning vs. speech as imperfect survival. Subtext lives in droplet words and shard pulse—meanings accrue without exposition. Final shift from “too late” to “try” offers resonant non-verdict. Complexity preserved: apology remains future work, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains perceptual signature saturated by humidity, salt, and stone warmth. Syntax coils like roots—long sentences for breathless canopy, fragments under shard pulse. Free indirect flow avoids filter verbs; diction stays within her sensibility. Dialogue minimal, indirection carries weight; voice never drifts into editorial gloss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Information density high: “roots twisted like the fingers of a drowning man” fuses scene, threat, theme in one stroke. Rhythm modulates—suspension in repeated sibilance, then curt breath at climax. No loops or scaffold; each image advances pressure. Metaphors remain coherent to water-and-stone logic through closing glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar regret/redemption arc made fresh via mangrove-spirit medium and condensation messaging that literalizes unspeech. Shard as memory engine with conditional moon-healing offers specific physics without exposition dump. Stakes stay intimate yet cosmic through lyric overlay. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing metaphorical chassis.</comment>
