<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet, tactile curiosity is vivid; the sand-grain micro-choice at the end crystallizes his renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only stated, so the final acceptance feels slightly under-causal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc—arrive, witness, record, let go—lands a clean Earned Stasis: he switches the suit lights off, leaving the crater to its fate. Orientation is immediate; closure beat carries visible cost (“he turned off his suit’s lights”). No causal gaps; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lunar summit is not backdrop but tool: the unspoiled rim, Earth-glare, and vacuum silence directly shape the choice to extinguish his lights. Micro-setting of the vial and cobalt strip constrain tactile action and timing. Final image is charged by environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last untouched place via photograph—tightens when he realizes the photo must substitute for the crater itself. One meaningful deepening: the chemical strip externalizes time’s passage and the inevitability of loss. Cost is legible in the final darkened walk-back.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence vs. witness emerges through the photo/crater substitution and the color-shifting strip; no explicit thesis stated. Final image reweights the premise: preservation is now an act of letting go. Resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains lunar-geologist perceptual signature—dust cling, nickel traces, Earth-glare—throughout. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to the clipped final departure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“blue light bleeding…slow-dying ember”) is selective and image-driven. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“slow creep of light…turning shadows into ghosts”) barely grazes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar “last pristine spot” trope is refreshed by lunar context and the chemical-strip timer; the photograph-as-preservation inversion feels specific to this voice. Risk is quiet but coherent—no gimmicks, just precise stakes.</comment>
