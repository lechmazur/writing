<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s regret over the woman is embodied in the ache that “never quite healed,” and the invitation forces a micro-choice that finally externalizes his empathy. The interior contradiction—devotion to rules vs. compulsion to follow—drives the beat that sends him into the night. Cost is legible: he forfeits the safety of marginal life. Yet the beat count is thin; one more pressured moment before departure would have shown the trait altering tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: invitation → memory → map → exit, each step a because/therefore linkage that narrows options. The midnight clock supplies a hard external deadline, making the final stride a Decisive Change with felt cost—he abandons the library that defined him. Orientation is clean within 120 words; spatial anchors (narrow door, paradox shelf) are concrete. The reflective paragraph on the woman is the allowed 20 % and tilts present choice, so BRR is satisfied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Beeswax-and-parchment scent, impossible spiral shelves, and the humming silence tome are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias’s curator gaze. The map-book reconfigures city streets into a labyrinth that literally routes the final action—setting constrains choice and charges the exit image. No sensory checklist; each detail either mirrors solitude or enables the paradox logic. Micro-setting (invitation, map) carries the weight normally given to city geography, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he break the rule of retreat?—is signaled by the singed invitation and tightens when the paradox shelf delivers the map. One meaningful escalation: the clock striking midnight collapses deliberation into action, foreclosing the option to hide. Cost is visible: he steps into “empty streets,” forfeiting sanctuary. Pressure is coherent but single-note; a second obstacle (locked door, guardian, weather) would have raised the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—wisdom lies in the mistake you return to—emerges through the returned invitation and the map that literalizes the woman’s absence. Subtext operates in the invitation’s riddle and the final “some mistakes are meant to be unmade,” which reweights the premise without moralizing. The humming silence book and the paradox shelves echo the theme of unheard consequence. No tidy moral; the city’s paused emptiness leaves ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “scent he had come to associate with solitude,” “hands…moved with a gentleness.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then shortens into the final stride, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice is carried by cadence and diction; “enlarged tranquility” risks elevated register but reads as Elias’s own paradoxical calm. Distinct texture sustained; no head-hop or filter-verb stack.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “truths folded into themselves like origami” does triple duty—metaphor, character lens, theme. One paraphrase loop—“never quite healed” echoing “quiet ache”—is purposeful, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beat. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve by image. Minor: “enlarged tranquility” could feel overwritten to some ears but fits the paradox mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The secret-library-as-origami-paradox is a fresh inflection on the hidden-archive trope; the map that rewrites city streets into a labyrinth literalizes internal regret. Risk is taken by making the climax a quiet departure rather than confrontation, and it pays off under the causal lens. The woman remains off-stage, so the emotional center is not yet proven unique; still, the synthesis of alchemical paradox + urban labyrinth + empathetic recluse feels specific to this piece.</comment>
