<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s lock-sentinel expertise is shown through tactile micro-choices (hairpin pry, silent footfall) and a single interior contradiction—years of guarding locks now weaponized against the fort—giving her a credible, embodied arc. The aide’s brief appearance still registers status tension and triggers her decisive theft. Cost is visible: she forfeits her sentinel identity the instant she palms the parchment. Competence is high yet balanced by the blackout’s real risk; no diagnostic self-talk mars the crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blackout → aide plants note → Mira intercepts → torch signal sparks revolt. Orientation lands within 60 words; no penalty. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—her torch left behind crystallizes the irreversible shift from guardian to insurgent. The cost is legible in the final image: fort glow at her back, city silence ahead, world holding breath.</comment>

<comment>Bioluminescent moss, brass goggles, and the quill holder’s hidden compartment are concrete, tactile, and filter through Mira’s professional eye. Spatial choreography is flawless: shadows, sconces, armory racks track without drift. The moss-light both guides and betrays her, constraining stealth options. Micro-setting (the holder’s weight, torch flare) directly charges the closure image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the governor’s city-burning plot—tightens once: intercepted parchment forecloses Mira’s neutrality. Escalation is causal: each beat (aide’s drop, her theft, torch signal) narrows her options and raises exposure. Visible price: abandonment of her post, torch left as evidence. No coincidence resolves; the aide merely complicates. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges silently: institutional loyalty versus systemic betrayal, shown through locks, lights, and the torch Mira once guarded now turned fuse. Subtext lives in gesture—her fingers tracing runes she will soon violate. No moralizing final line; the world holding breath invites reader reckoning. Ambiguity is purposeful: revolution may save or raze the city.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual lens: rune-etched goggles, dying-moss heartbeat, “winking hush” smile. Syntax tightens under pressure—single-word sentences when the door creaks. No head-hop; the aide’s intent is read solely through Mira’s senses. Distinctive diction (“luminous fort,” “cradle of sparks”) remains consistent and motivated by her cipher-trained mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse, patterned, and paid off—“dying heartbeat” echoes in the final held breath. Strong verbs (“pried,” “slipped,” “flared”) replace modifiers. One mixed moment—“pulse a quiet drum in her throat”—is minor amid otherwise precise embodiment. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy-heist fusion feels fresh: lock-sentinel turned saboteur via bronze stationery. Cipher-read through half-painted sundial angles is a specific, non-obvious method. Torch-as-signal subverts the usual “steal the key” trope. While “blackout during tyranny” is familiar, the bioluminescent fort and moss-light surveillance give it a localized inflection that would collapse if swapped out.</comment>
