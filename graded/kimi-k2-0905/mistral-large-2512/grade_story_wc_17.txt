<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity is visceral—his fingers on warm stone, the diary strap bite—but the final beat (“he understood then”) is told, not embodied. Interior contradiction is hinted (curiosity vs dread) yet never forced into a costly micro-choice on the page. The father obsession motivates entry, but the closing hand-hover lacks a visible stake-shift tied to Elias’s own flaw or limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing map reconfigures legacy from knowledge to warning with conceptual cost. Causal chain—diary coordinates → corridor → woman → map—holds; the negative motivates forward motion and pays off in her presence. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible (“the walls… tired of being forgotten”) but could be sharper if Elias forfeited a live option (retreat, destroy the map, etc.).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ivy, warm stone, ozone, and scorched-leaf black edges create tactile specificity that guides bodily movement (ducking, kneeling, hovering hand). The corridor’s feverish wall constrains pace and signals unseen agency, charging the final symbol-map. Spatial choreography is tracked; no white-room syndrome. Environment passes the 9+ gate by shaping the final hesitation beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover what walls dream—tightens when the woman reframes legacy as warning, narrowing Elias’s options from discovery to stewardship. Pressure escalates through because/therefore: negative find → wall vibration → shadow → map reveal. One visible cost: the walls’ hum demands remembrance, implicitly conscripting Elias. Could use a sharper tactical forfeiture (e.g., diary consumed) to enter 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as living burden—emerges via wall-hum and map-veins rather than statement. The climate-shift context reframes survival as moral indebtedness to place. Final image reweights “what walls dream” into “what they demand,” offering resonant ambiguity. No moralizing, though the father’s burned pages flirt with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: ivy “curling like veins,” stone “feverish,” symbols “like living veins.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under shock (“His breath hitched”). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Distinctive diction (“cartographer of echoes”) sustains lyric texture without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with beats—long sensory sentences in discovery, staccato when shadow appears. Information density high: one sentence often layers setting, emotion, and backstory cue. Figurative control consistent; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “the walls… the walls…” anaphora could be trimmed, but it does not touch closure. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Walls that dream” and memory-cartography feel fresh, not standard urban-fantasy furniture. Climate-shift survival merged with sentient architecture offers non-obvious synthesis. Negative-to-woman payoff avoids twist-for-twist’s-sake; pattern taught early. Specificity of scorched ivy and fireplace diaries prevents generic overlay. Risk level moderate; could push further by letting Elias damage the map or himself.</comment>
