<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet, embodied patience is vivid; the stone’s pulse and his stillness show contradictory impulses in scene. Yet his final smile feels sudden—no micro-choice visibly costs him, so the renunciation lands soft. Still, interiority stays concrete and character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: overlaying footage revives the river on-screen, the shadow sharpens, hope is repriced as mobile, not frozen. Causal chain (stone warmth → footage merge → shadow solid) holds; cost is the unclaimed stone and enduring vigil implied. Orientation and lens stay clean; one transition inside the library is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Silver vines, self-turning pages, and the stone’s tactile weight ground every beat; the library itself supplies the archival tool that enables the climax. Sensory selection stays tight to Elias’s dusk-attuned gaze. Environment constrains choice—only here can he splice the decades—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the river’s ghost to keep hope alive—tightens when footage overlap makes the shadow almost solid, foreclosing easier doubt. Agency is intellectual and tactile (terminal choices, releasing the stone), with visible price: he gives up possessing the last river fragment. One meaningful deepening satisfies the short-form lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as hope’s liquidity—never static, always moving like a river—without sermonizing. The repriced stone and dissolved shadow in the final image reweight the premise non-literally. Particulars (shared dreams, footage splice) keep abstraction anchored; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays close to Elias’s dusk-biased perception; diction (“sky bruised,” “shadow unbound”) is consistent and rhythmic. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure. Free-indirect texture mirrors his quietly deliberate cadence, teaching the reader early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm; high information density—each line advances image, motive, or stakes. Figurative language is selective, never clustering to fog causality. Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the final overlay sentence lands clean and luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Shadow as echo of what was” gives a fresh ecological metaphysics; shareable dreams and airborne archives feel inevitable, not ornamental. The synthesis binds loss, technology, and hope without echoing familiar plots. Risk is intellectual rather than structural, keeping coherence intact.</comment>
