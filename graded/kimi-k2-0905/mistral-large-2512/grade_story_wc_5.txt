<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—burner who longs to preserve—grounds every beat; the final origami ignition crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices (tracing empty space, folding the jar) enact the trait “patience physically” and foreclose his old art. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is waived; solo arc suffices at this length. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts the next action, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the hovering paper-jar starlight reweights the premise—he can seal, not destroy—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: because he envies the ink’s stillness, therefore he folds absence, ignites, and creates a counter-ash stillness inside himself. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the shift from burning memories to sealing the pause. Cost is legible in the final image—“the stillness between his own heartbeats.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard is more than postcard: frost hardens soil, twilight angle catches the button, silence presses like snow—each filters through Elias’s attention and constrains his slow ritual. Micro-setting objects (teacup, key, mirror, button) form the pattern that physically guides the seal; their discarded history charges the final stillness. Spatial choreography is clean—circle built, match struck, jar settles. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the pause, not the heartbeat”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: density of silence, pattern completion, then the ignition that reweights his art. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. One visible price: he relinquishes the flash-paper craft’s destructive identity to earn the sealed starlight. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening of quiet and the final charged image suffice for 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of alchemy: transmuting flux into stasis, not lead into gold. Subtext lives in gesture—folding absence, igniting to freeze—never stated. Final image offers non-literal answer: stillness can be crafted, not merely yearned for. Complexity remains: the cost is solitude and the renunciation of his former fire, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—breath plumes, calloused fingers, spider-slow motions. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic patience; no head-hopping. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon (“flash-paper alchemist,” “benediction”) without register drift. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or stakes; no loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“silence pressing like snow” returns as “stillness between heartbeats,” creating coherent texture. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Flash-paper alchemist who wants to preserve rather than destroy is fresh; coupling with origami-of-absence gives specific inflection. Orchard-in-crater feels new, not generic frozen wasteland. Final inversion—ignition creates stillness—grows inevitably from established craft rules. Risk is present but modest; no structural experimentation beyond lyric accumulation.</comment>
