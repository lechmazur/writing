<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora’s practiced detachment and the micro-gesture of re-pocketing the spent petal give us a believable interior contradiction, but the story stops short of forcing her into a cost-carrying choice; she observes more than she acts, so the “earned” threshold for 9+ isn’t met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: petal application → grief transfer → parting promise; the final image of the dull petal re-prices the premise by showing Liora’s own need for fresh lies, a quiet CR with visible cost that satisfies closure under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The amber grotto’s refracted light and pulsing walls act as a charged micro-setting that guides the ritual beat-by-beat; the petal’s texture and static are anchored to POV attention, but the grotto never actively constrains escape or tactics, keeping it just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once: the petal’s charge forces Darian’s surrender and Liora’s recognition that she, too, is consuming the product; the cost is legible, but the escalation is single-note—no further narrowing of options—so it peaks just below the 8.2 high-band line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The half-truth theme emerges through the petal’s mechanics rather than exposition; the final image of the spent petal reweights the idea that counterfeit grief is kinder than real loss, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter—synesthetic attention to scent, static, refracted light—and the lyric cadence modulates under pressure; no head-hop or register drift, meeting the 9− band with only hairline slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative layering is selective, never clogging the high-pressure beats. A single paraphrase loop (“the petal’s charge began to fade / its magic spent”) is the only scaffold trace and it misses the closure beat, so the 9+ gate stays intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The emotion-counterfeiting premise feels fresh, but the ritual beats—transfer-touch, client-depart, dealer-left-hollow—follow a familiar pattern; the amber grotto and static-charged petal supply the needed specificity to push the score into the low-8 band.</comment>
