<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, ragged breath, and the memory-jolt when he touches the chip—but the “wilts near dishonesty” trait is asserted, not dramatized in a choice. The final turn (accepting the covenant) is prepared by the childhood flashback, yet the cost feels symbolic rather than embodied: we see no immediate concrete consequence for him. The stranger functions more as oracle than crucible, so relationship pressure is absent. Still, the micro-choice to insert the chip is legible and irreversible, earning a mid-band pass.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the golden light and “tinkersong” reweight prior rust and fracture imagery with undeniable conceptual cost—he is no longer the repairman who avoids truth. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the chip’s pulse causes memory surfacing, which therefore motivates the final insertion. Orientation is clean within 120 words. The only drag is the stranger’s gnomic exposition that slightly over-explains stakes before the final beat, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Brass scars, oil scent, and the chip’s crimson hum are tactile and selective, anchoring POV bias. The resonance chamber acts as micro-setting: its thrum vibrates Elias’s teeth, guiding his decision to kneel and later insert the chip. Spatial choreography is coherent—workbench, doorway, light shift. While the “cloak woven from patches of twilight” edges toward purple, it is brief and serves the fairy-tale register. Environment does not constrain tactics as sharply as the chip itself, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim the stolen light via accepting inner fracture—signals early. Pressure tightens when the chip surfaces the accusatory memory, foreclosing the option to keep mending only external brokenness. The escalation is single but meaningful: from denial to insertion. Cost is conceptual (he must own the grief he avoided), yet no tangible price (tool, relationship, bodily harm) is exacted on-page, capping the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: repair as self-excavation rather than cosmetic fix. The rust covenant reweights from decay-as-enemy to decay-as-truth-bridge, a conceptual repricing that lingers. Subtext lives in gesture—his recoiling finger, the silent disappearance of the stranger—avoiding moralizing. Final golden light is earned, not asserted, though the stranger’s tagline edges toward echo (-0.2). Complexity remains: he gains wholeness by embracing brokenness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “his teeth ache,” “his breath ragged.” Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into short gasps, mirroring pressure. The fairy-tale register (“cloak woven from patches of twilight”) is consistent and POV-plausible for a mythic tinkerer. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Filter verbs are minimal; free indirect slips are clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “brass walls etched with the scars of time” does double duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in low-pressure narrative summary, not in peak beats. One mixed metaphor—“covenant of rust…pact between decay and creation”—is forgivable at closure because the image is reweighted effectively. Overall, high control with minor sheen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing music-box repair with alchemical philosopher’s-stone shard feels fresh, and the “covenant of rust” reframes steampunk decay as spiritual necessity. The childhood memory twist is specific to Elias, preventing swap-test failure. Risk is moderate: mythic stranger and golden-light redemption flirt with trope, but the tactile chip and dirge melody particularize the arc. Not radically experimental, yet memorable within genre.</comment>
