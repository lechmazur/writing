<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is viscerally embodied in the knuckle-stars and the needle; the interior contradiction between fleeing and memorializing is alive in every beat. The final tattoo sequence crystallizes a credible renunciation—he immobilizes himself with the very map of his failure—so the cost is felt on the skin. Micro-choices (pressing amber to chest, picking up the gun) keep motivation legible without therapy-speak. Only the sister remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is waived; interiority alone carries the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the tattoos permanently foreclose the option of forgetting, and the firmware’s hush is the immediate, legible cost. Causal chain holds—amber discovery → letters → translator → tattoo—each step narrows possibility. Orientation is taught early by the folded-time line and pays off when the screens show older Elias. One minor scaffold: “He had left them behind” repeats the prior cry reveal without new pressure, but it does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The laboratory’s rusted phonographs and humming jars are sketched with sensory economy; the amber and tattoo gun function as micro-setting that literally pierces the ending. Spatial choreography is clean—bench → chest → skin—so the environment constrains the final act. Time-fold rule is consistent: past voices leak, older face appears, but no paradox rescues him. Detail never stalls momentum; every image either hums with guilt or becomes ink.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the accusatory cries—signals in paragraph four and tightens when the translator spits the exact sentence he fears. The tattoo gun becomes the last viable tactic; each constellation narrows escape routes until the firmware dims, a visible price. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure escalates under causal lens. One deepening beat suffices at this length, and it delivers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of memorial: to remember is to silence the dead, yet he must brand himself with their voices to stop running. The amber mosquito—once inert—ends with a seeming flutter, a conceptual repricing that reweights guilt as perpetual vibration rather than absolution. No moral is stated; the skin itself speaks. Subtext in the unsent letters and untattooed knuckles lingers without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the meteor-hush tone; diction (“constellation tattooist,” “meteor hush”) is compressed yet legible. Perceptual signature is consistent—sound and light filter through Elias’s guilt-saturated attention. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains singular. One filter-verb cluster (“He wondered…”) is minor and does not contaminate peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn; each sentence either advances image or tightens stakes. Figurative language is selective—amber as absorber, tattoos as ledger—so density never clots the climax. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for laboratory awe, staccato for needle burns. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight the mosquito image; no scaffolding intrudes on closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “laboratory of lost sounds” frame feels fresh because the haunt is acoustic, not spectral, and the tattooist’s medium is star-maps of silence. Guilt-as-ink and firmware-as-confessional synthesize familiar grief-tech tropes into a singular ritual. Risk is taken with folded-time, but the piece commits fully and pays it off in the final screen flicker. Without the amber-ink mixture the climax collapses, so specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
