<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt toward his half-formed protagonist gives a sharp internal contradiction; the shell presses his palm, embodying the cost. Yet his “conflicted” label is announced, not dramatized, and the final turn—“learn”—is advice, not a choice we see him enact on the page. Interiority is vivid but stays reflective; no micro-choice in the river alters his real-time options, so the arc feels observed rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias turns back, accepting that hopes must pass through him, the river’s resistance now a persistent constraint—cost is felt. Causality is Accumulative: each apparition layers density until the protagonist’s accusation breaks the pattern. Early spatial anchors (river-bend, mist) arrive by word 80, well inside the 120-word safety window, so Orientation Test is waived. One minor lapse: the rules of “collecting shapes” are never demonstrated as an action, only asserted, blunting the final reconfiguration slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The feral nexus is rendered through rot-paper scent, silt sucking at boots, and mist that almost forms sentences—details filtered by a writer’s perceptual bias. The spiral shell functions as micro-setting, its worn edge and hum constraining Elias’s attention and returning in the final image to charge the parting moment. Spatial choreography is clean: river current, shore, three cameos appear and vanish without positional drift. Environment never forces a tactical shift, however, keeping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stake—“collect shapes of hopes before they dissolve”—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist accuses Elias of withholding life, forcing the meta-recognition that he must let hopes flow rather than hoard them. Pressure is Accumulative: each ephemeral cameo adds weight until the pattern ruptures; no single reversal narrows options. Cost is conceptual (his novel remains unwritten), but because Elias makes no observable decision in the river beyond turning back, the price feels intellectual rather than tactical, capping the score just under the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art’s responsibility to give transient human longings durable form without possessing them. The shell’s hollow echo and the closing whisper of pages reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—the boy’s empty kite string, the dissolved protagonist—rather than exposition. A hairline slip: the line “This was the problem with hope” edges toward thesis statement, but the final image quickly regains resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptions; diction (“ink resisted his touch,” “sentences half-formed”) mirrors a writer’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates from long, mist-laden clauses to staccato exchanges with apparitions, echoing rising urgency. No dialogue beyond two terse questions, yet each line carries subtext—absent kite, accusatory sketch—serving as action. Voice remains distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensory, with only one paraphrase loop (“fleeting and fragile and real”). Metaphors stay coherent: mist like living thing, river pushing with insistence—no mixed vehicles. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“waded,” “clutched,” “swallowed”) propel momentum. A faint register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “liminal space”—is earned by the protagonist’s literary mindset and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Meta-meeting with an unwritten protagonist refreshes the “artist enters his work” trope by staging it in a feral nexus where half-formed hopes gain ghostly bodies. The spiral shell—simultaneously earpiece, inkwell, and hourglass—offers a concrete, non-generic hinge for the meta-conceit. Specificity of rotting-library air and kite-string wrist-wrap roots the surreal in tactile detail. Risk is moderate but successful; the piece never retreats into generic abstraction.</comment>
