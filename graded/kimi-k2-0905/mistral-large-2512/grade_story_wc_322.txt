<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his calm while sinking into “quicksand” shows embodied contradiction—but the thread’s agency dwarfs his; he mostly follows. The final reach is a micro-choice, yet the cost (loss of gallery world) is more implied than felt on his skin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the door vanishes, the void reconfigures his options, and the alive texture of connection is legible. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each illusion intensifies because the thread accumulates his memories—but the thread’s unexplained origin is a mild teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gallery’s tilting floor and mirror that refuses reflection constrain movement and charge the final image; selective sensory detail (liquid-silver vein) keeps economy. Spatial tracking stays clean across the collapsing hallway→spiral→void sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—tightens when the thread begins rewriting his memories, foreclosing safe observation. One visible price: the gallery door disappears, stranding him in the dream-interstice; escalation is steady under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reweighted meaning of “texture”: from abstract desire to literal, living filament. The final image answers the thematic question without moralizing—connection is not smooth but alive, pulsing with alien agency—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices angles like a sketcher, filters illusions through rational enchantment. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“The gallery’s illusions erupted…”) then widens in the void, mirroring his awe; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong verbs (“thread clung,” “walls collapsed”) and high density; occasional figurative layering (“vein of liquid silver,” “breathing walls”) stays purposeful. One scaffold pair: “He didn’t panic. There was a strange calm…” could merge, but it doesn’t dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fever-dream architect + rational enchantment + sentient sinew thread synthesizes into a fresh metaphysical heist on memory itself. Risky second-person mirror moment pays off by revealing a self he doesn’t recognize—transformation feels inevitable yet non-derivative.</comment>
