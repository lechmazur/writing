<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s “steadily curious” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the only micro-choice—texting “How?”—feels lightweight because the deck’s threat remains abstract. Interiority is evocative but loops on the same metaphor (“mapped / being mapped”) without fresh contradiction. The final beat obeys causality, yet the cost is intellectual, not visceral; tension never penetrates her body or routine.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the anonymous reply reweights the entire deck from cultural artifact to live blueprint, cost felt in the instant shift from observer to participant. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each blurred card thickens the pattern that forces her text. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the loft, skylight, and bench anchor space and time. No causal or teleport errors, though escalation is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, ink-stained cuff, and coiled measuring tape create a tight micro-setting that constrains attention and finally charges the closing image when she “steps into the map.” Selective sensory detail (oil-slick ink, static lantern) is filtered through Lira’s cartomancer gaze, never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate; props remain trackable. Weather is not backdrop but metronome, accelerating with her pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she enter the map or remain outside—is signaled early and tightens when the text arrives. However, the tightening is purely cognitive: no concrete resource (time, safety, reputation) is risked on-page, so the price stays abstract. Agency is present—she sends the text—but the external pressure never physically or socially impedes her, keeping escalation in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the collapse of grand narratives (crypto, tarot) and the terror of being re-inscribed by someone else’s pattern. Subtext lives in the mutated card icons—chains, static, barbed wire—never editorialized. Final line “By measuring what’s left” reframes her tool from curiosity to complicity, a resonant non-moral answer. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the absence of bodily stakes keeps the aftereffect cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—ink, proportion, static—belongs unmistakably to Lira. Rhythm modulates from languid observation to clipped final exchange without register drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Prose texture is controlled and lyrical, but occasional metaphor density (“sleeping serpent,” “constellations,” “sedimentary record”) edges toward pattern overload, not yet obscuring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene temperature; paragraph cuts are lean. Figurative language is vivid but clusters in places (“oil on water,” “shattered glass,” “cracked orb”) creating minor texture debt; no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—each sentence at least doubles duty. A single paraphrase loop around “mapped / being mapped” costs −0.2; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fusing post-crypto cultural anthropology with mutated tarot is fresh; the reverse-engineering conceit literalizes the theme of reading collapsed futures. Specificity—static lantern, barbed-wire Hanged Man—prevents gimmickry. The concept could travel with different names, but the iconographic mutations are inseparable from this piece. Risk is present but moderated; bolder bodily or social stakes could push higher.</comment>
