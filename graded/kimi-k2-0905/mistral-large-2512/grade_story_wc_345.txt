<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s gardener identity and refusal to fade are cleanly anchored; her interiority stays concrete (“watered the flowers in her own way”). The villagers’ shift from hoarding to sharing is shown through visible acts, not labels. Yet the ghost’s agency is mostly observational; she never faces a true contradiction or cost that would deepen her arc. Closure is resonant but not character-costly—she simply lets go once success is assured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final bell-ring crystallizes the villagers’ transformed stance and Liora’s fade carries felt cost (“her form glowing brighter than the nebula”). Causality is light—messages appear by ghostly handwave—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn message tightens communal attention until the orchard sings back. Orientation is swift; floating arches and nebula are anchored by word 60. One transition (dawn-to-dawn) is legible and patterned. No late rule-breaks; the bell’s last toll reweights all prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop: the floating rock arches literally sing when touched, guiding the villagers’ new care. The nebula’s violet-gold glow is filtered through Liora’s gardener eye—light as nutrient, not scenery. Micro-setting inside the butterfly garden constrains action; the watering bell must be rung to gather people. Final image of bell-sound drifting into the nebula recharges every prior sensory thread.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchard survival—signals early via dwindling blossoms. Escalation is textural: each chalked message deepens communal attention, narrowing options from exploitation to partnership. The seventh message (“You were always the gardeners”) forces a public stance with visible cost—shared fruit, repaired wings. No coincidence resolves; the reversal is earned by collective micro-acts triggered by Liora’s prompts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal stewardship emerges through orchard response, not sermon: trees bloom after villagers share fruit and mend butterflies. The nebula’s whisper of “forgotten rest” reweights into communal wakefulness. Final bell toll offers Conceptual Repricing—rest is no longer absence but shared responsibility. Ambiguity lingers: will the next strangers heed the bell? Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person ghost POV remains stable, perceptual signature soft and horticultural (“watered the flowers in her own way”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens at each dawn reveal, mirroring villagers’ tightening focus. No dialogue, so voice carries all tonal modulation. Final fade is rendered in the POV’s own metaphoric key—light against nebula—keeping psychic distance consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative layering (“nebula... whispered of forgotten rest”) is sparse and patterned, taught early. Rhythm accelerates across the seven-dawn structure, each paragraph opening with temporal anchor. Only minor filter verb (“they discovered”) mid-story; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent orchard planet with singing arches feels fresh, yet core trope—ghost gardener guiding villagers—is familiar. Specificity saves it: chalk messages that glow like nebula bleed, bell shaped as blooming lotus. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks, but inversion of ghost-as-mentor rather than mourner adds lift. Transformation test fails mildly: swap ghost for living elder and plot still functions.</comment>
