<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s cultivated estrangement is rendered through tactile micro-choices—palming the silent disc, murmuring into dead lines—so her refusal to “fix” callers feels earned. The final “Good” crystallizes her stance, but the interior contradiction between caretaking and withdrawal stays verbal rather than embodied in a single, costly gesture. Still, her voice is specific, her limits legible, and the endurance costs her nothing we can see on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman’s “I’m ready” and Mara’s quiet assent reweight twelve years of loops into an earned stasis whose cost is the silence that now replaces them. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern builds until the pattern breaks—so the lens holds. Orientation is swift; tunnel, booth, and night hour are anchored by line 3. No teleporting props or retro-patches; the disc’s muteness and the callers’ disappearances tighten the final image without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The chipped 1970s booth, ozone air, and humming junction box are filtered through Mara’s practiced indifference; every sensory note is selective and purposeful. The glass disc acts as micro-setting: its unplayed vibration is the physical corollary to her unspoken listening. Spatial choreography is clean—she steps out, palm to disc, between streetlamp hums—and the tunnel’s cool darkness literally presses the final silence home. Environment constrains her only tactic: listening instead of healing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Mara will keep absorbing others’ grief or let an ending arrive—tightens once: the woman’s wordless inhale followed by “I’m ready” forces Mara to assent, foreclosing the weekly loop. Pressure is textural: repeated calls accumulate until one caller reclaims agency; Mara’s cost is the loss of her necessary fiction. No reversal originates from her choice, so escalation is mild, but the silence that follows is a felt forfeiture under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the ethics of bearing witness without rescue, the way unplayed grief can become its own music. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara’s palm on a silent disc, the boy’s vanished calls—never in exposition. The final hush reconfigures the prior loops as a single, shared exhale, offering no moral, only the cost of release. Complexity is honored: Mara’s caretaking is also self-exile, and the story refuses to judge it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual bias: she notices damp concrete, ozone, the way spirals “seemed to move when she wasn’t looking.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, then compresses—“She just said, ‘Good.’” Dialogue is sparse, indirect, and goal-driven; callers plead, Mara deflects. No filter-verb clusters; the prose breathes with her metabolic rhythm. Voice remains singular, never editorial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the silence in their apartment now” is both grief-catalogue and foreshadowing of Mara’s own impending quiet. Figurative language is spare—disc “thin as a whisper”—and never stacks into purple. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each paragraph advances pattern or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases the held breath without exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The underground operator who midwives grief through wrong-number loops is a fresh angle; the glass harmonica disc repurposes an obsolete instrument as mute talisman. Specificity—Tuesday 3:17 AM, Daniel’s humming while cooking—prevents abstraction. Risk is quiet: no villain, no twist, only pattern and release, yet the concept commits fully. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not grafted.</comment>
