<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The curator’s bewilderment is palpable, but her shift from passive cataloguer to active inheritor is asserted more than dramatized; the tub “inquiry” is still summary. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—she never considers leaving the shell alone—so the final smile feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard tilts, the shell becomes a “path,” cost is the lifelong pursuit now unavoidable. Causal chain is thin—epiphany triggers external shift rather than choice—but the Accumulative lens holds; pattern taught early (ledger scribble) pays off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orchard and gallery are sketched with starlight and humming blossoms; the bathroom’s underground spring anchors the breakthrough beat. Spatial choreography is clean; the shell’s glass case and the window-tracked shift outside constrain her reach and sight, charging the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes—possession of forbidden knowledge—are signaled early; pressure tightens once when the orchard “shifts” in response to her touch. Cost is conceptual (lifelong pursuit) rather than tangible; still, the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge that flows backward through time emerges from orchard images and shell emptiness, never sermonized. Final image reweights the ledger phrase “simply complicated” into lived vocation; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to curator’s tactile obsession; diction (“brightened disquiet,” “nonlinear inheritance”) remains within her scholarly lexicon. Rhythm swells then compresses at epiphany, no head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined: no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrase (“weight of nonlinear inheritance pressing against her ribs”) is earned by voice; momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Asteroid orchard and pistachio-shell key feel fresh, not grafted; the backward-blooming trees and blank cameo synthesize into a single cosmic logic. Risky cosmic horticulture pays off because emotional stakes stay intimate.</comment>
