<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the costume-widow identity while testing the blade—play out in embodied micro-choices (thumb on grain, first hesitant cut). The final renunciation of “harvesting lessons” is earned by the causal chain of carving; the cost is the visible lion that is both here and gone. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels. One hairline slip: “rust-hued peace” edges toward color-tag shorthand, but it is absorbed by the final sip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crouched lion reweights the stake from “contain grief” to “hold companion grief,” with felt cost in the warmed wood under her fingers. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of steam, rain, blade, wood accumulates density until the cadence shifts at “rust-hued peace.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Persistent constraint—the blank’s patient existence—shapes every tactical delay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and warped floorboards constrain pacing (slippers scuff) and mood; the ash blank functions as micro-setting that literally resists then yields to the knife. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: bergamot steam, damp wool, wood warmth. One minor lapse: city hum remains off-stage postcard. Final image of softened edges by diffused glow charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with uncontainable loss—is signaled in paragraph 2. Single meaningful tightening: the blade’s first cut narrows infinite options to one line; each stroke forecloses revision. Cost is legible in the lion’s quiet stance and the kettle gone cold. No escalation loop; pressure accretes under Accumulative lens until stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of container/contained: grief is not a crop to harvest but a companion to hold. Subtext lives in gesture—letting the kettle scream without action—rather than statement. Final image reweights “here and gone” without moralizing. One abstract phrase “crystallize time” is allowed because the carving dramatizes it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile (thumb on grain, steam curls). Syntax modulates: long reflective sentences build to short blade strokes. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Elara’s lexicon except “rust-hued,” forgiven by closure absorption. Rhythm mirrors emotional crest without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“steam like a ghost testing edges”—never muddled. Information density high: tea unfurling as drowning dancers compresses time and emotion. No artifacts in final third; line-level craft supports rather than decorates the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Widow-of-lion-tamer is fresh territory; the crouched quiet lion subverts expected roaring icon. Accumulation of domestic ritual with exotic residue creates specific synthesis. Risk is quiet, but coherence justifies it. Not quite 9 because premise could still travel with names changed, though execution feels singular.</comment>
