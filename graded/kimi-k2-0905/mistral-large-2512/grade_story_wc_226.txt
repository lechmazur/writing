<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s defiant-artist streak is shown, not told, through her touching the forbidden spire and weaponizing poetry; the contradictory ache for self-mending while courting catastrophe gives her credible internal tension. Micro-choices (taking the shard, speaking three poems) progressively raise her exposure, and the final refusal to wait for the ritual lands as Earned Stasis with cost—“she felt something worse—alive.” Echo’s status as pressure-foil is clear, but their own motives stay ornamental, capping relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each improvised couplet thickens atmospheric density until the spire’s glowing inscription delivers Conceptual Repricing—her words now carved, irreversible. Cause-and-effect is present but subordinate to pattern intensification; the final image reweights the premise, showing the price is speaking, not silence. Anchors (who/where) surface by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure beat carries legible cost—“her words” externally etched, foreclosing anonymity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bone towers, canyon echoes, and the spire are filtered through Lira’s artist eye, constraining her acoustic ritual and reframing her body as resonator. Selective sensory layering (ivory curves, ankle-curling mist, pulsing shard) feeds directly into action: she strokes, speaks, shatters hush. The spire re-enters at closure as the literal surface of consequence, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“refract a single truth into many before elders’ ritual”—is signaled early; escalation occurs via each spoken poem that amplifies echo-feedback and narrows her option to remain silent. Agency sits in the spoken word; cost accrues acoustically and visually (spire glow, towers groan). The final refusal to proceed with the ritual crystallizes stance under pressure. Could wish for one tangible loss (a cut hand, a stolen memory) to sharpen price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgiveness is not passive silence but the perilous act of externalizing fragmented truth. The spire’s inscription reconfigures the abstract concept into physical, irreversible mark—Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext pulses in Echo’s opaque grin and the towers’ groan, inviting reader ambiguity. No platitudes; the emotional after-effect lingers as exposed voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, tracking Lira’s artist perceptions (“jagged ivory curves,” “palette of warnings”). Syntax lengthens during poetic surges, then fractures at peaks to mirror echo-breaks; diction stays within her aesthetic lexicon. Echo’s dialogue carries mischievous indirection suited to name. No head-hop; POV stable. Final line lands with rhythmic snap: “She had a truth to shatter first.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose carries varied cadence, high density; metaphors stay coherent (sound as blade, silence as whetstone). Occasional intensifier stacks (“raw and real,” “thick as the mist”) flirt with overwriting but never clog the closing beat. No paraphrase loops, clean punctuation. One filter-verb cluster near midpoint (“She felt something worse—alive”) is earned as culminative beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing bone-tower acoustics with impromptu poetry-as-ritual feels fresh; the inversion that spoken words become permanent inscription on an ancient spire reframes familiar “art costs” trope. Specificity of canyon-echo physics and artist-brain perception prevents generic swap-out. Closing reconfiguration is unforeseeable yet inevitable given established sound-refraction rule-set.</comment>
