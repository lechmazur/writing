<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied in the opening beat and vanishes the instant wonder eclipses fear; the contradiction is left unexplored, so the arc feels toggled rather than transformed. The micro-choice to seize the compass is present, but no prior beat shows him weighing terror against curiosity, so the cost reads as plot convenience rather than earned nerve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is clean: compass → revelation → dimensional ship wakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—‘spatial mutiny is freedom’—with visible cost (his world-frame shattered). The Orientation Test is waived: initial disorientation (fractured dome, no clear egress) is taught early and pays off when the entire ruin reconfigures into a vessel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Iron-and-glass lattice, star-veins on stone, and the brass compass needle create tactile, selective density; the Nexus itself is the constraint that finally rewrites physics around him. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the compass’s evolving glow and the warping air directly enable the dimensional turn. No wasted tourist catalog; every descriptor either squeezes his claustrophobia or foreshadows mobility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—‘find the key or stay caged’—tightens when the figure offers the compass and warns of irreversible sight. One meaningful escalation: acceptance dissolves the literal cage into a navigable map. Cost is legible: the city he knew is now a mobile ship, stranding him in uncharted dimension-space; option set is permanently widened and destabilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of mutiny-as-freedom emerges through architectural inversion rather than thesis statement; the final re-pricing reweights ‘ruin’ into ‘vessel’. No moralizing line tells us what to think—the image of star-maps does the work. Slight deduction for the figure’s on-the-nose warning, which edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s sensory panic and later wonder; perceptual signature is consistent (breath, ribs, star-veins). Figurative language is restrained and POV-apt—no elevated diction drift. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses as the organ swells, mirroring his rising pulse without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with near-zero scaffold. One paraphrase loop—“the Nexus was never meant to be fixed. It was meant to move”—is purposeful repetition for emphasis, not artifact. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (lattice, veins, ship). Final line lands with punchy monosyllables that recharge the opening starlight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>‘Spatial mutiny’ could have been gimmick, but here it is literalized as architecture rebelling against stasis; that concrete inversion feels fresh. Risk is taken: ruin-into-ship reveal pivots on a single object handled on-page. While dimensional vessels are genre-familiar, the claustrophobia-to-navigation arc and the compass-as-key supply specific inflection that resists swap-out.</comment>
