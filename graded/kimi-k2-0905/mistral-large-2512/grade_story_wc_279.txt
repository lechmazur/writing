<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—needing order yet feeding on the grotto’s chaos—plays out in embodied micro-choices (pressing the flake, stilling the mandala). The final renunciation costs her the pattern she craved, but Maren’s pressure feels slightly under-motivated; a sharper prior cue would push this into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing mandala reweights the premise—silence is no longer absence but accumulated memory—while the tile flake’s insertion supplies visible cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative lens; pattern break at the end is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, tile flake, and chalk dust form a micro-setting that actively resists and then enables Liora’s final act; the flake’s pulse and the lilac haze charge the ultimate image. Spatial choreography stays clean; sensory selection mirrors her narrowing attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can art trap what the town refuses to speak?—tightens when the mandala turns from cage to mirror. One meaningful deepening: the hush reveals itself as fullness, forcing her choice to embed the flake. Cost is legible; Maren’s antagonism could sharpen earlier to hit 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: collective forgetting is not erasure but relocation into ambient silence. The glowing mandala offers a resonant, non-literal answer—meaning is found by surrendering to the mess, not ordering it. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter—pastel, mist, flake weight—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under threat; diction stays within her artist lexicon. No dialogue clutter; every spoken line advances tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. One mixed metaphor—“spectral confetti” beside “broken promise”—but it does not touch the closure beat. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Whispering grotto as external hard-drive for a town’s deleted memories feels fresh; chalk artist versus emergent silence is a non-obvious clash. Risk lies in lyric compression rather than plot twist; synthesis holds. Could push higher with one more specific folkloric detail to anchor uniqueness.</comment>
