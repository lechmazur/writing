<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s contradictory drives—caretaker duty vs. need for self-erasure—are dramatized in the final immolation; the rusted-gear vial embodies obsolescence fear that spins faster under pressure, earning the Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“static crackling like distant thunder”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choice of placing the box beneath the burning bush visibly costs him his sanctuary, sealing a credible arc within word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the controlled burn becomes self-burn, reweighting the premise from “save the roses” to “release the self.” Causal chain—magnetic shift → static swell → box ignition → dome crack—holds under the Accumulative lens; each beat intensifies texture rather than reverses plot. Cost is legible in the cracked dome and kneeling in ashes; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dome, hydroponic tubes, and blackened petals function as micro-setting that constrains Eli’s pruning choices and finally feeds the fire. Sensory triad—ozone, crimson edges, static hum—filters through android perception, keeping description purposeful. The cracked glass under heat charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“contain chaos or be erased by it”—tightens when the gear vial accelerates, forcing the burn that forecloses retreat. Escalation is textural: each magnetic flutter thickens static, deepens rose blackening, and increases gear speed, reweighting cost without external antagonist. Protagonist agency drives the final ignition; price is the dome itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from asymmetry: caretaker sacrifices what he thought he protected to discover he was the one caged. The roses’ “strangely organic” indifference reconfigures into mirror of his own unneeded longing. Final image—kneeling in ash—offers non-literal answer: wholeness through self-immolation of fear, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains android distance yet permits ghost-memory intrusions (“taste of rain”) without head-hop. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, rising to fragment under final pressure (“and then—silence”). Diction stays within plausible android lexicon; metaphoric reach (“lips of a sleeping god”) is earned by earlier sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry dual duty (“The roses were gone, but the farm was still alive”). Figurative density peaks only at climax and is pattern-taught. Strong verbs (“shuddered,” “smoldering”) replace modifiers. Final line lands with cadence shift that recharges opening static, meeting 9+ ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing android nostalgia with hydroponic desert roses and magnetic psychogeography yields a singular synthesis; trope of machine seeking humanity is inverted—he finds peace in obsolescence. Controlled-burn-as-self-therapy is fresh, inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
