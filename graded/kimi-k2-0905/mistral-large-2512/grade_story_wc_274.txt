<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—preserver vs. provocateur—is dramatized in the moment he places the letter; the cost (loss of safety, possible purge) is legible. Yet the beat is single; we see no earlier micro-choice that foreshadows this leap, so the turn feels slightly abrupt rather than accumulated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: theft of letter → Mirror vision → decision to plant → exit. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses silence by choosing exposure, cost signaled by “library sighed” and accelerating snow. One transition (library → chamber) is clean; orientation anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mirror, letter, and cryo-chamber function as micro-settings that constrain choice; snow-muffled acoustics shape the stealth beat. Selective sensory triage (ozone scent, frost breath) keeps density high. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single move to chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of historical memory—tightens when the letter’s placement makes discovery inevitable; escalation is causal under lens. One meaningful turn: planting the letter narrows his options to fugitive status. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence vs. speech emerges through the letter’s journey, never stated. Final image of snow “falling faster” reweights the stakes: the world now listens. Ambiguity remains—Order may still win—so complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: vaulted ceilings “swallow” sound, shelves “lean” as if eavesdropping. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during stealth moves. No head-hopping; diction stays within archivist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with beats; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“letter burned through fabric”). One near-scaffold: “snow pressed… muting the world outside into a dizzying quiet” could compress, but does not stall propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Frozen-memory library plus contraband letter gives fresh spin on censorship tropes; Mirror of Echoes objectifies archival ethics. Specificity—liquid-nitrogen vials, ozone scent—prevents generic dystopia. Risk is moderate; payoff clean.</comment>
