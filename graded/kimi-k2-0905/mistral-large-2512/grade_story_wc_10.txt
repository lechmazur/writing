<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s deafened desperation is embodied in every tactile gesture; the tuning fork as surrogate voice is specific and charged. Interiority stays concrete—he “traces patterns in the air,” not “feels hope.” The final beat shows earned renunciation: silence remains, but now speaks, costing him the illusion of full restoration. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the heat-map eruption rewrites silence into a visible score, undeniable on the page. Causal chain holds—fork → glass → color → language—each step triggered by Elias’s agency. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“conservatory’s winterglass panes”). No teleporting props or logic breaks; the 20% reflective block is interleaved with present action, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Winterglass pane becomes micro-setting that constrains the final act: the frosted surface he strikes is the literal canvas for the color burst. Conservatory cold, brass fork, and frost-pattern are filtered through Elias’s narrowed sensory world. Spatial choreography is clean—tripod, pane, body positions track. Environment never stalls momentum; every detail either reflects his deafness or enables the climactic translation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: the fork-strike must produce readable color or doom him to wordlessness. Escalation is Accumulative: each mapping session adds density until the single chromatic explosion reweights the stake—silence is no longer absence but palette. Cost is visible: the city’s roar stays lost; he gains a new language yet remains exiled from sound. No reversal, but the deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communication transcends medium—silence becomes pigment, loss becomes lexicon. No character states the thesis; the final image of “music” made of color carries the reconfiguration. Subtext resides in Liora’s amber pulse—her quiet witness implies acceptance Elias must now grant himself. The concept avoids moralizing; the reader feels the uncanny equivalence of absence and presence without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perception is filtered through tactile and thermal detail consistent with deafness. Syntax lengthens under wonder—“streaks of crimson and sapphire bloomed”—then fractures into short clauses to mimic breathless recognition. No head-hopping; Liora’s emotions are only externally sensed via the device. The rhythmic modulation mirrors the chromatic crescendo, achieving lyric control without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “winterglass panes hummed with frost” performs atmosphere and stakes in one stroke. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors stay coherent—frozen leviathan ribs, distant shore melody—without crowding peak beats. A single filter-verb cluster (“he could barely perceive”) is justified by POV constraint and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing deafness, heat-mapping, and alchemical glass gives a fresh angle on the tired “artist overcomes trauma” arc. The tuning fork as stylus and the conservatory as silent score are specific inventions; removal would collapse the plot. No derivative echoes; the chromatic notation device grows logically from the premise. Risk in marrying synesthesia to grief pays off—the final image feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
