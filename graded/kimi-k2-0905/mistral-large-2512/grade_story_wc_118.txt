<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile obsession with books and walls is vivid, but her final leap—touching the tapestry to open a “door”—lacks a prior micro-choice that proves she would risk the unknown; the interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact (tapestry, diaries, silo hum) layers density until the dragons’ gleam reconfigures reality; the closing image of the axis “pointing somewhere else” delivers a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—she forfeits the safety of mere collecting for an unmapped threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete sensory triangulation—“concrete ribs,” “faded crimson,” “slow deep thrum”—anchors the silo as both coffin and compass; the tapestry’s evolving texture (curling like dying leaves → ember gleam) directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through pattern intensification: silence thickens, shadows pool longer, books slide; the tightening is not a causal chain but a density swell that forces her stance crystallization—she must abandon archival passivity and step through the woven door, paying the cost of certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely—history is not behind but ahead—via the dragons’ shift from dead motif to living threshold; the axis re-pricing avoids moralizing, leaving a charged ambiguity about what “stories walls have heard” will demand of her next.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, hushed syntax mirrors the bronze-quiet mandate; controlled anaphora (“in the way…”) and precise nominal compounds (“grain elevator,” “pulse points”) create a perceptual signature that modulates into breathless compression at the dragons’ awakening—no head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds later payoff (“threads stiff” → “unraveling just enough”); occasional poetic compression (“the axis wasn’t displaced—it had always been pointing somewhere else”) propels without overwriting; zero loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic archivist meets medieval dragons inside a grain silo: the fusion feels inevitable, not gimmicky; the “last dream” conceit is transformed from cliché epilogue to active key, turning archival grief into forward voyage—fresh inflection with conceptual follow-through.</comment>
