<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but abstract; her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. surrender the words) are announced rather than embodied in immediate micro-choices. The decisive act—pressing the dictionary to the stone—reads as symbolic ritual, not a pressured character decision with visible cost. Earned stasis is asserted (“she had become the first weaver”) rather than dramatized through bodily or emotional toll.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hiccup smooths, Elara transmutes from witness to weaver, cost is implied in her erasure from the temple. Causal chain is thin—dictionary-to-stone jumpstarts cosmic repair without intermediate obstacles—but the accumulative pattern (fading words → final weave) holds. Orientation is swift; the single-scene default is met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The temple-library is evoked with visceral ribs-of-god shelves and dust-mote syllables; the arbitration stone serves as micro-setting that ultimately powers the closure. Spatial grounding stays consistent; body and object placement track cleanly. Detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s scholar-sensorium, and the hush-toned atmosphere directly supports the stakes of forgetting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent universal forgetting—is declared early; pressure escalates as ink visibly bleeds and the stone darkens. The tightening moment (dictionary pressed to stone) is singular and decisive, but no intermediate reversals or trade-offs complicate the ascent; the cost is retrospective rather than experienced as a forked choice. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic consensus as cosmic glue emerges through the arbitration metaphor and the dictionary’s fraying pages, avoiding overt thesis statements. Final image of the first weaver reweights earlier witness passivity into creative agency. Ambiguity lingers—what “new” illusions will be woven—yet the insight feels earned from the story’s own particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and cadence; diction (“spiral arbitration,” “resounding hush”) is elevated but stays within Elara’s scholarly register. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences build to the short flare of stone-light—without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue to test voice divergence, yet perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; metaphor chains (“dust motes as syllables,” “veins of light”) serve atmosphere without cluttering causality. Minor loop risk in repeated “hush” and “spiral” but the pattern is purposeful. No scaffold sentences or mixed metaphors obscure the final weave-image; clarity holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concept of dictionary-as-arbitration-engine is fresh, synthesizing linguistics and cosmic repair. The inward/outward paradox and history-witness POV avoid standard apocalypse tropes. Risk taken in lyric abstraction pays off because the closure image is legible and irreversible; removing the dictionary or the spiral mechanic would collapse the plot.</comment>
