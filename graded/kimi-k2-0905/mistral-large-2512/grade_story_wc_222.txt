<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirien’s motives—wonder over greed—are declared early and her playful-cautious stance stays consistent; the micro-choice to trade each chess-secret is credible. Interiority is light but embodied (breath fog, trembling fingers) and avoids label-speak. The final grin is earned because she has already accepted the guardian’s warning-price, so the arc closes with visible cost. Flaw: we never feel a contradictory impulse that might have made the renunciation sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because she wants the lid, she climbs; because she brought secrets, she can barter; because she accepts the riddle-cost, she leaves changed. Orientation is clean by line 6; the single-scene ascent/descent keeps scope tight. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “time is what seeks you” reweights the premise and the wrong sky pulses as felt cost. One minor slack: the guardian’s sudden generosity could use one more causal cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ice, altitude, and void are filtered through Lirien’s kinetic POV—frost-slick steps, breath fog, wind as invitation—so detail never stalls motion. The spire’s mouth and laughing walls constrain her stealth pace and cue the guardian’s game logic. The pocket lid’s warming surface and star-et constellation charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single vertical set.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wonder vs. safety—tightens when each chess piece physically leaves her belt, narrowing future options. The guardian’s riddle escalates from trade to existential warning, forcing her to shoulder conceptual cost. Agency sits entirely with Lirien: she initiates every bargain and accepts the final price. One beat more of physical jeopardy could have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—embracing the unknown that is already embracing you—emerges through the guardian’s paradox and the wrong sky’s pulse, never sermonized. The chess-secret economy embodies the idea that knowledge is both currency and curse. Final reconfiguration lands via image rather than statement. A touch more subtext in the pawn/rook choices would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Lirien’s perceptual signature: “jagged silhouette cutting the wrongness,” “wind sounded like an invitation.” Syntax is agile, rhythmic, and compressed; no filter-verb bloat. Guardian’s dialogue is spare, icy, and tonally distinct. Voice modulates from wary to exhilarated without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image, stakes, or character. Figurative language is selective—void sky, frost-starlight figure—and never clutters high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; punctuation and tense are clean. One near-repeat of “breath fog/fogged” is the only hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “trade secrets for relics inside chess pieces” mechanic feels fresh and is fully committed to; the wrong-sky spire reframes classic climb myth as cosmic game. Lirien’s thief-chivalry twist is specific rather than archetype bingo. Final riddle inverts time-hunt trope. Risk is present but not genre-shattering; still, specificity makes the synthesis memorable.</comment>
