<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “logical dreamer” interiority is vivid—she “saw equations in the way waves curled,” a clean, sensuous contradiction. Yet her final shift from observer to actor (“the work had only just begun”) is declared, not dramatized; we never see her actually alter a physical choice under pressure, so the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. The gauge vibration stands in for a micro-choice, but it’s reactive, not decisive. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent and specific, avoiding label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-building (shell spirals, dream balloons) intensifies until the gauge’s hum reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—bridge image crystallizes options with conceptual cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is satisfied by line 3; no causality breaks. Minor slip: “trial balloons” equation is stated late, not tested on-page, so the conceptual reprice is slightly abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grotto’s tide-polished quartz and dangling shell constellations are tactile, selective, and mirror the Fibonacci obsession; environment literally guides her pattern-building choices. Micro-setting triumph: the altitude gauge’s brass becomes a second heartbeat, constraining her final stance. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating props. Light fractals charge the closing image, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“puzzle out new equations for hope”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each decorative spiral tightens the density until the gauge’s vibration forces a stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of infinite parallel work), but because no live option is foreclosed on-page, pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Meets 8-band; misses 8.8+ because price is felt but not visibly paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: hope as iterative pattern-making, not feel-good bromide. Final image reframes prior shell spirals as “equations” without moralizing. Subtext in the gauge’s needle: precision amid decay whispers that hope is engineered, not found. Avoids tidy thesis; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet mathematically precise—“equations in the way waves curled” is a perceptual signature that sustains. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for tide hypnosis, staccato fragments for needle flickers. No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean. Minor cadence echo (“the tide rolled in once more”) repeats last line opener, but reads as intentional circularity rather than scaffold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “salt and time” compresses geology + history. No synonym loops or filter stacks. Metaphor coherence tight—“needle… stirred by an unseen wind” keeps physics intact. Final third free of artifacts; momentum breathes with scene pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: balloon gauge as quantum oracle turns steampunk relic into cosmological tool. Parallel selves riff is familiar, but anchoring it to tactile shell spirals and tidal math feels specific. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; pattern taught early. Could push higher if protagonist’s own equation had been visibly altered on-page.</comment>
