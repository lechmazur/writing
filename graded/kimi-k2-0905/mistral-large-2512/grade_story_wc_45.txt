<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s “forgiving skeptic” stance is shown through her staying after the substitute body surfaces and her readiness to kneel and dig for more teeth; the interiority is concrete (“skin prickle with the shrewdly innocent question: What if?”). Yet the climactic choice—taking the child’s hand—reads more as symbolic acceptance than a costly renunciation; the prior beats never force her to sacrifice or foreclose an alternative, so the arc feels emotionally resolved rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: tooth → map → maze → living child, each step a direct consequence of the last, and the final image (“Together, they walked back…”) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with the conceptual cost that the town will remain ignorant. Orientation is swift (garden, hedge maze, night after the body) and the lens—Causal—is held without wobble. The only minor slack is the off-stage appearance of the silver map; while magical, it is foreshadowed by the glowing second tooth, so causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The garden’s “willow-bent rules” and nameless flower-colors create a tactile micro-setting that actively guides Lena’s choices (the apple root yields teeth, the soil gives up the map). Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“smelled of damp earth and something older”) and the hedge maze’s shifting paths constrain her movement in the final beat. The environment never merely decorates; it supplies the tools that resolve the stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the real child or lay the stories to rest—tightens once: the second tooth becomes the map, collapsing search into encounter. Lena’s agency drives every turn (dig, whisper, follow, accept hand), and the price is legible: she accepts guardianship of an uncanny being the town will always fear. No reversal or antagonist is needed; the single deepening suffices under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of “turning mistakes into constellations”: the town’s fear, the substitute body, and the abandoned changeling are re-envisioned as a hidden constellation only Lena can see. The final image of two figures walking out while the town “never knows the truth” reweights the premise without moralizing. The ambiguity—whether this is rescue or new burden—lingers effectively, fulfilling the 9+ test of non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The free-indirect voice carries a restrained lyric cadence (“rules of the world bent like willow branches”) that stays within Lena’s perceptual range; diction never drifts into academic or corporate register. Compression is purposeful: “She kept it not for luck, but for proof” distills motive in one stroke. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctiveness is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening, with no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“star trapped in enamel”). The single possible micro-loop—“the garden sighed around them like a held breath finally released”—is earned by the prior pattern of breath imagery and does not obscure causality. Clean copy, no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The changeling-tooth-as-key is a fresh inflection on familiar folklore, and the “constellation” reframing of communal guilt feels specific to this narrator rather than generic uplift. Risk is moderate—magical realist garden, off-stage map—but coherence never wavers. While the core moves (hidden child, found object, guiding map) are recognizable, the synthesis and final image carry enough particularity to avoid derivative penalties.</comment>
