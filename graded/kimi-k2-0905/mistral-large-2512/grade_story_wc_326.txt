<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s borrowed-time guilt and heartbeat-counting compulsion are concrete and embodied; the porcelain shard handled in two beats anchors filial grief. The final renunciation—accepting he is “the space between mistakes”—is earned by the ghost’s pressure and the shard’s last touch. Interior contradiction is present but mild: no moment where guilt and relief collide in a single action. Still, the micro-choice to stop counting and pocket the shard visibly costs him, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ghost’s final line reweights the premise—Elias’s life is no longer borrowed but observed—at visible cost (he stops counting). Causal chain holds: death-certificate error → guilt → observatory → ghost → shard release → heartbeat renunciation. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “He thought of…” trio could lose one beat, but none touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dome refracting moonlight and the sub-zero metal smell are filtered through Elias’s hyper-alert gaze; the shard micro-setting constrains his fingers across three beats and charges the final pocketing. Snow-light spectral colors mirror the ghost’s ink patterns, integrating environment with concept. Only nit: no tactile consequence of cold (numb fingers, fogged glass) altering his handling of the shard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—legitimacy of his own existence—tightens once: ghost’s command “Defragment” forces him to decide whether to keep counting or relinquish the ritual. Cost is legible: he pockets the shard and stops at 103, trading control for acceptance. Pressure is coherent under situational lens; no external antagonist needed. Could use one earlier micro-cost (dropped shard, cracked skin) to push score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—existence as negative space rather than sum of errors—emerges through the shard’s fragility and the ghost’s ink spiral, never stated. Final reconfiguration reframes the death-certificate from curse to lens. Subtext in heartbeat silence after 103 says more than any epiphany. Avoids thematic echo; only the ghost’s last line flirts with aphorism but is earned by prior image chain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s sensory count; perceptual signature is numeric, chilled, optic. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short beats under ghost static—rhythm mirrors pulse. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. One filter-verb cluster (“he thought of…”) is the single bar to 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (light refraction = ink pixels) so no density penalty. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Final line “The stars are still watching” is a perfect cadence punch. Only a single paraphrase loop (“he had come here… he had come here”) keeps it from 9.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing bureaucratic glitch with digital after-life in an abandoned observatory feels fresh; the shard-as-soul fragment trope is redeemed by heartbeat numerics. Conceptual risk—static ghost writing in spilled ink—pays off without gimmick. Transformation test fails if relocated, proving specificity. Not quite a 9 because the core emotional arc (guilt → acceptance) is familiar underneath the ornate frame.</comment>
