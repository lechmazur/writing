<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; “wondered if she, too, was a story waiting to be unfolded” is the only micro-choice that edges toward contradiction. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The final renunciation is credible but low-cost because the book was never dramatized as a temptation. Trait consistency is strong; embodiment drifts into lyric summary rather than visceral beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of witness→release taught early, lands in Charged Poise as the book dissolves and silence reasserts. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure carries conceptual cost (she relinquishes possible authorship), but the absence of a middle beat that tests her grip on reality keeps the tightening modest. One shard, one transitionless scene, inside 800 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and river return in tactile beats (drinks light, laps at pages); micro-setting of the origami swan constrains the final gesture. Library is sketched through motion (“burrowed”) rather than catalog. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound, filtered through POV. Environment reweights meaning at close, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve witness stance vs. intervene with the new book. Pressure escalates only once—book appears→she releases it—without a mid-scene trial that would sharpen cost. Agency is present but solitary; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Sufficient for short-form but stays in mid-band because the book never endangers her silence or forces adaptation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges through recurrent images (river, swan, dissolving text) rather than statement. Final image reweights earlier material: relinquishing the book confirms silence as active force, not void. Ambiguity is purposeful; no moralizing. Could ascend higher if mid-scene had staged a clearer temptation to author rather than witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance; diction (“gnarled as the roots,” “forgotten tooth”) is specific and unlabored. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to clipped final paragraph, mirroring the cadence shift of release. No dialogue, so subtext is carried by image and silence. Perceptual signature is strong enough for 9-band; hairline slip is occasional adjective padding (“dim light,” “distant echo”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is dense but patterned (river=time, swan=folded meaning) and pays off in closure. One paraphrase loop: “she did not mind. / Silence, she had learned, was not the absence…” costs −0.2. Otherwise lean, with strong paragraph cut discipline. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Keeper of lost knowledge who refuses to write” is fresh inflection on archival fantasy. Regenerative silence as active force rather than void offers conceptual twist. Risk is moderate: lyric stasis over plot. Could swap names without breaking arc, but river-obsidian-swan triad is specific enough to resist full genericization. No close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
