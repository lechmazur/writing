<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aldric’s mute withdrawal and sudden surrender to the marionette strings give us a credible arc of renunciation, but the interior contradiction between “withdrawn” and “instant capitulation” is asserted rather than dramatized; the micro-choice to drop the sword lands, yet the emotional cost feels compressed because the prior beat shows no embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: found program → woman’s offer → surrender → bodily hoist; the orientation anchors within 120 words and the final image (“the oath is not to the puppet, but to the dance”) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with conceptual cost. One minor warp: the program dissolves into embers that “swirl around her fingers,” a teleporting prop that breaks physical logic for a beat but does not rupture the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s fogged glass, pulsing fruit, and twisting branches are filtered through Aldric’s war-numbed perception; the setting actively constrains the final choice by literally winding strings around his limbs, turning environment into antagonist. One hairline slip: the sky “that had forgotten dawn” is vivid but never re-enters the perceptual field to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightens once: the woman’s offer forces Aldric to trade autonomy for agency over fate. The price (loss of bodily control) is visible on the page, but the escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal deepens the cost beyond the initial surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: power over possibility exacts the price of becoming the very mechanism of control. The final line reconfigures the puppet motif without moralizing, letting the image of “the dance” carry the conceptual cost. No thematic echo or abstraction intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aldric; perceptual signature is war-bleached and tactile (“gauntlets scraping against the flagstones”). Syntax lengthens under duress, then fractures into short beats at the hoist, mirroring the loss of motor control. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is selective rather than stacked. One scaffold loop: “He had not spoken in years, not since the war ended and the world began to unravel at the seams” compresses two clauses into near-paraphrase, but the slip is early and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard + marionette metaphysics fuses two familiar tropes into a fresh crucible; the “shivering bliss” concept reframes battlefield time-glitch trauma as cosmic puppetry. The synthesis feels specific to this voice rather than a checklist graft.</comment>
