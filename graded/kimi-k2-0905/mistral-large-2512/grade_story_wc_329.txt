<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the orchard vs. seizing beauty—are dramatized in her body under pressure (hand clutching the shell while bowing). The locust-shell mimicry is an earned micro-choice that forecloses her old life; the bruised landing on rusted metal makes the cost visible. Interiority stays concrete (“her fingers already tightening”) rather than abstract. Voice stays coherent across shards; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shell heartbeat → rhythm hack → vine eruption → leap. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and again at shard break. Closure is a Charged Poise: the speaker’s music spills into the mechanical street, reconfiguring the world’s silence with undeniable cost—her bow will never rest. Persistent constraint: statues keep coming, bow remains in hand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard and mechanical wasteland are sketched with selective, urgent sense detail (“gnarled trees heavy with fruit that never rotted,” “air thick with oil and decay”). The locust shell functions as micro-setting that constrains her tactic shift. Spatial choreography across the sky-bridge leap is clean; distances track. Final image of cracked speaker vibrating with shell-rhythm re-weights the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep beauty alive vs. be eaten by silence—signals early. One meaningful tightening: shell rhythm converts her passive vigil into an active breakout that narrows options to jump. Cost is visible: bruised knees, perpetual exile, bow never silent. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: beauty as insurgent force, not nostalgic ornament. Subtext in the child’s cracked speaker re-prices the world’s silence without preaching. Final image of music spilling into rusted towers offers resonant, non-literal answer: beauty is seized, not coaxed. No sermonizing or thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter (“air hum like a half-remembered lullaby”). Syntax mirrors violin cadence—long bow-stroke sentences swell, then fracture at jump. No head-hop; child’s interiority surfaced only through gesture and dialogue tag. Register stable; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Information density high: one sentence often advances music, stakes, and body. No mixed metaphors; “shattered prism” stays consistent with light motif. Zero loops or scaffold; no artifact in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar “last musician vs. stone guardians” trope is inverted by heartbeat morse code and mechanical-wasteland coda. Specific synthesis: locust shell as cryptographic key fuses insect molt + music + rebellion. Risky vault across sky-bridge pays off with landed cost. Fresh inflection: beauty is not revived but weaponized on contact.</comment>
