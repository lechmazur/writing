<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief and need to understand Mira’s vanishing are palpable, but the interiority leans on abstract labels (“fractured hush,” “necessary distances”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after the midpoint alters his tactics; the final renunciation is asserted, not dramatized through a fresh action. The trait of “analyzing grain” is named but never shown steering a decision. Daughter remains off-page, so relationship crucible cannot apply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias sets the prism down and accepts the threshold he cannot cross; the cost is the visible absence he now carries. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each refracted image deepens the stake of irretrievable loss. Orientation is clear by line 5; no penalty. One scaffold paraphrase (“the wood was warm, almost alive…”) slightly dulls the final beat, keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is not backdrop; its tilting panels and jagged rainbows physically destabilize Elias’s footing and mirror the splintering of certainty. The glass prism he handles in the final beat reweights the earlier refraction motif, making the setting charge the closure image. Micro-setting (the spiral-grained bench) constrains his tactile search and is tracked consistently. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—father’s need to locate daughter—signals early and tightens through each failed sensory clue. Pressure grows accumulatively: every refracted rainbow and splintered footprint intensifies the impossibility of crossing back. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening when the prism hits the floor and he chooses retreat. Cost is legible in the pocketed logbook’s dead weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “thresholds once crossed cannot be recrossed” emerges through the terrace’s literal edge and the final image of the abandoned prism. Subtext resides in the silence after the glass falls—acceptance without exposition. No moralizing sentence mars the ending. The weather code remains conceptually reweighted as a map to an unreal storm, underscoring irreversible separation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: spirals in wood, sky “split by fractured light,” prism cold against palm. Syntax lengthens under grief, then snaps short at the final renunciation, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice contamination not tested. Occasional lyric elevation (“broken promises across the planks”) stays within a bereaved father’s heightened register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; only one paraphrase loop (“the wood was warm…”) and one filter-verb cluster (“he saw her”) in the vision beat. Figurative language is selective and coherent—light metaphors never collide. High information density: each sensory detail also advances emotional stakes. No artifact touches the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The corn-maze architect’s missing child fused with a prism terrace that refracts impossible weather codes feels fresh, not grafted. The “analyzing grain” method is under-exploited, preventing higher originality. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Premise avoids familiar missing-child tropes by foregrounding threshold metaphysics rather than detective beats.</comment>
