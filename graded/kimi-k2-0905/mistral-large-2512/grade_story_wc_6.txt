<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—protecting the child while exposing her own wound—surface only in soft dialogue; the interior clash is asserted, not embodied. The coin as paternal relic is handled twice but never tests her vocation or forecloses an option; cost is thematic, not dramatized. Still, her tactile attention to sand and scar keeps the portrait above generic “healer” cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the adult offers her scar-song to the child while the distant siren keeps the fire-world alive; the new dyad is legible and irreversible. Causality is situational—no plot reversals, but the encounter crystallizes Lena’s stance under the lagoon’s hush. Orientation is swift; only the mother’s vanishing remains off-stage without payoff, a minor ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Obsidian water, black sand, and the coin form a micro-setting trilogy that constrains the final teaching moment: the sand literally slips through fingers to embody loss, the lagoon mirrors shifting clouds to cue time, the coin warms against skin to signal readiness. Sensory selection stays tight to Lena’s fire-sharpened attention. One minor lapse: “kelp-drift peace” is told, not felt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens once: Lena shifts from solitary listening to mentoring a witness, trading exposure for possible rejection. No external opposition or resource loss escalates the risk; pressure is purely ethical-aesthetic. Sufficient for sub-800-word lyric mode, but the cost is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sand-coin-skin triad: ruin as seedbed, not lesson. Final image of “quiet hum of healing” reweights the father’s arson from origin to octave. Avoids explicit moral; the child’s uncomprehending nod keeps ambiguity intact. One soft line—“plant the seed of unyielding compassion”—edges toward thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lena’s fire-sharpened sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent—heat-cold, grain-skin, metal-warmth. Syntax lengthens during lagoon stillness, shortens at the child’s question, mirroring breath. No head-hop; coin and sand return as tactile leitmotifs rather than symbols imposed from outside.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose carries a read-aloud cadence without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative layer is restrained—only two metaphors in 700 words—keeping the lagoon’s mirror uncluttered. One scaffold: “she had come… she had stayed” is mild recap; no loops or register drift touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter teaching a child on a volcanic beach—avoids redemption cliché by keeping father present only as warm coin. Black sand as scar-song medium is fresh, but “fire-as-family-trauma” is familiar terrain. Risk is emotional, not structural; the piece commits fully to quiet lyric mode without gimmick.</comment>
