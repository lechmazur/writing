<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—flight versus acceptance—are dramatized in the moment she closes her fingers around the bead; the embodied shudder and salt-taste show cost without label-speak. The final press of the bead to her lips crystallizes a credible, irreversible endurance that forecloses further flight, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor deduction: the seven-year amnesia is asserted rather than dramatized, slightly blunting motivation immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s warmth becoming a “second heartbeat” reweights the entire debt and forecloses escape with felt cost. Causal lens holds throughout—because she grips the bead, memory floods and stance crystallizes. Orientation is secured by line 3 (“winter solstice for seven years”) and the pattern is taught early; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s cold glass and metallic tang constrain Liora’s movements—she kneels, brushes soil, receives the bead within that hush—so environment actively shapes the beat. The bead itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. One hairline slip: “winter-cracked fields” is repeated verbatim; still, the object’s pulse and salt-taste keep specificity high.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repay the unnamed debt—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the bead’s warmth forces memory; options narrow to acceptance. The single meaningful turn (gripping the bead) escalates under causal lens with visible price: the wound stays “forever open.” No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the image sequence of seed–wound–bead–heartbeat: memory as irreversible organic growth. No moral is stated; the final taste of salt and magic reweights prior material without abstraction. The “lovingly venomous” wound is shown, not sermonized, yielding resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—“time moved slower, thicker, like honey dripping from a spoon”—that modulates under pressure to shorter, breathless clauses. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts credibly as the bead warms. One near-repeat phrase (“wound that refused to close”) but cadence remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Information density is high—each sentence advances memory, object, or cost. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; “winter-cracked fields” is the only echo and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The alchemical-orchard–ghost-bride fusion feels fresh because the bride is neither vengeful nor benign but a living mnemonic device; the bead as memory-graft is a non-obvious twist on the token of regret. Risk—lyric non-linear flash—pays off in closure. Slight familiarity of “debt across lifetimes” keeps it just shy of 9+.</comment>
