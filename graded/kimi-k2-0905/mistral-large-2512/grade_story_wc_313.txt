<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—erase vs. speak—co-exist in scene, but the interiority drifts into abstract “shared meaning” therapy-speak at the exact moment he pockets the photos, blunting the embodied cost of the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each photograph tightens options until the distillery lantern forces a because/therefore decision. Closure lands as Charged Poise—pocketing the photos reframes the levee’s future with undeniable social cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sapphire label and mirrored reservoir act as micro-settings that physically constrain the choice (burn or carry back). Spatial choreography stays clean from ridgeway to distillery; juniper-tangled chime anchoring twilight satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“drowned stories resurfacing”—tightens once: the fourth photo collapses Elias’s inherited myth. Price is legible: he must now publicly bear witness, forfeiting the warden’s quiet authority. Could use one earlier micro-loss to push into 8.8 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: submerged histories can’t be managed, only spoken. Final image of wind-ruffled branches reweights the premise without moralizing. One abstract clause—“to spin stories into shared meaning”—triggers −0.4 for thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices textures of damp wood, ghost-berry sweetness, mirrored hush. Rhythm modulates under pressure; no head-hopping. One register drift into “conceptual repricing” academic docket keeps it below 8.5.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often advances atmosphere, stakes, and backstory. Two mixed metaphors—“bones of a forgotten song,” “drowned man gasping”—slightly muddle; no loops or template cadence detected. Final third remains artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-reservoir town rising is fresh terrain; photograph trail as breadcrumb memory device feels novel and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than twist. Synthesis stays specific to Elias’s lineage, avoiding generic flood allegory.</comment>
