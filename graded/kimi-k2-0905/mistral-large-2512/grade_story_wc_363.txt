<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to silence yet answering the call—surfaces early and tightens through embodied beats (wrapping the damp shawl, pressing the bead to her ear). The final renunciation costs her the orchard and the loom; causality holds. One hairline slip: “she understood then” moment is slightly label-like, blunting peak embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forfeits the orchard and accepts the silence outside it. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (fraying shawl, glowing bead, skeleton loom) reweights the stake until the final crystallized poise. Orientation anchors within 60 words; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the dimming amber and her forward step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard, bamboo, and bead act as micro-settings that constrain every move: the bead’s warmth decides departure; the crumbling spires force final acceptance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—silk threads “damp with her own breath” fuses body and place. One minor drift: city description is sparser, but the ruin mirrors internal desolation, so function remains intact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“stay swallowed by silence or re-enter the world”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens once: the bead’s hum makes refusal impossible. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density of forgetting increases until silence flips from refuge to prison. Cost is visible when she abandons the loom and orchard without guarantee of return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-both-wound-and-womb emerges through image chain: half-woven shawl, unbroken puzzle, skeleton loom. No moralizing; the final “beginning” is a Charged Poise that reweights the orchard’s forgetting as necessary loss. Subtext in Kael’s corpse = mirror of her future if she had stayed—shown, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual filter: “stoically sparkling” bamboo, “thread pulled loose from the loom of time.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath, never breaking pattern. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A; internal diction remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic drift; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold trace: “the silence was raveling around her, thick as wool” repeats the raveling concept already shown by frayed shawl, a −0.2 loop that keeps the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of textile cosmology and post-apocalyptic orchard feels singular; the puzzle-map that doubles as memory-tapestry is a fresh device. Risk in letting the quest end with a corpse and no resurrection pays off thematically. Transformation test fails if names are swapped—details are too specific to this voice and world.</comment>
