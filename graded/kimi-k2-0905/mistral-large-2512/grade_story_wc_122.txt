<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile listening and Mira’s numbness are embodied in every beat; the moment she lets the silence “become something she could hold” is a credible, earned shift. Interior contradiction is present—Mira both fears and craves the hush—yet the final acceptance is slightly under-powered: we see her exhale but not the immediate cost on her body or next action. Still, traits govern speech, gesture, and worldview; no therapy-speak intrudes. Character work is vivid, but the micro-choice that seals the change could carry sharper forfeiture to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the filament of hush thickens until the final tap reweights silence as playable. Orientation is swift—cavern, two characters, shared goal—and the broken needle’s first appearance at ~100 words anchors the pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira’s “emptiness changed” is legible, felt, and irreversible; the cost is the lifelong labor of holding that silence. One causal link remains implicit—how the snapped needle actually transmits “hush” onto skin—but the pattern is taught early and pays off without contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: drum-skin, lantern gleam on snapped metal, and stone that drinks sound constrain every action. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s deafness—vibration, scent, temperature—while Mira’s numbness filters visual sharpness. The cavern’s muteness is not backdrop but active antagonist that forces their tactile experiment. Environment, body, and tool converge to charge the final image; no atmospheric detail floats unattached.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—signals on arrival and tightens once: from resisting silence to wielding it. The tap that makes no audible sound is the single deepening that forecloses Mira’s old tactic of noise-filled escape. Cost is legible—she must now live inside the hush she once fled—yet the external stakes (what she forfeits next, how this changes her life beyond the cavern) remain unspoken, capping entry into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence into playable substance; no character ever names the moral. The broken needle and the drum reweight each other: relic of failed sound becomes stylus for unsound. Final image—Mira holding transformed emptiness—offers resonant ambiguity: is this healing or new burden? Subtext thrives in gesture: Elias placing the needle, Mira’s twitching fingers. No platitudes, only concrete particulars that echo after the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited flexes between Elias’s tactile lexicon (“pulse of the earth… shiver of air”) and Mira’s sharper, visually brittle register. Syntax lengthens for Elias’s slow circles, shortens for Mira’s frustration; rhythm tracks emotional temperature. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Final paragraph modulates into shared cadence without collapsing distinction—precise control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language clusters only in low-action beats where density is welcome. One scaffold trace: “the way rhythm could enthrall the soul when words failed” edges toward abstraction, but it is immediately grounded in the drum gift. Otherwise, verbs are strong, paragraphs trim, and the final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf drum-maker records silence itself using a snapped phonograph needle—concept that feels inevitable once introduced. Risk lies in making “nothing” the playable medium; execution follows through without gimmickry. Specificity of haptic listening and emotional anesthesia prevents abstraction drift. Transformation test fails if relocated: the cavern’s muffled stone, the needle’s obsolete tip, and Elias’s tactile craft are irreplaceable. Bold, memorable, and fully committed.</comment>
