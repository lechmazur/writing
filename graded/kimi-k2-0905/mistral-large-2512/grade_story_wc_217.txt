<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—her grief is embodied in the lagoon’s hush and the feather’s weight—but the moment of shift (“healing wasn’t about mending…”) is articulated rather than dramatized, so the final stance feels slightly managed, not earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the snapped string → feather-quill → blank page becomes a Charged Poise that reweights grief into generative incompleteness. Causality is accumulative/textural; each image (feather, woven dawns, kite crack) layers density until the final cadence turns the stake from loss to ongoing song. Cost is felt in the ink-stained, salt-stung fingers—an indelible, visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon’s post-rain surface, the drake feather’s oil-sheen, and the woven dawns in reeds are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered; the feather-as-quill finally constrains the closing act of writing, charging the image. Micro-setting (body, tool) successfully substitutes for broader geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into usable beauty—is signaled early and deepens through tactile micro-choices (wading, pressing feather to palm). The kite-crack supplies a single tightening beat; options narrow to “write or retreat,” but the cost, though felt, is more conceptual than tactical, keeping pressure just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: incompleteness as generative force. The feather’s fractured vanes and the unfinished poem embody this without sermon. Final image of “broken things could sing” reweights prior material via Conceptual Repricing, avoiding tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the unclosed poem.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person intimate sustains a burnished, tidal rhythm; diction (“hammered metal,” “lace of tide”) remains within Mira’s perceptual signature. No head-hop; compression (“She had come to tend…”) is brief, anchored to present stimuli. Final cadence modulates breath-length sentences to mirror surf-like hush—precise control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—each metaphor (metal sheet, stained-glass feather, woven dawns) returns to watery light motif. One mixed moment—“burnished hush that made her chest ache”—is permissible at closure where pressure crystallizes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar grief-to-art arc is refreshed by the drake-feather quill and the “woven dawns” optic—particularizing the lagoon’s fractured reflections. Risk resides in lyric accumulative structure; it heightens texture without gimmick. Transformation feels inevitable yet not derivative, though the core insight remains within known poetic territory.</comment>
