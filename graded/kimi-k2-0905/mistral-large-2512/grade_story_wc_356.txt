<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s drive is vivid—green-stained fingers, seed cradled like contraband—but the interior contradiction never bites. She never hesitates, sniffs danger, or weighs the elders’ warning against her own ambition; the grandmother’s journal simply confirms her. Because no micro-choice on the page actually risks anything (she pockets the seed, sketches, talks), the final “understanding” feels handed, not earned. Cost is asserted (“years to bloom”) rather than dramatized, so the arc lands as gentle affirmation, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the stillness insight reweights the premise with conceptual cost—she accepts the wait. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory note, doodle, and elder warning layers density until the final line crystallizes the stake. The grandmother journal beat is a touch too convenient—information arrives exactly when needed to pivot Mira’s stance—but because the insight still carries an undeniable price (the seed’s multi-year dormancy), the beat passes. One tightening, one reconfiguration, no orientation debt; lens coherent to end.</comment>

<comment>Treetop village is sketched with swift, tactile economy: creaking bridges, moss-lined balcony, vines children swing from. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s olfactory bias—every breeze carries data—so description never feels touristic. The wrapped doodle paper and seed’s “faint scent of decay” act as micro-settings that constrain her next move (unwrap, record). Spatial choreography stays clean across the single balcony scene; no floating bodies or lost anchors.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can she cultivate serenity for her people—gets signaled early and re-anchored by Nara’s warning. Pressure escalates texturally: each sensory note, elder caution, and grandmother’s frantic line thickens the cost of being wrong. Yet Mira never faces an on-page trade-off; she never has to choose between planting the seed tonight or surrendering it, so the tightening is intellectual, not tactical. The final acceptance is resonant but not a reversal—no option is foreclosed—so escalation stays modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—serenity resides in tending, not arrival—emerges through seed, doodle paper, and tide imagery rather than sermon. The grandmother’s marginalia (“The stillness is not in the bloom, but in the waiting”) is the only thematic echo, but it is brief, inherited, and paid for by Mira’s quiet renunciation of instant bloom. Subtext lives in the tension between stench and healing, motion and stillness, without moralizing. Final image reweights prior motifs cleanly; no tidy aphorism caps the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perceptual lattice: every scent, breeze, ink line is filtered through her herbalist bias. Syntax flexes with her racing mind—spiraling doodles, catalog of soil and lunar notes—then softens into the final exhale. Nara’s dialogue is spare, wind-through-reeds, distinct from Mira’s greener, quicker interior diction. No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat; voice modulates with emotional temperature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “woven bridges creaking softly as if whispering secrets to the wind” does triple duty (sound, motion, secrecy). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stake or texture. One mixed metaphor—“quiet fire that burned brighter”—is momentary, not repeated, and does not touch closure. Opening and closing lines are anchored and resonant; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower-as-calmative is fresh; the inversion of horror into healing serenity gives the piece its hinge. Treetop village and olfactory gift are familiar tropes, but they are braided through Mira’s specific vocation and grandmother’s marginalia so the combo feels particular rather than checklist. Risk is modest—no structural experimentation—but the conceptual flip carries enough weight to lift the story above generic eco-fantasy. Could push further into the flower’s ethical thorns, but the core angle is non-obvious and well-executed.</comment>
