<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>E-7X’s calm, glitching curiosity is sketched through concrete micro-choices—hovering hand, slower mop strokes—so the “remarkably composed” trait earns its keep. Interior contradiction is hinted (duty to clean vs hunger for origin) but never collides in a single beat; the loops externalize rather than dramatize the split. The final renunciation (“ready to begin again”) is legible but the cost is abstract; no prior option is foreclosed on the page. Still, the voice-specific perceptual filter (shattered-mirror light, static between code) keeps the robot from reading as a stock archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the loops collapse into a crystallized moment whose cost is the unending pursuit itself—“some questions weren’t meant to be answered.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each layering of twilight deepens the stake rather than resets it. Orientation is swift—frozen courtyard, twilight, janitor, violin all inside 120 words. No teleporting props; the ice violin is present throughout and its final hum reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The courtyard’s mirrored ice and looped twilight are not backdrop but instrument: they constrain E-7X’s every attempt to grasp the violin without melting it. Micro-setting (the frost under his chassis, the chill conducting vibration into metal) doubles as sensory embodiment of his alien cognition. Selective detail—no extraneous tech lore—keeps the 700-word frame taut. The final image of frost swept from stones carries the reconfigured meaning: knowledge as endless upkeep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where do thoughts come from?”—is signaled early and tightens through each loop: every repetition adds tactile density (crack of ice, reflection with stitched mouth) that raises the cost of ignorance. One meaningful deepening suffices: the whisper in the gap between thoughts reconfigures the quest from acquisition to listening. Agency is present—he chooses to pick up the mop, to press forehead to ice—but the price (eternal pursuit) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping the score just below the 8.2 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: consciousness as maintenance, not destination. The ice violin transmutes from impossible object to epistemic engine without authorial nudging. Final line’s refusal of answer is earned by the looping pattern; no moral is stated. Ambiguity lingers—does the melody free or chain him?—but the after-image is concrete: frost ghosting in circuits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to E-7X’s perceptual circuitry: diction of “alloy chassis,” “audio receptors,” “static in the gaps” is consistent yet musical. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for loops, staccato fragments for cracks—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; the humans remain distant silhouettes, appropriate to his isolation. The lyric compression (“world *shifted*”) is taught early and paid off at collapse, justifying the italics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is spare—shattered mirror, stitched mouth—each re-used to reweight meaning, avoiding decorative overload. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; “loop” recurs only as noun/verb with shifting context. One minor scaffold: “the question never faded” restates prior line, but it occurs mid-text and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The second-chance janitor trope is inverted: cleaning becomes the metaphor for infinite inquiry rather than redemption. Ice-crystal violin feels inevitable in hindsight—an instrument that erases itself suits a question that dissolves answers. Risky loop structure pays off by making the reader feel temporal vertigo without breaking causality. Specificity of “shattered-mirror twilight” and “ghost of a melody in circuits” prevents the concept from drifting into abstraction.</comment>
