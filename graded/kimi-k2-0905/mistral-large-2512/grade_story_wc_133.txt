<comment>The sleepless painter’s insomnia is viscerally embodied (“paint on his canvases never dried; he worked in layers, scraping away”), and the brooch-in-pocket moment gives a micro-choice that externalizes inner fracture. Interior contradiction is strong: he claims to paint “to remember” yet the woman corrects “you paint to forget,” exposing a split the final hand-taking accepts. Cost is present—the tide swallows the return path—but the shift from passive reception of dreams to active surrender is slightly under-motivated on the page; we see the gesture more than the irreversible internal tilt that locks the cost. Still, within 700 words the arc of exhausted compulsion crystallizing into fatal cooperation feels earned.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide erases retreat and the brooch burns between joined hands, re-weighting all prior amber imagery with the cost of irreversible entanglement. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (rain, resin murals, tide) tightens the noose of drowned stories until the painter steps into the pact. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“tidal island…sea retreated twice a day”) and no teleporting props occur. The only minor drag is the woman’s explanatory chunk inside the cave; it slightly flattens the escalation right before the final image, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Environment is never backdrop: the returning tide literally deletes the path, forcing the final choice, while the cave’s molten-amber walls mirror the brooch and the painter’s layered canvases. Sensory triangulation—salt sting, copper smell, resin heat—filters through the insomniac’s narrowed attention. The skeletal ship mast and slick cliff descent are sketched with painterly economy, each detail later echoed in the amber murals. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves or floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he trade his own agency to exhume drowned stories?—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens once: the brooch’s warmth escalates from dream-cue to skin-brand, turning abstract guilt into physical price. The rain-trail choice and the cave entry are sequential escalations under Accumulative pressure; each new amber surface increases the density of trapped memory. The final hand-clasp forecloses retreat with visible geographic cost (incoming tide). No coincidence resolves; the woman’s appearance is the culmination of the trail he chose to follow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as both preservation and erasure—emerges through the painter’s scraping/re-layering and the amber-entombed murals, never sermonized. The closing image of two hands around a burning brooch reconfigures memory as shared burden rather than solitary obsession. Subtext in dialogue (“You paint to forget”) reframes his entire practice without moralizing. The drowned-stories conceit risks abstraction, but the tactile resin and tide keep the concept grounded and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the painter’s perceptions; the wry woman’s voice is distinct without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors exhaustion—long, salt-licked clauses that fragment under cave pressure. Figurative control is high (“rain carved rivers into dirt”) yet stays within a painter’s lexicon. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds even during the explanatory beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with escalation: clipped openings during cliff descent, then liquid run-ons inside the amber cave. Every sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. The single mixed metaphor—“rain carried memory…drowning in ghosts”—is purposeful and immediately tethered to tactile consequence. Line-level craft is clean, propulsive, and closure-adjacent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Post-water-war tidal island and memory-amber are freshly synthesized; the brooch-as-key/lock twist reframes a familiar quest object into reciprocal imprisonment. Insomnia-as-creative-method is not new, but linking paint layers to geological resin traps is. Risk in the lyric accumulative structure pays off: the final image feels inevitable yet un-gimmicky. No close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
