<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative—“prism-minded archivist” refracts through sensory detail—but her motives stay abstract: “find forgotten combinations” never sharpens into a personal stake. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she simply proceeds. The final recognition (“guardian of thresholds”) is asserted, not paid for by an on-page choice that costs her anything. Still, the perceptual filter is consistent and character-specific, keeping the score north of midline.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank book absorbs her marginalia and reconfigures her identity with conceptual cost—she leaves carrying a secret flame. Causality under an Accumulative lens holds: doodles → path → book → new role. Orientation is taught by 80 words; no penalty. One minor slack: the “hour of inversion” rule is announced late, not foreshadowed, so the price feels slightly exogenous rather than earned by prior constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine coils, mist curtain, and inverted stalactites are tactile and bias-filtered through Elara’s cataloguing gaze. Environment actively shapes action: moisture rises to imprint her soles, moss flares at touch, blank book sits at gravity’s pivot. These constraints alter her movement and cue the final image. Micro-setting (the manuscript) also functions as tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find forgotten combinations”—is declared early; pressure tightens when symbols rearrange and the blank book demands transfer of her marginalia, foreclosing the option to remain mere observer. The transfer itself is passive (book does the writing), so agency is observational rather than decisive. Cost is conceptual but present: she exits transformed, sworn to secrecy. One clear tightening beat satisfies short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: archival obsession as portal to custodianship; knowledge is not consumed but guarded. The ouroboros doodle and blank book create a quiet CR—what was sought becomes responsibility. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the “flame in the dark.” Ambiguity is productive, though the stakes could cut deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s synesthetic cataloguing: “prism-minded,” “latent blaze,” “hum in bones.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath control; no head-hopping. Diction skews latinate yet remains within an archivist’s lexicon. One register slip: “therapy-speak” label “she understood then” could be replaced by embodied beat, but it’s isolated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from elongated sensory clauses to staccato beats (“She opened the book.”). Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor overwriting: “clandestinely luminous” appears twice in 700 words; second use dulls the coinage. Still, propulsion never stalls and the final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Inverted gravity hour + archival marginalia yields a fresh angle on the “lost knowledge” trope. The ouroboros manuscript bleeding into a blank codex feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is present but modest; the piece executes its concept cleanly without pushing formal boundaries further. Specificity of grotto and archivist lens prevents generic swap-out.</comment>
