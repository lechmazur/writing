<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief for his sister is concrete—turning it “like a chess piece”—and his decision to step into the night carries a palpable cost. Yet the interior contradiction between “planting forests” and armed rebellion is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see him hesitate over a magnet or window cue that would force a visible trade-off. The final image is earned, but the middle lacks a micro-choice that crystallizes the stakes for him personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the synchronized lights flicker alive as Elias crosses the threshold, reweighting the quiet rebellion with undeniable risk. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory beat thickens the hush until the town’s held breath is externalized in light. The sister’s vanishing is referenced twice but never given an on-page cue that would anchor the grotto’s rules, so the speculative logic remains slightly porous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist, stained-glass shadows, and the oak table are filtered through Elias’s tactile memory; the cobalt library functions as both sanctuary and trap. The grotto is only named, never entered or handled, so it fails the 9+ gate that requires an environmental constraint to shape tactics. The final image of shifting light on cobblestones evolves from earlier ledger sketches, giving the setting a re-weighted payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the town heed the silent warning before the shadows return?—tightens as the window code goes live. Pressure escalates by accretion: whispers thicken, clocks swallow their own chimes, magnets clink in the bag. One concrete loss is implied: Elias forfeits the safety of anonymity the moment he steps outside, light announcing his complicity. The cost is felt but not yet paid in blood, satisfying the 600-word bandwidth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the necessity of quiet, reversible resistance—chess logic versus forest logic—without ever naming it. The synchronized displays literalize “second thoughts” into a communal language, letting subtext glimmer instead of preach. The sister’s absence haunts every beat, but the grotto remains abstract, blunting the conceptual reprice. Still, the final image reframes the library’s hush as the first move, not the last.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is hushed, slightly archaic, consistent with a man who hears what others only breathe. Syntax lengthens and contracts with Elias’s attention—short clauses under stress, lyrical rolls when memory overtakes him. No dialogue appears, so the interior monologue must carry idiom; it does, avoiding filter verbs and therapy-speak. The only slippage is one line—“something older, something hungry”—that edges toward generic horror cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold sentences appear. Figurative language is selective—prismatic shadows, chess-piece grief—each image anchored to Elias’s perception. The opening sentence is long but controlled, setting tone without purple drag. One mixed metaphor—“grief is a forest you plant”—survives because it is immediately re-grounded in the seed-by-seed action of the window code.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of small-town gothic with tactical light-code feels fresh; the chess-coach-turned-partisan of silence is not a stock figure. Synchronized window displays as insurgent semaphore invert the usual torch-and-pitchfork rebellion, shrinking epic resistance to boutique scale. The grotto-as-wound risks familiar cosmic-cave tropes, but its magnetic specificity and handmade piece-magnets keep it from abstraction. A hair more concrete grotto lore could push the score higher.</comment>
