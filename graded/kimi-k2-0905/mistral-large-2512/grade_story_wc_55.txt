<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet grief and avoidance are credibly embodied in his bench ritual and nighttime vigil; the micro-choice to invite the girl in cracks his armor and tracks. The final kneel at the forecourt registers as earned renunciation because the music-box repair and the bear’s nudge have already forced a visible softening. Interiority stays concrete—oil-and-parchment skin, trembling girl hands—never drifting into label-speak. Flaws (risk-aversion, mother-haunting) actively shape the yes/no to the bear and the kneel, so the closure cost feels proportionate to 700 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias re-opens the path to the foreclock with felt cost—he abandons lifelong avoidance and the safety of routine. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the humming stones, ticking Spire, and music-box melody layer until the final kneel reweights memory. Causality is soft—why a bear guides him is unexplained—but coincidence only complicates, not resolves, so Situational allowance holds. Orientation debt is waived: “the city of Vaelis still slept” places us by 60 words and the bear’s payoff at closure justifies early hush-mystery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt evolves from boyhood myth to adult reckoning, constraining Elias’s final kneel; its quartz hum is the literal sound-track of closure. Micro-setting inside the Spire is equally tactile: scattered watch-tools, oil scent on skin, blanket in the corner—all used, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean: alley → gate → forecourt, no impossible jumps. Weather (overnight rain) is causal, making stones sing and bear tracks plausible. One cap: no environment-driven tactic during the walk; still, the setting recharges the ending image, satisfying 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—avoidance vs. return to the forecourt—is signaled early and tightens once: the repaired music box + bear sighting foreclose continued refusal. Cost is visible—he physically leaves the sanctuary and kneels where he swore never to return—but escalation is single-step, not iterative. Agency is present but gentle; luck (bear arrival) nudges more than forces. Sufficient for 600-word scale, yet lacks a second pressure twist that would push into 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as repairable mechanism—emerges through parallel between watch gears and music-box restoration, never abstractly named. The forecourt’s “whispers” reprice from boyish magic to adult elegy without exposition. Subtext in the bear: patient solitude mirrored in Elias’s own. Final image (kneeling, palm to humming quartz) answers the thematic question wordlessly. One friction: near-echo of “mother wound” trope, but local detail (music box she wound) keeps it from feeling stock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elias’s perceptual bias—clock-oil skin, auditory narrowing to ticking—no head-hop. Syntax mirrors his meticulosity: balanced clauses, gear-like cadence. No dialogue from Elias, so voice distinction test is waived; girl’s brief speech is child-simple, appropriate. Filter verbs are minimal, used only when they signal his evaluative pause (“he thought of…”). One micro drift: “the world still wrapped in the hush” momentarily cosmic, but immediately re-anchors to his skin-level cold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: long oil-and-parchment clauses early, short cold-bite fragments during the bear walk. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors both vocation and stillness in one stroke. One minor scaffold: “the city of Vaelis still slept” repeats the sleep idea in adjacent clause, but the echo serves cadence and is not repeated elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fusing watch-repair with music-box grief is fresh; bear as grief-guide feels mythic yet earned by the forecourt’s established whisper-magic. The “glacial hush” sunrise and crystal humming stones particularize setting beyond generic fantasy city. Risk is moderate—bear could read twee, but its silence and immediate exit keeps it from gimmick. Not transformative enough for 8.5+ band, yet avoids stock clockwork orphan cliché through sensory specificity.</comment>
