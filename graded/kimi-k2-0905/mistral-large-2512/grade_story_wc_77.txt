<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior dread is vividly embodied (hollow vessel, mirror recoil), but the whispering advisor functions as disembodied oracle rather than relationship crucible; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only received wisdom. The final renunciation (dropping the clasp) is symbolically legible yet feels lightly earned because the mirror-test is passed on the first attempt without visible cost beyond startle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s reversion and torn photo certify a before/after under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—why touching glass starves the doppelgänger is asserted, not motivated—but the pattern holds. Orientation is clean by 120 words; only one reflective block (<20 %) and it tilts present stance. Cost is conceptual (loss of cursed image) rather than viscerally felt, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<comment>Funhouse is rendered through sensory triad: rust-sugar air, warped glass, collapsed booth—each filtered by Elias’s bodily unease. Micro-setting (opera-clasp eye, Polaroid) constrains the final choice: he must unclasp and tear the photo to exit. Spatial choreography is coherent across the mirror lunge and retreat. Environment is indispensable to tactics and final image, meeting the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“am I already hollow?”—is signaled early and tightened when reflection refuses to mimic him. Single meaningful escalation: mirror-lunge → palm-press that collapses the doppelgänger; options narrow from flight to confrontation. Agency is present but cost is primarily conceptual (loss of fear’s image) rather than tangible, capping the band. Coincidence absent; resolution stems from Elias’s counter-intuitive curiosity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-haunting emerges through mirror imagery and paradoxical notes without explicit sermon. Final image of torn, once-cursed photo reweights the premise: identity re-asserted by destroying its false copy. Ambiguity lingers—was the hollow fear real or projected?—but resonance is slightly blunted by advisor’s aphoristic prompts that occasionally echo prompt-language. No final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors metallic, ocular, saccharine textures that feel idiosyncratic to Elias. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during mirror lunge, longer reflective cadences afterward. No dialogue, so voice distinction across speakers not tested. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is selective rather than stacked. One mixed metaphor cluster (“silvered surfaces warped…like elastic”) but it does not obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening and closing lines are sharp, propulsive. Minor synonym echo (“lingering luminance” twice) keeps the score just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Mirror-as-self-haunting is familiar, but the Polaroid that captures facelessness and the opera-clasp eye as talisman give the trope fresh, tactile specificity. Paradoxical dream-dictionary inserts risk gimmick yet feel integrated via Elias’s oracular mindset. Risk is moderate: no structural experimentation, but sensory-metallic diction and object-choice elevate stock carnival horror into individualized nightmare. Transformation sufficient to escape template charge.</comment>
