<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s “methodically curious” trait is embodied in tactile map handling and the decision to pry the chapel, but the interior contradiction—why this risk now?—is asserted rather than dramatized. The final recognition (“the story was not yet finished”) lands as label, not embodied cost. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the micro-choice to enter darkness carries visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the child’s shoe reweights the torn map and the silence Elias has parsed for years; the cost is the sudden audible whisper that forecloses his former anonymity. Causal chain holds: torn map → footage comparison → pry → shoe → re-cognition. One minor elasticity: the chapel door opens on first try after decades, a convenience that slightly softens the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rain-scoured frescoes, lantern light on mossy stones, and the vault’s damp pigment create a coherent sensory palette that guides bodily movement. The henge’s stones and the chapel’s threshold function as micro-settings that literally constrain the final pry-bar action. Environment is never backdrop only; it tightens with each beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias break the village’s suffocating silence?—is signaled early and tightens once: the footage comparison forces the decision to reopen. The escalation is single-cycle but legible; the price (he now hears whispers) is on-page. Could use one intermediate obstacle to deepen cost, but sufficient for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of mapping the unmappable: silence, erased children, blank parchment. The final image of the single shoe re-prices the entire premise—cartography cannot chart erasure, only witness it. No moralizing; the resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—ink bleed, fiber fray, lantern flicker—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures during the pry: rhythmic control mirrors pressure. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each image (pigment scent, iron groan) advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; varied sentence openings maintain momentum. One mixed metaphor—“darkness swallowed sound”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Merging silent film archival horror with map-framer’s tactile expertise feels fresh; the footage gap becomes a literal tear in landscape. The vanished-children trope is redeemed by the shoe’s specific reprise in a new context. Risk is present but not showy; specificity carries it.</comment>
