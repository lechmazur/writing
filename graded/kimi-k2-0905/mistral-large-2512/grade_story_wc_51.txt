<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is textured—her breath curling into cold, the way she lets the thorn-coil bite without flinching—but the “years collecting burdens” backstory is delivered in one expository slab and never crystallizes into a contradictory on-page impulse; the final release feels more ordained than earned because we haven’t seen her earlier refusal to relinquish these weights.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp-warmed burner and the song-drip reweight the prior hush with undeniable cost (“her body lighter”) under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds because each calcified burden dissolves only after she permits it to press skin-cold against her, a micro-choice chain that tightens once and releases. Orientation is swift—grotto, starlight, snowmelt drip by line 3—so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bronze grotto ribs, kerosene brass, and starlight-slit ceiling are not backdrop but instruments: the thinnest north wall dictates flame orientation, the drip-rate modulates from whisper to song as the air calcifies. Micro-setting (lamp burner, her palm) constrains the decisive tactile choice, passing the 9+ gate; only the single adjective “boundary-lessly” momentarily blurs spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she let the burdens bronze her or release them—tightens once when the third thorn-tangle coils around her wrist and the grotto itself groans; the price (possible ossification) is legible, but because the dissolution happens in the same beat the escalation plateaus rather than deepens further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the alchemy of turning intangible grief into measurable weight, then song, avoids thesis-statement pitfalls. The final reconfiguration—silence becomes full song—carries conceptual cost without moralizing, though the earlier “years collecting burdens” paragraph edges toward pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter—cold brass, blue-hungry flame, thorn-barbs—syntax lengthens then compresses with her inhale/exhale rhythm. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the single neologism “boundary-lessly” is pattern-taught by the shadows’ behavior and repaid when the hush reconfigures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and stress, propelling the calcification beat; figurative layering is dense but purposeful—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One paraphrase loop (“weight…heavy…heaviest”) costs −0.2, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The kerosene-flame-as-fossilizer is a fresh inflection on the “confront your regrets” trope; the bronze grotto acoustic-ritual feels singular rather than borrowed. Risk is evident in the lyric compression, but the concept commits fully without late rule changes.</comment>
