<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to finish the orb yet fearing exposure—remains present in every beat; the final micro-choice to “flip the last switch” crystallizes the arc with visible cost (the humming ghosts he now must host). Embodied emotion is strong: the thumb on cracked leather, breath fogging, fingers on dusty toggles. Mother warning is cleanly anchored and tilts the present stance. The glassblower identity, however, is asserted more than practiced; we never see furnace heat or molten risk, so the occupational lens feels borrowed rather than lived, capping the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the machines awaken, the thaw is accepted, and the prior pattern of avoidance is reconfigured with undeniable conceptual cost—he now shares the room with “old ghosts.” Causal chain holds: bookmark → memory → thaw metaphor → switch act. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One meaningful tightening—abandoning the journal to manipulate live panels—suffices. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of humming, dripping, cracking images escalates until the cadence shift at “Let’s see what happens…” lands with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Control-room micro-setting is tactile: rust smell, dying-bee bulbs, dusty toggles that click. The cracked bookmark functions as micro-setting, constraining the final calibration when its creases guide thumb placement. Ice-melt drips serve as metronome, directly pacing interior thought. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. While wider facility geography is vague, the single room supplies every necessary resource and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“craft safe zones for inquiry without shattering”—is signaled early and revisited in the unfinished orb. Pressure tightens once: abandoning the passive journal to active switch-flip narrows options from reflection to live consequence. Cost is visible: the awakening machines now demand stewardship. No reversal or external antagonist is needed under Accumulative lens; the escalation is a density shift from silence to full chorus that forces stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete pattern: cracked yet functional objects (bookmark, orb, man) argue that fracture is prerequisite for light. Final image reweights the premise—machines once dormant now “whir like old ghosts,” making the conceptual cost undeniable. No moral is stated; the thaw is accepted, not celebrated. The insight feels earned from specific handling of glass, ice, and switches rather than from abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: selective attention to smells, clicks, drips. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during switch sequence, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Occasional lyrical uplift (“chorus of old ghosts”) remains within Elias’s artistic lexicon, keeping distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—three metaphors across 700 words—avoiding purple drift. Information density is high: each sentence advances atmosphere, memory, or action. One paraphrase loop (“the thawing heart of the world…”) is repeated twice; minor, does not touch closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Using an abandoned polar control room as a crucible for a glassblower’s creative thaw is fresh; the occupational crossover feels non-obvious. Bookmark-as-creased-map for acceptance is lovely and specific. Risk is present but modest—no formal experimentation. The orb motif could slide into generic “fragile artist” territory, but the final machine chorus rescues it from cliché.</comment>
