<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s meditative patience and grief are palpable through embodied detail (chisel scrape, ribbon warmth). Yet his interior contradiction—skepticism vs. longing for spectral contact—stays summary; we never see a micro-choice that risks belief or refusal. The final “smile and recitation” is too tidy; the cost of accepting mentorship is asserted, not dramatized. Still, the occupation-specific gestures and lavender-scented memory keep him individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ribbon-banner over the greenhouse door reconfigures grief from private weight to shared pattern, cost felt in the public recitation. Causal chain holds: ribbon → poem → greenhouse walks → insight → communal act. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The only slack is the off-stage “weeks” ellipsis that skips the beat where Elias decides to speak the poem aloud—without it, the final gesture feels slightly gifted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Granite dust, lavender, rusted iron, monarch wings—each sense detail is filtered through Elias’s stonemason eye and grief-narrowed attention. The greenhouse micro-setting constrains movement: broken benches force him to “unspool” the ribbon along the exact path his father walked, tethering memory to physical space. Twilight hues on the ribbon return in the butterfly sky, charging the final image with chromatic echo. No geography drift; weather and decay affect pacing and breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape—signals early and tightens when the ribbon glows and whispers Keats, forcing Elias to stay. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative: each return visit layers sensory evidence until the poem’s line bridges living and dead. The “smile and recitation” is the visible price—public vulnerability—but because we skip the private beat of decision, the foreclosed option (silent withdrawal) is only implied, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete returns: stone permanence vs. ribbon ephemera, migration vs. rooted greenhouse. The final reweighting—grief as bridge, not wound—arrives via his father’s handwritten line, not authorial sermon. Subtext whispers in the ribbon’s scent and the butterflies’ orange-black echo of twilight hues. Ambiguity lingers: townsfolk may still doubt, but the poem-banner now reframes their shared silence into communal pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: chisel-scrape as prayer, lavender as temporal slip. Syntax lengthens and breathes with meditative cadence, then shortens at the whispered line—“His breath caught”—mirroring cardiac skip. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the free-indirect “wondered if grief had a shape” keeps psychic distance consistent. The final public recitation retains the same measured cadence, proving voice can carry outward without breaking character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive: “sun bled into dusk” does double duty for time and emotional tint. One paraphrase loop—“ribbon pooling in his lap like a living thing” followed by “ribbon warm against his skin”—redundant tactile cue, but it does not stall momentum. No mixed metaphors; granite, ribbon, butterflies stay in separate sensory lanes. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“noticed the faintest scent”) they serve meditative delay rather than dilution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of stonemason craft with spectral mentorship feels fresh; the ribbon as portable séance tool is specific, not generic ouija. Keats quote is transformed from condolence cliché into public sigil. Risk lies in quiet accumulative structure—no jump-scare or twist—but the payoff justifies the patience. Minor deduction for echo of Mary Frye’s famous line without textual acknowledgement; the poem’s handwriting twist redeems most familiarity.</comment>
