<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation and her need to “find the thread” give her a coherent internal drive; the twig-in-hair gesture shows embodied change. Yet her contradictory impulses (writing others’ secrets vs. hoarding her own) are stated more than dramatized in scene, and the final shift—“I just stopped looking”—is asserted rather than forced by a visible, costly choice. The keeper and artist function more as oracles than pressure sources, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites. Still, micro-choices (placing the paper lotus, accepting the fresh twig) land as credible renunciation with modest cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s paper lotus and the twig she now wears reweight her earlier search under Accumulative/Textural logic—pattern recognized, not solved. Causality is loose but coherent: each encounter (keeper → artist → mirror) offers a reflective surface that intensifies her self-recognition rather than alters external stakes. Orientation is swift; the temple, pond, and city installation anchor by ~100 words. Cost is conceptual—she abandons the search she once clung to—but felt in the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory selection is POV-filtered: Mira notices water reclaiming twigs, ink on fingers, mirror shards of sky—details that mirror her fracturing/rejoining motif. The lotus temple and labyrinth of mirrors function as micro-settings that constrain movement and perception, charging the final self-recognition. Weather (post-cloudburst slickness) affects robe hems and paper buoyancy, integrating atmosphere with action. Spatial choreography is clean across the three locations; no floating rooms or prop teleportation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the thread that connects all things”—is signaled early and tightens through each reflective encounter; the mirror labyrinth deepens pattern rather than widens conflict. Escalation is textural: each surface (water, mirror) fragments and reassembles her image, reweighting the stake without external antagonism. The final twig gift forecloses the search path with quiet conceptual cost, meeting the 8.0+ bar. Pressure is coherent but gentle; a sharper external consequence or irreversible forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of stitching others without first recognizing one’s own unspooled heart. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing spirals, tucking twig into hair—rather than declaration. The paper lotus drifting back toward the temple reprises the nest spiral with reweighted meaning, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the thread was never missing, only mis-seen—an insight earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “voice the color of wet stone,” “ink-stained fingers” read as her metaphors, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, then compresses at the mirror climax, mirroring her intake of breath. Dialogue is sparse but idiolectic—keeper’s whimsical gravity versus artist’s gnomic brevity—maintaining distance control. No head-hopping or register drift; lyrical compression is taught early and paid off in the final mirrored self-sighting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive: “white petals unfurling under the weight of the recent cloud bursts” collapses time and weather in one stroke. Figurative density is high but patterned—spirals, mirrors, threads—teaching the reader early; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Occasional near-repetition (“whimsical and inevitable” twice) is the only minor loop; it doesn’t touch closure. Strong verbs (“reclaim,” “unspool,” “breathe”) and varied paragraph rhythm support momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The ghostwriter who must author her own secret is fresh, and the mirror-labyrinth made of broken sky offers a prismatic take on self-recognition. Spirals-as-threads transform a familiar metaphor into tactile object handling. Risk is moderate: lyrical accumulative structure rather than causal plot, but coherence holds. Could push higher with a bolder formal risk or deeper cultural specificity, yet remains memorable within its compact frame.</comment>
