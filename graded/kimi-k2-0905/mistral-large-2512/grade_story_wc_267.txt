<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s muteness and nerve-damage backstory give him a sharp, embodied lens; the bolt-hunt externalizes his need to test numbness versus pain. Yet the final refusal—“he would not let it go unanswered”—is declared, not dramatized; we don’t see the next risk he accepts, so the cost stays conceptual rather than felt. Interior contradiction is present but stops one beat short of true stakes-payment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: missing bolt → climb → confrontation → refusal, each link tightening options. Closure is an Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the comfort of forgetting, paying with the uncertain path ahead; the price is legible in the blank staff paper he chooses to leave behind. One micro-drag: the “discoloration” clue is discovered off-page before the story starts, so the investigative escalation is slightly blunted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fortress as second skin: rust-streak, dust, glove-leather, and snow-muffle all filter through Elias’s tactile hypersensitivity, constraining how quietly he can move and what he dares to touch. The cobalt walls and spiral stair act as physicalized memory palace, guiding him toward the sealed practice room; environment materially shapes tactics. Final image of blank notation on the stand re-weights the setting from archive to erasure-device—clean, specific, resonant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he reopen the silenced truth?”—is signaled early and tightens when the bolt vanishes. Mid-scene reversal: Madame Veyra admits to systematic forgetting, raising the cost of pursuit from job-loss to existential erasure. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 750 words; the refusal crystallizes stance without safety net, satisfying the lens. Could use one more tangible forfeiture (e.g., surrender of rehab-approved quiet) to push into 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as both sanctuary and violence emerges through bolt/blank-score imagery rather than exposition. Subtext in Veyra’s off-key humming shows memory warped by institutional self-protection. Final refusal lands as conceptual repricing: safety bought by curated silence is exposed as moral amputation. Avoids explicit thesis, though “the cost of safety is forgetting” flirts with on-the-nose summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance, mirroring Elias’s hyper-attuned stillness; syntax is percussive and metronomic, then fractures slightly during the bolt-touch beat. Word-choice—“seraphically mundane,” “unpardonable silence”—carries idiosyncratic authority without purple drift. No dialogue; signed exchange is cleanly rendered in italics-free action tags, preserving rhythm. Voice stays singular and pressure-calibrated, though one clause (“frostbitten hope that still flickered in his chest”) edges toward poetic overlay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences multi-task (action + sensory filter + metaphor) without congestion. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent under cold-metal through-line. Occasional elevated diction—“seraphically,” “unpardonable”—justified by POV’s meditative remove. Only minor snag: “the fortress breathe around him” anthropomorphizes without prior pattern, a hairline clang in an otherwise controlled texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-accident mute bellhop tracking a vanished bolt through a memory-suppressing music fortress is fresh synthesis; imagery of curated silence as erasure-device feels non-obvious. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot velocity; the piece commits fully, avoiding gimmick. Could push higher if the bolt’s mechanical function (e.g., bench collapse triggering past trauma) were more uniquely tied to choir disaster rather than symbolic clue alone.</comment>
