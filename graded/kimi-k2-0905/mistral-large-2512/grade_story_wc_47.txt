<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s watchful, note-taking stance is credibly embodied; Mira’s quietly proactive honey offerings give her agency without speech. Interiority stays concrete (“flinched when their mother hugged her”) and the final hand-off shows a micro-choice that alters their relational state. However, the voicemail-erasure backstory is told in summary, so the stakes feel inherited rather than personally re-earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant returned to the rack crystallizes a new shared silence-with-cost. Causal chain is lean but intact—Mira steals pendant → Elias tracks her → mutual offering → pendant left as joint monument. Orientation is clean within 120 words; single-scene default met. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (drips, cracks, amber glow) tightens once and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The moss-choked server rack functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture: only the rusted hook makes the hanging possible. Sensory triage is POV-filtered (“drip of thawing icicles” heard, not catalogued). Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly from threshold to hub. Environment mirrors interior thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the siblings renegotiate their shared silence—surfaces early and tightens once when Elias proffers the notebook, forcing Mira to stay. The beat narrows options: flee or co-create a new ritual. Cost is present (the pendant is surrendered), though modest in scale for 700 words. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: rituals can rewire grief only after surveillance gives way to co-authorship. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing pendant into palm, not speech. Final image reweights the amber from keepsake to communal scar, avoiding moralizing. The honeyed hush motif accrues meaning through pattern rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly anchored to Elias’s perceptual quirks (noting dusk exits, icicle lace). Syntax lengthens under emotional softening, then contracts at the hand-off, mirroring thaw. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet narrative idiom remains consistent and character-specific. Free indirect thought (“the wound had never been...”) is cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without purple drift. No paraphrase loops or template cadences. Strong verbs (“swung,” “split,” “unraveling”) carry weight, modifiers sparse. One clause (“like the ribs of some slumbering beast”) skirts cliché but is saved by immediate tactile follow-up. Final sentence earns its uplift through prior drip imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Repurposed data-center-as-moss-garden feels fresh, and the viral-confession backstory updates the grief template to post-internet shame. Pendant-as-ritual-object avoids familiar fantasy tropes by remaining technologically inert. Synthesis is specific enough that swapping setting or object would break the emotional calculus. Risk is moderate but coherent, not gimmicky.</comment>
