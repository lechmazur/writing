<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is embodied in the salt-steeped skin and the locket’s weight; the final release is credibly earned by the accumulating sensory ache. Interior contradiction is light—one mention of “trying to preserve her” versus “let her go” could be sharper under pressure—but the micro-choice to drop the locket crystallizes his hierarchy of values. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; archivist vocation surfaces only as label, not as enacted skill. Still, the renunciation carries visible cost and the voice remains particular to a mourner who catalogues small moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the locket’s disappearance reconfigures the covenant from promise to acceptance, cost felt in the instant the water glows. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each salt-and-light image tightens the stake until the release becomes inevitable. Orientation is clean within 60 words; single-scene default met. One minor scaffold: “He had spent so long…” paragraph re-summarizes prior beats, but it does not break the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jetty, twilight, and sea-lavender scent are filtered through Elias’s bereaved attention; the planks’ residual warmth and the gull’s tilted head constrain his stillness and timing. The locket acts as micro-setting that finally merges with the sea, charging the closure image. Selective sensory economy—no visual catalog of the town—keeps momentum. One nit: “blooming jetty” is metaphorical; if sea-lavender actually colonizes the boards, a tactile cue would nail the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping Liora present—tightens through sensory accumulation until the final forfeiture. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and emotional. The single meaningful turn is the locket release, which forecloses all future tactile memory; cost is legible in the glowing water. Escalation is gradual but coherent under Accumulative lens; a sharper mid-scene micro-reversal could push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of archiving a person—ink fails, metal fails, only relinquishment endures. Subtext resides in the gull’s witness and the covenant’s quiet regeneration, never named aloud. Final image reweights “small moments” from treasured fragments to survivable weight. No moralizing, though the line “some losses could not be mended—only carried” flirts with aphorism; the surrounding sensory immediacy mostly earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tightly latched to Elias’s perceptions; salt, creaking wood, and locket weight are rendered in his quiet archivist idiom. Rhythm modulates from long, breath-held sentences to the short release of “The locket slipped…”—a deliberate cadence shift under peak stress. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets are N/A. One clause—“as if she had already seen the water rising”—edges toward authorial omniscience, but the illusion holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or emotional pressure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs—“steep,” “trace,” “slipped”—carry weight without adverb clutter. One near-filter: “He felt Liora’s presence” could be cut to the whisper itself, but the line lands in the denouement, not under peak pressure, so clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “regenerated covenant” reframes a coastal superstition into quiet communal acceptance rather than magical fix, a fresh angle on flood grief. Archivist protagonist and blooming jetty are specific enough to resist generic renaming. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but the piece commits fully. Could push higher if the walnut-ink craft shaped one tactical beat rather than serving as backstory label.</comment>
