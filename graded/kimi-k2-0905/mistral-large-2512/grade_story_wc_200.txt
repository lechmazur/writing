<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The collector’s weariness and new hunger for laughter are palpable, but the woman-ghost remains a charming device rather than a crucible; she pats the rock and gifts him a firefly-note without forcing him to risk or surrender anything. His single micro-choice—accepting the note—feels gifted, not earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the collector pockets living laughter and steps into dawn, cost felt in the warming tooth. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory shard adds weight until the final reconfiguration—but the woman’s exit is unmotivated coincidence, not causal turn, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Echo Gorge breathes, drips, and sings; the misaligned harp is both soundscape and tool, its warped lullaby plucked by unseen hands that finally hand over the note. Wet stone, dry reeds, and the croc-tooth’s thigh-press tether every beat to a body that must decide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Stakes—recover authentic laughter or stay haunted—are signaled early and tighten when the collector must ask the ghost how to leave. No visible price is exacted from him, only bestowed, so the escalation registers as atmospheric deepening rather than irreversible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of laughter as soul-repair emerges through image, not sermon: the broken lullaby reassembled into a firefly-note. The ending reweights the croc-tooth from memento of failure to vessel of warmth—an earned conceptual repricing that invites reflection on mercy versus cruelty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to the collector’s bone-cold perception; syntax lengthens and softens as dawn and laughter enter. No head-hop, no filter clutter; even the woman’s dialogue is filtered through his ear-of-wind, keeping voice singular and textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from percussive clauses to luminous runs; each paragraph advances image or decision. Occasional poetic overlay (“sky bled a hidden sunrise”) risks purple, but rhythm breathes with the gorge and never loops or stalls the climb to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Soul-collector seeking laughter is fresh, yet the woman-ghost who dispenses wisdom and vanishes replays a familiar trope. The harp-as-medium and laughter-as-light are vivid inflections, but the core transaction remains comfortably recognizable rather than inevitably reimagined.</comment>
