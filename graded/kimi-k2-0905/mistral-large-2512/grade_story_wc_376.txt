<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—precision vs. the tremor after refusing forgery—grounds her; the postal plate and map beats give her two micro-choices that tilt her stance. Yet the climb-down to the Echo Vault is still summary; we don’t yet feel her body pay a concrete price, so the final resolve hasn’t fully earned its cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: plate fragment → map → archive → seam in floor → staircase, each because/therefore link tightening her options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she commits to descent with the map ink still on her fingers—cost is visible, path foreclosed. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass-domed bruise-sky, fogged purifiers, brittle blue bloom under cracked glass—selective sensory triad that mirrors her wavering integrity. The zinc plate’s cold jagged edge is returned to twice, constraining her handling and prefiguring the floorboard seam; setting materially guides the final discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find lost conversations—signalled early; pressure tightens when map half-assembled forces the archive trespass. One visible cost: she risks damaging the last bloom’s case to access the stair, but escalation still feels single-note; no secondary obstacle raises the ante further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of candor vs. forgery emerges through her refusal and the map’s “truth waits” legend; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of the staircase into darkness reweights the premise—honesty now demands literal descent into unknown consequence—achieving quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter: gilded-leaf precision, ink-smudge under fingernails, the taste of damp decay. Syntax lengthens during map assembly to mimic concentration, then shortens at the seam discovery; no head-hopping, diction remains within her artisan lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong density—single sentences fuse action, sensory detail, and emotional tilt. Occasional modifiers (“sky the color of old bruises”) verge on familiar, but metaphor stays consistent to bruise/bloom palette; no loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; final line lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic archive dive is familiar terrain, but gilded-leaf calligrapher + postal plate fragment + shredded treasure map syntheses feel fresh and specific. Risk lies in quiet lyric closure rather than spectacle; the combination of artisan forgery-refusal with lost-conversation vault gives a memorable inflection.</comment>
