<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—language-through-skin and compass-as-heart are concrete, embodied micro-choices. The final renunciation (“she carried its song within her”) is earned by the stillpoint absorption that costs her the external path. Yet the blind mapmaker never makes a true mid-scene decision that alters tactics; she follows notes and compass until revelation arrives. One contradictory impulse in-scene would push this to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ring points inward, the forest’s song relocates inside her—visible cost, no reset. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the pattern breaks at the glass-bark tree. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“she had never seen…”) so disorientation is waived. The causality is “because she keeps listening, therefore the song migrates into her”—one tightening, cleanly executed.</comment>

<comment>Ultrasonic forest is not postcard backdrop; its hum frequency modulates from “below pain” to internalized melody, directly constraining Liora’s breath and pulse. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the platinum ring and the tree-as-stillpoint function as handled environments that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—notes, compass warmth, bark pulse all tracked without drift. One more tactile interaction with the ring mid-journey would hit 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“finally understand herself”—is signaled early and deepens through each sensory layer. The stillpoint encounter forces a single, irreversible trade: external map for internal song; options narrow to zero once the ring turns inward. No coincidence; escalation is pure Accumulative density until pattern break. Cost is legible on-page (“she would never find the stillpoint again”), satisfying the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: cartography of the self beats cartography of land. The compass reprise (points inward) and song relocation reweight prior material conceptually. No moralizing; the final laugh is image, not thesis. A hair more ambiguity—does self-knowledge preclude future mapping?—would lift this to 9.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually signature: vibration-as-language, constellations that “pause,” compass warmth read through skin. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences build to the short laugh that snaps the quiet blaze. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off. One syntactic monotony patch (“she… she… she…”) keeps it from 9.3.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. Mixed metaphors avoided—“strings of an untuned violin” stays within sonic frame. One paraphrase loop (“the notes were not heard but felt… resonated”) costs −0.2. No filter-verb stacks; final image is uncluttered. Tightening that loop would hit 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses blindness, ultrasonic forest, and emotional cartography—fresh synthesis, not trope shuffle. The stillpoint as inner-map center is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode commits fully; no retreat to exposition. Transformation test fails if Liora were sighted; specificity is high. A bolder mid-structure surprise could reach 9.2.</comment>
