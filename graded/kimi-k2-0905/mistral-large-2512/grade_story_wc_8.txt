<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voss’s “archivist of last resort” self-image and the scribe’s parallel dilemma give him a clean internal contradiction; the moment he sees Liora, his stance visibly tilts from theft to preservation, paying the cost of public exposure. Emotion stays embodied—spectacles fog, letter warm in palm—avoiding label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: protect narrative of village vs. protect archival purity. The shift is credible, but the prior stakes (reputation, legal risk) are asserted more than dramatized, so the cost feels moderate rather than searing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: rose drops → board lifted → rival appears → joint decision → letter redirected. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “lie” keeps breathing but under a glass that also shows the truth, reweighting the rule-set for future viewers. Cost is legible in the final image—“bare branches stark against the twilight” signals winter for the old story. One minor causality fuzz: the private-collector solution is introduced only in the last paragraph, so the tactical path feels lightly teleported in.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Station is sketched with selective sensory anchors—damp stone, rust, ivy “like grasping fingers”—that double as moral commentary without overt symbolism. The loose floorboard and rosebush function as micro-setting objects that directly gate access and timing, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the two-character blocking. While wider town or auction space is off-page, the compressed scene doesn’t need more; environment does the job it was asked to do.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the forged letter survives as truth or is exposed—tightens once Liora steps out; the option set narrows to three publicly visible outcomes (auction secrecy, joint revelation, or curated display). The tightening is driven by protagonist agency rather than coincidence. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the village’s heroic myth is preserved yet permanently asterisked. A slightly higher score is barred because the external jeopardy (legal, career) is named but never activated on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the parallel between 15th-century scribe and modern historian: can a lie be a kindness to history? No character sermonizes the thesis; the final image of ivy swaying “like a living thing” lets ambiguity stay alive. Subtext in the dialogue—“To recapture the truth by letting the lie stand”—carries the weight of academic war without explanatory padding. The refusal to land on a tidy moral gives the piece lingering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Voss’s perceptual filter—spectacle fog, penknife grip, warmth of gold leaf—creating a consistent scholarly-brittle diction. No head-hopping; Liora’s interior is accessed only through her spoken lines and Voss’s inference. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for archival obsession, clipped exchanges under threat. One minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” feel) appears in the penultimate paragraph, but it stays within an academic POV’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, atmosphere, and thematic echo in single strokes (“ivy that crept inward like grasping fingers”). Metaphors stay coherent and sparse enough to avoid purple drag. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; opening and closing images form a tidy palindrome without forcing. A single filter-verb cluster (“He recognized her then”) is harmless amid otherwise strong verb propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “noble lie” trope is refreshed by embedding it in archival ethics rather than battlefield melodrama, and the rose-as-countdown device supplies a tactile, non-clichéd timer. Parallel between scribe and historian feels inevitable in hindsight yet not obvious at entry. Risk is moderate—no formal acrobatics—but specificity of the station, letter marginalia, and academic rivalry gives the piece a fingerprint distinct from generic treasure-hunt shorts.</comment>
