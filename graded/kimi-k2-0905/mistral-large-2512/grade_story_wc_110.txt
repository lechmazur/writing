<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s guardedness and Elias’s covert listening are cleanly opposed; the lens-exchange beat crystallizes mutual risk. Interiority stays concrete (“ticket stub still warm in her pocket”). Yet the pivot from suspicion to trust relies on a single shared admission—cost is felt but not compounded by deeper flaws or losses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: withheld lens → ticket-map reveal → reciprocal confession → joint reset. Closure is a Charged Poise: the re-inserted lens and humming crystals reweight silence from barrier to beginning, cost legible in their exposed vulnerability. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt, rain-slick cobbles, and celluloid scent are filtered through Mira’s registrar eye. The projector lens micro-setting reappears as the final pledge object. Environment nudges choice—wet quiet invites whispered truths—yet no environmental constraint actively threatens or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: mutual trust. Escalation: each withheld artifact (lens, tickets) tightens suspicion until joint exposure narrows options to either joint confession or permanent rift. Cost is the emotional nakedness of admitting surveillance; however, no external consequence (job loss, security) is activated, keeping pressure intimate but limited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—transparency as risky thaw—emerges through the lens and ticket stubs, not exposition. Final image of projector light slicing darkness reconfigures prior silence from menace to possibility. Subtext in Elias’s shaky exhale and Mira’s pocketed stub carries the weight, avoiding thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is cinematic—light, film stock, seat numbers. Syntax tightens under pressure: short exchanges, tactile detail. Dialogue carries subtext (“You’re lying” / “I know”) without losing natural rhythm.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Sentences vary from atmospheric openings to clipped confrontational beats. Filter verbs minimal; “breath misted,” “lens catching the light” show without over-telling. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Surveillance-through-ticket-stubs is a fresh, low-tech inversion of modern data snooping. Crystalline forecourt and “words become unnecessary” frame risk in hush rather than thriller noise. Could transpose to another silent archive, but the doodle-map mechanic and cinema relics give it memorable texture.</comment>
