<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—breath fogging glass, trembling fingers—and her micro-choice to “give them silence” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The cautious hope is shown via the steadying breath before she activates the generator, not merely labeled. Voss functions mainly as skeptic; no real status shift occurs, so the relationship crucible is thin. Still, her flaw-driven risk (silence over force) directly enables the closure, satisfying the 9+ quick test for earned choice with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the charts shift, Mara therefore rigs the subsonic generator; because she chooses silence, the tricksters’ hold loosens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“university radio station”) and closure lands a Decisive Change—static smooths, community tension drops—with felt cost: “the weight of the night pressing down.” No teleporting props; the generator is introduced early and used at climax. Slight deduction for off-stage tricksters resolving without counter-move, but causality inside Mara’s chain remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The station booth’s glass, blinking tower lights, and low static hum create a tactile micro-setting that constrains her movements and signals the signal’s release. Astronomical charts evolve from data to warning to proof of success, recharging the final image. Sensory selection favors sound and sight—perfect for a radio-staff POV. Environment never over-described; each detail either guides her choice or mirrors internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community cohesion vs cosmic deception—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when Mara realizes silence is the only remaining tactic. One meaningful escalation: the shift from “theory” to actionable subsonic pulse forecloses loud resistance. Cost is legible—she risks permanent trickster attention and professional ridicule if wrong. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet ingenuity versus bombastic chaos emerges through action, not statement. The subsonic “whisper” reweights the earlier motif of static, letting silence trump noise. No final moralizing; the last image of glowing charts implies ongoing vigilance. Ambiguity remains—tricksters may return—preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter: she notices “erratic pulses,” smells her own breath on glass, distrusts Voss’s smirk. Syntax shortens under pressure—“She activated the signal.”—matching heartbeat. No head-hopping; Voss’s interior is only inferred through gesture. Voice carries distinct texture without drifting into academic jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long atmospheric coils to clipped beats, propelling the climax. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances choice or stakes. Figurative language is spare—“red lights blinking like distant stars”—and stays accurate to POV. Zero mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; high information density maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing cosmic trickster myth with campus radio tech feels fresh; the subsonic counter-signal is a specific, non-obvious tactic. Transformation test fails if relocated to a generic lab, proving particularity. Risk—quiet solution over spectacle—pays off without gimmickry. Slight genre echo of “Signals” trope, but grounded detail and occupational specificity overcome familiarity.</comment>
