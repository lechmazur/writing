<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s survivor-guilt and adaptive reflex read in her tactile handling of the ledger and the pause before facing Jaren; the contradiction between seeking beauty and needing truth is embodied, not declared. The final pocketing of the strip is a micro-choice that seals her renunciation of innocence with a felt cost. Yet Jaren’s guilt is asserted more than dramatized, muting the relationship crucible and keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fire → ledger → frost pattern → confrontation → choice. Orientation is clean by line 6; the canyon night anchors who-where-when. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she pockets the evidence, accepting complicity and the canyon’s wider war—cost is visible in the weight against her thigh. One minor slack: Jaren’s “they were going to burn the whole canyon” arrives as unmotivated exposition, blunting the because/therefore chain a notch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frost patterns on stone, the glass beads’ glint, and the strip’s frayed edge are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered; they guide her upstream like a living map. Canyon silence and starlight press on the choice, constraining stealth and emotional volume. The kiln’s “blackened husk” is briefly mentioned but never re-embodied; a touch more tactile callback would have pushed this into 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus safety—tightens when the frost patterns confirm the ledger’s code, forcing a face-to-face with Jaren. Agency is hers: she holds up the strip, demands why, then folds it into her pocket, foreclosing denial. The escalation is single-curve but effective; the off-stage threat (“burn the whole canyon”) stays abstract, capping the felt price just short of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of complicity and witness emerges through the strip’s journey from anonymous numbers to personal burden; no character moralizes. The glass artist’s pivot from shaping light to carrying evidence reframes “luminous” as exposure, not beauty—an earned repricing. Final image of the canyon as “also a choice” offers resonant ambiguity without sermon. The late arrival of the wider arson plot keeps thematic depth from full 9-band integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Liora’s perceptual lens: “patterns as familiar as the scars on her wrists” carries her idiom of craft and pain. Syntax lengthens under grief, then shortens at the shadow’s appearance, mirroring pulse. Jaren’s diction—“That’s not yours” versus her crisp “It is now”—creates status clash without caricature. One clause drifts toward poetic register: “the weight of silence” is borderline, but context justifies it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; frost, beads, and ledger reappear with accreted meaning. Minor scaffold: “the kind of change that left ash in its wake” abstracts a beat already shown. The final pocketing line lands clean, propelling closure without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Glass-artist-turned-witness against eco-arson is fresh; the ledger strip as Rosetta stone of frost patterns is an inventive synthesis. Canyon-as-code and frost-as-map avoid stock post-apocalypse tropes. The broader conspiracy is sketched rather than particularized, muting the story’s singular fingerprint. Risk is present but partial, keeping the score just below 8.5.</comment>
