<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “physics of letting go” is asserted but never embodied in a concrete, costly micro-choice; the final acceptance is declared, not dramatized. Interiority drifts into abstractions (“measure the weight of a shadow”) that distance rather than reveal. Relationship to Mara remains observational—no status shift or mutual risk under pressure—so the crucible test fails.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the farm-wide pulse reweights boundaries as doors, cost felt in the shared flare. Causal chain is thin—Mara’s spore gift is the single pivot—but it is set up by earlier laser-spore visual and holds under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Glow, drip, spongy caps, root-snakes—sensory triad is selective and filtered through Elias’s detection gaze. The laser beam slicing humid air anchors spatial logic and returns in the final pulse, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (vial in hand) literally constrains the last gesture—he can’t pocket it and hold Mara’s hand—so environment shapes choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand letting go”—is declared early but never tested by a visible forfeiture; pressure stays intellectual. Only one meaningful tightening: accepting the vial, yet no tactic is foreclosed afterward. Cost is aesthetic (farm pulse) not personal; stakes never pierce the skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of permeability vs. barrier emerges through fungal imagery and laser trace rather than statement. Final pulse reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Mara’s years-long spore trail is evocative, but Elias’s interior summaries blunt resonance by naming the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s instrumented perception; syntax stays precise, almost metrological. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Mara’s diction is indistinct from his, but she speaks only twice—within tolerance at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene—short pulses during laser beat, longer clauses in reflective lulls. No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“quiet wildfire” repeated) but it serves as motif reprise. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—each sentence advances image or relation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing intrusion-detection tech with mycological permeability is fresh; the laser-as-scalpel for spore tracking feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric speculative rather than bold structure—but specificity of shiitake caps pulsing like heartbeat prevents generic slip. Could swap Elias’s job title with minor edits, so not quite indispensable.</comment>
