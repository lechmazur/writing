<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory pull between renunciation and duty is embodied in the pocketed drawer-pull; the final step-back is earned because every beat has shown him weighing the talisman against the cost of continued tethering. Seris’s “thoughtful” trait surfaces once—correcting Elias’s “clever” to “thoughtful”—but the beat is too thin to feel like a crucible; still, the single gesture hints at a status shift that justifies the quiet détente. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the micro-choice to pocket both relics crystallizes the film’s central contradiction without exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the parapet, moon, mist, and objects layer density until the final image reweights “recycling mistakes” as an unending personal burden rather than societal fix. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the widening space between Elias and Seris, plus the double weight in his pocket, forecloses retreat into pure detachment while making the cost legible. One tightening—accepting both keepsakes—suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The parapet’s slick stones and blade-like crescent moon constrain ambush options and time the encounter; the drawer-pull’s worn brass is returned to twice, finally pressing against Elias’s thigh to charge the parting image. Sensory selection narrows to cold, weight, and salt, mirroring Elias’s pared-down emotional range. Spatial choreography is immaculate: step-forward / step-back tracks cleanly, no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal absolution versus perpetual entanglement—is signaled early via the drawer-pull. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Elias decides to keep both relics, narrowing his future to continued brokerage of old wounds; cost is the literal added weight in-pocket. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the lens allows it; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the iterative handling of tarnished metal: peace treaties and family heirlooms alike oxidize yet remain carried. The final image—mist swallowing the widening gap—reweights “recycling mistakes” from hopeful slogan to Sisyphean labor without moralizing. Subtext in the silent hand-off says more about mutual dependence than any treaty clause could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “breath shallow,” “wind howled,” syntax contracts under stress. The single spoken exchange is spare, idiomatic, and carries subtext (“They always do”). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts only once, intentionally, as dawn light widens the physical gap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long mist-laden clauses to the staccato of the final step-back. Figurative language is selective—moon “like a blade,” parapet “like a scar”—and each reappears to charge closure. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; one paraphrase loop (“step back, then another”) is purposeful echo, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar trope—hostile diplomats swapping relics—is refreshed by treating the parapet as emotional petri dish and the real traded items as personal guilt-objects rather than geopolitical prizes. The moon-phase timing device could feel contrived, but it is embedded in the locket etching, making the pattern intrinsic. Risk is moderate; specificity of salt-stung parapet and tarnished brass lifts it above template.</comment>
