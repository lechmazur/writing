<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s quiet analytic habit and lifelong intimacy with death are shown through tactile choices—tucking the globe, flipping ledger pages under water—so motive stays embodied. The final release of the globe is credibly foreshadowed by his earlier reverence and the growing sense that possession = entanglement. Interior contradiction is light: we get proximity to death but little fear or resistance, so the arc feels slightly monochrome. Still, the renunciation costs him the “last transmission,” a tangible forfeiture that satisfies Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: find globe → read notes → meet Liora → shatter globe = let ship go. Orientation is swift—submerged library, 70-year wreck, night dive—within first 100 words. The single shard structure tightens naturally; no mid-scene teleporting or retro-fixes. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: by destroying the key Elias forecloses personal proof and academic glory, a price legible in the silver plume that drifts away.</comment>

<comment>Sensory triage matches crisis: fractured skylight, silt like ash, copper helmet streaked with verdigris—each detail pressures action or mood. The snow globe serves as micro-setting that finally constrains the choice to release. Spatial logic holds: desk bolted to floor, door ajar, current carving a path—bodies and objects stay trackable. One minor slip: “moonlight” on surface feels generic after such rich underwater specificity, but it does not touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—possession of forbidden knowledge vs. letting it vanish—is signaled when Elias pockets the globe. Pressure escalates causally: each new piece of information (ledger, apparition, spinning biplane) narrows his options toward release. No coincidence resolves; the ghost’s beckoning is the final squeeze that forces the shatter. Cost is visible—the dissolving plume—so the tightening carries weight under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “letting go as untangling from time” emerges through Liora’s equation and Elias’s final act; no character sermonizes. The snow globe’s shift from souvenir to temporal key reweights its meaning without authorial nudge. Final image—“Some threads aren’t meant to be held”—is understated yet conceptually costly, achieving CR. Ambiguity lingers: was the wreck real, transmission, or both? Complexity holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: he notices copper corrosion, parses equations, feels globe weight “negligible against pressure.” Diction is precise, marine, slightly clinical—fitting a quietly analytic diver. No head-hop; Liora’s dialogue arrives as radio crackle within his sensorium. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for descent, staccato fragments under apparition stress—tight control without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and double-duty: “his fins stirring silt like ash from a forgotten fire” advances both action and mood. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new tactile or conceptual data. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (thread, loom, transmission) belong to Liora’s intellectual palette and stay consistent. One tiny filter cluster—“He understood then”—could be trimmed, but it does not mar the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Combines Earhart lore, underwater ghost wreck, and time-physics in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet fresh. The snow globe as portable time-knot is a specific, risk-lift that charges the entire plot—remove it and story collapses. Apparition-in-diving-suit risks cliché, but here she’s a recorded transmission, not a nostalgic haunt, transforming trope into concept. Final renunciation flips the usual treasure-hunt payoff, staking out non-obvious emotional territory.</comment>
