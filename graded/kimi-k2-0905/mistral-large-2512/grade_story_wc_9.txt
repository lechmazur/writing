<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s interior contradiction—seeking lost time while confessing ink—grounds her; the final palm-to-cloth micro-choice binds past and present with visible ink cost. Yet the absence of on-page opposition or relationship pressure keeps the arc more monologue than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ink-sealed handprint fuses past and present under a parting cloud ceiling, cost legible in the irreversible stain. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silvered grass, ozone, crushed-violet air, and the porcelain fracture’s warmth form a tactile micro-setting that guides her tracing finger; the saucer’s temperature shift charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent within the single cloud-rooted glade.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens when the saucer crack becomes the map she physically follows; the ink’s irreversible absorption forecloses the option to remain merely observer. Cost is felt, but escalation is single-note without external opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “breaking as revelation” emerges through the fracture’s transformation from ruin to map; the final inked palm refuses to moralize, letting the image reweight the premise. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at a consistent psychic distance; syntax lengthens and compresses with emotional temperature, creating a perceptual signature of starlit ozone and violet rain. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; only one paraphrase loop (“edges frayed like the edges of her resolve”) slightly dulls propulsion. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, taught early by ink-bleed and cloud breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cloudbound cartomancy merging handprint genealogy with porcelain fracture offers a fresh synthesis; the concept commits fully without retreat. Risk lies in lyric density, but coherence is maintained.</comment>
