<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lian’s contradictory impulses—vengeance versus self-release—are dramatized in the final beat when she chooses forgiveness yet still detonates Vey’s legacy; the embodied tremor of her fingers and the blood-prick from the thorn give visceral cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The heritage rose thorn and key function as extensions of her internal split, forcing a micro-choice that visibly forecloses her old life. One minor slip: “unlinking herself from the past” is told, not shown mid-scene, blunting the fullest possible arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: rose thorn → unlocks key → reveals scroll → collapses Vey’s lies. Orientation is swift—who, where, when land inside 70 words. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Lian exits the sanctuary, her name restored, Vey’s power fatally undercut. The mechanism is set up early (scholar’s key) and paid off on-page, though the scroll’s physical emergence is slightly rushed, keeping it just under the 9.0 gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary, stalactite drips, and aurora light are filtered through Lian’s calibrated attention—each drip marks elapsed time, the shifting colors mirror her rising clarity. The rose thorn and inkstone act as micro-setting that constrain her final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean: workbench → altar → doorway. One hairline slip: “vaulted ceiling dripping with stalactites that wept” is a touch ornate, but it doesn’t stall momentum or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of her father’s name—tightens when the scroll’s exposure becomes possible. Pressure escalates because Vey physically enters, narrowing options to one decisive beat. The cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the sanctuary and her forged-anonymity to free herself. No persistent physical price is dramatized, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as the deeper treason—emerges through image and action, never sermon. The rose thorn’s return reweights “treason” from crime to civic duty. Final line’s “stepped into the light” offers a non-literal, resonant answer: forgiveness, not vengeance, breaks the chain. One soft echo: “truth” is named twice in dialogue; trimming would sharpen subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lian’s perceptual signature: ink scent, cold stone, aurora hues. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short beats as Vey enters, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; Vey’s interior is implied only through gesture and Lian’s reading of his smirk. One near-slip: “poisoned honey” edges toward cliché, but the surrounding ice-cracking laugh reclaims freshness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry dual duty—description and emotional calculus. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent: stalactite tears = slow justice; aurora = shifting moral light. A single mixed image—“shadow swallowing the light”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Forged imperial seals and a rose-thorn key deliver a fresh angle on the “hidden confession” trope. The calibrated-treason concept reframes betrayal as bureaucratic precision rather than melodrama. Risk is present—quiet forgiveness instead of violent payoff—yet fully grounded in prior causality. The aurora sanctuary feels specific rather than generic fantasy backdrop.</comment>
