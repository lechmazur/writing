<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet endurance and the moment he hands over the bitting gauge both carry cost, but interiority drifts into summary (“the world felt too heavy”) rather than embodied contradiction; Lila’s grief is asserted, not dramatized. The final beat earns a micro-choice that forecloses his retreat into solitude, yet the emotional hierarchy between caretaker and apprentice stays static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias relinquishes the paternal relic, crystallizing a before/after under the Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—rose death → girl appears → gift exchanged—though the rose’s symbolic weight is declared rather than tested on-page. Cost is visible in the empty pot and the gauge changing hands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight and the skeletal fire escape filter through Elias’s practiced eye; the worn gauge and lantern light constrain distance and timing. Spatial choreography is exact—feet on metal, lantern pool, key exchange—yet the rose absence never physically obstructs or enables the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether beauty can survive decay—tightens once: the rose is gone, the girl arrives, the tool must pass on. Pressure is coherent but singular; no secondary reversal complicates the transfer. The cost is felt, yet the escalation is more cadence shift than option foreclosure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of generational custodianship emerges through the gauge’s journey rather than statement. The final image of lantern light on water reweights the earlier “reflect light” motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the girl may fail, the garden may die—complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s tactile notice—dirt under nails, metal worn smooth. Syntax lengthens with nostalgia, shortens at the scrape of boots, matching breath. No filter-verb clusters; diction stays within a quiet laborer’s lexicon. Voice is consistent, modest, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional lyric uplift (“liquid silver”) is balanced by concrete verbs (“wiped,” “clutching”). One mixed moment—“the world shifted, just a little”—edges toward abstraction but does not mar the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop-to-harbor fire escape garden feels fresh; the locksmith lineage via a single gauge tooth is specific. Yet the “passing the torch” arc is familiar; the rose-as-cycle symbol is standard. Specific sensory detail and vocational minutiae lift it above template, but the emotional arc is recognizable.</comment>
