<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eira’s synesthetic gift is embodied in the way colors fracture under the chisel strikes; her motive—“certify wonder as essential”—is declared rather than dramatized, but the final white-note that stills the sculptor shows a credible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, so the score hinges on solo interior arc, which earns its tightening but not full contradiction in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “sculpted hush” lands as Charged Poise—the cavern, aurora, and chisel all fall silent under the white-note, reweighting the stakes with felt cost. Causality holds: each bell-ring is answered by aurora-shift or ice-hum, and the chisel strikes function as because/therefore obstacles that narrow options until the final bell. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity at end. The amber sheet’s rule (“only releases in sculpted silence”) is taught early and paid off in the image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ice-cavern geometry is tracked through vibration, echo, and aurora ribbons; the body is present in trembling hands and breath that fogs. The smallest bell catching aurora light becomes the micro-object that charges the final beam. Environment constrains tactics: the chisel’s echo dictates tempo, and the cavern’s hush must literally be sculpted before the sheet will sing. Specificity is selective—no tourist catalog—yet every sensory pick advances stakes or mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the song escape before the chisel kills the hush?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens with each clink that shatters color. Escalation is accumulative: three strikes progressively fragment the melody, forcing Eira to risk the largest bell. The final white-note forecloses the option to retry; the sculptor’s silence is the visible price. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, and it carries unmistakable cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—“wonder as necessity, not luxury”—emerges through the aurora’s color-shift and the final opal cascade, never sermonized. The sculpted hush reweights the premise: silence must be crafted, not found. Ambiguity lingers: will the outside world actually hear, or is the victory internal? The image of pearl whisper avoids tidy moral, but the earlier declarative “certify wonder as essential” slightly thins subtext, keeping the score just sub-8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Eira’s synesthetic perception; diction (“veins of blue and silver pulsed”) is filtered through her color-sight. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during chisel strikes, then widens into long cadence for the white-note release. No head-hopping; aurora and ice are perceived, not explained. Voice remains distinct and purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances stakes: “the aurora’s hues flickering like candle flames in a draft” both paints and signals instability. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last rather than restates. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated. A single mixed vehicle—“colors…curling around her like smoke” beside “heartbeat of the earth”—is minor enough not to dull the climax. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the bell strikes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Synesthesia-as-magic is familiar, but binding it to aurora-weaving and silence-sculpting gives fresh torque; the chisel as anti-music antagonist is unexpected. The amber sheet’s rule feels invented rather than borrowed. Risk is taken with lyric escalation instead of physical fight, and it pays off in the final image. Could edge higher with a sharper external consequence, but the synthesis is already non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
