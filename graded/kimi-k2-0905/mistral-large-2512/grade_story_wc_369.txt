<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s numb-hand healing and final quiet acceptance register as embodied change, but interiority drifts into abstract “quantified sorrow” talk; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the turn feels declared rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the re-forged sextant roots-map reweights the premise with felt cost (“so you don’t have to”). Causal chain holds—sextant → healing → map → stance shift—under Accumulative lens; one tight reflective block stays anchored to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tower, storm, moonlight, and broken brass are filtered through Elias’s maintenance-eye; sawdust, damp, and mercury-like moonlight constrain movement and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; weather affects choice (climb, balcony stance). Micro-setting (sextant body) directly enables closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“measure what remains of sorrow”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via tower whispers, offerings, then sextant re-forging that forecloses escape. One meaningful tightening: map shifts from sky to earth, crystallizing his endurance. Cost visible in numb-hand reversal and lifelong caretaker burden accepted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow’s measurability emerges through sextant, tree-rings, and final root-map without moralizing. Final image reconfigures premise: memory-work outsourced to trees, leaving Elias in charged stillness. Subtext in offerings and pin-drop silence invites re-reading. Avoids tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s maintenance idiom; perceptual signature favors tactile weight, damp, brass hum. Rhythm modulates—short beats under storm, longer lyrical lines at moonlight climax. No head-hopping; compression (“dreams left behind” list) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid yet lean; metaphor chains (moonlight as mercury, roots as veins) stay coherent and serve closure. One scaffold loop: “the tower… the tower…” echo could trim. No filter-verb stacks; syntax varies. High information density—each paragraph advances map, body, or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Broken sextant retooled to map terrestrial sorrow instead of stars feels inevitable yet fresh; merges labyrinth caretaker with arbor-memory outsourcing. Risky lyric accumulation paid off in root-script image. Could swap names but root-map twist is specific to this text. Transforms quiet grief into cosmological labor.</comment>
