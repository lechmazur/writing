<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession is embodied through tactile micro-choices (palming the glass, blowing the cork) that externalize his “whisper” thesis; the final shared silence with Maren shows a credible shift from ridicule to recognition, paying the cost of public credibility. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of belief remains slightly under-dramatized—Maren’s turn is registered only by “breath caught,” not by an irrevocable action that locks her new stance. Still, the contradiction between Elias’s need for proof and his surrender to the storm’s listening is kept alive in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each handled object (cork, vial, scent) layers density until the final cadence shift—rain swallowing the shatter yet returning the note—delivers the Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the vial lost, the garden scent now uncontainable). Causality is lyric rather than plot-sequence, but the pattern is taught early (“whispers travel farther”) and closure reweights it: the world literally answers back. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (lighthouse, dawn, storm edge), meeting the single-scene default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse glass, the warped cork’s spiral grooves, and the cliff wind are not backdrop but tools that constrain action: Elias can’t shout into the storm; he must whisper through the cork’s etched path. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt-chipped paint, jasmine ghost—mirroring his narrowed attention. The garden scent functioning as micro-setting charges the final image when it lingers after the vial’s destruction, proving environment can bend to intent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers trump shouts—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Elias risks the only evidence (cork + vial) to the storm; the stakes move from abstract theory to irreversible loss. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (heat, rain, scent, returning note) increases pressure until the single decisive release. Cost is visible—vial shattered, garden scent freed but unattributable—foreclosing the option to replicate the demonstration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of volume: the softest signal carries furthest when intention is purified by sensory memory. Subtext resides in Maren’s silence after the echo—no apology, only changed breathing—implying acceptance without verbal surrender. The ending image (scent lingering beyond the cliffs) reweights the premise: proof is no longer required; the world’s listening is enough. No moral is stated; resonance is olfactory and auditory, not didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual signature—vibration through bones, scent as memory-ghost—without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors his quiet bias: long vowel clusters, soft fricatives, deliberate comma pauses that “whisper” on the page. Maren’s dialogue is driftwood-rough, short clauses, distinguishing her without POV drift. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds even in the peak storm beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—moth-spiral, petal-touch—never crowding a single beat. One paraphrase loop (“the way the world trembled… the way the rain’s rhythm stuttered”) is minor. Rhythm accelerates into the release, then exhales with the final line, matching the storm’s cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “whisper > shout” premise is familiar, but grounding it in an etched cork that must be sacrificed to a storm-whipped cliff gives fresh physical stakes. Sensory specificity (salt-chipped cobalt paint, night-blooming jasmine on an unseen coast) prevents generic lighthouse gothic. The final auditory echo returning after destruction is an earned inversion, not a twist—risk feels particular to this keeper and this coast.</comment>
