<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora’s resolve is vivid, but her interior contradiction is asserted (“breaking nothing”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice; the final smile is the first visible cost, so the arc feels more declared than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the scroll’s pulse and her sleeve-tuck crystallize a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with conceptual cost; causal chain (breadcrumb → rune → unbroken claim) holds, though the “unbroken” test is stated, not shown in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Library’s decay is tactile—dust motes, cracked glass, singed parchment—and the shifting star-map physically guides her next move; environment constrains the final beat by literally delivering the rune into her sleeve.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) is signaled early; pressure tightens when the rune’s criterion threatens her own identity, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping escalation just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasure versus unbroken memory emerges through iron-gall ghosts and star-forgetting; the final image reframes the library itself as a blade—resonant, unsentimental, and open-ended.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Liora’s scholar-thief perception; syntax lengthens for awe, shortens for stealth, never drifts from her lexicon; no head-hop or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are selective (“stone arches sagging like the shoulders of an old king”) and propel rather than stall; no loops, no mixed vehicles; occasional elevated diction stays within a scribe’s ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Memory-eating ink and a star-map that rewrites legitimacy fuse fantasy with archival noir; the rune of drift feels fresh because its price is moral identity, not teleportation gimmick.</comment>
