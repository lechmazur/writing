<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a dead past while courting a living future—pulse in the acorn-cap press and the hatchling contact; the final renunciation (“carry its weight forward”) is earned. Yet her interiority drifts into abstract gloss (“texture of borrowed time”) that blurs bodily stakes, and the grandmother memory is recalled rather than dramatized under present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the warm cap and sleeping hatchling reconfigure the stake from nostalgia to custodianship, cost paid in the visible “unmaking” of frost. Causal chain is lean—cap-touch triggers vortex, greenhouse flash reverts, cap stays warm—held cleanly under a Causal lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Icebound atrium functions as micro-setting: its frost melts under vortex pressure, physically constraining and enabling the past-reveal. Starlight, scent of loam, and damp down are filtered through Liora’s seed-saver attention; spatial track (kneel-press-rise) stays coherent. Environment directly shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she re-open the past without shattering present or self—tightens when the vortex actually melts frost and shows the lost greenhouse, forcing her to decide whether to persist. The beat is single but meaningful; cost is legible in the frost reasserting itself and the cap’s residual warmth. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship versus resurrection emerges through the acorn cap’s re-weighting: heirloom becomes seed of future rather than relic. No explicit thesis; final image of “beginning” reframes prior ice-bound despair. Ambiguity lingers—will nurturing the hatchling restore the world or merely remember it—creating resonant aftereffect without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Liora’s sensory field; perceptual signature is botanical (“downy feathers,” “loam,” “stubborn soil”). Rhythm modulates—long breaths in reflection, staccato clauses at vortex climax. No dialogue, so no voice drift; compression (“storm in stillness”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but controlled; figurative layering serves the lyric mode without clogging the climactic beat. One scaffold loop—“the texture of borrowed time” repeated in concept not image—slight drag. Strong verbs (“rippled,” “ruffled,” “slumped”) and varied sentence openings maintain propulsion; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of seed-saving lore with time-vortex magic feels fresh; the acorn cap as temporal ignition source is specific, not trope recycling. Risky lyric escalation pays off by making entropy reversal tactile. Could swap greenhouse for orchard, but hatchling-cap pairing is idiosyncratic enough to resist generic substitution.</comment>
