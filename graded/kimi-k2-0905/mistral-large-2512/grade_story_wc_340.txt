<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is vivid and embodied; the diary beat forces a visible micro-choice that costs her the goggles. Interiority stays concrete, but the final renunciation reads slightly tidy—no lingering contradiction after the captain’s warning. Still, the endurance of leaving both diary and goggles behind carries felt cost and aligns with her established warmth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira’s refusal to keep probing is dramatized by placing diary and goggles on the desk, foreclosing her trespass with visible price. Causal chain holds—diary discovery → refraction trick → recognition → renunciation—under a single contiguous scene. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire, brass elevator, and cracked goggles supply tactile specificity; the model airship and refracted light anchor the final image. Cold biting through slippers is a sharp body cue that guides Lira’s hesitation. Environment never becomes a postcard; each detail filters through her goal-directed attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to violate or respect the captain’s grief—tightens once when Lira deciphers the sketches and again when she renounces further intrusion. Pressure is coherent under situational lens; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is legible in the relinquished goggles and the ache she carries back downstairs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of privileged curiosity versus sacred privacy emerges through gesture and object, never sermon. Final image—captain’s tender finger on the sketches—reweights “joy beneath anguish” without stating it. Ambiguity lingers: Lira’s restraint may be kindness or self-protection, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira; perceptual signature is biased toward tactile cold, engine-oil scent, refracted light. Syntax remains controlled, with rhythmic lift at pressure peaks. No head-hopping; captain’s interior is surfaced only through Lira’s reading of her gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean, propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“diary shifting as if breathing”—and never clutters the high-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Airship-grief diary reframed through servant POV feels fresh; the refraction decoding trick is a lovely concrete method. Tropes (orphan maid, tragic captain) are personalized through sensory detail and the goggles’ cracked lens. Risk is modest but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
