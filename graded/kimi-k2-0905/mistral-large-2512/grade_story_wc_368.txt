<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dye master’s watchfulness is concrete—tracing the wing, tracking sun trails—but his interior contradiction (restlessness vs. stillness) is asserted rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat. The final “search is over” feels handed to him by the shimmering map rather than earned by a micro-choice that costs him something visible. No relational crucible is tested; the traveler functions as oracle, not pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the map’s shimmer reweights the premise—stories cling iridescently—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the pattern is taught early (sun trails = light paths) and returns in the glowing symbols, so the reconfiguration feels inevitable. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, yet legible: the dye master’s private quest becomes public, shareable light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating tea house is not postcard scenery; its hovering granite and rice-paper walls filter light that literally dyes the floor and directs the protagonist’s gaze. The morpho wing acts as micro-setting, constraining how he handles color and memory. Sun trails and valley mist are tracked with sensory specificity that mirrors his internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes—“why some lives shimmer”—stay dominant and deepen when the traveler links sun trails to story-symbols, tightening the textural pattern. No reversal or option is foreclosed; pressure accumulates through luminous recognition rather than a choice that costs. The final shimmer is a deepening, not a narrowing, satisfying the Accumulative lens but keeping tension lyric, not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges iridescently: stories, like dye or wings, catch light only at certain angles and then fade, leaving a shared afterglow. No character states the thesis; the final image of the glowing map reweights earlier sun-tracking without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—will he now dye the sky?—inviting reflection rather than closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to the dye master’s perceptual filter—flint eyes, wing iridescence, sun-fractured colors. Syntax lengthens and breathes with misty wonder, then compresses at the wing’s “quietly explosive” flare. No head-hopping; the traveler’s dialogue carries subtext that advances the conceptual quest. Voice feels singular, not stitched.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers light, color, or story without paraphrase loops. Figurative chains (“hover between stillness and flight,” “sleeping giant”) stay coherent under the Accumulative lens. One mixed metaphor—“quiet explosiveness”—is allowed by pattern. No scaffold or register drift; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating granite teahouse, morpho-wing pigment, and sun-trail cartography synthesize into a fresh conceptual frame: memory as iridescent dye. The risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal plot—pays off in a final reconfiguration that feels both inevitable and non-obvious. No close echoes; the valley-mist wonder is specific to this voice.</comment>
