<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prophet’s “precognitive forgetfulness” is dramatized through the chalk, tape, and spiral, giving us embodied stakes, but his interiority flirts with label-speak (“tightened,” “echo he’d been clinging to”) and the final step forward feels lightly motivated—he pockets items rather than acting upon their cost. Micro-choices (drawing, placing sticks) show hierarchy of values, yet the woman does most of the explanatory lifting, muting the contradiction we need in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tape re-inscribes the spiral rule and reweights the premise—he can now “listen” because the cost of forgetting is visible in his own handwriting. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each return deposits artifacts (chalk, tape, driftwood) whose density finally crystallizes into Charged Poise. Orientation is anchored early; driftwood choreography stays coherent. One minor causality bump: the VCR “somewhere” powers itself, a tiny teleport, but it doesn’t resolve the conflict.</comment>

<comment>Fog, rusted wire faces, and damp earth are filtered through the prophet’s hush-seeking ear, creating a sensory hierarchy that mirrors memory loss. The driftwood spiral functions as micro-setting that literally steers his body and charges the final image; chalk and tape act as portable “settings” that constrain choices. Selective detail—static silence, chalk worn smooth—keeps economy tight while sustaining tidal longing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older before it slips away”—is signaled early and tightens through each failed recording. The spiral’s completion plus the revealed sentence constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: he confronts the self-authored proof of irreversible forgetting. No visible price is extracted after the reveal, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s erosion versus the human compulsion to archive. The driftwood spiral and chalk line literalize the futile cartography of time; the videotape label re-prices the prophet’s mission without moralizing. Final image—“he wouldn’t forget”—carries earned irony because the story has shown that he will. Subtext in the woman’s “You always forget” stings more than any exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that stays interior to the prophet; perceptual signature favors auditory metaphors (“thin as a reed,” “static silence”) consistent with his sonic obsession. Syntax modulates—long breathless sentences under fog, fragmentary beats when the tape appears—without losing clarity. No dialogue bloat; the woman’s two lines carry maximal subtext. Voice remains distinct and purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional poetic elevation (“marrow of his bones,” “wax”) is earned by the accumulative texture. Punctuation and tense are clean; spatial tracking flawless. One mixed vehicle—“fog curled around his ankles, thick as memory”—but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so the artifact is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The junkyard prophet who records aging’s silence via driftwood sigils feels novel yet inevitable. Recycling memory-loss tropes through analog media and sculptural navigation freshens the concept. Risk resides in the circular structure—each return deepens pattern rather than plot—yet the closure justifies the gamble. Specificity of the chalk-worn spiral and self-authored stone prevents abstraction.</comment>
