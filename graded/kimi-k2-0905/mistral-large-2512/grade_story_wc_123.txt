<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s meticulousness and curiosity are shown through tactile detail (brass clasp, ink texture) and a history of risk-taking; the interior contradiction between solitude and duty is present but not yet pushed to a costly choice. The final beat—“integrity demanded action”—is declared, not dramatized; we feel the weight of the recorder, not the cost of crossing the threshold. A hairline slip from summary keeps this just below the 7-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the courtyard listening session intensifies pattern until the hidden gear-sound reweights the stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the storm recorder becomes a “promise,” reconfiguring Elias’s observer identity into participant with conceptual cost. The beat is earned by the prior auditory accumulation, but the cost is still more emblematic than visceral; a sharper bodily or social price would push this past 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory selection is disciplined: damp cobblestones, metallic salt scent, and the faint gear-rhythm all filter through a meteorologist’s trained attention. The courtyard micro-setting—fountain basin reflecting first stars—supplies the mirror that quietly charges the final image when Elias stands. Weather is not backdrop but investigative tool; environment constrains method (listening instead of breaching). Meets the 9-band gate by letting the storm-recorder tool and auditory setting jointly shape the final tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias remain a passive observer?—is signaled early and tightens when the gear-sound collapses neutrality. One meaningful deepening: lateral listening replaces frontal confrontation, foreclosing the safe option. Cost is conceptual (loss of observer immunity) rather than tangible; a lost tool or social credit would make the trade-off concrete. Sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: measurement versus intervention, solitude versus complicity. The storm recorder’s transformation from instrument to “promise” reweights the premise without moralizing. No motif is forced; the bruised sky and gear-rhythm echo without schematic symmetry. Quiet but coherent resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s meteorologist gaze: anemometer rattle, pressure intuition, wind-borne data. Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, then compresses—“He opened his eyes and stood”—under rising pulse. No filter-verb stacks; perception remains embodied. Distinctive without showiness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances atmosphere or character (“smelling of wet moss and distant thunder” does double duty). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold. One tiny hedge—“the precision felt heavier”—could be cut, but it occupies only three words. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing meteorological craft with espionage intrigue feels fresh; the storm recorder as investigative tool is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Lateral listening as tactic avoids the stock break-in scene. Risk is moderate—quiet accumulation instead of set-piece—but coherence justifies the choice. Not groundbreaking, yet memorably particular.</comment>
