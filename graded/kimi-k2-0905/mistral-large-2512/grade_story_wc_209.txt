<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s quiet obsession is embodied in tactile postcard handling and deliberate brushwork; the final micro-choice—painting the single moon-flower—caps her arc with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “quietly driven” trait is asserted more than tested under opposition; no contradictory impulse on-page. Still, the beat sequence (study, recall, paint) links motive to action cleanly for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stained-glass epiphany reweights darkness from absence to illumination, foreclosing her search for external answers. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of postcards + glass layers tighten meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final brushstroke that commits her to the twilight mural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory triad—honeyed beams, thawing cobblestones, candle-flicker on stone—filters through Liora’s attention economy. The cathedral glass functions as micro-setting that literally refracts her insight; the postcard stack acts as portable setting-object carried across scenes. Selective detail keeps momentum; no white-room drift. Environment does not constrain bodily choice but charges the final image enough to meet 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—need to grasp nocturnal blooming—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure intensifies via accumulating postcard evidence + glass revelation, narrowing options from search to acceptance. No external antagonist; escalation is accretive pattern-break, valid under Accumulative lens. One credible tightening: realization that darkness is its own light forecloses further inquiry with felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image triad: night-bloom, thaw, hidden glass—darkness as generative illumination. Grandmother line is the only near-theme-statement but is dramatized via glass echo seconds later, escaping sermonizing. Final reconfiguration invites reflection without moral. Ambiguity is coherent: acceptance of unknowing carries quiet cost in the last stroke.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter; diction (“umbral tenderness,” “honeyed beams”) mirrors her artist’s gaze without purple drift. Rhythm modulates—long contemplative sentences contract to single decisive clause at final brushstroke. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Free-indirect cue (“she understood then, not with her mind…”) is clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor cluster (“pull of the moon on the tides” beside “tug at her”) slightly blurs agency but does not touch closure beat. Figurative control elsewhere precise: “ghostly petals,” “amber pavilion glow.” High density without congestion; final line breathes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar quest for hidden meaning is refreshed by stained-glass etchings as archival evidence and moon-bloom as conceptual pivot. Synthesis feels particular to this town, this artist, this winter thaw. No gimmickry; risk lies in quiet lyric accrual that trusts closure to a single added brushstroke—earned. Could swap village name without breaking arc, so not quite indispensable.</comment>
