<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora’s obsession with “the interrupted cadence” is declared more than dramatized; her only embodied beat is touching the bridge. No contradictory impulse or flaw complicates her resolve, so the climactic reach feels pre-scripted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands: time visibly bends as sand flows and the world dissolves—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin (she simply “reaches out” and it works), but the lens holds as situational pressure crystallizes into a charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals, leaning towers, and the frozen hourglass are sketched with selective, sense-driven strokes that guide her downward path; the pendant’s heat and the city’s pulse tether description to bodily stakes, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early—find the echo-door or the Giant wakes—but the only tightening is the pendant burning; no option is foreclosed, no price paid before the climax, so escalation stays atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of borrowing time from eternal sleep emerges through the hourglass image rather than exposition; the closing dissolve invites reflection on artistic obsession without moralizing, though the idea remains more evocative than deeply probed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptions; diction (“living sketch,” “wet paper”) is consistent and rhythmic. No dialogue to test, but internal cadence modulates with rising heat and cold, sustaining a hushed, nocturnal timbre.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; occasional poetic overlap (“time bent like wet paper,” “interrupted cadence”) skirts repetition but never stalls momentum. Final beat avoids figurative clutter, letting the frozen sand carry the weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>“Giant’s Nap” as a literal time reservoir feels fresh; rooftop canals repurposed as labyrinthine arteries give a recognizable cityscape an off-kilter pulse. Concept outweighs character novelty, but the synthesis is memorable within the flash length.</comment>
