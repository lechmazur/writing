<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “grim optimism” is asserted but never embodied in contradictory action; the dice roll is the only micro-choice and its emotional cost is abstract. Interiority stays in paraphrase (“breath steady,” “breath catching”) rather than specific bodily experience. No internal contradiction is dramatized under pressure, so the final endurance feels pre-ordained, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tilted staircase reweights the premise—“even in infinity, there is room for change”—with visible conceptual cost. Causality holds: the chipped die’s null result → tremor → tilt. Orientation is swift; the infinite rule is taught by line 5. The rupture is summarized rather than moment-by-moment, muting the decisive beat, but the lens (Causal) remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stone scent, worn smoothness, and the die’s chipped corner give tactile anchors that return in the final image. The staircase’s tilt is a micro-setting shift that constrains next steps. Selective sensory detail (no visual excess) keeps momentum. Environment directly shapes the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single stake—prove limits—is signaled early and tightened once: the dice roll forecloses the “break” option and replaces it with perpetual adaptation. Pressure is coherent but brief; the shudder is the only on-page cost. Escalation is a single beat, sufficient at this length, yet the price (tilt) feels conceptual rather than visceral, keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: infinity refuses absolutes, embracing imperfection. The chipped die’s unreadable face becomes the emblem of unknowability, reweighted in the final tilt. No moral is stated; the reader is left to feel the paradox. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the emotional aftereffect is cerebral, not gut-level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is light but consistent—“hope like a bruise” is idiosyncratic enough. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences contract to short beats at the shudder. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior diction stays within plausible math-philosopher lexicon. Clean control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with only one paraphrase loop (“then another, then another”). Metaphors are sparse and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Strong verbs (“shuddered,” “spiderwebbing”) propel the rupture. A single filter-verb cluster (“felt warm, or maybe that was just the heat of his resolve”) slightly dulls immediacy, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Infinite staircase plus flawed randomizer fuses abstract math with bodily risk, a fresh angle on “man vs. endless system.” The chipped die’s illegible face is a specific, non-generic catalyst. The story avoids explaining the mechanism, preserving mystery. While the core idea nods to Borges-lite, the execution feels individual rather than derivative.</comment>
