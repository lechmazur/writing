<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s trembling fingers, claustrophobia, and decision to kneel rather than join give a charged, embodied arc; the “stand by the unremembered” motive is shown only in final gesture, so the cost is felt but not deeply textured in prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s kneel and the swallowed gold reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost; causal chain (codex path → phase transition → renunciation) holds, though the midpoint shift into the wall-route is taught only by image, not foreshadowed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Condensation-slick corridors, breathing gold, copper-veined cables, and the syrupy sideways air are selective, pressure-matched, and directly guide the final image; the facility’s thinning membrane is both atmosphere and constraint, charging the closing hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“return what was taken before tide crushes”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the codex path fades and the wall-route appears, forcing renunciation; cost is legible in Elias’s blank codex and swallowed stars, though escalation is single-arc rather than compounded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-burden emerges through gold that maps unseen paths and eyes that swallow starlight; the ending’s winking flecks reweight the opening theft into an act of mercy, avoiding overt statement and letting image carry resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—dying-whale facility, syrupy air, teeth-aching chant; diction is controlled, rhythmic, and rises into compressed lyricism without losing clarity; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Varied sentence rhythm, high information density, no loops or scaffold; occasional stacked figuratives (“gold absorbed like blood into sand”) verge on surplus but occur after climax, leaving closure image intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Undersea-archive codex that maps non-existent routes and a membrane-thin station fuse cosmic horror with elegiac renunciation; the sideways phase is freshly grounded in copper cables and tidal clock, not generic portal fare.</comment>
