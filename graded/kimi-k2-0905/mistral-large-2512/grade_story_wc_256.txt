<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile obsession with “texture of connection” is vivid and embodied; the lens-in-hand beat crystallizes motive. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where he both craves and fears the hum—so the final epiphany feels slightly foregone rather than hard-won. Still, micro-choices (ringing, listening, palm-to-glass) track cleanly to the closing stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bell-ring adds density until the wall-hum reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias’s realization that connection is “not discovered but awaited”—with conceptual cost: the pilgrimage must stay unfinished. Orientation is swift; only one transition (ruin→lab) but anchors hold. No causal break, though escalation is gentle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The carbide lens functions as micro-setting: its refracted light and later vibration physically constrain Elias’s attention and trigger the final sync. Glass-jar “whispers” and golden shadows are selective, never catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean—bench→ceiling orbs→walls—keeping the lab’s scale intimate yet charged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the pilgrimage yield connection?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once the lens vibrates independently, forcing Elias to revise the pilgrimage’s purpose. Cost is conceptual (the wait must continue), not tactile; a sharper forfeiture would deepen the turn. Still, the single deepening satisfies the 600-word bandwidth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light / refracted sound parallel: connection survives as resonance inside brokenness. No explicit thesis—final line’s “not discovered but awaited” lands as image, not moral. Ambiguity is coherent: the lab waits, the bells keep ringing, the cost is open-ended patience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—calloused fingers, fractured rainbows, second heartbeat in the ribs. Syntax lengthens during the pilgrimage, then shortens at the vibratory shock, mirroring attention. No dialogue, so voice distinction is N/A; internal diction remains consistent, mining-camp grit meets lab-poetry without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the ritual: long sentences for circling, staccato when glass hums. Figurative language is restrained—one rainbow, one held breath—keeping immediacy. No loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly. The final clause “the texture of connection wasn’t something to be discovered” could lose the passive “to be” for punch, but artifact is hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-collapse “laboratory of lost sounds” is fresh scaffolding: archive as living instrument. The prism-song bell ringer fuses miner’s tactile ethic with spectral science, a synthesis not seen before. Risk is quiet—no plot pyrotechnics—but the concept commits fully, avoiding retro-futurist cliché.</comment>
