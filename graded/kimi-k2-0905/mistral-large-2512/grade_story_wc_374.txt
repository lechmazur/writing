<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism and inherited glow give her a sharp, specific interior; the final beat of tightening her fingers around the ring shows a micro-choice that costs her the safety of disbelief. The man’s instant recognition of her taste-quirk, however, flattens his mystery into exposition and robs her of discovering her own limits under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Charged Poise: the trees march and Elara’s stance crystallizes with the compass spinning—cost is the irrevocable knowledge that she is “terrestrially cosmic.” Causal chain holds: ring warms → leads → encounter → reconfigures worldview; no teleporting information, no soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lavender Bluff’s aurora and the root-election are sensuously anchored and constrain the final image—trees uprooting make the cosmic intimate. The clearing’s spatial choreography is clean; rain sphere in the man’s hand tracks tactically. Micro-setting (ring, taste) alters choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she confront the unexplained or keep safe distance—tightens when the ring locks onto a person, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful escalation: electoral hum → silence after decision, price is the irreversible sight of migrating forest and her own complicity. Agency sits with her descent and grip on the ring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as an act of cosmic citizenship. Subtext in the grandfather’s warning and the taste-method reframes sensory anomaly as responsibility. Final image of marching trees reweights earlier archive data without moralizing. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers about what “listening” will demand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—ultraviolet glow, copper taste, frayed cuff—syntax flexes with auroral cadence. No head-hopping; man’s dialogue carries thunderous idiom distinct from her measured interior. Compression (“trees were voting tonight”) teaches lyric pattern paid off in final silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose propels: varied sentence rhythm, high-density lines doing two jobs (“roots sending electrical impulses…like schools of fish”). No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent under auroral logic. One near-repeat—“swaying in unison as if swayed”—but cadence absorbs it without dulling closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of mycelial democracy, taste-weather, and heirloom compass feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist. Risk in “trees vote” pays off by reconfiguring the cosmic scale into personal stakes. Transformation test passes: swap any piece and the emotional arc collapses. Specificity of copper taste and UV glow anchors novelty in body.</comment>
