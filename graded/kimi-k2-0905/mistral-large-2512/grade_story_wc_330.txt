<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s silence-as-language and “quietly persistent” trait are shown through tactile micro-choices (tracing the horse, pocketing the halo, mounting the carousel); the final laugh is a credible release. Missing is an interior contradiction that complicates his decision—he never hesitates, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than existential. Still, the endurance/renunciation of exile lands with visible price: he forfeits return, letting the carousel spin him “home” into the vanished crowd.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the halo clicks, the oasis blooms, the carousel whirls, and Elias stays—cost is the irreversible abandonment of the ordinary world. Causality is lyric-accumulative: song → halo flare → train shudder → tents restored; each step is textured, not arbitrary. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single shard holds. One soft spot: the “wrong turn” motive is declared but never dramatized, so the inciting breach is off-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sawdust under boots, caramel air, and the jagged silver edge of the halo are sensuous anchors that double as choice levers (the halo socket literally starts the ride). The micro-setting of the carousel pole constrains the final decisive act. Wild grass “swaying like a crowd” and wind-bell chronometry keep the circus ghost economy alive without catalog bloat. Only the oasis leap is sketched in wide shot, but the blurred speed at the end is intentional POV filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence re-summon a lost world? Pressure tightens once—song activates halo, halo activates train, train restores circus—each increment forecloses retreat. No antagonist needed; the pressure is ontological. Cost is legible: Elias pays with permanent displacement into memory-made-real. A second tightening beat (doubt, resistance) would push higher, but the single crescendo satisfies short-form economy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: art as resurrection, persistence as portal. Subtext lives in the halo’s torn edge—divinity ripped open by human craft. The final image reweights the premise: the crowd is still absent, the applause ghostly, so the triumph is also erasure. No moralizing; the cost of making memory flesh is left humming in the reader’s ear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter—wood grain, silver pulse, caramel scent—syntax lengthens and compresses with carousel tempo. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through rhythmic, carpentered prose that mimics lathe-turned ornament. The wind-bell refrain acts as stanza break without dropping POV distance. Register never drifts into carnival cliché; the hush remains carpenter-quiet even at crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “The halo fragment glowed faintly in his grip, its light pulsing in time with his voice” advances plot, image, and causality in one breath. Figurative load is high but patterned (bells = time, halo = heart), taught early and paid off. One scaffold loop: “the wind bells chimed again” appears three times with near identical phrasing—minor drag. Otherwise rhythm modulates, no mixed metaphors, and the final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Abandoned circus restored by song to a halo-powered carousel is fresh, yet the core trope (ghost circus) is alchemized through carpenter POV and accumulative lyric engine rather than twist gimmick. Risk is taken: no human antagonist, no dialogue, purely imagistic escalation—yet coherence holds. Specificity of craft (half-finished horse, torn silver) prevents generic nostalgia. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: of course the carousel maker’s song restarts the ride.</comment>
