<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—honoring overlooked histories—remains steady and is embodied in every micro-choice (tucking the fragment beside her notebook, tracing the painting, fastening the locket). The final renunciation—accepting perpetual search as the honoring itself—carries visible cost (“she would keep searching”) and is earned by the causal chain. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The only minor slip is the father’s remembered maxim, which edges toward aphorism rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse lens is redefined from missing relic to perpetual search-anchor, with the cost of endless incompleteness legible in the final line. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard (market, painting, attic writing) deepens pattern rather than forcing plot turns. Orientation is clean within 120 words. No teleporting props or retroactive patches. One micro-turn—realizing retrieval is the honoring—suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The swaying rope bridges, salt-and-sugar scent, and submerged-lighthouse painting are selective, sensory, and filtered through Liora’s translator-bias. The fragment itself functions as micro-setting: its pulse against notebook leather and locket constrains her next moves and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across stalls, attic, empty booth. One minor missed opportunity: the city beyond the rafters remains a glow rather than a pressure, but this does not cap the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover stories the fragment holds—tightens when the painting reveals the lighthouse was pulled under by the very tales she seeks. Escalation is textural: each encounter (alchemist, artist, empty stall) increases density rather than external threat, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: she accepts an unending quest, forfeiting closure. No coincidence resolves; coincidence merely complicates by removing the alchemist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—honoring history means keeping it elusively alive—emerges through image (drowned beam, absent ship) rather than assertion. Subtext in the final empty stall painting reweights “some stories stay elusively tangible” from aphorism to lived stance. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line crystallizes choice without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is endless search salvation or curse? The piece invites both readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Liora; perceptual signature is translator-synesthetic (“stories slipped between worlds like mist through cracks”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadence in market pools, clipped fragments during wrist-hum. No head-hopping; alchemist and artist speak only when on-stage. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. One near-slip: “elusively tangible” risks thesis-statement, but context absorbs it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—three metaphors total, each anchored to marine or archival imagery. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Information density high: “She unfastened the clasp…pulsed faintly against the leather” does three jobs in eleven words. One minor scaffold: “time here didn’t flow so much as pool” is restated twice; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-lens-as-story-anchor synthesizes maritime folklore with archival desire in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk: choosing accumulative lyric over plot-thriller raises coherence stakes; the gamble pays off in charged poise. No close echoes of famous drowned-lighthouse scenes. Specificity—salt-and-sugar alchemist, rope-bridge market—anchors universals. Transformation test fails if swapped to any other relic, confirming originality.</comment>
