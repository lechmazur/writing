<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s synaesthetic “touch-seeing” is vivid and consistent; the ribbon beat shows motive-to-action linkage. Yet her interiority flattens in the quarry confrontation—no contradictory impulse under threat, just steady resolve—so the final acceptance of the lance feels pre-decided rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sketchbook absorbs the lance, reweighting Liora from victim to remembered person with visible cost to Elara’s mission. Causal chain holds—ribbon → sister’s arrival → lance gift → drawing act—though the sister’s prior absence from police files is an unmotivated ellipsis that slightly frays credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mist, damp stone, and the quarry’s vertical swallow are filtered through Elara’s haptic gaze, giving environment immediate sensory purpose. The lance’s rust against satin ribbon provides the micro-setting contrast that charges the final sketch; spatial choreography remains clean in a two-body scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken empathy for a forgotten woman—tightens when the lance converts abstract injustice to concrete artifact. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elara shifts from observer to bearer of evidence, foreclosing the option to remain merely an archivist; cost is legible in her sweat-slick grip on the ribbon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-justice emerges through the tactile reunion of ribbon, lance, and portrait; no declarative slogans. Final image of Liora’s “whole” face reframes prior fragments without moralizing, letting the reader feel the repricing of civic forgetting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual grammar—fog, stone edges, satin coolness—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under reflective beats, then fractures into short units at the sister’s entrance, mirroring threat; diction stays within an artist’s lexicon (“contour,” “shadow,” “sketchbook”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor—“mist curling like smoke” beside “yawned beneath the mist”—is minor; otherwise verbs are sharp (“swallowing,” “frayed,” “slick”) and paragraphs are cut-ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Face-blind forensic artist is fresh; combining masquerade ribbon with medieval lance gives the corruption probe a baroque local signature. The sister-as-informant device skirts cliché, yet the piece feels more elegant variation than radical reinvention.</comment>
