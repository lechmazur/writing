<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—“his breath steady, his heart a metronome” shows embodied resolve—but the decisive shift from craftsman to dream-bearer is asserted rather than dramatized; the cost of erasing his own boundary is named, not felt. Contradictory impulses (practicality vs. longing) are stated, not pressed together in a single beat under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restored sextant and receded fog reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost—the mirror maker now carries what he once only reflected. Causal chain holds: sextant hum → path opens → climb → trust → dissolution of mountain. Orientation is swift; lens (Situational) is stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog, frost, and glass mountain are tactile and selective; each constrains movement and charges the final image when the mountain dissolves into mist. Micro-setting (the sextant in pocket) becomes the charged object that certifies the boundary’s erasure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the dream—tightens once via the climb; the cost is the dissolution of the mountain and the implicit burden of carrying another’s dream. Escalation is singular but sufficient; no reversal, yet agency (stepping onto the path) is clear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of boundary-erasure emerges through the fusion of mirror craft and dream-holding; the final image of bare orchard bones reframes earlier reflections as responsibilities. No moralizing—resonance is imagistic, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the maker’s perceptual filter—“glass sang like wind through chimes”—with rhythmic compression that mirrors breath-sync. No head-hopping; diction remains within plausible artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and musical; no loops or scaffold. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“ribs of a dying bird”) and pays off in the dissolving mountain. One mixed moment—“warm and trembling, like a bird with a broken wing”—leans on stock image, yet does not blur causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing mirror-craft with dream-rescue feels fresh; the glass mountain made of forgotten things reweights the trope of reflective surfaces. Risk in lyric escalation is coherent and heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
