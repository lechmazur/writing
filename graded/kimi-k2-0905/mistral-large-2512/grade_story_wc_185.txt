<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ryn’s motive—carry silence out—stays legible; the binding micro-choice anchors her arc. Interiority is concrete (“stone warm and humming with stolen silence”) yet stays single-note; no contradictory impulse complicates the final act. The endurance cost is felt, but the bloom’s collapse is externalized rather than internalized, so the emotional price reads light for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: map → stone → bloom → binding → flight. Closure is a Decisive Change: silence is portable now, bloom gone; cost is the lost refuge. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality bump: “stone flares” alerts beings off-page, but the beat still lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Harmonic caves, ripple-ice, and lantern shadows are filtered through Ryn’s mapkeeper gaze; sensory pick-list tracks her goal. The bloom sphere as micro-setting directly shapes the final choice—she must touch and bind it—so environment constrains tactics. Gently luminous ice recurs without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography stays coherent through the frost-curtain passage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—secure silence—signals early and tightens when beings press against the bloom. One meaningful turn: binding the bloom forecloses personal refuge to create portable refuge; price is the bloom’s loss. Escalation is causal under the lens; no reversal overload. Cost is legible but brief, keeping the beat just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: silence as fragile commons vs. shared refuge. Subtext lives in the stone’s warmth versus the beings’ discordant wail. Final image reweights prior maps—quiet is no longer a place but a burden to carry. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether silence can survive surface chaos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Ryn; perceptual signature favors sonic and tactile detail over visual catalog. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into short clauses during escape, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “ripple-mark mapkeeper” and “bloom of hush,” both character-specific. Register remains ice-bound and ritual without drifting into generic fantasy cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences advance image or causality. One scaffold loop: “she had to… she had to” in adjacent lines. Metaphors (soap-bubble sphere, needle of light) are precise and mixed only once. No filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Minor paraphrase in “ice ceased its groaning” / “caves’ usual harmonics faded” costs 0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Combines cartography, acoustics, and energy-beings in a fresh synthesis; silence as portable resource reframes typical “find sanctuary” trope. Ripple-mark profession and echo-stone tech feel specific rather than ornament. Risk is moderate—lyric compression over exposition—but coherence holds. Could swap glacier for desert, so freshness tops at high 7s.</comment>
