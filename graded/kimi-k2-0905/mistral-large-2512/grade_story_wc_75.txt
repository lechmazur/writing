<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora’s grief for lost craft is vivid, but her contradictory impulses (save the past / doubt anything can be saved) stay summary; the loaf-choice costs her nothing and the “V” feels inherited, not earned. Interiority is atmospheric, not decision-forcing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: bees return, tapestry re-weaves, cost is conceptual (heritage may survive) and felt. Causal chain is thin—bread shape → bee summoning is magical coincidence—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) accepts pattern-break reweighting, so the image satisfies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist-soaked grotto, cold ovens, opera-glass tint—details are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final image. Waterfall roar threading every room keeps setting active; micro-setting (warm loaf in cold museum) charges the closing beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stake—“rescue dying arts”—is clear early; pressure tightens when last tapestry is unreadable and bees vanish. But escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no irreversible choice or forfeiture narrows options; success arrives as gentle restoration rather than costly trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transmission versus erasure emerges through concrete objects (tapestry, bread, bees) rather than statement; final image reweights “V” from personal memento to collective sigil. Avoids moralizing, lets ambiguity linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent lyric-fabulist: aged-parchment diction, hush of water, rosewater dread. Syntax modulates—long breath for myth, short pulse for bee-hum—without losing clarity. POV stays tight third, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; occasional soft repeats (“golden… golden”) and faint poetic uplift (“rosewater dread”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final line lands with snap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Folkloric bee-song + museum conservation + initial-bread is fresh synthesis; “opera glass as time lens” repurposes antique tech without steampunk cliché. Risk is moderate, payoff gentle—restoration rather than revelation—but specificity keeps it from generic eco-fable.</comment>
