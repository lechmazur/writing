<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is lyrically specific (“salt-stiffened air,” “splinter in the chest”), but her contradictory impulses stay static; the needle’s command is the only external pressure and she obeys without visible internal cost. The “re-imagining” turn is asserted rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses an alternate path. Earned stasis is hinted at but not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the loom scene reweights the premise from “break the labyrinth” to “be sewn into it,” with orchid wind as felt cost. Causality is soft-lyric (Accumulative/Textural lens); the overlapping footprints pattern teaches the surreal logic early and holds. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. The beat-to-beat linkage is more poetic accretion than because/therefore, acceptable under the chosen lens.</comment>

<comment>Red canyon ribs, bone needle, and woven stone walls are tactile and specific; the loom chamber micro-setting directly constrains the final action. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. The illustration plate functions as portable setting/object and returns to charge the closure image. Weather shift to orchid-scented wind is a final environmental reconfiguration that mirrors internal change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the voice declares “You’ve been sewing the wrong things,” forcing a shift from escape to participation. The escalation is a single deepening rather than a reversal, sufficient for lyric mode, but the cost (loss of autonomy?) is only gestured at, not viscerally felt. Agency is present but low-stakes: she sits and sews without risking a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as active re-weaving rather than nostalgic preservation. The illustration plate’s optimistic vision is re-priced when the labyrinth demands she become thread rather than tailor. Subtext whispers through gesture—needle, loom, vanishing footprints—never sermonized. Final orchid wind offers charged poise without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter: poetic diction (“salt-stiffened air,” “frayed edges of the old”) is consistent with her wharf-weaver sensibility. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to short drum-beat clauses under pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Filter verbs are minimal and justified by lyric distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each image advances atmosphere or stakes; no synonym churn or template cadence. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “ribs of a sleeping giant” is singular and sustained. One paraphrase loop (“the labyrinth…its walls…its secrets”) is minor. Final paragraph breathes naturally; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The sewn-labyrinth that remembers broken precedents is a fresh synthesis; the wharf-weaver profession seeds maritime texture without exposition dump. Overlapping sleepwalking paths literalize surreal causality early, avoiding late-rule twist. Risk is taken with lyric passivity, but the piece commits fully to accumulative mode. Could edge higher if the cost were more viscerally unique.</comment>
