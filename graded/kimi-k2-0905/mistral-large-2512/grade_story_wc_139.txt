<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s ambivalence between filial con-artist reflex and nascent moral agency pulses in concrete beats: pocketing the pot, the thumb-print test, and the final “prove it” dare. Interiority stays embodied (“ink so dark it seemed to drink the light”) and contradictory impulses coexist in-scene rather than in summary. The choice to withhold the pot demands a visible social cost—he inherits the risk the diplomat fled—yet the beat is slightly under-cooked: we feel the stakes for the woman but not yet for Elias’s own skin. Still, character voice is particular, flaw-driven, and the refusal lands as Earned Stasis with foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the pot on the counter between them re-weights every prior con rule; Elias’s “prove it” crystallizes options with undeniable social risk. Causal lens holds throughout—each beat (discovery, test, intrusion, standoff) tightens because/therefore linkages. Orientation is anchored by sentence 10 (prep room, formaldehyde, night); no disorientation serves the ending, so the Orientation Test is waived. Cost is legible: Elias has just weaponised his mother’s funeral-home stage against her ethos, inviting state reprisal—an irreversible tactical shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prep room is not backdrop; the steel table, formaldehyde, and florist roses constrain behaviour (hiding from watchman, pot on embalming counter) and charge the final image—death-scented stage now hosts an anti-ledger rebellion. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: Elias notices pocket linings, ink viscosity, footstep tempo, not floral wallpaper. Micro-setting (the pot itself) functions as setting-core and directly shapes the climax choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no prop drifts or teleports.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—control of the ink pot as lever against bureaucratic math—tightens once: from passive possession to active gamble. Escalation is causal under lens: because the ink rewrites equations, therefore the woman comes; because Elias demands proof, he jeopardises the funeral-home cover. Price is visible: he forfeits anonymity and assumes the diplomat’s hunted position. No coincidence resolves; pressure crystallises into stance rather than explosion, fitting short-form economy.</question>

<comment>Theme emerges as “every ledger can be hacked, but someone must hold the eraser” without sloganising. Subtext resides in gesture: the woman’s split lip and the ink’s fractal patterns silently equate state violence with numerical fictions. The final image reframes the mother’s aphorism—“fair trade is just math”—into a moral dare, reweighting prior material. No explicit moralising; complexity and ambiguity remain alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is noir-leaning, syntactically crisp, with rhythmic control (“deathly vitality of a world that refused to stay buried”). Perceptual signature is specific to a mortician’s son: he sees borders as sutures, scents as lingering invoices. Compression like “liquefied rigid thinking” is taught early and pays off in the pot’s behaviour. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens naturally from reflection to action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language is selective and purposeful—no metaphor storms. Occasional template cadence (“He wasn’t supposed to be here—not really”) is voice-motivated and brief; no loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor edge (“ink spread in fractal patterns, branching into equations”) is forgivable at closure distance. Momentum stays brisk; paragraphs advance knowledge or tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing funeral-home noir with anti-bureaucratic magical realism feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The ink pot as bureaucratic skeleton key re-casts embalming tech into ideological sabotage—an angle not templated. Specificity of diplomat-smuggled corpse via florist van grounds novelty in lived detail. Risk is taken (quiet magical device) and coherence retained, earning +0.3 risk bonus within band.</comment>
