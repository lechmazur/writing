<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora’s urbane calligrapher identity is vivid—ink-stained fingers, unshakable composure—yet her interior contradiction (precision vs. subversion) stays stated, not dramatized. The brother argument is off-stage, so the rawness never surfaces in micro-choice; the final “smile” feels unearned because no on-page cost is shown. Serenity is asserted, not tested under pressure. Still, the puppet-show past and stick handling give her a tactile, vocational spine.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome’s returning light reweights the premise—stories can be questioned, not just told—while the candle’s gutter and re-flame make the cost felt. Causality is light (Accumulative/Textural lens): because she speaks the echo-story, the room “takes a breath,” a pattern break that crystallizes stance. Orientation is swift; stakes legible. Yet the decisive turn is more image than irrevocable choice, nudging it short of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted dome is no postcard: its swallowing acoustics force Liora to whisper, the curved wall becomes her puppet screen, and the meteor hush tightens every syllable. Salt wind, lamp-oil air, and shifting shadows are filtered through her calligrapher’s eye for negative space. The campfire stick’s carved bird is micro-setting that literally moves in the candlelight, charging the final image. Environment, tool, and body converge to constrain how the story can be voiced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can stories be ethically reversed?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by density: each puppet anecdote tightens the thematic screw until the echo-collector tale forces the recognition that every retelling is theft. No external antagonist is needed; the tightening is cognitive, internal, and sufficient for 700 words. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the candle’s extinction/re-light makes it legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the stick’s moving bird and the echo-collector parable: narrative is appropriation, reversal is obligation. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing the carving, watching shadows argue on the wall—never in lecture. The final soft light reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is unsettling audiences enough, or does ethical storytelling demand more? The refusal to answer charges the aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Liora’s urbane perceptual signature—ink, negative space, meteor hush—syntax calm and calligraphic even under pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens only when the bird symbol appears to move. Rhythm mirrors breath: long sentences hold, then a fragment gutter. The absence of dialogue is a choice, not a lapse; voice remains distinct and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “rusted ribs groaning,” “meteor hush,” each noun doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. No loops, no scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked; when the bird “beats,” the metaphor is single, earned. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with candle flicker, final line exhales.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing calligraphy, puppet theatre, and Cold-War radar dome into an ethical ars poetica is fresh; the stick that animates carved symbols literalizes “living text.” Risk is taken—no antagonist, no physical danger—yet coherence holds. The echo-collector parable feels inevitable in hindsight, reversing the fisherman reflection joke into darker territory. Not quite paradigm-shift territory, but memorable, specific, and resistant to renaming.</comment>
