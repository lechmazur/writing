<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat tightening under the crown carries cost—but the inspector’s contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. dissolve grief) are asserted more than dramatized in mid-action. The final self-confession lands because the pearl’s earlier weight prepped it, yet the leap from “priestess of others’ grief” to “I’m afraid of being forgotten” feels slightly convenient rather than compelled by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bunker walls blank, the pearl dulled, the crown left behind—cost is visible and irreversible. Accumulative lens holds: each dissolved confession tightens the pattern until her own fear is the last shard, reweighting the premise. The only hairline slip is the late introduction of the child-crown; its payoff works emotionally but arrives without prior causal seed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Crystal caves refract light that literally guides her micro-movements and later swirls the freed confessions—setting actively constrains and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she smells vanilla amid rust, feels pearl against ribs, hears hinges groan. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms or white-space syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“dissolve the walls between hearts”—is signaled early and escalates through each confession she liquifies; the tightening is the pattern itself. One meaningful reversal: the moment she realizes the last wall is her own fear. Cost is legible: the pearl exhausts its glow, the bunker empties, she exits lighter but stripped of her talisman.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of abandoned hope reconfigures from collective artifact to personal admission without moralizing. The crown’s inscription “I wanted to be brave” reweights all prior confessions into a single, non-literal answer: courage is leaving the door open to being forgotten. Resonance lingers because the insight is oblique, earned, and unspoken by the narrator.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: “prismatic whispers,” “fossilized prayers” compress atmosphere without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices through touch and refraction, never touristic catalog. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, clipped fragments at the self-confession. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds later payoff (pearl’s glow foreshadows dissolution). Figurative language is patterned early and paid off, avoiding density penalty. One minor loop: “confessions…confessions” in adjacent clauses; not enough to dull closure. Final line “quartz…like seeds” crystallizes the reconfiguration cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic bunker with crystal-cave reliquary feels fresh; the grief-dissolution ritual reverses typical survivalist tropes. Specificity—“daughter’s shoes by the door”—grounds the concept. The child-crown is a novel icon that recharges earlier confessions. Risk in lyric mode pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
