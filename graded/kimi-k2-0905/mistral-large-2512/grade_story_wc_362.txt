<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his breath, numb fingers, prism memory—but the decisive turn (“Objects did absorb emotions, but not like sponges…”) is delivered as summative epiphany rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice shows him risking or forfeiting anything, so the renunciation feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism warms, the arbor’s hum fades, and Elias exits carrying the shifted hush—cost is the surrender of empirical proof. Accumulative lens holds: frost pattern → prism light → quartz pulse → reweighted rule. Orientation is clear by line 5; causality intact, no teleporting props. One reflective block (mother memory) stays under 20 % and tilts present stance. Could reach 8+ if the final reconfiguration were forced through an on-page refusal that costs him something tangible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, crystalline branches, spectral shards, frost veins—selective sensory triangulation keeps the micro-setting tactile and purposive. Mist, cold, and refracted color track consistently and constrain attention (he studies frost because fieldwork is frozen). Prism-as-tool recurs with changing thermal state, charging the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove/disprove emotional absorption—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: frost face reveals prior mourner, forcing Elias to confront transformed grief rather than raw emotion. Accumulative deepening (density of mirrored sorrow) reweights the stake, but no visible price is exacted from him—no tool cracks, no belief forfeited, no external consequence—so escalation is intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—truth as bent light, never pure—emerges through prism imagery and frost refraction rather than assertion. Final image of melted frost reprises the motif and reweights it: absorption equals erasure, not preservation. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers. Slight deduction for overt thesis line (“The truth was never pure…”), but resonance survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: cold glass, dendritic veins, shifted hush. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens under sensory spike; diction stays within mystic-observer lexicon. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Distinct rhythmic signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language dense but patterned (light/bending/mist) and coherent. One paraphrase loop: “absorbed it, held it, until Elias had come to listen” restates without new pressure. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold clutter. Information density high; every paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle: emotional residue as frost-etched physics rather than hauntology. Prism-as-memory-mirror repurposes a common trope through quartz arbor’s crystalline refraction. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final melted-window image. Not radically novel, but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
