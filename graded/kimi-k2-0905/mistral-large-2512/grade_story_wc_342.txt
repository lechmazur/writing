<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s prosopagnosia is rendered through concrete perceptual tics—collarbone light, gait rhythm—that cleanly motivate her negative-space portraiture; the final refusal to possess the sketch crystallizes her established values with visible cost. Interiority stays specific, never lapsing into diagnostic labels. The lone weakness: no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; the arc is a straight confirmation of traits rather than a pressured test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she turns the key, sees perfection, then renounces possession—cost is the foregone relic and the coming demolition. Causal chain (coin-map → safe → renunciation) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat deepens the stake of “containment versus reverence.” No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and never blur.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Tree-trunk library is tactile—damp-paper smell, wax under thumb, creaking wood—and the fractal sky sketch re-weights every prior visual motif; the setting literally supplies the final charged object. Spatial choreography is immaculate: coin, shelf, safe, dawn cracks tracked without drift. Micro-setting (wax patch, lock “that seemed to breathe”) constrains the decisive tactile choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“mirror the sky without caging it”—tightens once: the sketch’s perfection forces renunciation. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the inferred lens (Accumulative) legitimizes density increase over reversal. Cost is legible: she forfeits the artifact and accepts ephemerality just as demolition clock hits zero. No escalation curve, yet the single deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via negative space: the unsought sky, the unpossessed sketch, the un-demolished moment—containment as sacrilege. No moralizing; final image (“this moment, would remain”) reweights prior motifs without statement. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide if refusal preserves or evades. The only debit: no counter-argument is dramatized, so complexity is implicit rather than tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is saturated with Liora’s perceptual signature—light in clavicles, spiral dots under thumb—maintaining idiosyncratic rhythm. Syntax breathes with the hush-tone: long vowels, sibilants, controlled caesuras. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction and cadence; it never flattens into editorial gloss. Under peak pressure the diction compresses—“She would not take it”—a clean stylistic heartbeat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: every sentence advances image or stake; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative layer (“lock so intricate it seemed to breathe”) is sparse, purposeful, and paid off by the living sky sketch. Rhythm modulates—long accumulation, then clipped refusal—mirroring the escalatory hush. One micro-slip: “thousand shades of blue” edges toward cliché, but context reframes it through fractal precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prosopagnosic portraitist who paints negative air is fresh; coupling her with a fractal sky-containment relic synthesizes condition and concept into inevitability. The guild’s tree-trunk library feels mythic yet un-exposited, avoiding stock wizard tropes. Risk is quiet—renunciation instead of theft—but the stakes feel large because the cosmology is implied, not declared. Not quite paradigm-shift original, but specificity makes the fusion memorable.</comment>
