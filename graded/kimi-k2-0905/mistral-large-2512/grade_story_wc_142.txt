<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lan’s contradictory impulses—carnival loyalty vs. investor fluency—surface early and tighten through micro-choices (spiking food, slipping notes). The final hand-on-shoulder beat earns a credible endurance stance, but the cost is only gestural; no concrete consequence is felt on the page, capping the arc below 8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: graffiti warning → Lan’s sabotage → elders’ quiet sanction → vote-eve poise. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (gentrification still looms), but the lens stays situational; the raft “survives because we choose it” reweights options without a visible price paid by Lan herself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Raft-city sensory layering is selective and POV-filtered: “wooden planks groaning beneath perpetual revelry” anchors place inside Lan’s ear. The foundation chip re-appears as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate; spatial choreography stays coherent across one continuous night.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the deeds—tightens once via Lan’s escalating sabotage; options narrow as surveyors are blocked and investors stalled. Pressure is coherent under situational lens, but the absence of a live ticking clock or tangible forfeiture keeps cost legible yet not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of cultural resilience emerges through sabotage particulars rather than thesis; the neon-vs.-handmade contrast reweights at closure. Final line offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, though ambiguity is mild.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lan’s perceptual signature: “laughter had started to sound hollow” is her ear, not authorial decree. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hop or register drift. Distinct carnival idiom (“coded insults and ritualized dances”) is woven through action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative layer is restrained—one sustained carnival/river metaphor—avoiding peak-beat clutter. High information density: each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Raft-city gentrification is fresh angle on familiar trope; graffiti-as-code and “culture shock absorber” add specific inflection. Premise is fully committed to without late rule changes. Risk is moderate; no structural experiment, but specificity keeps it above mid-band.</comment>
