<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven self-exile and her need to mentor without words are clear, but the moment she lets Mira lift the cup is more facilitator than crucible; we see protective tenderness, not a visible cost that forecloses her own retreat. The contradictory impulse (stay vs. save) is named, not enacted under pressure; the final beat leaves her stance essentially unchanged, so the arc feels suspended rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara hands the cup to Mira, symbolically passing the vigil, but the reversible exile premise remains intact and no path is actually closed. Causality is loose—Mira’s arrival asks questions but does not force a decision—so the lens reads Accumulative; the tightening is gentle, the cost off-stage, and the ending hovers rather than lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library, shard-mirror, and creeping shadow are tactile, smell-bound, and kinesthetic; the mirror’s fractured glass and the scabbing spines supply micro-setting that mirrors Elara’s splintered self. Spatial choreography is clean; the backward walk and the swing’s creak root time and place without exposition dumps. The shadow finally charges the closing image by becoming the object Mira must read, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elara will re-enter the world or keep annotating emptiness—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus; Mira’s presence is curiosity, not threat. The meaningful tightening (handing over the teacup) reweights mentorship yet does not foreclose Elara’s own exile, so cost feels prospective, not paid. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; agency is observational rather than irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “resilience through persistent attention” emerges via the shadow’s refusal to vanish and the girl’s return visits; no character moralizes it. The final image—two pairs of eyes on the same shifting stain—reconfigures the library from mausoleum to classroom without pronouncement. Ambiguity lingers: the lesson may save either Mira or Elara, but the text refuses to pick, letting complexity stand.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s fractured perception; diction (“spines split like dry lips,” “combative tenderness”) is character-specific and rhythmic. No head-hopping; Mira’s voice is rendered only through gesture and dialogue sparse enough to keep focalization clean. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under surprise, supporting psychic distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphors are consistent (glass, shadow, lips) and reinforce theme. Occasional minor scaffold—“she had been exiled here—not by decree, but by choice, a reversible exile…”—explains what the prior clause already shows, but the loop is brief. No mixed vehicles or density clutter in the final beat; rhythm breathes with the swing’s creak, carrying the ending image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shard-mirror archivist and shadow-tea divination graft occult science onto emotional archaeology, giving a fresh angle on mentor–pupil tales. The library-as-observatory for resilience is specific rather than borrowed; the risk of quiet stakes pays off in tonal coherence. While the reversible-exile concept is not fully exploited for plot turns, the synthesis of image and theme feels memorably particular.</comment>
