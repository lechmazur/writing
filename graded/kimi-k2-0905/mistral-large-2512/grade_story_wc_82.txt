<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Veyra’s grief for her brother is embodied in the origami cranes and soot-stained fingers; the moment she palms the basilica floor and chooses a dream is a clear micro-choice that advances her obsession. The final possession-by-dream is credible because her need to externalize sorrow has been shown, not told. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the cost (loss of bodily autonomy) is visible on the page. The only minor drag: we never see her doubt or hesitate once the lanterns begin to feed, so the flaw feels half-acknowledged rather than actively struggled against.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dream she polished now owns her, flipping artisan into vessel under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The basilica, garden, and lantern craft are anchored by word 80; no orientation debt. Causality is clean—each lantern tightens the pattern until the inevitable rupture—and the final image (“the world transformed”) carries undeniable cost. One hairline slip: the priests’ offerings appear without prior mention, a micro-teleport that keeps this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating tea garden, inverted bonsai, silver chains, and glass basilica are filtered through Veyra’s artisan eye; every detail either enables access (chains as ladder) or mirrors grief (cranes caught in roots). The dream-pools’ liquid-silver texture returns in the serpent-coil of light that finally seizes her, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her climb, palm-press, and workshop return without drift. The environment literally constrains the final choice—she can’t flee the platform—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she contain other people’s sorrow without being consumed—tightens with each lantern; the pattern break when one lantern feeds back is the single required intensification. Agency stays hers: she chooses which dreams to harvest and keeps building despite priestly signals. Cost is legible: body possession, loss of artisan control. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is the accretive weight of polished grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the attempt to aestheticize grief turns the craftsman into artifact. Subtext lives in the inversion—origami cranes meant to release sorrow instead anchor it, and polished dreams meant to illuminate instead colonize. No moral is stated; the final image of interior transformation lets the reader reweight every prior lantern. Ambiguity is purposeful: we cannot tell if the brother’s name whispered is salvation or erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Veyra’s perceptual filter—soot, solder, jasmine, moonstone dust—creating a rhythmic, metallic-jasmine cadence distinct to the piece. No head-hopping; priestly offerings are seen only as unexplained externals, preserving her narrowed lens. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer accumulative clauses build the garden calm, then fracture into short beats at the shatter. Voice remains consistent even under the final possession, the last clause stripped to “the world transformed.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image plus causal push (“she would polish them…until they fit perfectly into the lanterns”). Figurative layering is dense but patterned early, so the lyric overload at the climax reads as earned crescendo rather than purple drift. Zero paraphrase loops; each crane mention adds a new physical or emotional angle. A single mixed metaphor—“raw wound of violet and gold”—is marginal and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The dream-recording basilica, grief-folded origami, and artisan who refines sorrow into light form a synthesis that feels inevitable yet fresh. No familiar plot template matches this inversion of maker-made. Risk is high—lyric density, floating world, conceptual horror—but coherence never buckles. The final re-pricing flips the craftsman trope into object without reading as gimmick, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
