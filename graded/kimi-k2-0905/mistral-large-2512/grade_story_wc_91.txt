<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “quiet rebellion” and barefoot poverty are vivid, but the prophecy beat turns him from agent to pawn; the interior contradiction between giver and chosen savior is asserted, not dramatized under pressure. The mirror vision hands him future action rather than forcing a present micro-choice that costs him something already valued. Still, his body-on-the-line past and the extinguished bug create enough embodied cost to keep the arc legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the darkened jar and volcanic cough crystallize a new necessity, cost is felt (“he didn’t feel destitute. He felt necessary”). Causal lens holds: detour→woman→mirror→run, each because/therefore link narrowing options. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. Minor knock: prophecy supplies external causality rather than Elias’s prior tactics triggering the eruption, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Black sand, lava glow, and bug-light create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the final run—bare feet on hot grit, dying glow signaling time. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors Elias’s poverty-sharpened attention. Volcano functions as looming clock, not postcard. Environment directly shapes the closing action; meets 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep giving vs. accept destiny”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the bug darkens and the woman forecloses denial. One meaningful turn: mirror vision forces the choice to run, trading anonymity for village salvation. Cost is legible (loss of quiet rebellion, exposure as “Stormbringer”). Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word scope; prophecy convenience keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformative poverty—giving until one becomes necessary—emerges through bug-light and barefoot run, never sermonized. Final image reweights “destitute” into “necessary” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is prophecy self-fulfilling or gift? Avoids tidy closure. One thematic echo (“texture of transformation”) is spoken aloud but earns partial pass because it is immediately embodied in the volcanic crunch underfoot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical close-up maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“coincidences felt less like chance and more like fate”) stays within Elias’s poetic lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences collapse into staccato run beats. No head-hopping; woman’s dialogue carries oracular indirection. Voice distinctiveness survives the pressure spike.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence fronts, high information density. One paraphrase loop: “he had felt the tremors, the way the earth shifted beneath his feet like a restless sleeper” restates prior tremor hint. Metaphors stay coherent (volcano as sleeper, bug as dying star). No filter-verb clusters or register drift. Minor scaffold keeps it sub-8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“Destitute philanthropist meets accidental prophet” is fresh inflection; volcanic island + bottled bioluminescence as poverty currency feels specific. Transformation trope is inverted—he becomes necessary rather than rich. Risk is moderate; prophecy device is familiar but reweighted through his prior habit of engineered kindness. Synthesis is memorable if not radically new.</comment>
