<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s mechanical arm and “diplomatically fierce” tag stay ornamental; only the needle-card micro-choice shows hierarchy of values. Isolde’s shift from smirk to surrender is sketched, not embodied. Interiority is atmospheric, not contradictory. Closure choice is credible but cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the card-sundial alignment reconfigures their duel into joint journey with conceptual cost (“the duel was over. The journey had just begun”). Causal chain holds: card reveal → angle shift → stance reversal. Orientation clean by 120 words. No meaningful constraint persists into the after-image, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass-atrium/brook anchors every beat; light through perforated card turns the floor into a living map—setting directly shapes tactics. Micro-setting (brass arm, sundial gnomon) handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy follows Elias’s philosopher-cartographer gaze. Environment charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“first fatal question”—tightens when card converts sundial angles into a route, forcing Isolde to cede control. One visible price: her surrender of the next question. Escalation is intellectual, not visceral, but agency and cost are legible on the page under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of inquiry-as-navigation emerges through the card-sundial light-map rather than exposition. Final image reweights earlier “questions into destinations” line without moralizing. Subtext in silence and traded objects carries the emotional shift. Ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature—geometric light, gear-whir, cipher-thinking—remains distinct. Syntax mirrors his measured philosopher-cartographer rhythm. Isolde’s dialogue carries surgical precision, separating voices. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative language is spare and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits POV. Final line lands with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Philosophical duel via sewing-needle cipher and half-painted sundial” feels fresh and specific; trope of romantic rivals turned collaborators is transformed through cartographic metaphor. Risk in intellectualized conflict pays off. Synthesis inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes.</comment>
