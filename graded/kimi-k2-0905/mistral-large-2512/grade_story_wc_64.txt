<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s quiet hunger to “hear the dead” is embodied in tactile gardening gestures and the micro-choice to plant roses at the end; the interior contradiction between blithe caretaker and lonely listener is palpable. The final renunciation—accepting Margaret’s story as his own—carries visible cost in the midnight vigil, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: “longed to hear their voices” drifts toward label-speak, keeping the score just sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each thread-color discovery layers density until the gold initials reprice Elias’s custodial life. Closure is a Charged Poise—roses tomorrow, echoes tonight—whose conceptual cost (he will now tend the living memory, not just the dead) is legible in the final image. No orientation debt; transitions from silo to river and back are cleanly anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt silo’s rusted curves, velveteen gloom, and finger-smoothed wall corner function as micro-setting that literally guides Elias’s path and final decision. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: gardener notices soil scent, thread texture, wall wear. The environment constrains the choice to plant roses in that exact niche, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elias let the dead speak through him?—tightens when gold threads force him to confront Margaret’s unresolved love. One meaningful deepening: the scratched initials reweight his custodial role into surrogate lover. Cost is felt in the midnight rose-planting vow; pressure accumulates rather than reverses, fitting the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—stories don’t die, they wait for a gardener—emerges from the tapestry decode and rose-planting without moralizing. The final image reweights “tending the dead” into tending memory itself. Subtext in the locket portrait and “wait for me where the water bends” implies Margaret’s defiant hope; Elias’s acceptance is earned, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s gardener perception: “roots… velveteen gloom… spider-silk gold.” Rhythm modulates from languid garden cadence to sharper thread-counting beats. No head-hopping; diction remains within rustic lexicon except one elevated phrase (“uncharted echoes”) that reads as his own newfound longing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “current lapped at the shore like a cat at a saucer of milk” does double sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, memory, or motive. One mixed metaphor—“cold light pooling in hollows”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing cemetery caretaker with textile code-breaking feels fresh; the tapestry border as cartographic memory is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk in lyric stillness pays off because the final rose-planting crystallizes the accrued echoes. Slight deduction for echo of familiar “chess clock” adage without new spin.</comment>
