<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s curiosity and musical memory feel specific; the moment she chooses to bow the floating violin crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—breath fogging, fingers finding strings—without slipping into label-speak. The cost is legible: the program blanks, the house darkens, the music now lives only in her. A hair more contradiction under pressure would push this to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank program and darkened house reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—program → water → Elias → violin → played symphony—each beat because/therefore. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. One tightening: the rising water narrows options to “play or remain silent.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Flooded pit, peeling varnish, lantern shards in black water—each detail filters through Lena’s musician gaze and constrains her reach. The violin-as-micro-setting governs the final gesture; water level decides when she can touch it. Spatial choreography is clean: threshold → pit → stage → corridors of light. A touch more sensory narrowing under cold stress would hit 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“unravel the code or let the symphony die”—is signaled early and tightens once: the program dissolves, forcing immediate performance. Pressure grows causally; water rises because she plays, not by coincidence. Visible price: antique program lost, eternal custodianship gained. Stakes stay personal and legible; no abstract world-saving clutter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of resurrection-through-performance emerges from the sequence, never stated. The blank program’s silence after sound becomes the resonant image; meaning reweights without moralizing. Subtext in Elias’s wordless conducting keeps ambiguity alive. One overt thematic line would have dropped this band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lena; perceptual signature—musical notation, breath fog, varnish texture—feels bassist-specific. No head-hopping; Elias remains opaque, as he must. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for submerged awe, staccato fragments when she bows. A single filter-verb cluster (“she saw, she understood”) keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, image, and atmosphere in one stroke: “water rose just enough to breathe life into the silence.” No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (mirror, shattered light). One mixed vehicle—“lantern light bent into corridors”—is borderline but paid off by spatial shift. Clean copy, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “music that drowns unless played by the living” angle feels fresh, not a trope checklist. Water as both archive and audience synthesizes ghost-story and artist-myth in one stroke. Transformation test fails if Lena were any performer—bassoonist-turned-violinist specificity matters. Risky spatial warp earns +0.3 for heightening stakes without losing clarity.</comment>
