<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s paralysis and the locksmith’s quiet resolve are sketched through gesture and object-handling rather than label-speak, but the story withholds any interior contradiction or micro-choice from the locksmith during the ritual; his decision to “tell it” arrives without visible cost or struggle, so the arc feels gift-wrapped rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine—lock of hair → starlit ritual → braided key → idea freed—lands a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the village must confront its buried guilt). Orientation is swift, the single transition back to the village is legible, and the closure beat carries undeniable reweighting; only the locksmith’s unmotivated certainty keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Starlight, damp earth, and the wooden box are filtered through the locksmith’s tactile precision; the micro-setting of the palm-held starlight mercury constrains the ritual’s possibility and reappears in the final braid, satisfying the 9+ gate. Village space is sketched only as “by the fire,” just enough to stage the hand-off without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will the silenced founding truth be released?—tightens once when the braid ignites with ancestral voices, foreclosing the option to re-bury the secret. Pressure is coherent but single-stage; the locksmith meets no external resistance or internal trade-off, so the escalation feels more illumination than collision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: communities become what they flee when fear locks their own voices. The braided lock recharges the motif of binding/unbinding, and the final imperative “Tell it” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers about what the village will do, keeping the thought alive after the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the locksmith’s perceptual signature—starlight as mercury, hair that hums—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates from long ritual sentences to the two-word release (“Tell it”), giving the closure beat sonic punch. No dialogue means voice distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence advances ritual or stakes. Figurative language is selective—starlight pools like mercury—never stacked. No loops, scaffold, or register drift appear; the final braid shimmer is earned by earlier tactile handling, so the image lands without metaphoric muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-as-ritual-technician and hair-as-archive feel fresh, synthesizing folk-horror with quiet lyric activism. Risk is taken in keeping the climax off-stage (the village’s listening), but the closure still reweights the premise. The concept of “enveloped secrets” could slide toward abstraction, yet here it is materialized in every twist of the braid.</comment>
