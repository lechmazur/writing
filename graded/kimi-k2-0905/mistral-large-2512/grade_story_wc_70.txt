<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s involuntary truthfulness is a vivid constraint that activates twice—first when he blurts “Just a box” and again when he swallows the admission that the riddle chose him. These micro-choices under Maren’s gaze show contradictory impulses (obey rules vs. keep wonder) and cost him authority. The final strike is credibly motivated by the prior beats, but the interior contradiction could be sharper in the moment he decides to trespass.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: found box → riddle → Maren intercepts → tower core → blue match reignites hives. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s wonder is restored yet the tower is now depleted, a felt cost legible in “stolen thunder.” Orientation is clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor slack: the saboteur is named but never faces consequence, so the plot stops at restoration rather than full reckoning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lightning tower, drone hives, and nectar dusk are sketched with selective sensory strokes—“copper veins,” “wings too heavy with static”—that filter through Elias’s stake in wonder. The tower’s dimmed core and the matchbox’s blue flame are micro-settings that directly constrain the final choice. Spatial choreography is clear across the gate, base, and core moves. A hair more tactile handling of the lacquer box could have pushed it past the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder via restored hives—is signaled early and tightens when the core is revealed “dimmed to a sickly pulse.” The midpoint reversal (Maren seizes the matchbox) raises the cost of trespass and narrows options to one lawful act: strike the tower’s memory. Price is visible—the tower’s remaining charge is spent—yet the off-stage saboteur lessens the final pressure; confrontation stays technical rather than personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder versus routine maintenance emerges through the hives’ silence and Elias’s coin-counting life, never sermonized. The closing image of hives “humming with stolen thunder” reweights the premise: wonder survives, but only by consuming its own source. Ambiguity is purposeful—who drained the tower remains open—yet the thematic counter-reading (wonder exacts a hidden debt) is only lightly implied rather than fully charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tightly aligned to Elias’s perceptual filter: static-heavy air, the box “warm as if it had absorbed the storm’s fury,” nectar dusk tasted rather than seen. Syntax flexes with pressure—“truth clawed up his throat”—without losing clarity. Maren’s dialogue carries steel-edged subtext that forces Elias’s hand. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” diction in narration feels above Elias’s pay-grade, but it is isolated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance image or causality without scaffold. Figurative layer is controlled—two metaphors per beat at most—and coherent: tower as “skeletal sentinel,” flame smelling of “ozone and burnt sugar.” No paraphrase loops or template cadence. A single mixed image—“drone beehives hovered like dying stars”—barely grazes physical logic but does not obscure the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The lightning tower that remembers storms and the matchbox-riddle ignition fuse mythic tech with pollinator collapse in a way that feels specific to this world rather than borrowed. The notion that wonder must literally burn its own archive is fresh, though the sabotage thread stays generic. Risk is moderate: the piece leans into wonder-repair rather than interrogating power, but the synthesis is memorable and internally consistent.</comment>
