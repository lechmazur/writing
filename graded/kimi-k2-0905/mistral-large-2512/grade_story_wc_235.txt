<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s jealousy toward his past self is vivid and embodied (“coiling in his gut”), but the story stops before he makes a micro-choice that would foreclose a path; the final beat is still anticipatory. Interior contradiction is strong—desire to soar vs. fear of burial—yet no on-page decision crystallizes it. The jealousy drives the emotional engine, but closure is deferred to the unseen visitor, so cost is implied, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the door swings open, re-weighting all prior dread into an undeniable fork—confront the self or be dragged under. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated scroll/cabin imagery tightens the noose until the final image crystallizes cost. Causality is loose—no because/therefore chain—yet pattern-break at the end satisfies the lens. Orientation is clear by line 5; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cabin’s “groaning” logs, birch scroll’s brittle edges, and the mountain’s “teeth” are tactile, selective, and filter through Elias’s chronicler gaze. Space is stable: table, loft, latch all track cleanly. Weather howls but does not yet constrain choice—still, the final image of the opening door is charged by the claustrophobic interior, so environment shapes the stakes. Micro-setting (scroll) directly charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias outwrite his own burial—is signaled early and tightens through scroll rereads and grave vision. One meaningful deepening: realizing the handwriting is his own escalates jealousy to existential choke. No visible price paid yet—he hasn’t burned or surrendered the scroll—so cost is still prospective. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; final image narrows options to two: face or flee.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—time as predatory text that devours its author—emerges through concrete images (own grave, self-authored warning) rather than exposition. Subtext lives in the act of rereading: each perusal rewrites the reader. Final image reframes the scroll as summons, not relic, reweighting prior nostalgia into dread. No moralizing; resonance is felt in the hinge of the door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is dense, rhythmic, and chronicler-specific—“feral nostalgia,” “mountain’s teeth”—without purple drift. Compression (“lucid dream chronicler” as sole epithet) is taught early and holds. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. POV stays interior and coherent; perceptual signature (ink bleeding, maps never sold) is consistent. Under peak stress diction shortens to “The latch clicked,” mirroring pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long, clause-stacked lines to staccato beats; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors per page, not every sentence—so density never stalls. One mixed metaphor risk: “mountain swallowed him whole” beside “mountain’s teeth” reads coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Clean copy, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Time-jealousy of one’s own prior self is fresh and executed through tangible artifact rather than abstract angst. Scroll-as-wormhole feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into repetition, but final image justifies the pattern. Not radically avant-garde, yet specificity of chronicler-voice plus grave-before-birth twist lifts it above trope.</comment>
