<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s claustrophobia and the doll-as-talisman are embodied in every step; the contradiction between bunker-bred fear and skyward hunger drives each micro-choice. The final hand-brush is a credible first stride toward agency, not a cure, so the arc earns its scale. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—even at peak altitude. Cost is visible: she will return to crushing walls, now knowing they aren’t the only space.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the trellis will remain and so will she, a resonant reconfiguration that costs her the safety of never-knowing. Causal chain is clean: inversion → trellis appears → father’s prohibition → her calibrated exposure → boy’s recognition → mutual pledge. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Lens is Situational—pressure of inverted world forces stance crystallization—and holds to last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The spongy vine under bare feet, syrupy air, and cloud-ceiling glow are filtered through Liora’s sensory hierarchy—every detail tightens or eases her claustrophobia. The doll’s chipped smile and the trellis’s creak act as micro-setting that directly constrain her next step. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track distance, sway, and shifting gravity without drift. Environment charges the final image—she pockets the doll and feels the sky’s hush become a second skin she must eventually shed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she claim breathable space without being crushed—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is situational: each vine creak heightens the price of exposure; the boy’s recognition tightens the stakes from solitary risk to shared covenant. One meaningful deepening suffices: gravity’s re-inversion clocks their parting. Cost is legible—she will descend back into ribs of stone carrying the sky’s taste.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges: space is made, not given; silence can be cultivated into agency. Subtext lives in the doll hand-off—safety redefined from object to mutual witness. No moralizing; the final “next time” is an open horizon that reweights the bunker’s suffocation without naming it. Ambiguity is productive: we feel both futures simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Liora’s perceptual signature—ozone-tasting air, starched hush—without ever ventriloquizing the boy. Syntax stretches with syrupy air, then tightens when gravity re-asserts; rhythm mirrors altitude. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Voice is singular enough that two lines could not come from another story.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is selective—only three extended metaphors—each pays off (beast-ribs return as she descends). Zero paraphrase loops; every clause advances image or pressure. Copy is clean; no misplaced modifiers or simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inversion-bridge that appears only when physics flips is fresh; pairing it with claustrophobia inverts the usual “escape” trope. Xenial trellis as living, reaching fingers synthesizes botanical and mechanical in one image. Risk is taken—quiet lyric ending instead of triumphal flight—yet coherence is preserved. Removing Liora’s specific bunker childhood collapses the entire emotional engine, passing the transformation test.</comment>
