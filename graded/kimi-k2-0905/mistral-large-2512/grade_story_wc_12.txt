<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Father Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for revelation yet fearing possession—remains vivid and embodied; the violet smear and heartbeat loop externalize the split. Micro-choices (pressing thumb to lip, triggering the pedal) steadily escalate stakes. The final “invitation” earns its turn because the palette, pedal, and anchor have all been handled under pressure. Cost is felt: the violet spreads, staining skin, signaling irreversible surrender.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stillness is not void but mirror, reweighting all prior sound-layers with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop thickens density until the single chord collapses options. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors (altar, pedal, anchor walls) are clear by line 5. No causality breaks; the palette’s earlier ruin-backstory cues the violet’s later spread.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor functions as micro-setting: its thrumming walls and shifting bones constrain every sonic action. The palette’s bruised violet and the pedal’s wires provide tactile specificity that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is priest-centric—sound over sight—mirroring his vocation. Weather is absent, but the anchor’s dimensional hum substitutes as environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he survive possession?”—is signaled early and tightens through each added layer of sound. The heartbeat loop acts as irreversible escalation, foreclosing silence as refuge. Agency remains active: he chooses to add the heartbeat, inviting the mirror. Cost is visible when violet stains spread, marking bodily surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: revelation requires self-dissolution, not defense. Subtext resides in sonic palimpsest—each loop erases authorship. The violet stain reconfigures the palette’s art-craft into sacramental war-paint, repricing “decoration.” No moralizing; the final image leaves ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains priestly diction—“hollowed-out husk,” “chorus of the unsaid”—without slipping into editorial. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for ritual, fragments for percussive loops. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Compression (“the stillness wasn’t unraveled. It was revealed”) teaches the pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, mirroring sonic layering. Figurative language is selective: “sleeping beast” for pedal, “poorly stitched shroud” for silence—each recurs in altered form. No synonym loops or filter stacks. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic imagery, creating propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Loop-pedal priest as exorcist-sound-sculptor feels fresh; the palette reduced to one bruised violet offers a tactile relic of apocalypse. Risk lies in collapsing sound into mirror, yet the payoff is legible. Could edge higher if the dimensional anchor’s rules were slightly more particularized, but the synthesis already avoids trope recycling.</comment>
