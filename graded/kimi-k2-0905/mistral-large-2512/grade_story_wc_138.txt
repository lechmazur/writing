<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Veyra’s longing to “discover what happens after goodbye” is concrete and stakes her eternal solitude; the amulet burn she accepts at the end shows embodied cost. Interiority stays specific to an immortal’s fatigue rather than generic angst. Yet the moment of refusal is summarized (“She had her answer”) rather than dramatized, muting the contradictory impulse that would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: stolen fragment → Kael’s intrusion → storm peak → Veyra’s channeling → Kael erased and Veyra scarred. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80; the final image of cold amulet equals Earned Stasis with cost visible in the burnt palm. One causal leap—how channeling “dimensional awareness” alone banishes Kael—is off-stage, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prismatic escondite is not postcard backdrop; its crystalline walls amplify the storm’s magnetics, turning the chamber itself into the weapon Veyra wields. Sensory triage narrows to violet light, metallic air, and skin prickle, matching crisis attention. The micro-setting (amulet in palm) literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“see after goodbye”—tightens when the only means (storm + fragment) demands a sacrifice Veyra hesitates to pay. Her refusal to let Kael seize it escalates via because/therefore: each magnetic surge narrows options until she pays with flesh. Cost is legible in the scorched hand, but the beat is compressed; a sharper sensory spike at the burn would have lifted this to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: immortality’s true curse is not endless time but the unanswerable echo of every farewell. The silence that follows Kael’s erasure reweights the opening question without moralizing. No motif is forced; the violet light’s return in the final line offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that makes silence legible as aftermath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays interior to Veyra; perceptual signature favors cosmic fatigue and dimensional “prickles,” distinct from Kael’s thunder-tinged idiom. Syntax tightens under pressure—“The amulet fragment burned”—then exhales in the quiet last line, mirroring her arc. No head-hopping or register drift; the single POV holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“light fractured into a thousand hues”) and never clutters the high-pressure beat. One mixed vehicle—“chorus of the damned” applied to solar winds—barely grazes coherence, not enough to dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Spatial mutiny” reframes familiar immortal-angst through dimensional insurgency, giving cosmic scale to private grief. The prismatic escondite as both sanctuary and loaded gun feels specific to this tale; swap the setting and the climax collapses. Risk is moderate—cosmic fantasy in under 800 words—yet the piece commits fully, avoiding archetype shorthand.</comment>
