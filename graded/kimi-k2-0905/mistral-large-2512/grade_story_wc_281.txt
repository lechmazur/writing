<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “affectionate skeptic” trait is shown early and embodied in the final “Prove it” that now carries belief, a credible shift. Interiority stays concrete—fingers on sternum, paint on skin—avoiding label-speak. The only drag is Eli, who functions more as helpful prop than pressure source, flattening the relationship crucible. Still, her micro-choices (taking the placebo, painting air) earn the closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the painted threads crystallize a new lived stance with felt cost (“willowglass hope light as a feather”). Causal chain holds—shock → pill echo → body map → shared memory → acceptance—tight under 800 words. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (studio, blacklight, ozone). One minor causality bump: the placebo is swallowed mid-scene yet produces immediate perceptual shift with no cue that it’s psychosomatic; momentarily blurs lens.</comment>

<comment>The studio’s blacklight, phosphorescent paint, and ozone scent constrain every action—she paints on skin then on air because the walls already pulse. Muscovite sliver acts as micro-setting, refracting light to reveal pathways, charging the final map. Selective sensory hierarchy—burnt sugar clings to skin, static hum beneath bones—keeps pressure immediate. Environment never feels like backdrop; it supplies the literal paint and light that make the closure image possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“how to live with the pill’s rewiring”—tightens once: accidental shock forces her from denial to experimentation, then to acceptance. The shared-memory thread raises cost (someone else’s joy invades her), foreclosing the option of total reversal. Agency stays hers: she swallows placebo, paints pathways, chooses collaboration with Eli. No external antagonist needed; internal/external pressures braid cleanly under 800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: embodiment as epistemology—knowledge is painted, worn, shared, not merely thought. Subtext in final hand-clasp flips her earlier demand for proof into mutual trust. No moralizing; the painted door stays ambiguous—exit, portal, or mirror—inviting reflection. The willowglass hope line edges toward poetic assertion but is saved by its newfound weightlessness after heavy static.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mara’s perceptual filter—fractal edges, ozone taste, thread-light synesthesia—creating a distinct rhythmic signature. No head-hopping; Eli’s unreadable expression is observed externality only. Syntax flexes with pressure—short bursts during shock, longer lyrical coils while painting—without losing clarity. One clause drifts toward workshop prose (“devise a way to live with it”), but voice re-anchors in tactile verbs: brush slips, sliver refracts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “paint dried but pathways remained” advances plot and reweights metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each brushstroke adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure, avoiding purple clutter. Minor filter verb cluster (“she could see”) during vision beat, but immediacy recovers with tactile follow-up.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Telepathy-via-pill recalls is familiar, yet the somatic light-painting workaround feels fresh and specific to this narrator. Fractal precision motif grows from geode to skin to air, transforming a math adjective into lived ritual. Risk taken: turning one’s body into a canvas of someone else’s memory—earned, not gimmicky. Could push further into the ethical thicket of shared minds, but within word count the concept lands intact.</comment>
