<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s precognitive curse and eel-herding vocation give him a singular interior signature; the moment he kneels and feels “the hum of something older” embodies his lifetime of pattern-reading. The final micro-choice—placing the last rock while eels coil around his wrists—crystallizes a hierarchy of values (promise > fear) with tactile cost. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the beat where “the promise became clear” leans summary rather than simultaneous contradiction, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: friction returns re-weighted, the world’s texture restored at visible price (“the weight in his chest lighter now”). Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—each rock placement tightens the pattern until star-dust and eel-shard complete the weave. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“Elias had spent thirty-seven years…”). The only hairline slip: the father’s deathbed line is told rather than shown, a micro-ellipse that keeps it from perfect 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The tidal bluff is no backdrop; the missing friction literally removes the setting’s resistance, forcing Elias to act. Painted rocks, salt-stiff air, and auroral light pool are selected for pressure, not postcard color. The eels as living shadow-ropes finally deliver the shard that completes the constellation—environment, tool, and body converge in the closing image. Micro-setting (jar of star-dust in palm) constrains the decisive beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep the world from unraveling”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: friction vanishes → pattern must be rewoven. The painted-rock sequence is the single meaningful narrowing; each placement forecloses error and raises cosmic cost. Agency is high; coincidence complicates (eels return) but does not resolve. Price is legible (father’s promise paid with lifelong burden), yet the escalation is singular rather than layered, capping it just below the 8.8 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of knowing without feeling: precognition grants pattern-sight yet denies the herder bodily friction until he earns it back. The reweighted aurora—first dreamlike, finally a forge that reseals the world—carries the thematic turn without statement. Subtext resides in the eels’ silent guardianship and the father’s unexplained promise, inviting reflection on inheritance and repair. No moralizing line intrudes; the closing image of clinging sand is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “salt-stiff air,” “living shadows,” “hum of something older.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under action (“He placed the final rock”). No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within a coastal herder’s lexicon. The single line of dialogue is whispered, diegetic, and voice-apt. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity—meets the 9- gate with hairline margin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: every image pulls double duty (“ribbons of green and violet weaving through the salt-stiff air” sets both sky and sensory deprivation). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; star-dust and painted rocks retain literal integrity while accruing symbolic charge. Sentence variety modulates from auroral sweep to staccato placement beats. One tiny scaffold—“the patterns were unraveling” echoes “the world had nearly unraveled”—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing cosmic aurora, invisible eel-herding, and geomancy via painted rocks feels inevitable yet unseen before. The precognitive curse is inverted: knowledge without sensation, repaired only by bodily friction restored. Risk—cosmic stakes in <800 words—pays off because tactile micro-actions (rock, dust, eel-shard) ground the abstract. The synthesis is specific to this voice and shore; swap any element and the fabric tears.</comment>
