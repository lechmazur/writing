<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-ritual is embodied in the creak of the jetty and the papery rattle of pods; his stooped posture and shallow breath externalize loss without label-speak. Interior contradiction is present—he “has no illusions” yet still casts seeds—creating a credible tension. The final renunciation (turning away lighter yet heavier) is legible, but the cost feels generalized; no specific memory or sensory anchor makes the battlefield’s ghost personally his. Micro-choices are mostly observational; a single active risk (speaking back to the heron) would have pushed this into 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seeds in dark cracks + departing silhouette reweight the premise—reclamation is possible only after witness, not victory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt-rot, pod-rattle, heron wing-beat) deepens the stake of return. Orientation is swift: “blooming jetty at twilight” anchors where/when inside 20 words. Cost is present but diffuse; the line “his heart was not” names the price rather than letting an image make it felt, capping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The jetty itself functions as micro-setting: splintered wood, cracks, tide-slick gaps constrain where seeds can lodge, turning the structure into both grave and cradle. Weathered planks “groaning under his weight” tie battlefield memory to present bodily pressure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal—Elias notices wind direction, gull cry cadence, damp earth scent—never tourist-catalog. One minor slip: “vastness so narrow it felt like a wound” is vivid but conceptually abstract; a tactile bridge to the wound would have lifted this to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim lost life—signals early via seed scattering. Pressure escalates texturally: color-drained sea → heron inquiry → seeds swallowed by cracks; each beat thickens the elegiac density rather than narrowing options. No active opposition or visible price (lost pods, snapped plank, rejected call) is dramatized; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Sufficient for short lyric mode but keeps cost conceptual rather than felt, holding the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as seeds that need witness, not soil—emerges through recurrence of “dead languages” translated into tide-creak and bird-call rather than exposition. Final image reweights the pods from relics to promise without moralizing. The heron’s departure acts as Conceptual Repricing: absence becomes the necessary attendant for return. One near-moral line “the earth…was patient” is saved by its placement mid-paragraph, not at closure, preserving resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Elias’s perceptual filter: verbs like “cradled,” “tilted,” “scattered” carry gentle ecclesiastical cadence matching his ritual vocation. Syntax lengthens and contracts with duskfall, mirroring tide rhythm. No dialogue appears; voice remains consistent without head-hop. Diction edges toward lit-speak (“submerged concord,” “conceptual repricing”) but stays within a coachman-poet’s plausible lexicon, so only a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences show purposeful variation; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are internally coherent (mirror-wound, seed-whispers) and do not stack during high-pressure beats. Density is high—each line advances image or stakes. Two minor scaffolding phrases—“something older, something like” and “not the soil—there was no soil left here”—could be trimmed without loss, preventing 8.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Familiar eco-elegy tropes (dead reef, battlefield garden) are refreshed through the coachman-linguist who translates avian prayers into seed rites. The submerged concord concept gives the reef’s death a prior diplomatic rupture, a speculative twist not seen in standard climate fiction. Pods as both text and womb is a fresh inflection. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold formal experiment—keeping score in high 7s.</comment>
