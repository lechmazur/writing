<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—dream-pull, shard-hum, scanner readings—but the final choice is asserted, not dramatized: we never see him weigh the cost of redirecting the flow versus letting truth stay hidden. The scarred double’s warning (“Some truths aren’t meant to be weighed”) supplies the only external pressure, so the closing decision feels imported, not earned from contradictory impulses shown in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city-of-mirrors image reweights the shard and the multiverse premise with undeniable ontological cost. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—accumulative thinning of reality plus the causal trigger of pressing shard-to-console—but the choice moment is off-page beat jump; we’re told “Kael made his decision” rather than shown the micro-choice that seals the gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Ozone, rust, flicker of emergency lights, and the cracked console give tactile anchoring; the shard’s pulse against Kael’s ribs merges body, tool, and setting. The repair bay functions as micro-setting: its collapsing architecture and erratic scanner readings directly constrain whether the gate can be opened, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what truth is withheld”—is signaled early and tightens when the double appears, forcing a single irrevocable choice. Escalation is one-step but sufficient: the bay’s walls thin, the gate activates, options narrow to redirect or retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the image of the scale holding the shard makes the price legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the shard-to-scale image: individual identity as measurable fragment of an incomprehensible whole. Subtext resides in the double’s scarred face—silent argument that knowledge literally marks the bearer. No moralizing; the closing image reweights prior motifs without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s sensory filter; diction (“ozone and rust,” “sky bled violet”) is character-specific rather than tour-guide. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under pressure—“The air between them crackled”—without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“the repair bay wasn’t just a nexus—it was a gate”—is justified as emphatic beat. Strong verbs and concrete nouns carry description; final line lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Multiverse encounter with one’s own scarred self is familiar, but the shard-as-weight-on-cosmic-scale reframes it into fresh ontological stakes. Specific sensory leftovers (burnt-sugar air, violet sky) keep the template from feeling generic.</comment>
