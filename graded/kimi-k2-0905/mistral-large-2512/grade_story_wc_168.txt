<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s survivor-guilt and vocation to “translate pain” are concrete via the notebook, the itch of scars, and the choice to listen. The stranger’s trembling hand on the pen shows the cost of the stolen voice, but the bargain itself is reported, not dramatized, so the interior contradiction peaks late. Still, the micro-choice to offer the page earns the softening of grief—visible, proportionate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pair sit rewriting the bargain under shifting stars—options reweighted, silence traded for shared witness, cost legible in the pen pass. Causal chain: find box → hear loss → offer page → rewrite; no gaps. Orientation anchored by 80 words; single transition up ridge; lens (Causal) holds. Only nit: the stranger’s age-twelve flash is summary, not scene, so the decisive change feels half a beat shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Moonlit ridge, pine scent, and porcelain fractures are filtered through Elias’s fire-trained eye; the cracked box becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—crouch, cradle, sit, pass pen—no floating bodies. Weather (distant thunder) tightens the hush without forcing symbolism. Environment does not actively constrain tactics, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the stolen voice be given back—signals early and tightens once: from solitary burden to shared testimony. The pen hand-off is the single meaningful narrowing; it forecloses silence and costs Elias his protective detachment. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Cost is felt but not yet material (no lost tool or time), so stays south of 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—how to speak pain after fire has taken the words—emerges through the notebook margins and the final ink bleeding into paper; no moralizing statement. The porcelain box reweights from fragile curiosity to vessel of shared silence; the image of “rewriting the bargain” offers non-literal resonance. Ambiguity remains: will words ever equal song? Complexity honored, no tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is tactile-fire—scars itch, wind carries burn-smell, paper feels “like water through cracked earth.” Syntax lengthens during listening, then compresses at the pen pass, mirroring breath. No dialogue attribution clutter; the stranger’s rasp is distinct from Elias’s quieter diction. One filter verb cluster (“he felt the hard edges…soften”) but it serves the beat, not drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors (“liquid mercury,” “water through cracked earth”) stay coherent because both feed the same cracked-box motif. One paraphrase loop: “the forest called…in a way nothing else could” could trim. Otherwise momentum carries uninterrupted to the final ink bleed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—traumatized firefighter meets magical burn victim—feels fresh via the specificity of fire-pattern sketches and the inversion: voice lost not to flame but to child-bargain. The “rewrite the bargain” ending is a quiet conceptual twist that grows organically from the notebook motif. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks. Could push further into ecological or mythic depth for 8.5+.</comment>
