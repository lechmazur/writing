<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is lyrical but coherent; the beautician-mortician fusion is shown through tactile ritual, not label. Contradictory impulses (preserve beauty vs accept transience) surface in the emerald kiss, but the cost is more asserted than embodied—no micro-choice visibly backfires. Still, her final stance crystallizes with quiet renunciation, satisfying the 9+ test at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the threshold mood until the emerald’s dimming reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pause between breaths—felt cost is the chip’s extinction and her inevitable return. Orientation is swift; no causal break. One soft spot: the revival beat is slightly too gentle to tighten options; hence not 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto, frost-kissed linen, auroral palette—all filter through Liora’s professional eye for beauty. The emerald chip doubles as micro-setting and tool, constraining the ritual’s success; its dying glow charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no weather clichés. Just shy of 9 because environment alters mood more than tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—is signaled early and escalates as the emerald’s pulse fades. Pressure tightens when the chip dims at revival; the cost is the irreversible drain of the only tool. Agency is ritual attention rather than brute action, fitting the lens. A sharper external jeopardy or irreversible bodily price would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: beauty as threshold companion to death, not its opposite. Subtext lives in the emerald’s spent light—art’s fleeting victory over void. Final image of Liora’s elongated shadow under twilight aurora reweights the premise without moralizing. One echo too many of “radiant hush” keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual signature: frost “sings,” breath is “silver thread.” Syntax lengthens and softens under auroral glow, then snaps short at revival beat—rhythmic control is purposeful. No head-hop; diction stays within her elegiac lexicon. A single filter verb cluster (“seemed to hum”) is the lone hairline slip.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lyrical yet lean; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—each aurora color shift marks a narrative beat, so density earns its keep. Opening and closing lines are mirror-polished. One mixed vehicle (“fractured dreams” scattering from emerald) barely grazes clarity, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Beautician-mortician fusion feels inevitable yet fresh; the emerald chip as soul-capacitor reframes familiar death-ritual tropes. Aurora-grotto setting is specific enough to resist generic afterlife limbo. Risk lies in quiet stakes; the piece commits fully to them. Not quite 8.8 because the concept’s rule-set could be pushed further—what happens if the chip fails mid-ritual?</comment>
