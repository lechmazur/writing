<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her grip on the punch, the sand sucking at boots—yet the “unused courage” motive stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. Elias functions as oracle, not crucible, so status shift is absent. The final step onto the sand registers as earned because the star-stamp glow retroactively pays for her earlier refusal to answer, but the cost is more symbolic than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the punch-in-air gesture reconfigures Mira from passenger to agent with conceptual cost visible in the lantern-lit cove. Causal chain holds—because she stamped her own ticket years ago, therefore she can stamp the air now—though the ferry’s scrape against “unseen rocks” is a mild convenience to force reflection. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Veiled Ridgeway is evoked through tactile water, reed-labyrinth, and lantern-lined cove; micro-setting (the ticket punch’s glint) constrains attention and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to starlight and wet earth underfoot, mirroring Mira’s narrowed options. One minor slack: “shoreline lullaby” is repeated without sonic detail, so the promised auditory tone stays generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find unused courage”—is signaled early and tightens once when the star stamp glows, forcing the final stance crystallization. No reversal or external antagonist is needed under Accumulative lens; the deepening of ambient light and lantern chorus suffices to raise cost. Price is legible but intellectual (she “doesn’t feel like a passenger”), not a tangible forfeiture, keeping it below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: courage as traversal rather than possession, paid off when the punch leaves no physical mark yet reweights identity. Subtext lives in Elias’s indirect route and the hooded chorus—figures of those who never crossed—creating resonance without moralizing. Final image avoids explicit thesis; the star-burn brighter sky reconfigures prior material with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is selective—she notices water smell, star glint, sand suction—never ventriloquizing Elias. Syntax breathes with scene tempo: longer cadence during lull, clipped questions at cove arrival. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet narrative idiom remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, metaphor, and interior shift. One paraphrase loop—“step forward, then another”—is minor. Figurative control holds; “water lapped…like a shoreline lullaby” is the only mixed metaphor but does not muddle closure. Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The after-life ferry riff is familiar, yet the star-stamped ticket punch as portable key re-weights the trope. Indirect route through reed-labyrinth feels specific to this world, not generic underworld. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist—but execution is confident and coherent, giving freshness without gimmickry.</comment>
