<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity and grief are vivid, but the sister-memory reveal is delivered in a single expository lump rather than dramatized micro-choices; the final reach is reflex, not a value-laden decision, so the cost feels adjacent rather than internal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: missing stars → return → ring re-opens → sister’s half-presence; the gap of forgotten summer is the pivot that lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (“You took too long”). Orientation is clean inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sunken greenhouse and salt-rotted hulls are tactile throughout; the fairy ring itself acts as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. One broken pane shattering at closure recharges the initial drowned image—meets 9+ gate by charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memory—tightens when star-map proves the ring is active; escalation is one-way but coherent. Cost is felt in sister’s translucent accusation; options narrow to “too late,” satisfying lens. No second beat, so stays below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of irretrievable time emerges through ring-as-door and star-absence; no moralizing. Final line’s fading glow reweights earlier luminescence with irrevocable loss, achieving CR. Ambiguity lingers without confusion—meets 9+ resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s sensory funnel; diction (“metallic tang,” “tide pulling away”) is character-bound and rhythmic. No head-hop; compression in star-study paragraph is taught early and paid off. Voice modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“constellation breadcrumb trail”—but it clears before climax. Final image is uncluttered, high-density. Within 9+ band except for single figurative slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fairy-ring portal is familiar, but drowned orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is fresh; star-map as memory trigger reconfigures trope. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present but not structurally radical—holds below 8.5.</comment>
