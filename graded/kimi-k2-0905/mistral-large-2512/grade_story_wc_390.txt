<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is embodied (cold burn, trembling fingers) and drives the final plunge; the scavenger’s shift from defiance to awe externalizes the key’s cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the renunciation (“learning to carry the weight”) is earned. Yet the brother-storm regret is only asserted, not dramatized, so the absolution feels slightly under-causal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: key sings → disruptor tactic → lighthouse counter → ice break → hand-in-water choice with visible cost. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no penalty. Closure is Earned Stasis: he keeps the guilt-bearing key, pulse now “quiet, steady,” cost legible in the still-shaking hand.</comment>

<comment>Frost-cracked pier, brass resonator, whalebone harness—selective sensory triplet that constrains movement and tactics. The lighthouse’s sonic beam is not backdrop but tool, turned into weapon mid-scene. Drift-ice marina’s groan mirrors Elias’s teeth-ache, integrating setting with physiology. Micro-setting (wrist-mounted dial, tuning fork on ice) directly enables the vibrational duel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—key must not reach scavenger—tightens when Elias risks drowning to seize it. One meaningful reversal: scavenger’s harmonic match collapses under lighthouse flood, forcing Elias’s hand-into-water gambit. Cost is immediate: frozen burn, audible scream, dock-edge suspension. Guilt-as-weapon concept amplifies personal stake without diffusing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—absolution as learned burden, not erasure—emerges through key’s cold burn and final pulse, never sermonized. Scavenger’s ear-blood and Elias’s trembling hand embody the price, letting silence after lighthouse hum carry resonance. Final line reweights earlier “ghost in the cold” image: breath is no longer spectral, implying life-with-weight. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in steady pulse that must keep beating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—brass dials, salt-crusted crates, key-whisper—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into lunges and gasps, mirroring cardiac rhythm. Scavenger’s single line of dialogue carries subtext (“Too late, keeper”) that externalizes her defeat. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy sustained through tactile verbs: tightened, brushed, trembled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean: no scaffold, no synonym loops; figurative language (ice sang, bones creak) appears sparingly and only when it advances sensory stakes. Sentence rhythm accelerates across dock sprint, then cuts to single-word heartbeat lines under water. One mixed metaphor risk—“azure coat blending into twilight” beside frost—passes quickly without muddling causality. Final paragraph earns quiet cadence after sonic crescendo, satisfying read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sonic-guilt artifact fused with lighthouse acoustics feels fresh, not re-skinned magic item. Drift-ice marina as resonant battleground repurposes nautical grief into speculative engine. Risk taken: weaponized regret that doesn’t erase but recalibrates, avoiding redemption cliché. Yet “vault of unspoken regrets” and “Great Thaw of ’92” flirt with lore placeholders; specificity of key’s 1912 counterpart could push originality higher.</comment>
