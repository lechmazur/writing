<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s calm indexer persona is vivid, but interiority stays safe—no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The instant recognition of “Veyne” lands as convenient knowledge rather than destabilizing identity. Micro-choices (kneel, close ledger, smile) are present yet cost-free; the ending stance feels pre-decided. Earned stasis is asserted, not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamp becomes ancestral key, re-indexing his life. Causal chain is thin—ledger coincidence supplies the crucial name without prior tension or jeopardy. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Cost is conceptual (inheritance revealed) but not felt; the blackout lifting is external grace, not causal price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Submerged library filters lantern-light into shifting “dappled” patterns that mirror Elias’s wavering certainty; salt-slick bindings and warped ledger tactically slow page-turns, buying discovery time. Micro-setting (stamp in palm) closes the story with charged poise. One-line weather cue (“blackout ended”) is external and un-integrated, a minor drop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trace the stamp—signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: ledger reveals crest + name. No narrowing options or trade-off; discovery is happenstance, not agency. Cost is absent; blackout neither complicates nor prices the reveal. Single tightening satisfies short-form minimum but stays modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through indexer reclaiming his own past, but subtext stays verbal (“the past was indexing him”). Image of serpent-and-moon reappears without new inflection. Final smile signals acceptance yet lacks ironic aftershock. Resonance is present, not piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—“tranquilly perceptive”—colors every observation with cataloguing diction. Rhythm stays controlled, slightly monotonous, matching librarian temperament. No dialogue to test voice distinction; prose voice coherent and unobtrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare and purposeful. Minor overuse of participial openers (“casting dappled shadows”) softens peak beat. High information density; only hairline slips keep it under 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sunken-library-as-archive is fresh; family crest twist feels inevitable yet not groundbreaking. Risk level moderate—quiet lyric rather than structural gamble. Specificity of indexer’s tactile cataloguing rescues premise from generic ruin. Could swap stamp for seal or signet with little fracture, limiting upper band.</comment>
