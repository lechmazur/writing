<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—obsession vs. the fear of inheriting another’s despair—are dramatized in the mirror-handling beats; the final refusal to erase the cracks is earned. Interiority stays concrete, but “helix-minded” remains a label never embodied in syntax or action. Emotional cost is felt, yet the micro-choice hierarchy could be sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces repair, accepting the woman’s fractured memory as-is, with the canyon’s hush confirming cost. Causal chain—find → glimpse → risk of possession → refusal—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Canyon moonlight, mirror fractures, and dust are filtered through Lena’s tactile attention; the wall’s “held breath” pressure guides the final angle adjustment. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single kneeling move. The mirror-as-micro-setting constrains the climax, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to resurrect or preserve the broken dream—tightens once the woman’s face appears; refusal forecloses the restoration path. Escalation is textural: fracture-glow intensifies, canyon whisper deepens, risk of possession grows. Cost is legible in the mirror’s chill and her wavering breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory’s value lies in its wounds, not its repair. Subtext carries in the cracked constellations and the whispered “You don’t have to fix it.” No moralizing; the final image reweights prior motifs. Ambiguity lingers—will she carry the woman’s despair?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s perceptual filter; synaptic-plasticity diction stays within her lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences under moonlight, clipped fragments when the face flickers. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinct voice texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and concept. One paraphrase loop (“weight of forgotten things” echoed in “weight of it familiar”) mildly dulls. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Clean grammar and precise punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Archeologist of abandoned dreams” is fresh; the synaptic-plasticity memory-transfer via fractured relic feels novel yet grounded. Canyon-as-memory-reservoir trope is familiar, but the refusal to restore gives it new inflection. Risk is moderate; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
