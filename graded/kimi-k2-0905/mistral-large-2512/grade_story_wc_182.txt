<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is dramatized—she bargains, tracks, reads shelves for lies—but her interiority drifts into label-speak (“realized some lessons…”) at the exact beat where contradictory impulses should collide with her sister. The time traveler’s panic is vivid yet never complicates Elara’s stance; their statuses remain parallel, not crucible. Closure cost is present yet generalized to “we,” softening the personal price she must pay for reopening the wound. Still, micro-choices (diary page as coin, fingertip on shifting spine) keep her alive and individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: backward watch → lost key → negotiation → door → sister. Orientation is swift and spatially legible. The final image reconfigures stakes—sister alive, library real—carrying clear conceptual cost: the path back is unspoken, time may be irreversible. One minor causality fuzz: the map “dissolves when read” yet is later “crumbling” in hand; the rule inconsistency nicks credibility but does not rupture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mountain-bookstore is tactile: spines like trees, air “humming with panic,” shelves that rearrange when unobserved. The diary functions as micro-setting, its pressed petals guiding moves. These environmental rules constrain tactics—Elara uses plant lore to decode shelf shifts—charging the final door image. A hairline slip: we never feel temperature or bodily fatigue despite descent “deeper than roots,” keeping it just shy of top band.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—find sister / recover key—tightens once: renegotiation turns helper into co-victim, foreclosing solo escape. Pressure escalates through shelf movement and ink-fade, costs ink, map, certainty. The sister’s sudden presence supplies the reversal, but the price (lost return route? aging?) is implied rather than felt on-page, capping intensity. Still, agency remains Elara’s; coincidence complicates but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “unlearned lessons” emerges through image—books of regrets, backward watch—rather than statement. Final tableau reframes earlier plant linguistics as living memory, suggesting knowledge and grief must be reread, not archived. Ambiguity is fruitful: reader weighs whether reunion is salvation or deeper loss. Avoids moralizing, though the sister’s first line (“You came”) flirts with sentimental echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Elara’s botanist perception: “titles shifting like living things,” “second heartbeat” of diary. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under threat, mirroring pulse. Time traveler’s diction is wild yet distinct, never ventriloquizing her precision. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sustains through final door push.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “jagged with the spines of books,” “off-key note in an unheard symphony.” Figurative layering stops before clutter; each image advances mood or rule. One paraphrase loop—“library of unlearned lessons was real…library took her”—repeats noun without new pressure. Otherwise rhythm modulates, sentences vary, and no filter-verb stacks dull the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Combines botanic philology with Möbius-library, a fresh synthesis. Backward-running pocket watch and dissolving map feel inevitable inside this paper-mountain. The “bookstore deeper than any root system” literalizes Elara’s scholarly obsession, transforming trope into personal stakes. Risk is present; concept commits fully without winking at reader.</comment>
