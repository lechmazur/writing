<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s mournful-eager caretaker persona is embodied in the leaf-blower baton; the trembling hands and dropped pull-cord at the end show a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“tended to them like a gardener to withered blooms”) and avoids label-speak. The only slip is the off-stage accident backstory—thin causal grounding for his obsession—but the on-page micro-choices under girl/mother gaze earn the smile and laughter, so the arc lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the blower’s death and dropped handle create Charged Poise—options reweighted, laughter released, Elias walking away unpaid. Causal chain holds: off-key drone → family listening → girl steps → smile → mother laughs; each beat is a because/therefore. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt (fuel gone, anonymity lost), satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel’s acoustic warp is not backdrop—it forces Elias to embrace “imperfections” as tactic and charges the final echo of laughter. Leaf-blower’s weight, sputter, and dropped handle serve as micro-setting that constrains the last beat. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“wind spiraled deeper”). Only the household interior is sketched from afar, but the tunnel-as-instrument earns its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens once: silence → off-key song → girl steps → laugh bubbles; each escalation is legible under causal lens. No reversals needed; one meaningful tightening suffices. Agency is Elias’s angle-tweak and final relinquishment; cost is the empty tank and exposed identity. Pressure stays coherent; coincidence (girl appears) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—art’s power to re-voice the unspoken—emerges through action, not statement: the blower’s drone becomes lullaby, the smile becomes first syllable. Subtext lives in silence between mother and child, broken by off-key wind. Final image of laughter echoing “like a symphony” reweights the premise without moralizing. No motif grafted late; the tunnel’s song is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s musician’s ear (“notes curled,” “wind was off-key”). Syntax is lyrical yet controlled; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. The perceptual signature—conductor hearing orchestration in garden tools—remains consistent and specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and musical; sentences vary in length to mimic crescendo/decrescendo. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“macerated into silence”). Opening and closing lines bookend with echo motif. One minor adverb (“mournfully eager”) is told, but it is later embodied, so the infraction is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—symphony conductor wielding a leaf blower as healing instrument—is fresh yet grounded. The inversion of high-art tool into yard-machine feels inevitable, not gimmicky, because acoustics and gardener metaphor are seeded early. Risk taken with off-key sound as cure pays off emotionally. No derivative template detected; specificity of Elias’s ear keeps it singular.</comment>
