<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eira’s interiority is vivid—her breath, the fossil biting her palm, the heat-device flare—but the final surrender (“I don’t know how to answer”) is voiced rather than dramatized; we feel awe, not the contradictory tug that would make the fusion an earned cost. Still, her sensory-mapper identity shapes every beat, and the fossil’s burn supplies a tactile micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cave swallows her, the fossil pulses, the air smells of pre-storm rain—an undeniable before/after with conceptual cost (she is now “voice” not observer). Causal chain holds: fossil dreams → cave warmth → entity → fusion; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“mouth of the coastal cave network”), waiving any disorientation penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coastal cave is more than postcard: calcite fractures, bioluminescent mist, fissure that parts “like lips” all constrain her movement and meter her fear. The elm fossil micro-setting charges the final image when it glows, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays tight—salt air, dripping water, wrist-device colors—filtered through her mapper bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming the cave’s voice—tightens once: from mapping the unknown to being possessed by it. The device shattering is a visible price, but escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal or tactical loss beyond the fusion itself. Sufficient for this length, yet the cost could have bitten earlier to shape tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of translation-as-surrender emerges through image, not thesis: the mapper who externalizes sensation ends internalizing the cave’s pressure. Fossil-as-bridge reweights from relic to conduit, offering resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; the final scent of rain is an open, charged answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Eira’s perceptions; syntax flexes from lyrical (“light fractured through calcite like broken glass”) to compressed under stress (“her pulse hammered”). No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat. The voice carries a faint archaic tinge that suits the last-human mood without slipping into pastiche.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: sentence length varies, metaphors stay precise, no scaffold loops. Minor overwrought line—“forgotten teeth” crumbling towers—survives because it’s brief and early. Information density high; each line advances atmosphere or stakes. Clean copy, no simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-human sensory-mapper meeting a lithic entity is fresh, yet the “become the voice” arc echoes familiar possession tropes; specificity of mapper tools and fossil reweighting rescues it from template. Risk taken in lyrical surrender rather than physical showdown pays off. Could push further if the entity’s logic felt less conveniently benevolent.</comment>
