<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s gentle ethos is embodied in tactile micro-choices (steady breath, trembling fingers), and the poacher betrayal tilts his worldview with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the climactic renunciation—“I lost the whole illusion”—edges toward label-speak, blunting the contradiction that should power Earned Stasis. Still, the chameleon-tail trim crystallizes a new, harder gentleness, satisfying the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the trimmed tail and the first notebook stroke reconfigure Elias’s stance under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost (“didn’t reach his eyes”). Causality is clean—betrayal → shattered trust → altered craft. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props. A hairline slip: the poacher’s off-stage vanishing slightly dilutes the persistent constraint that could have sharpened final tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mist, lamp-glow, and glass-roof stars filter through Elias’s selective attention, narrowing to the chameleon’s scaled body that literally constrains the final action. The workshop’s preserved specimens mirror his emotional stasis and later pivot—jars watch him write, recharging the setting. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and smell over visual cataloguing, keeping density tight. Environment directly enables the tail-surgery beat that triggers closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protective compassion vs. self-protection—tightens when Elias abandons adhesive for the trim, a visible trade-off. Pressure escalates via pattern-break: gentle reconstruction turns to controlled amputation, reweighting the stake under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page (shorter tail, new notebook). The off-stage poacher prevents a final external confrontation, keeping escalation just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “shedding illusions” emerges through the tail trim and notebook restart, not thesis statements. The chameleon’s regrowth metaphor reweights at closure without moralizing. Subtext in Elias’s tremor and empty smile carries the betrayal cost more than any declaration. Final image offers resonant ambiguity: stillness now contains wary resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature leans on tactile precision and natural-history lexicon (“emerald scales dull,” “fine brush”). Syntax breathes with longer reflective sentences then tightens during the cut, mirroring emotional modulation. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are minimal and motive-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is selective (mist “curled like smoke”) and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional adjective pairs (“quietly vivid”) flirt with excess but stay within POV lexicon. Clause variety and paragraph cuts propel momentum; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conservation-craftsman meets betrayal is familiar, yet the chameleon-tail as metonym for truncated idealism offers fresh inflection. Shedding layers replaces clichéd “rebuilding,” and the glass-roof workshop under stars particularizes the milieu. Risk is moderate; concept stays coherent. Could push further into the poacher’s methodology or Elias’s past for deeper freshness.</comment>
