<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—find beauty in the unfinished—stays consistent, but the only micro-choice is “played again.” The bowl cue is passive (dipped, listened) so no contradictory impulse is enacted. Closure reaches Earned Stasis, yet the cost is ambient, not personal. Characterization clear, not stellar under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical looping of music → echo → fish → silence re-cast as anticipation. One tightening beat (the answering hum) reweights the stake, but no option is foreclosed; she simply leaves. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise, yet lacks visible cost. Orientation clean; structure holds but stays single-register.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse glass and shipwreck ribs are tactile, acoustic, and mirrored in the violin’s resonance; environment shapes the sound experiment and final image. Sensory layer selective (sound, light, damp) without tourist clutter. No spatial drift; bodies/props tracked. Setting does not constrain a second tactical choice, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: wrest song from post-catastrophe silence. Pressure intensifies once via the underwater hum, but escalation is observational, not tactical; no trade-off or resource lost. Stakes remain aesthetic, felt but not tested against a counter-want. Sufficient for short-form but thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in fragments—emerges through acoustic imagery and unfinished architecture; no thesis stated. Subtext carries in the bowl’s inherited silence and the echo that replaces human audience. Final image reconfigures silence as anticipatory, supplying resonance. Avoids tidy moral, lands oblique hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s auditory perceptions; diction lyrical yet concrete (“sound spiraling,” “scales like scattered coins”). Syntax lengthens and contracts with musical phrases, no head-hop. No dialogue to test. Voice distinct, sustained, tonally coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is musical, mostly controlled; occasional modifier stacks (“waterlogged air,” “chronic hush”) flirt with excess but pattern is taught early. No loops, no scaffold, metaphors consistent. One mixed image—“ribs like ribs”—mild clang. High density, clean grammar, strong final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse as echo-chamber is fresh; merges eco-collapse with acoustic archaeology. Post-burn rainforest & shipwrecks skirt cliché by serving acoustics, not spectacle. Core action—playing violin to unbind drowned sound—non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural risk, but angle feels particular.</comment>
