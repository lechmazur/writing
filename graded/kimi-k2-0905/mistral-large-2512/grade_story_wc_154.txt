<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—returning to a forbidden zone while numbed by anesthetic—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices: scratching the cast, pressing coral to stone, aligning plaster with the boy. Each action externalizes her need to convert private trauma into shared language, and the final smile costs her the safety of detachment. The boy mirrors her without becoming a device, giving the relationship a crucible that shifts both states. Interiority stays embodied; no label-speak intrudes even under drugs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the aligned casts and glowing “Home” reconfigure fear into communal meaning without dissolving danger. The coral-key logic is taught early (“remembers the shape of fear”) and paid off when the fragments pulse in unison, forcing a visible cost—her exile from evacuation safety. Causal chain holds: coral call → decrypt cast → shared glow → stance crystallization. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is not postcard scenery; its cold marble and ghostly arches physically force Lena to crouch, press plaster, and bridge vertical distance to the boy. The cast itself becomes micro-setting—its ridges, graphite, and coordinates constrain her fingers and decode the next move. Sensory hierarchy obeys anesthetic haze: edges blur, temperature dominates, coral heat registers against thigh. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from balustrade to courtyard to final touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—graft new meaning onto old wounds—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when decryption reveals Voss coordinates, foreclosing the option to remain a detached observer. The coral’s pulse escalates stakes from personal talisman to shared transmitter, forcing a public gesture that could expose her to militia. One meaningful turn: boy’s matching fragment converts parallel anxiety into joint agency, price = loss of anonymity. Cost is visible: she ignores medical exile and accepts permanent displacement for the word “Home.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring grafting image—casts, coral, language—all attempting to splice broken pieces into living tissue. No moral is stated; instead, the final glow reweights prior smudges as communal cartography. Subtext resides in silence: the absent Voss, the missing mamas, the unmentioned war remain holes that charge the scene. Ambiguity is productive: “Home” may be delusion or blueprint, but the cost of believing is real.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s drug-flattened perception: syntax lengthens under anesthetic, then fractures into short beats as coral heats. Diction—“palimpsest,” “fractal,” “lotus-hearted”—belongs to a translator who thinks in etymologies; no POV leakage into the boy. Rhythm modulates with pressure: languid opening clauses tighten to single-sentence gestures at climax. No filter-verb stacks; every image is filtered through skin, plaster, or mist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—e.g., “She scratched at the smudged notes… coordinates, a time, a name” simultaneously reveals plot, character compulsion, and tactile action. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the grafting motif without mixed vehicles. One clause of overwritten mist imagery (“curling like ghostly fingers”) survives without muddling causality. Final line breathes, giving cadence shift appropriate to Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The brain-coral-as-memory-medium trope is refreshed by treating it as cryptographic substrate rather than mere talisman; the cast-cipher grafts medical waste onto map-making. Risk taken: anesthetic haze could have dissolved causality, yet decryption beat keeps agency intact. Specificity—disputed atoll, graphite ridges, Voss coordinates—anchors the concept in geopolitical reality. Without these exact elements the ending glow would collapse into hallucination.</comment>
