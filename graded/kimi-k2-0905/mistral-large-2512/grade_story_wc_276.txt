<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s cool-headedness is shown through steady breath and calm under cosmic chaos, but interior contradiction is only implied, not dramatized. The rail spike as keepsake hints at back-story motive yet never complicates his present choice; the final “voicing silence” feels symbolic rather than a paid-for renunciation. No micro-choice visibly costs him, so the Earned Stasis is atmospheric, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the single clear note and resettled stars reconfigure the world’s pattern with Kael as conduit; cost is implied in the warm spike and his lone exhale. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern break → density → stillness. Orientation is swift; no因果 gaps. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Black sand, silver reeds, and the rail spike’s rust are tactile and POV-filtered. The garden’s transliterating reeds constrain action—he pulls away, then follows their dissonance—charging the final silence. Spatial track is clean; no world-rule drift. Micro-setting (spike) alters tactics by becoming offering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the goddess’s echo—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: sky chaos → garden shriek → void silence, forcing zigzag stance. Cost is conceptual (he becomes vessel) but only lightly felt. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal, yet option space narrows to silence or failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening as surrender emerges through image, not statement. The feral lullaby motif evolves from threat to transfiguration, reweighted in the final note. Ambiguity lingers—was he chosen or consumed—without moralizing. Particulars carry universality; no symbolic graft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptions; diction is lean, maritime, mythic. Rhythm modulates: long breaths vs staccato stars. No dialogue, so voice is carried by syntax and metaphor—“ribs of a sleeping giant” is apt, not purple. Compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“void that swallowed noise” serves immediacy. Zero paraphrase loops; information density high. One clause-level scaffold: “not with his ears, but with his bones” is acceptable amplification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mythic astronomy plus emotion-transliterating reeds synthesize into fresh texture. Sleepwalking constellations are not mere backdrop; they fracture pattern and enable the silence catch. Risk is taken with cosmic scale in flash fiction; coherence holds. Could not swap spike or garden without collapsing logic.</comment>
