<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is anchored in the tactile ritual with the sea glass; every beat of stacking stones is a micro-choice that externalizes his need to “bottle safety.” The final surrender of the glass to the spiral shows a visible cost—he leaves behind the last fragment of his daughter—earning the shift from isolation to communion. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak intrudes. The only limit is that the anonymous correspondent remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias relights the lamp and abandons the talisman, crystallizing a communal custodianship that reweights his earlier solitude. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each note and stone accretes until the final pattern compels the act. The cost—relinquishing the sea glass—is on the page and irreversible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lantern room’s soot-streaked glass, iron stairs, and rattling panes are filtered through Elias’s mariner gaze; every detail is touched or heard. The spiral of stones functions as micro-setting that literally rewrites the room’s language and constrains his final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to chill, flame, and the click of pebbles under pressure. Environment is not backdrop; it is the dialogue partner that forces his reply.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias re-engage with the living world instead of merely servicing its dead beacons? Pressure tightens when the stone syntax demands an answer; his three-plus-two reply forecloses the option of passive reception. Cost is visible—he sacrifices the relic that insulated him from grief. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-turn, but the final lamp-lighting crystallizes stakes with undeniable price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: safety is not a beam you maintain but a language you keep speaking to strangers in the dark. The sea glass migrates from private reliquary to public offering, reweighting “light” from mechanical fixture to shared vigil. No character moralizes; the spiral of stones and the final note carry the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers—who is the other stacker?—yet the emotional aftereffect is precise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual signature—ropes, tide-rhythm, salt-smooth glass. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, then fractures into short clauses when the stones shift. No head-hopping; the anonymous voice exists only in italicized notes whose diction remains spare and maritime. The final sentence lands with quiet inevitability because the voice has earned the right to speak for every keeper who ever waited.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “luminescent ache,” “ghost of light”—figurative bursts are rationed, never stacked. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, action, or interiority. Opening line anchors stakes and tone; final line releases without exposition. Occasional adjectival flourish (“bruised twilight”) is justified by POV’s poetic reticence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The stone-dialogue trope is refreshed by treating the lighthouse itself as a grammar that must be answered; supply-skipper POV is rarely foregrounded in ghost-beacon tales. Risk is taken by refusing to reveal the correspondent, yet the pattern teaches early and closure remains legible. Specificity of maritime chores and tidal cadence keeps the world from feeling generic. Not quite a 9 because the core moves—anonymous notes, stacked cairns—are familiar; the inflection is sharp but not transformative.</comment>
