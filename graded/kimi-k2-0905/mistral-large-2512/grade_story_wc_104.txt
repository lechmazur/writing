<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s shift from captive to collaborator is sketched through embodied beats—raw wrists, lighter chains at dawn—but her interior contradiction stays summary. Vey remains cipher; his refusal to fight the scavenger is choice without visible internal cost. Micro-choices (how much seed to take) show hierarchy of values, yet the final “weight of hope” is asserted, not dramatized. Enough specificity to feel individual, but one more beat of flawed hesitation would earn 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: arrow warning → key map → vault access → dawn departure, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—locking the vault and walking toward a green future reweights prior captivity with conceptual cost (“they’ll find it eventually”). Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final sentence: chains feel lighter, hope already exacting its price. Missing the 9-band only because the scavenger beat resolves by brandished arrow rather than protagonist decision.</comment>

<comment>Carnival detritus is tactile—warped piano lid, rusted rides, cotton-candy kiosk—each detail filtered through Mira’s risk-calibrated attention. Micro-setting (piano bench) literally constrains tactics: key order dictates which locks open. Spatial choreography is flawless: counter → midway → Ferris-wheel base → staircase. One more sensory echo (smell of rust mixing with seed dust) would push 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—live to plant—signaled early and sharpened by “not too much” sack limit. Mid-story scavenger encounter raises cost of failure; wall-collapse clock tightens final descent. Agency sits with Mira’s seed-cupping gesture that accepts finite load. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word span; visible price is the locked vault itself—future access foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience vs. hoarding emerges through seed-selection beat rather than statement. Subtext in scavenger’s spit: regimes fall, but territorial claims survive. Final image of lighter chains reweights liberation as burden of stewardship—nice CR. Theme skirts overt thesis, though “time for growing” edges toward echo; still, ambiguity lingers about who “they” are, keeping moral space open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perceptual sieve: she notices clinks, smells popcorn, gauges Vey by gesture. Syntax tightens under pressure—“breath hitched” vs. reflective earlier cadence. No dialogue, so voice carries through rhythmic, tactile diction. One filter-verb cluster (“she understood”) could trim, but texture remains character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “skeletal silence,” “drought-resistant life.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (vault as monstrous mouth) and serve stakes. One mixed register slip—“conceptual repricing” level abstraction in “weight of hope”—keeps this south of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse seed-heist is fresh, yet piano-bench cipher and grass-wire arrow feel novel integrations. Tropes (last vault, benevolent chain-breaker) are tilted by musical lock-picking and scavenger standoff. Risk is moderate: lyric compression over explosive set-piece. Specificity of carnival ruin and seed taxonomy lifts it above generic dystopia, but needs one more unforeseeable turn for 8.5+.</comment>
