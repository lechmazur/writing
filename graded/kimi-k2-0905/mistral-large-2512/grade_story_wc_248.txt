<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession is vivid—her fingers on the frayed tapestry, breath hitching at the gouged eyes—yet her pivot from hunter to ally arrives in a single line of dialogue (“Then let me help”) without visible interior friction; the cost of that surrender is asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the key locks, not opens, and the tapestry’s final glow reweights every prior burn. Causal chain holds—each library fire exposes the next breadcrumb—though the Ember Scribe’s off-stage arrival inside the archive is a mild teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Scorched parchment, toppled bookshelf, half-melted painting—each sensory shard is filtered through Elara’s hunter gaze and guides her next move. The archive itself becomes a tactile map; the final mural is spatially tracked and charges the lock-turn image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the arsonist’s truth—tightens when the promise is revealed as a seal. One meaningful deepening: fire as revelation, not destruction, narrows Elara’s moral options and forces alliance. Cost is conceptual (world-abandonment guilt) rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The theme—knowledge vs. oblivion, abandonment vs. responsibility—emerges through vandalized faces and ash, never sermonized. The final image of the turning lock lets the reader reprice the “promise” without a moral tagline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s analytically intuitive filter; perceptual signature is consistent—she traces patterns, notes soot stains, hears metal on stone. Ember Scribe’s dialogue carries volcanic cadence (“laugh like embers settling”) distinct from her cooler observations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrasing (“volcanic tenderness”) risks register drift but remains anchored in the Scribe’s voice. No artifacts touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Arsonist-as-liberator flips the detective trope; the key-that-locks reframes a classic quest object. Civilization self-sealing via cultural self-vandalism feels fresh, not checklist quirky. Risk is taken and paid off in the final lock-turn.</comment>
