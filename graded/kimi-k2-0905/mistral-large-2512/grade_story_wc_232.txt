<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is evocative—his fingertip on the chart, the hollow of inherited duty—but the decisive pivot (“the promise… suddenly felt hollow”) is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; the earned cost of abandoning the shop is legible yet still abstract, keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: chip inheritance → ant trail → door recognition → insertion. The creek-rise clock tightens once, the chip-click is a clear Decisive Change with felt opportunity-cost (“for the first time in years… hope”). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat is clean, though the ants-as-mechanism is slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Portolan chart, velvet drawer, bioluminescent blossoms—each sensory layer is filtered through Elias’s map-trained eye. The rising creek and glowing cavern constrain the final approach; the chip-as-key micro-setting charges the door image. One minor spatial blur: “tunnel opened into a vast cavern” skips intermediate distance, but clarity recovers before the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inheritance vs. self-chosen path—signaled early; pressure tightens when water reaches ankles and the chip slots home. Agency is present (he pries the board, inserts the chip), with visible forfeiture of the shop-bound life. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; cost is more conceptual than visceral, capping the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of cartographic erasure vs. lived exploration emerges through chart→door progression; no explicit thesis. The final image—ants leading through a glowing doorway—reconfigures “maps” from ink to motion. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the emotional aftershock is moderate because Elias’s inner shift is summarized rather than embodied in a last beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual map: coastline “color of old tea,” chip grooves “etched with tiny, precise ridges.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under choice; no filter-verb clusters. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction alone—sufficiently idiosyncratic to avoid generic antique-shop cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences vary in length and opening. One scaffold loop: “their silent stories more reliable than the people who occasionally wandered in, then out again” restates the solitude beat. No mixed metaphors, no register drift. The final paragraph’s rhythmic lift supports the glimmer without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing letterpress tech, colonial cartography, and bioluminescent speleology yields a fresh composite; the chip-as-key trope is familiar but justified by generational print lineage. Ant-guided quest nods to fairy-tale yet feels organic to Elias’s childhood mapping instinct. Risk is moderate; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>
