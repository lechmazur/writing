<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—listening vs. acting—are dramatized in the rope-pull; the near-catastrophic mis-read costs her certainty and the villagers their safety, a felt price. Interiority stays concrete (“hands pressed to the flagstones”) and avoids label-speak. The switch-beat is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure. Flaw: the priests remain off-page, so status dynamics are inferred, not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she swaps wires → storm turns → she must re-pull; the final toll reconfigures her stance with visible cost (“she had been wrong”). Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses pure listening, accepts perpetual vigil, and the bell’s vibration through her bones is the on-page price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The frayed, copper-wired rope functions as micro-setting: its texture guides her kneeling, its fraying mirrors institutional decay, and its final vibration charges the closing image. Ozone-scented thin air and cloud-serpents are selective, not tourist catalog. Weather shifts causally affect her choice (“the storm had changed its mind”). Spatial choreography is clean: rope pools, she kneels, stands, re-kneels; bell hangs above.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—village safety vs. her epistemic ethic—tightens when the storm’s voice flips from “weeping” to “world splitting open,” forcing a costly reversal. Agency drives escalation: her earlier sabotage narrows options, then her re-pull pays the price. Coincidence (storm’s sudden turn) complicates, not resolves. Cost is legible: wrong call almost kills, bell’s toll becomes audible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—listening as responsible action, not passive purity—emerges through the rope, the mis-read sky, and the final tremor in her bones; no explicit thesis states it. The ending’s Charged Poise reweights “listening” to include risking noise when stakes demand. Ambiguity lingers: she will keep listening, but now knows silence can kill. Avoids tidy moral; resonance is tactile, not abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter: “clouds coiled like sleeping serpents” is her metaphor, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments when lightning cracks, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; priests’ motives remain opaque as they are to her. Diction stays within her artisanal lexicon (“grain of the cathedral bell rope”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive: “She had favored listening over noise, and it had nearly cost her everything” compresses beat and consequence. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“cloud-serpents”) and paid off in storm-turn. One mixed metaphor possible—“rain lashing…like a thousand whips”—but does not muddle causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Freshens the familiar “weather-prophet vs. bureaucracy” by locating moral stakes in a single frayed rope and a single mis-pronounced sky. Storm-reading via copper-wire repairs and microclimate logs is specific, not generic oracle. The switch sabotage flips usual techno-skepticism: older bell trumps newer siren. Risk taken: quiet almost kills, yet quiet is not abandoned—earned complexity rather than cautionary cliché.</comment>
