<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—dead-language murmurs, tactile memory of the foghorn—but the pivot from archivist to listener is declared more than dramatized; the final “he understood” lands without a preceding micro-choice that costs him anything visible. The pomegranate omen is sensuous yet external; we never feel him weigh abandoning the Archives’ mandate against his new vocation, so the change feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each wax-cylinder capture layers density until the final playback reweights silence as invitation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—orchard breath + city grief archived inside one warm cylinder—cost is the stain on his palm and the foreclosed option of ever again hearing the city as noise rather than voice. Orientation is swift; the single time-shift to childhood is cued by tactile memory and paid off at the end, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Skyscraper-orchard is impossible yet instantly legible; roots-through-steel and hidden aquifers give it tactile physics. The phonograph horn angled “toward the sky” and the pomegranate that actually drips onto the wax are micro-setting objects that constrain the final recording and charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and low-frequency sound, matching the stake of listening rather than seeing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the city’s post-foghorn grief be archived?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when each new language recording risks incomprehensibility; the final playback chorus narrows his options to perpetual listener. Cost is legible: stained fingers, warm wax, and the implicit forfeiture of returning to mere transcription. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals are needed under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as vessel rather than void—emerges through the progression of recordings and the orchard’s witness; no character sermonizes. The pomegranate’s split seeds reprice the archival act as ingestion, not objectification, a conceptual shift that reverberates back through the wax cylinder. Ambiguity remains: is he prophet or parasite? The ending refuses to moralize, letting the image of red-stained hands carry the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, filtering perception through Elias’s linguistic ear: “words curling into the air like smoke.” Syntax lengthens with Old Sumerian cadence, then fractures into whispers on playback, mirroring the accumulative pressure. No head-hopping; the city’s voice is kept external until the final chorus, preserving focal discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence adds texture or stakes. Only minor scaffold: “He adjusted… He recited… He pressed” triplet mid-story, but the pattern breaks before the climax. Mixed metaphors are avoided; smoke-curl and fruit-surrender remain coherent within the sound-archive motif. No loops or register drift in the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Foghorn-as-emotional-fossil and wax-cylinder-as-ghost-trap synthesize vintage tech with urban grief in a way that feels specific rather than steampunk cosplay. The accidental prophecy angle avoids cliché by being retroactively discovered through playback, not portentously declared. Risk is taken in making the climax a listening act; the story commits fully to that quiet reversal, trusting the sensorial buildup to make it earned.</comment>
