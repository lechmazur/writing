<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirien’s curiosity is anchored in tactile ritual (salvaging the link, forging lenses), but interior contradiction is told rather than dramatized—“balancedly curious” is asserted, never embodied in a moment where risk and safety pull her simultaneously. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost (alien contact, political risk, personal exposure) is gestured at rather than felt on the page. Competence outweighs visible mistakes; the arc lands cleanly but without lingering asymmetry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: alien arrival → star-reading obsession → chain-link template → refractive tools → successful sighting → new horizon declared. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s boundary myth dissolves in a single charged image (“the stars are our new horizon”) with conceptual cost—deep culture must reinvent itself. Pressure tightens once, cleanly, though the beat where thecity elders accept the shift is compressed to a nod from Tael, muting the felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Benthic city rendered through lived detail—pressure-forged alloys, leviathan bone, ozone in the observatory—each note filtered by Lirien’s instructor gaze. The chain link functions as micro-setting: its cold, pitted curve constrains every tool design and thus the climax. Spatial choreography remains exact across trench lip, observatory dome, and drifting alien hull. One anchoring lapse: “frigid water” breath-mist contradicts submerged reality; waive as poetic license because it does not distort choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claim the stars for the deep—is signaled early and escalates through prototype failures and the night sighting that proves the method. Agency stays with Lirien: each lens iteration narrows options, materials dwindle, reputational risk grows. The tightening turn is the successful alignment of alien trajectory with her star chart; thereafter the city’s stance pivots. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—acceptable under hybrid lens, but a tangible forfeiture (lost tenure, exile threat) would have sharpened the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of horizon-expansion emerges through metallurgical metaphor: an old surface anchor is recast into instruments that breach the sky. No character verbalizes a moral; the final line re-weights “expand” from territorial to cosmic without sermon. Subtext flickers in Tael’s reluctant nod—tradition yielding not by argument but by demonstrated possibility. Resonance is solid yet stops just short of the uncanny reconfiguration needed for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lirien’s perceptual filter—bioluminescent visor glint, silt drift, thermal taste—creating a distinct rhythmic signature. Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, shortens under the alien ship’s pass-over, mirroring attention compression. No head-hop; elder Tael’s interior is left opaque, maintaining distance. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels like evaluator intrusion, but these are bracketed meta-notes, not story text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; sentences carry double duty—world facts plus emotional charge. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (anchor → path → star-chart). Minor overwrite: “sprawled across the ocean floor like a corpse of coral and steel” stacks two vehicles in opener, but pattern is taught and revisited, earning its keep. Closing sentence lands with punch and clear conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of deep-sea salvage astronomy feels fresh; anchor-chain optics is an inventive pivot that grows inevitably from setting physics. Alien presence remains inexplicable, avoiding anthropocentric negotiation clichés. Risk lies in compressing centuries-deep culture shift into one instructor’s prototype, yet the specificity of edge-geometry refraction keeps it from reading as metaphor-only. Not quite a 9 because the emotional stakes stay intellectually cool.</comment>
