<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile “mapping” of grief and Clara’s stillness create a credible crucible; the final micro-choice—etching the screw—pays the emotional cost of naming and reclaiming. Interiority stays concrete (“oil stains and the calluses”), avoiding label-speak. The parallel naming (“Elias”) lands as earned coincidence rather than contrivance because his prior absence-of-smell is already embodied. Only the grandmother remains off-stage, so relationship pressure is single-axis; still, the dyad’s status shift feels palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the etched screw becomes Charged Poise—meaning re-weighted, cost felt in the hush before the chime. Causal lens holds: because Clara brings the screw, therefore Elias can transpose his own loss into visible marks, foreclosing his exile from meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. One tightening beat suffices at this length. Cost is legible in the final image (“he didn’t feel like he was missing something. He was holding it”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shop’s drips and fogged glass act as micro-setting, constraining Elias’s reliance on touch and sound; the screw’s cold threads supply the tactile pivot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—smell absent, touch magnified. Weather lifts in sync with interior shift, but the causal direction stays character-ward, avoiding cheap pathetic fallacy. Specificity is selective and purposeful; no occupational over-exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can discarded relics be re-humanised?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Clara’s request forces Elias to test whether mapping absence can create presence. Agency is his decision to engrave; the reversible micro-turn narrows his stance from observer to co-author of memory. Cost is visible in the irrevocable marks on the screw and the exposed name-link he must carry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile metaphor: absence as generative space. Subtext resides in silence—the midwife tool that once ushered life now records death and continuity. No final-statement sermon; the chime’s clarity answers the question obliquely. Complexity is preserved: the boy’s survival is also a mother’s loss, left un-moralised.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—sound of drops, feel of brass. Syntax mirrors his meticulous calibration: long, sensory clauses interrupted by spare realisations (“Mapping. Not a place. A moment.”). No head-hopping; Clara’s interior is legible only through gesture and breath, respecting boundary. Voice feels singular, not committee-averaged.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language appears sparingly and never clusters in peak beats. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance cleanly. Minor filter verbs (“he thought of”) are voice-motivated and do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</comment>
<comment>Fusion of aromatherapist-turned-horologist with midwife relic offers fresh angle on post-loss repair narratives. The “humanize” imperative is literalised through metal engraving, transforming abstract desire into tactile art. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry. While the “naming after the craftsman” beat flirts with coincidence, prior thematic groundwork lets it feel fated rather than contrived.</comment>
