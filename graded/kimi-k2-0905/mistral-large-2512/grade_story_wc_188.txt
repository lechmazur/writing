<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—wanting to defy hopelessness yet unsure how—remains embodied in the tremor she feels while her fingers stay steady on the rag. The micro-choice to let the rag fall and burn out is a credible renunciation that costs her tool and signals acceptance of memory over spectacle. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the arc is interior and complete. The only minor slip is a brief diagnostic tag—“she understood then”—but it is immediately grounded by the warm stone pulse under her palm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing fortress and the silent figures reconfigure the stake from “defy hopelessness” to “remember it,” with the spent rag and her kneeling as visible cost. Causal chain holds: mosaic note → travel → ignition → revelation, each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation is clear by line 5 (“dusk,” “stone petals,” “kerosene rag knot”). Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. One transition—entry into the fortress—is legible and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fortress’s petal-shadows and the alcove torches constrain her path and supply the exact tool she must sacrifice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: fireworks designer notices wick brittleness, smoke weight, flame greed. Selective detail—no stars, damp earth, warm dais—mirrors her narrowing focus. Spatial choreography is clean from outer wall to dais; no floating bodies or lost anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“bring light where none is left”—tightens when she realizes the light’s purpose is remembrance, not rescue, forcing renunciation of her rag. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; the escalation is the ignition sequence that reveals the waiting figures and reframes the cost. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The price—loss of her crafted fire-tool and the emotional weight of summoned memory—is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory as the antidote to hopelessness, not its denial. The shift from spectacle (“fire that danced”) to memorial flame is earned through concrete action. Final image—fortress glowing like a lantern—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or abstraction intrudes; silence of the figures carries subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual signature—smell of kerosene, flame greed, stone pulse. Syntax mirrors fireworks rhythm: long fuse-like sentences build, then short sparks at ignition. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence is maintained through interior chant and sensory filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught—“stone petals,” “shadow tide”—paid off at closure. Sentence variety supports momentum without drumbeat monotony. One minor filter verb cluster (“she felt,” “she understood”) is forgiven under interior pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fireworks-designer-as-memory-keeper angle is fresh; trope of “light versus dark” is transformed into memorial rather than triumph. Specific occupational detail—wick brittleness, rag spin—grounds the concept. Risk in quiet ending pays off: no battle, only acknowledgement. Removing the rag or the mosaic note would collapse the arc, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
