<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and need to apologize are embodied in the ritual with the bottle; the micro-choice to breathe the scent rather than drink is a credible, character-specific renunciation that costs him the chance at full absolution. Interiority stays concrete—‘his breath shaky’, ‘pressed it to his lips’—and avoids label-speak. The only slip is the curator, who functions as a prompt-delivery device rather than pressure source, keeping relationship crucible off-stage. Still, the final stance is earned: he accepts imperfect miracle and walks away lighter, scar intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked bottle releases the apology-sound and a drop of amber that sizzles on the wire—visible, irreversible cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: because he hums the waltz and coils copper, the veil thins; because the bottle cracks, the apology escapes and forecloses any second attempt. Orientation is anchored within 120 words by scent, chapel damp, and curator dialogue. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the stake from ‘fix’ to ‘listen’.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The archive’s yellowed glue smell and the orchard’s held-breath hush are filtered through Elias’s professional nose and guilt, constraining his decision to stay until dawn. The perfume bottle acts as micro-setting: its cracked glass and sizzling drop physically shape the closure beat. Spatial choreography is tight—wire around neck, bottle on table, curator exits—no floating props. One hairline slip: ‘stone walls of the converted chapel’ is told, not sensed, but the error is sub-closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver overdue apology—tightens when the bottle’s crack makes the apology audible yet unreceivable, forcing acceptance of imperfection. Pressure escalates via sensory density: scent strengthens, light pulses, note trembles, drop burns—textural intensification that reweights the stake from ‘save’ to ‘witness’. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt and time-bound orchard felling supply coherent pressure. Cost is on-page: the fractured bottle and lost chance for fuller restitution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—imperfect miracles as listening, not fixing—emerges through the failed exorcism turned apology ritual, never sermonized. Subtext lives in the shift from ‘tuning a radio’ to ‘letting the river find another way’, reconfiguring Elias’s metaphysics without statement. Final image of chainsaws starting as he walks away reprices the orchard’s fall as collateral to his earned acceptance. No thematic echo or moralizing paragraph; resonance is carried by the sizzling drop and silence that follows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter—smell of glue, fogged lenses, trembling breath—syntax lengthens with memory, shortens under voltage. Metaphorical diction (‘static and spite’, ‘waltz that sounded like falling’) is consistent with his exorcist-radio idiom. No head-hopping; curator dialogue is sparse and utilitarian, preserving voice monopoly. Compression in the final paragraph—‘he didn’t look back’—earns its brevity after textured buildup.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lyrical long arcs to the staccato ‘Then, nothing.’ without mechanical patterning. Figurative language is selective: three metaphors across 750 words, each paying off (radio, river, orchard). No synonym loops or scaffold; ‘bottle’/‘perfume’ are reused with changing states. One mixed moment—‘scent of bergamot and lightning’ is abstract physics—but it is saved by sensory immediacy in context. Closure line is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Gossip-column exorcist who works with copper coils and induction instead of psalms is a fresh riff on occult tech. The apology-through-scent device transforms the familiar ‘failed exorcism’ trope into a quiet acceptance beat. Specificity—playing pieces backward to ‘hear the ghosts’, the weeping-angel stopper—prevents generic gothic pastiche. Risk is moderate: lyrical stillness over spectacle, but coherence holds.</comment>
