<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—skeptical intellect vs. ache for the grandmother—surface in the fountain moment, but the interior shift is declared (“memories aren’t just stories… anchors”) rather than embodied in a micro-choice that costs her something visible. The key turn is present yet bloodless; we see no bodily risk, forfeiture, or irreversible action that makes the descent sting. Earned, but thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: box → key → date → breadcrumbs → apparition → lock → staircase, each beat tightening options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—staircase into light reweights “sidereal patience” with cost of irreversible descent. One transition (surface → under-city) is legible; no orientation debt. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fountain basins, cracked stone, velvet color, and the glass box itself act as micro-settings that constrain movement and focus perception. The constellated door reprises the box panes, charging the final image. Selective sensory triage—dust, damp, rust—mirrors Elara’s narrowed attention. Setting never blocks choreography; spatial track stays clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—signals early and escalates through each breadcrumb. Apparition forces a crystallized stance: descend or remain anchored. One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is legible as irreversible step into dark. Could use one tangible forfeiture (time, safety) to punch past 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-anchor emerges from concrete imagery (dry fountains, locked box) rather than exposition. Final image of light below reconfigures “sidereal patience” from waiting to active descent—an earned conceptual reprice. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what memories will cost. Subtle, not revelatory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—shattered-glass mind, flickering lantern heart. Syntax tightens under pressure: breath shallow, pulse metronome. Figurative layering (“colors bled… like a memory refusing to stay still”) is voice-motivated, not ornamental. No head-hop; psychic distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary. High density—each line advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor cluster (“mouths agape like silent witnesses… moss surrendered to dust”) but clarity survives. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Memory-locked city and sidereal patience braid into fresh mythic texture without genre cliché. Grandmother-as-moonlight-apparition risks trope, but specific constellation mapping and breadcrumb mechanics transform it. Risk is moderate; payoff cerebral rather than visceral. Feels particular to this voice.</comment>
