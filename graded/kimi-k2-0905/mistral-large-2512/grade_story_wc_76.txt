<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with reversing time is vivid—his thumb on the stone, the yoyo wound “like vertebrae”—but the final beat of “choice” is declared, not dramatized; we see no new micro-choice after the world rewinds, only a smile and a repeated drop. Interior contradiction is strong early (hunger vs. hubris) yet the cost is felt more by the landscape than by his body, so the arc hovers at strong-not-exemplary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: yoyo-rise → stone-split → time-reverse → blank stone, each beat caused by the last. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam now casts *backward*, a visible, conceptual cost that reweights the premise. One causal gap—why the yoyo first rises—is never seeded, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive disorientation; the final image pays off the inversion rule cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Black-teeth island, salt-corroded brass, kelp-licked rocks—every detail is filtered through Elias’s tactile, maker gaze. The lighthouse itself becomes a micro-setting tool: its reversed beam is the final environmental constraint, charging the closure. One minor slack: tide physics after the rewind are asserted (“slower this time”) rather than shown through action, keeping the score just under exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seize authorship of time—signals early and tightens when the stone’s names vanish, foreclosing return to the original world. The single meaningful turn (yoyo ascends instead of falling) narrows options under causal pressure. Cost is legible—stone blanks, beam reverses—but the price lands more on the world than on Elias’s future tactics, capping entry to the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—time as malleable yet morally bruised—emerges from the bruise-colored light and the erased famine-names, never sermonized. The final backward beam is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior clock image. Ambiguity lingers: has Elias freed or orphaned the dead? The refusal to answer is earned, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is clockmaker-precise, compressed, salt-rusted: “his clocks run backward… time itself stutter.” Syntax shortens under pressure—“He gasped as the world *reversed*.” No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent, even through cosmic rewind. A hairline slip: “bleak and exhilarated” labels the final smile; trimming the adjectives would let the image speak and nudge this to 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence twins action with metaphor (“gears click into place like vertebrae”). No loops, no filter-verb stacks. One mixed vehicle—“dying breath against the storm”—is allowable at opening. The final paragraph’s repeated “wound… dropped” cadence is intentional callback, not template, so momentum stays intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Reverse-engineering a yo-yo to pick the lock of a famine-stone that rewinds the world—this synthesis feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The trope of “forbidden artifact” is transformed through maker-craft specifics: nested gears, brass corrosion, spiral unwind. Risk is high but coherence never breaks; the final backward beam is an image that could not exist without every prior oddity.</comment>
