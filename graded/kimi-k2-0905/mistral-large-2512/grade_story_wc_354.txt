<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s exile and teaching past give him texture; the stone’s dent anchors a specific memory of pity. His decision to stay is credible because the scene has shown silence yielding a usable pattern. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the final micro-choice costs him the solitary life he knew. Still, we never see him actually misplay or teach a board, so “chess tutor” remains asserted rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covenant’s meaning reweights Elias’s exile and the choice to remain, cost legible in the fading glow and the dent pressing his palm. Causal chain holds—because he correlates, therefore he sees; because Lysara guides, therefore the pattern unlocks. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One minor slack: the “next phase” clock is declared but never tightens options on this night.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus is more mood than constraint until the final beat when the pulsing stones actively shape the visible symbols; that late participation lifts the score. Earlier, the violet-rust sky and uneven gravity are vivid but decorative. The basalt stone serves as micro-setting and is handled twice, earning its keep. To reach 8.8 the environment would need to frustrate or enable a specific tactic before the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find meaning in exile through silence”—is signaled early and tightens once the symbols cohere, foreclosing the option to leave empty-handed. Cost is present but soft: the foregone life is implied, not dramatized. Agency is mostly attention and correlation, yet that suffices under the Accumulative lens. A sharper forfeiture (time, bodily risk, or social capital) would push the band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: patience and shared listening transmute exile into belonging. No character moralizes; the covenant’s reveal reweights earlier images (stone, hum, dusk) without sermon. Ambiguity remains—what the “next phase” demands—inviting reflection. The hopeful melancholy tone is sustained, but the closing line is slightly declarative, muting full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“frayed cuffs,” “ink in water”) reflects his precise yet bruised mindset. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences stretch, then shorten when glyphs appear. Lysara’s dialogue is spare and idiomatically distinct. One micro-slip: “he could feel it in the way the light bent” edges toward telling, but the next clause quickly recovers with sensory image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; most sentences do two jobs. No loops or scaffold clusters. Metaphors stay coherent and scene-anchored. Occasional elevated phrasing (“eclipsed covenant,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above the POV’s plausible lexicon, keeping the score sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing chess logic with geomancy via silence is fresh, and the magnetic nexus avoids standard fantasy portals. The “beauty in difficulty” angle is familiar, but here it is earned through joint attention rather than triumph. Risk is moderate: no structural experiment, yet the quiet payoff trusts the reader. More specificity about how chess patterning informs his reading of the glyphs would deepen the synthesis.</comment>
