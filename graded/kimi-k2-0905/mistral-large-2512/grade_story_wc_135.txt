<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s desire to “compile fragments into meaning” is concrete and embodied (the damp parchment against her ribs). The micro-choice to meet Dain and handle the valves shows hierarchy of values, yet interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak (“reactively visionary”). Cost is legible—she trembles holding the erased map—but the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes her irrevocable next step.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: exile ended → valves collected → erased map revealed. Orientation is swift: ivory harbor, night-after-storm, satchel weight all land inside 120 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the etched map reweights the city’s history with undeniable social cost. One minor slack: the watchtower door opens on a favor we never see earned, but it doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory triangulation—salt taste, wet-stone smell, fractured lantern light—filters through Liora’s archivist gaze. The ivory docks and rain-slick cobbles constrain movement and mood, while the trumpet valves function as micro-setting that finally reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track from alley to tower without drift. Environment does not yet constrain a tactical choice at the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“stitch the city’s absences”—is signaled early and tightens when the third valve reveals the pre-exile map. One meaningful deepening: the map proves erasure, not mere absence, narrowing options from recovery to exposure. Cost is felt in Liora’s tremor, but the beat is internal; no external resource or relationship is visibly forfeited. Escalation is coherent under causal lens, yet pressure plateaus once the map is seen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history as palimpsest, memory as salvage. The erased harbor map reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Liora’s fingers trembling over brass—rather than declaration. Final image reframes earlier “fragments” as evidence of deliberate violence, inviting reflection on who controls narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter: puddle-light, parchment weight, valve resonance. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly formal—apt for an archivist. No head-hopping; Dain’s dialogue carries smuggler indirection. One register lift—“Conceptual Repricing” in rubric, not text—keeps voice intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences double-duty (action + atmosphere). No loops or scaffold. Occasional poetic compression—“echoes of stories half-drowned”—but figurative load stays light under pressure. One mixed micro-image: “missing teeth” beside “gaped” is redundant; trim would sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival salvage + brass cartography + post-exile noir. Trumpet valves as mnemonic keys feel specific, not gimmick. Risk is moderate—quiet revelation over thriller beats—but execution commits fully. Could push further if the erased map’s implications were weaponized beyond recognition.</comment>
