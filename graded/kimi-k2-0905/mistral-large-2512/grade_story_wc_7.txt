<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-driven quest is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstractions (“felt whole”) that short-circuit embodied contradiction; the final renunciation of remaining seeds is earned yet the cost is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pouch of seeds crystallizes a new, uncertain path after the memory-fruit reweights her pain; causal chain holds—alignment window → plant → bite → softened grief → dispersal—with one clean transition inside the greenhouse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is tactile and constraining—broken glass, sagging benches—its decay directly shapes her pruning labor and the final image of seedlings leaving the ruin; sensory selection stays tight to Mara's chef-eye for growth and rot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal city’s collective memory—tightens when the single fruit ripens and she must decide to consume or share; the bite forecloses immediate reuse, a visible price, though escalation is more lyrical deepening than rising external threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of gentle rebellion against decay emerges through her act of planting inside ruin rather than exposition; the translucent fruit reconfigures memory as living tissue, avoiding moralizing, but the final line’s “own kind of magic” flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mara’s perceptual filter—smell of soil, shimmer of leaves—syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts under urgency; no dialogue, so voice carries all subtext cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional softeners (“unnatural pace,” “world dissolved”) edge toward cliché; no loops or scaffold, rhythm breathes with scene beats, and metaphor stays coherent under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Memory-tasting chef grafted onto botanical necromancy feels fresh; the synaptic-fruit concept could tip into gimmick yet is grounded in tactile gardening labor, transforming a trope into lived ritual.</comment>
