<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “moral auditor” label is vivid, but we never watch him audit; he only listens. The mirror shard and cloak motif echo inner conflict yet Elias never acts against his own fear—he simply absorbs Veyra’s story. Veyra’s fragile certainty lands, but because Elias’s stakes never tighten, the moment feels observational rather than crucible. Interiority is atmospheric, not decision-forcing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse shifts from courtroom to confessional, sunlight replacing judgment with shared uncertainty—cost is the lingering absence of absolution. Causal chain is thin—Elias’s only “act” is asking one question—but under an Accumulative/Textural lens the chimes, mirror, and dawn light successfully reweight meaning. Orientation is secure inside 120 words. Lens holds; cost is conceptual, yet legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Wind-chime “language,” extinguished campfire scent, and cliff-top dawn are selective and purposeful, economically sketching a world without pausing the beat. Lighthouse interior is micro-set as moral arena; chimes and mirror function as tools that filter attention. Details stay inside Elias’s biased perception—no tourist catalog. While no prop physically constrains the final choice, the reconfigured morning light charges the closing image enough to satisfy the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elias deciding whether to “unhook” Veyra—surfaces late and remains conversational; no visible tactic narrows. Pressure is ambient (guilt, chimes, mirror) rather than actionable; Elias’s single prompt is not tested by resistance. No option is foreclosed, no price shown. Ambiguity is thematic, not procedural, so escalation stays flat under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“truth is messier than guilt or innocence”—emerges through image pattern (fractured mirror, discordant chimes) rather than statement. Final sunrise reconfigures the moral rule-set without moralizing. Subtext resides in Veyra’s trembling hands and Elias’s pocketed shard; no character voices the thesis. Complexity is invited, not solved, leaving resonant aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “wind tugging like an impatient creditor,” “notes rising like breaths.” Syntax grows clipped under rising unease; longer sentences relax into dawn light. No head-hop; psychic distance modulates intentionally. Distinct maritime-dawn idiom differentiates the piece; even without dialogue, narrative voice carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—mixed metaphors avoided. Occasional elevated phrasing (“protected vulnerability,” “conceptual repricing”) skirts register edge but stays within scholar-adjacent POV tolerance. Clause propulsion remains intact; final sentence lands with cadenced exhale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>“Moral auditor” and “deciphering wind chimes” refresh familiar gothic-lighthouse tropes by reframing investigation as acoustics-of-conscience. Mirror that shows fear not truth deepens the spectral device into moral ambiguity. Conceptual risk is moderate; execution relies more on atmosphere than causal innovation. Specificity of chime-pattern scholarship keeps the idea from feeling ornamental.</comment>
