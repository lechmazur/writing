<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet resolve is embodied in tactile wire-work and animal trust; interiority stays concrete. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene—he never doubts or recalculates—so the final act is credible but not dramatically tested. The “six-month” death sentence functions more as premise than pressure, so the cost feels pre-paid rather than freshly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the unfinished arch and the animals eating from his palm crystallize both legacy and inevitable loss. Causal chain is lean—wire-wrap → slow growth → memory—but sufficient for this length. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in the image “he would not live to see…”, re-weighting the orchard’s future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Elias’s caretaker gaze: stone “grown, not carved,” copper soon “invisible inside bark.” Micro-setting (wire, berries, fox muzzle) constrains action and charges the final beat. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and muted sound, matching mortal fatigue. Spatial choreography is flawless—body, wire, branch, altar track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve orchard vs. bulldozers—is signaled early and tightens through the single escalating act of covert shaping. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening: the first arch takes visible form, foreclosing surrender. Cost is present-tense in his aching knees and dusk deadline. Pressure stays coherent under situational lens; developers remain off-stage threat, sufficient at this scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies continuity emerges through wire-scarred trees and animal trust rather than statement. Final image of fox and badger eating together re-prices the orchard as shared territory, not property. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is imagistic. The shift from human custodian to multispecies archive is understated but legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is steady, quiet, arborist-precise: “testing its tension,” “mimicked the natural flow.” Rhythm lengthens toward dusk, mirroring fatigue. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Occasional elevated phrasing—“brazen calm,” “conceptual repricing”—slips toward editorial diction, but frequency is low.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences vary without algorithmic pattern. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare—only “pillars… like old friends”—and earns its place. Filter verbs appear only when justified by mortal detachment. High-band control with microscopic slips in diction elevation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Living stone pillars + copper-wire topiary is a fresh synthesis of arboriculture and architecture. The “temple as slow negotiation between mineral and root” reframes eco-fiction trope. Risk is quiet rather than bold, keeping score sub-8.8. Specificity of grown-not-carved stone and oxidizing wire prevents swappability.</comment>
