<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—restorer of machines vs. builder of community—surfaces only in summary; we never see her hesitate or pay an embodied cost when she pivots from gears to choir. The final smile is unearned because no on-page moment forces her to relinquish a private want. Still, her grandfather’s weight and multilingual past give her credible roots.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the swinging weight reconfigures the town’s siloed lives and Mara’s vocation under a single audible heartbeat; cost is felt in the tower’s groan and the workers’ hesitant first hum. Causal chain is lean—overheard talks → poster → gathering → song—but coherent. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only one soft time-jump (“weeks passed”) risks diluting pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower’s brass hands, stone steps, and lantern glow are filtered through Mara’s tuner’s ear; sound (scuffing boots, chime timbre) dominates sight, a nice occupational bias. The cuckoo weight’s polished iron reappears at start and end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clear; no impossible bodies. Micro-setting (the weight as metronome) constrains the closing rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can isolation be turned into chorus?—is signaled early and tightens once: the first collective hum either fractures or fuses. Escalation is textural rather than causal; density rises as languages layer into a single melody. Cost is audible (tower groan) but not personal to Mara; she risks no visible loss. Sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic and social mesh emerges from the workers’ trilingual fragments and the final wordless chorus; no character spells it out. The cuckoo weight’s reprise reweights “time” from mechanical measure to communal pulse. Ambiguity remains: bridges are built, but silos still stand—an honest open texture. Final smile edges toward softness, blunting resonance a notch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited stays latched to Mara; perceptual signature is auditory and tactile—“grain elevator talks” heard through walls, iron weight “thudding softly.” Syntax is clean, lightly lyrical; no register drift. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal idiom is consistent. One filter-verb cluster (“she had come… she wanted… she unlatched”) slightly dulls the inciting beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose breathes with scene needs—short beats for ascent, longer cadence for communal release. Mixed metaphors avoided; “missing syllable in a hymn” is precise. One paraphrase loop (“voices could rise together, not just in song, but in understanding”) could compress. No scaffold, no purple. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusing a cuckoo-clock weight with a multilingual choir is fresh; the astronomical clock as community metronome feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric uplift rather than subversive twist—but execution is specific enough to escape template. Grain-elevator silos as metaphor for linguistic isolation is a nice local inflection.</comment>
