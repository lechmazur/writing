<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s meticulous-care trait is shown through glove-adjusting and dial-turning, but interiority stays general (“his chest tightened”) and the vow-recognition epiphany is declared rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized; the final commitment reads as single-note uplift rather than costly renunciation. Still, the motivation arc is coherent and stakes feel personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias locks the lantern, accepting lifelong custodianship with the cost of eternal solitude and labor. Causal chain is intact—finding slide → tuning frequencies → stabilizing illusion → choosing to preserve. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality bump: “he knew what it could do” before on-page evidence, but it is quickly paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice-cathedral library is vividly sketched through glinting shelves, sagging under neglect, and the brass lantern slot; cold is made tactile via breath-curl and glove ritual. Spatial choreography holds as Elias moves from shelf to lantern to projected image. The setting constrains the final choice—only this frozen archive can host the vow—meeting the 9+ gate. A sliver of headroom remains for even sharper sensory compression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“save the library from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightened when the illusion begins to fade; Elias’s agency (frequency adjustment) directly forecloses the option of walking away. Cost is visible: perpetual vigilance implied by “locked the frequencies in place.” Pressure escalates under causal lens, but only one beat of real endangerment (flicker) occurs; a second constriction would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-obligation emerges through the lantern’s resurrection of a stranger’s vow, not thesis. Final image reweights earlier cataloging work as sacred stewardship. Subtle irony: the orderly chief who indexed dead stories becomes the final living footnote. Avoids moralizing, though the last line’s smile edges toward sentimental resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains a cool, precise diction (“gently meticulous precision,” “quartz hush”) that mirrors Elias’s temperament and the icy setting. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for awe, fragments for flicker beats. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. One register lift (“conceptual repricing”) feels academic but appears only once.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figuratives (“cathedral of ice,” “quartz hush”) recur but are pattern-taught and payoff in final hush. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor over-modification (“spectral glow,” “luminous and fleeting”) slightly dilutes peak beat; still, clarity and momentum remain intact through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Frozen library + magic lantern slide + vow-etched-light is a fresh synthesis; the concept of “luminous vows” reframes memory as palpable technology. Execution leans on familiar “last guardian of knowledge” arc, so freshness is moderate. Specificity of frequency tuning and ice-shelf collapse keeps it from feeling generic. Not radically risky, but the blend feels particular to this piece.</comment>
