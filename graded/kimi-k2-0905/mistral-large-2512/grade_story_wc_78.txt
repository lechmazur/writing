<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leeward’s embodied listening and tactile micro-choices (“soles of his feet… salt in his veins”) give a vivid interior, but the arc is pure ascent—no contradictory impulse or error under pressure—so the “earned” quality feels thin; the laugh at the climax is the only visible cost, not quite scaled to the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky resonates back, cost is the irreversible exposure of his private ritual to the vast sea; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies rather than causally reverses. Orientation is swift; only driftwood-raft physics stays fuzzy, not enough to dent legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The floating orchard is tactile—roots “stretching like strings,” fruit “tasting of brine and stubbornness”—and the xylophone mallet doubles as micro-setting that constrains every action; spatial choreography is clean, no white-room lapse. Final image of glowing fractal clouds is recharged by earlier sensory seeding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn the sea’s chaos into music—tightens through density and cadence shift; no option is foreclosed, but the stakes ascend from solo to duet with the ocean. Cost is aesthetic exposure, felt but not materially limiting; one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—obstacles as instruments—emerges via recurring sonic imagery rather than statement; the sky’s final “score” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext rests in the shift from warning to collaboration, though ambiguity is modest; resonance lingers in the ear rather than the gut.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Leeward’s perceptual filter: salt, vibration, fractal hearing; syntax lengthens then compresses with crescendo, no head-hop. Distinct maritime-musical diction (“dubbing the driftwood,” “euphony exploded”) sustains texture without purple drift; rhythm mirrors musical phrase, pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and forward drive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked figuratives (“fractal paths the wind carved through the sky”) flirt with excess but occur pre-climax and do not obscure causality; final strike is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard-orchestra is fresh, yet “prophet reads sky, tool turns world into instrument” leans on known lyrical-fantasy templates; specificity of salt-fruit and driftwood-xylophone transforms the trope enough to feel memorable. Risk is moderate, not boundary-shattering, but execution is committed and coherent.</comment>
