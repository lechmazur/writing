<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s coin-flip and map-reading micro-choices show embodied ritual, but interiority drifts into explanatory labels (“the labyrinth remembered things”). The final hand-off is credible, yet the woman’s motivation is asserted, not dramatized; cost is felt but not deeply personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral walk becomes the lock, key transfers, storm holds breath—cost is atmospheric and social, not private. Causal chain is thin (map → walk → woman) but coherent under Accumulative lens; orientation clean by 120w, no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Container maze hums with geomagnetic frost and sodium halos; every sensory note pressures Elias’s teeth and gloves. The spiral path is tracked spatially without white-room drift; storm-light charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled early and tested by the spiral walk audition. One meaningful tightening: key must be offered to a stranger whose gait fits the lock; stakes escalate from puzzle to social risk, cost legible in storm-hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of listening vs. broadcasting emerges through mirrored maps and reversed spirals, never sermonized. Final whispered pact reweights earlier coin-flip luck into shared conspiracy; ambiguity lingers about who is using whom, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual tics—static in gloves, map creases as scars. Syntax flexes with storm-pressure; no head-hopping. Woman’s dialogue carries subtext without voice convergence; diction stays within dockworker lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrases (“choir of the lost”) risk purple but remain patterned; no mixed metaphors. Final line breathes without overwriting, sustaining momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Geomagnetic shipping-container labyrinth plus gait-as-lock is a fresh synthesis; trope of mysterious key is revived through kinetic cryptography. Risk-taking lies in withholding back-story and letting atmosphere carry stakes; specificity prevents generic noir pastiche.</comment>
