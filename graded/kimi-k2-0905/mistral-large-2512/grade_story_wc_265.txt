<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The philosopher’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure is dramatized. The gear-touch triggers translocation, yet the decision to “unravel” is asserted, not shown via a beat that costs him something tangible. The final step forward reads as surrender rather than earned stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear dissolves and the forest hybridizes, reweighting the rule-set with visible cost (loss of the map-object). Causal chain is thin—gear pull → dream → teleport → guardian lecture → dissolve—but holds under a lyric-accumulative lens. Orientation is swift; only one transition (sleep/wake) and it is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest and living-wood clearing are sketched with kinetic, sense-driven strokes; copper leaves, rusted soil, sap scent all filter through POV attention. The hybrid forest at the end reconfigures the prior imagery, charging the final image. No environment actively constrains a tactical choice, so 9-band gate not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes—“rediscover the wild frontier of mind”—are declared early but remain abstract; no concrete option is foreclosed mid-text. The gear’s pulse intensifies the hum, yet the protagonist remains passive recipient of guardian exposition. Escalation is tonal, not tactical; cost is paid only in the final dissolve, too late to shape tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of ordered thought versus ungoverned ideation emerges imagistically through metal-vs-organic forests. Final hybrid grove offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext stays shallow because the guardian spells out the conflict; no ironic gap is sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: “the hum of insight sharpened into something almost painful.” Syntax modulates with wind cadence; no head-hopping. Guardian diction merges with narrator, but flickering-shadow descriptor keeps otherness intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) but stays within philosopher’s contemplative register. Mixed metaphors avoided; gear dissolves cleanly into light. Final paragraph could lose one adjective without harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest as prison of tame thought is fresh; hybrid closure avoids binary nature/tech cliché. Wind-as-code key and gear-as-idea-map feel specific to this world. Risk is moderate—lyric teleport dream logic—but execution stays coherent. Not transformative enough for 9+ band.</comment>
