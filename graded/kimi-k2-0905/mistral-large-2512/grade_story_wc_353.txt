<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile obsession with wood-sound is vivid and embodied; the final micro-choice—wedging the insulator and striking—pays off his trait. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only limit: no contradictory impulse is allowed to complicate the beat, so the arc is linear rather than fracturing under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s silence is broken by a raw, imperfect breath whose cost is the sculpture’s further fracture. Causal chain—find relic → map cracks → insert resonator → strike—holds without ellipsis. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. The insulator’s re-purposing is foreshadowed early, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.</comment>

<comment>Alder damp, moss give, and hair-line cracks are filtered through a wood-carver’s professional eye; every tactile detail later guides the strumming tactic. The porcelain’s “smooth white orb” contrasts physically and acoustically, charging the final resonance. Environment literally channels sound; without the cracked alder and grove hush the climax fails—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the first gasp of sound escapes; option space narrows from “can anything sing?” to “this broken thing can, but only once.” The hedgehog’s uncurling supplies a soft clock, not a threat, so pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial; still, the protagonist’s agency drives every escalation beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: wounds and relics can still voice beauty if met with precise, empathetic attention. The porcelain insulator’s migration from power-grid refuse to resonator reweights “silence” from absence into potential—an earned conceptual repricing. No moralizing line intrudes; the final image lets the cracked sculpture’s gasp answer the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s synesthetic perception; diction—“calloused,” “spiderwebbing,” “ghost of it”—is carpenter-precise. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for hush, clipped fragments for strike. No head-hopping or register drift; even the hedgehog’s gaze is filtered through Elias’s projection, keeping psychic distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence either advances tactile discovery or deepens acoustic metaphor. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. The single intensifier cluster (“raw, uneven, the voice of something broken”) is justified by the emotional peak and is immediately grounded in action—therefore allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Using stress cracks as fret-boards and a discarded power-line insulator as phonetic diaphragm feels fresh and inevitable; the concept fuses lutherie with field-found readymade. The “tree-song sculptor” trope is elevated by acoustic engineering detail rather than pastoral cliché. Risk is quiet but coherent—no gimmicks, yet the image of a grove learning to hum again lingers.</comment>
