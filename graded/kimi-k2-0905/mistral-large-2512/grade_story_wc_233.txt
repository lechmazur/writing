<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The queen’s interiority is vivid—her dread, fatigue, and dawning recognition braid together in embodied beats (tracing the star-scars, the shared exhale with the firefly). The final acceptance is earned because every beat of the climb strips away her former sovereignty and leaves her “no longer marked by constellations, but by something deeper.” No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the arc is coherent, specific, and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror-touch dissolves her star-marked skin and re-casts her role under a new sky-covenant; the cost is legible in the phrase “something that hummed in her bones.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (raven scroll, firefly pulse, cobalt moss) tightens the texture until the final cadence shift re-weights the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ember grotto’s cobalt moss, liquid-silver mirror, and thinning mountain air are not backdrop but tactical: the ozone scent and sinking boots slow her steps, the mirror’s surface literally parts to finalize her transformation. Firefly light recurs with rising frequency, stitching valley to sky and charging the final image. Environment constrains the decisive act, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she answer the summons or cling to terrestrial rule?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens once: the climb forecloses retreat, the mirror forecloses her former identity. Under Accumulative lens the pressure intensifies through sensory density rather than causal reversals; the cost is the loss of her star-marked skin and former sovereignty. A second reversal or higher-stakes trade-off would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of celestial memory versus earthly power emerges from image pattern (starlight, fireflies, mirror-sky) rather than exposition. The final image—dawn creeping over the ridge with her bones humming—re-prices the premise: rule is no longer a throne but a covenant with the sky. No moralizing line intrudes; ambiguity lingers about what “first of the earth to remember” will demand of her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical yet precise diction—“wind tugging at her robes like a restless child,” “grotto yawned.” Syntax lengthens during ascent, then fragments at the mirror touch, mirroring breathless thin air. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains queen-bound. The elevated register never drifts into purple because every metaphor is filtered through her fatigue and wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned—starlight, fireflies, cobalt—teaching the reader early and paying off in the final glow. One mixed metaphor (“cage of silk and shadow”) is minor. No scaffold sentences; every paragraph advances image, pressure, or transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “starlight bleeding into skin” trope is refreshed by treating it as ancestral memory rather than curse, and the ember grotto becomes a living observatory rather than a generic magic cave. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric ending rather than a throne-room reversal; the payoff is conceptual re-pricing rather than spectacle. While the sky-queen memory device is recognizable, the specific firefly/mirror choreography makes the iteration feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
