<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s numbness-to-life arc is embodied in sweat, breath, sword-weight; the duplicate-brain backstory is anchored to a present micro-choice (Veyra’s twitch toward the jar). Interior contradiction—“I don’t know how to stop”—is dramatized, not labeled. The final renunciation of clone-vs-original identity lands with visible cost: he steps off the rock into unknown air, ego armor left behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: each beat because/therefore—spar failure therefore insight, insight therefore attack, attack therefore cracked numbness. Closure is a Decisive Change: Kael’s stance shifts from “I need to feel” to “Either way, I’ll be moving,” foreclosing the dojo safety with physical leap. Cost is legible in the final image—bare feet leaving solid stone. One micro-turn mid-scene suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating rock, ozone scent, sword-grooves under bare feet—details are filtered through Kael’s urgency, not catalogued. The jar’s amber fluid catches sunset and refracts into the final realization, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography of the duel is clean; no impossible positions. Weather and altitude remain consistent constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens when sparring failure forces the insight that numbness is canvas, not enemy. Escalation is one meaningful shift: Veyra’s blade slices the pretense armor, narrowing Kael’s options to stay (duplicate fate) or leap (unknown feeling). Cost is the dojo’s safety forever forfeited. Agency remains Kael’s; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: identity is not original-vs-copy but the motion one chooses after opposites are accepted. Subtext lives in Veyra’s twitch toward the jar and the silent brain—no speech needed. Final image of stepping into clouds reweights earlier numbness as necessary canvas without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; insight earned through sweat and splinters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter: “air tasted like possibility” is his diction, not authorial. Rhythm accelerates with short parataxis under sword stress, lengthens during reflection. No head-hopping; Veyra’s interior accessed only via observable twitch. Dialogue sparse, subtextual—“Then fight.”—mirrors Kael’s need.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“storm inside him” is cliché but isolated. No loops or synonym churn; each line advances pressure or image. Strong verbs (“blade sliced the illusion”) carry weight, minimal adverbs. Copy-clean punctuation and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating dojo + ego-death sword training + clone custody brain is a fresh synthesis; tropes are inverted—nirvana is not escape but forward motion into void. Risk of stepping off rock pays off thematically and physically. Specificity of “grooves worn by centuries” roots the fantastical in tactile reality. Conceptual integrity holds: no late rule changes.</comment>
