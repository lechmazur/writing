<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile obsession with the key and the cut-thumb beat give embodied cost, but interiority drifts into abstract “understanding” rather than contradictory impulse; the final shift from resistance to acceptance feels declared, not wrestled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the blood-drop reboot reconfigures the rule-set (time = resistance) with visible price; causal chain (key → blood → horizon snaps) holds under Accumulative lens; Harkin log provides single reflective block within 20 % and anchors present choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cliffside station, brass eyepiece, and razor-edged gears are filtered through Elias’s professional eye; the folding-air image reappears at climax, charging the final horizon snap; micro-setting (the pendulum’s razor edge) literally cuts him, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the line hold?”—tightens once: the horizon’s waver narrows options to blood sacrifice; pressure is coherent but single-cycle; cost is legible (blood, pain), yet no secondary loss compounds the tactic shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: clocks as friction-holders, not measurers; blood-drop re-prices the concept without sermon; ozone-and-salt sensory echo quietly reweights the opening promise—no moral spelled, resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter—“fingers that knew the weight of time”—with rhythmic compression under pressure; no head-hop; diction stays within hydraulic-clock lexicon; final underwater-chime cadence is earned and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm, high density (“iron girders groaning in the fjord quiet”), zero paraphrase loops; one mixed metaphor (“air folding in on itself”) is momentary; no scaffold; razor-edge repetition is purposeful, not churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Time-as-friction via hydraulic clocktower is fresh; razor-edged pendulum literalizes metaphor without gimmick; Harkin marginalia nods to cosmic-horror lineage but stays subordinate to Elias’s tactile trial—risk taken, coherence intact.</comment>
