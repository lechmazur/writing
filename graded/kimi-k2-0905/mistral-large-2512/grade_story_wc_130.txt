<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is palpable, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“mathematics of emotion”) that tells more than embodies. The sister-shaped hole motivates, yet no contradictory impulse complicates his ritual; he glides from loss to comfort without micro-choice that costs him anything visible. Closure gives warmth, not renunciation, so the arc feels consolatory rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the orchard’s answer rather than forcing causal reversals. Orientation is swift; moon, cavern, eyes anchor by line 4. Closure lands as Charged Poise—presence is re-weighted, not returned—yet the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping it shy of 9-band punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is rendered through touch, drip, glow; micro-setting (glass eyes, mosaic stone) constrains the ritual action. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elias kneels, places, turns. The environment is inseparable from the spell, charging the final image with underground hush and warm brown iris-light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stake—recover sister’s trace—is signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory accretion rather than option narrowing. The orchard’s “answer” is a permission, not a foreclosure; no live path is sacrificed. Cost is aesthetic communion, not tactical loss, so escalation feels gentle, not decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss emerges through orchard silence and shifting eye-colors, never named outright. Final image reframes absence as porous, not absent, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral. The consolation is earned through ritual texture, though it leans toward comfort rather than paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s fingertip perception; diction stays hushed, precise, slightly archaic (“conjurer,” “stalactites”). Rhythm lengthens during spell, contracts at closure, mirroring breath. No head-hop or filter clutter; voice is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, largely loop-free; occasional poetic overlap (“silence that followed ambiguous loss”) is tolerated under accumulative mode. Metaphors stay coherent (sunlight through stained glass). Final paragraph holds cadence without syntactic scaffold. One paraphrase loop (−0.2) keeps it below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing taxidermy eyes with emotional fractals feels fresh; orchard-as-psychic-computer isn’t overtrod. Yet the sister-quest structure is familiar, and the eyes’ magic follows dream-logic rather than rule-based surprise. Specificity of color-shift and mosaic dovetail lifts it above template, but risk is modest.</comment>
