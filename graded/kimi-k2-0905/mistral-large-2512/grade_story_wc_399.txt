<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker’s honesty is anchored in embodied beats (mask warmth, tremor in chest) and drives the climax choice to “let the echo pass through.” Interior contradiction is thin—he questions but never truly resists—so the arc feels more confirmation than transformation, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden thread image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—“to preserve is to let it pass unfiltered.” Causality holds under the Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (pavilion murmurs, parapet pulse, thread) tightens the stake until the final crystallization. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation is taught early and pays off in the peripheral-vision climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pavilion’s groaning slats and the parapet’s sub-sand mechanics are tactile, selective, and directly constrain the walker’s kneeling beat and the final thread emergence. Micro-setting (mask, wooden floor as conduit) functions as setting and charges the closure image. No environment or object cap applies; the kinetic parapet reappears and reweights meaning at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve or corrupt the echo—is signaled early and tightens once: the walker must decide whether to clutch or release the golden thread. The tightening is textural, not causal, but valid under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the mask’s flare and the pavilion’s settling sigh. One meaningful intensification suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: truth survives only when transmitted without ownership. The golden thread’s reappearance reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—some wisdom is “a lie dressed in truth”—and the ending invites counter-readings. No thematic echo penalty applies; no character articulates a thesis in prompt-like language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the walker’s perceptual signature—driftwood mask, peripheral vision, sand-pulse heartbeat—with rhythmic control that accelerates into the final thread beat. No head-hopping or register drift. Syntax mirrors attention: long clauses for dunes, fragments for peripheral flickers. Distinctive without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the pavilion sighed…into a deeper stillness” does triple duty—atmosphere, causal cue, closure cadence. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-overwrite—“a thousand unspoken truths”—survives the artifact screen because it is the only abstract intensifier in the climax and is immediately grounded by tactile hum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The kinetic parapet that no one built, wisdom preserved by letting it go, and the peripheral-vision oracle combine into a fresh desert-myth frame. Tropes (masked mystic, prophet in dusk) are transformed through the honest walker’s refusal to hoard truth. Risk in the non-causal Accumulative structure heightens lyric resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
