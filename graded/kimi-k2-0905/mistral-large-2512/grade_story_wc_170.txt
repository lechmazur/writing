<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is textured through synesthetic memory and embodied ritual, but the decisive shift from “seeing” to “believing” is asserted rather than dramatized; no micro-choice on the page pays the cost of that leap. The watchman supplies welcome external pressure, yet their exchange stays observational, so status and relationship remain static. Earned stasis is hinted at, but the final stance is not foreclosed by any visible forfeiture or contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last line crystallizes a new perceptual state with undeniable conceptual cost—she now bears the borrowed heartbeat alone. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal; pattern is taught early via prism refractions and lullaby echoes, tightening until the final brushstroke reweights reality. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is felt, though off-stage—no concrete consequence is shown on the page, keeping it just shy of 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The terrace, prism parapet, and pre-bell hush are returned to in every beat; rain-caught facets literally color the paint and constrain what she can steal for the canvas. Micro-setting (the wet stone under her knees, the dying light on glass) channels her tactical choices and charges the final image. Jasmine scent and echoing bells function as sensory metronomes, not ornament. Spatial choreography stays crisp across two bodies and one shifting mirage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—coax the mirage into permanence—signals early and tightens through sensory narrowing: light fading, bells impending, paint running out. The watchman’s skepticism supplies external pressure, but the escalation is accumulative density, not option-closing reversal; no tactical loss or tool break alters her method. The climax is a cognitive flip, not a blocked path, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the single deepening is meaningful under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as pigment that rewrites reality—emerges through refracted light and half-remembered lullabies, never named. The prism’s shift from optical toy to pigment source reweights “grace” from maternal gift to solitary burden. Subtext hums in the watchman’s listening posture: he hears bells, she hears pre-bell silence, exposing incompatible epistemologies. Final image avoids moral, offering resonant reconfiguration instead.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Liora’s synesthetic attention: rainbows “bleed,” stone “vibrates,” heartbeat is “borrowed.” Syntax lengthens then fragments in mimicry of held breath, taught by line 1 and paid off in the accelerating brushstrokes. Diction stays within her artisanal lexicon—no academic register drift. Watchman’s diction is gravel-rough, distinct without caricature. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrically dense yet information-rich; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors (prism as thief, lullabies as code) stay coherent and internally consistent. Occasional adjectival stacking (“dying light and blossoming jasmine”) flirts with purple but serves the accumulative cadence. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase drift; final paragraph’s rhythmic crescendo propels closure without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Merging optical physics with maternal lullaby-cryptography feels fresh; the “mirage that only she can see” trope is revitalized by paint stolen from real refractions. Risk is taken in eschewing plot reversal for accumulative lyric intensity, and it largely pays off. Specificity of prism parapet as both palette and portal anchors the concept. Not quite 9+ because the borrowed heartbeat’s rules remain metaphoric rather than materially consequential.</comment>
