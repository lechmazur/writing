<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—her giddy laugh and pocketed leaf show embodied emotion—but the story never lets her doubt or fear; she glides from curiosity to certainty without contradictory impulse, so the final “choice” costs her nothing and feels pre-approved rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the arbor’s golden glow and the tendril’s pulse reconfigure the village’s disbelief into potential communal song—visible, felt cost is the energy drained from Liora and the arbor’s withheld hush afterward. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory intensification (tendril pulse, bark glow) is a pattern break that reweights the stake of forgotten belief without requiring external antagonist turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arbor is rendered through mint scent, spiralled bark, and the tactile vine bracelet; these micro-details constrain her singing posture and later charge the golden glow, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5—dawn, roots, window—so orientation is secure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake—revive sacred song—is signaled early; escalation is the arbor’s incremental illumination that forces her cracked-voice public performance, a visible price. Pressure tightens once, sufficiently for 800 words, but no second option is foreclosed; villagers’ scoffing remains off-stage threat rather than lived obstacle, keeping cost poetic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembered reciprocity emerges through the tendril’s heartbeat sync and the returned song; no character moralizes. Final image—leaf in pocket—quietly reweights earlier “half-finished trinkets” into living keepsake, offering resonant reconfiguration without stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s tinkerer eye: light fractures into rainbows, spirals “match.” Syntax lengthens during song, then shortens to breathless “giddy and breathless,” mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long cathedral sentence vs. staccato “She laughed.” Figurative layer is selective—no mixed metaphors—and information-dense: “tendril… newborn’s fist” does double sensory job. Only minor scaffold: “something older, something like” is filler that could compress, but it never touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Familiar “last believer revives nature” arc, but specificity of clockwork beetles, silver firefly flute, and grandmother’s nonsense lyrics freshens trope. Risk is moderate—lyric eco-fantasy in under 800 words—yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not borrowed.</comment>
