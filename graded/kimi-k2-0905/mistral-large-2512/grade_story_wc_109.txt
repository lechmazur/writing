<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “mildly obsessed” never manifests as a concrete, costly quirk. The final renunciation is signaled early and feels pre-decided, so the beat carries limited tension. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page; the oracle’s calm stays flat across the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map is completed in silence and the last star vanishes, re-weighting her world. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught by 25 % and holds. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-scoured fort, salt-slick stones, and crumbling gold leaf are tactile and selective. The pebble shore functions as micro-setting that constrains her ritual tracing. Final image of wind “mapped” returns environment to interior state, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate the booklet or remain haunted—arrives early. Pressure tightens once: booklet dissolves, forcing her to internalize the map. Cost is conceptual (loss of star, loss of need to speak) rather than viscerally felt; escalation is single-step, adequate for lyric mode but not high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-fullness emerges through imagistic repetition rather than statement. Final “let the silence be enough” reprises earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the conceptual repricing is gentler than high-band examples; emotional aftereffect is muted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to oracle’s perception; diction (“ambered hush,” “marbled blue”) is consistent and atmospheric. Rhythm modulates with long sentences that mirror tide-like accumulation; no head-hopping or register drift. Voice is distinctive without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. A few adjacent metaphors (“storm had clawed,” “marbled hush,” “ambered hush”) risk overlap but do not muddle closure. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; punctuation and tense clean.</comment>

<comment>Mystic cartography via silence is fresh, yet the arc—lonely seer deciphers cosmic text and transcends speech—echoes familiar lyric templates. Specific coastal imagery and the booklet-to-dust transition supply particularity that lifts the piece above cliché. Risk is moderate; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>
