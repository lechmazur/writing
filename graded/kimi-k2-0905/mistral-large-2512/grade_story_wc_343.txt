<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity is shown through tactile action (tracing charts, copying scratches) and a visible micro-choice (sneaking out at night). Interiority stays concrete, but the final “grin” is performed, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the beat feels single-note. Still, the earned cartographer moment carries credible cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern projection reconfigures the world-rule (“the airship is a compass”) with conceptual cost—every future route now depends on shadow-reading. Causality is clean: starlings → board → lantern → new wind. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt applied. One tightening beat suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Brass hull, ozone, chalk dust, and lantern etchings are filtered through Elias’s map-eye and constrain his bodily actions (kneeling, brushing, copying). The hopscotch board micro-setting directly enables the pattern discovery that triggers closure. Spatial choreography is flawless across the single night-span. No weather or larger geography is needed at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—earn the sigil by finding an unmapped route—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the hopscotch cipher becomes the only live option and forecloses safer study. Cost is conceptual but legible: mastery now depends on decoding living shadows. No reversal or antagonist is required under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge is written in living motion, not ink—emerges from starlings → chalk → light chain without statement. The final projection image reweights earlier “stranded luminance” scribble, delivering quiet CR. No moral is declared; ambiguity lingers about what unseen currents they now serve. Subtext is carried by gesture and pattern, not commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual map: selective attention to angles, dust, etched glass. Syntax lengthens with wonder (“its sails catching a wind that hadn’t been on any map”) yet stays within apprentice lexicon. No dialogue to test voice split; internal diction is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer is restrained—one sustained starling metaphor—so density never clogs the discovery beat. Information dual-loads action + atmosphere (“brass-plated hull glowing faintly under the last embers”). Final line lands on image, not explanation. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Hopscotch-as-cipher and starling-murmuration-as-map fuse into a fresh navigational logic that feels inevitable in hindsight. The antique airship trope is retained but repurposed as mobile astrolabe. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk is moderate: pattern-over-world rather than character peril, but coherence stays intact.</comment>
