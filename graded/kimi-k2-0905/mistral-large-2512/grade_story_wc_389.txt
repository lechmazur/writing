<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s envy-of-Kael motive is declared, not embodied; the only embodied beat is the trembling glove on the cobalt glass. The final claim of leadership lands without prior micro-choices that foreclose alternatives, so the cost feels asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crowd’s gaze pivots, Elias seizes the mantle, ancient shadows flare—cost is the lifelong solitude now weaponized. Causal chain is thin: the radio voice gives permission, but the crowd’s shift hinges on a spectral vision they somehow share without established rules, so the lens wobbles between causal and accumulative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stormlit observatory, cobalt portico, and lightning-scarred ridge are vividly etched and return to constrain the final confrontation; the cold glass bite recurs as tactile price. Spatial clarity holds from dome to valley platform; weather actively limits descent and frames the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Single tightening beat: Elias decides to descend and publicly contest Kael. Stakes (reclaim prophecy-leadership) are declared early, but pressure escalates only through the radio’s disembodied prompts rather than tangible obstacles; no resource or risk is visibly lost, so the price remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of usurping charisma with ancestral memory emerges through the shadow-vision stunt, avoiding overt thesis. Final image of “ancient shadows” reweights the portico’s earlier symbolism, but the crowd’s instant conversion feels too neat, blunting moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Elias’s sensorium—brass static, glass bite, wind howl—creating a prophetic cadence without head-hop. Compressed syntax under storm pressure (“boots slipping on wet stone”) modulates rhythm effectively; diction stays within the character’s arcane lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong imagistic density—“domes clawing like fingers of a drowning man”—but two mixed metaphors in the same line dull impact. Occasional scaffold (“He had spent thirty years…”) could be trimmed; otherwise rhythm propels descent without loops or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Radio-whispers-as-prophecy is familiar, yet coupling them with a cobalt mirror that projects imperial ghosts gives a fresh visual hinge. The valley-prophet rival trope is straight from dystopian playbook, but the inversion of audience allegiance via shared hallucination supplies a memorable inflection.</comment>
