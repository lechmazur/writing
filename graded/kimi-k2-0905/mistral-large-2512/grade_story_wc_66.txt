<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession is sketched through tactile detail—ink-stained fingers, the jar of dust—so his turn from passive listener to active “teacher of dust” feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only missing layer is a simultaneous contradictory impulse under peak pressure; his resolve hardens but never collides with an on-page doubt, so the cost is more observed than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust speaks “Listen,” crystallizing Elias’s new role and foreclosing the old silence. Causality holds—radio lyric → dust jar → spoken word—each step triggered by an on-page choice. The final image carries visible cost: the radio fades to static, leaving him alone with the glowing dust, a charged poise that reweights the premise. One minor scaffold: “He had what he needed” could be cut without loss, but it does not touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ember alcove is rendered through scent, temperature, and the radio’s pulse, anchoring time and place within the first 120 words. Micro-setting—the jar, the dial glow—functions as both prop and constraint, guiding Elias’s ritual. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating bodies or impossible moves. The mist outside remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—break the silence by teaching dust to speak—tightens once, when the lyric reveals dust as story-remnants and Elias begins the incantation. Agency is clear: he tunes, hums, gathers, and the dust finally forms a word. Cost is legible—the radio’s silence afterward signals a permanent shift in his tactics. A second tightening or external obstacle would have pushed higher, but the single escalation satisfies the 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory persists in the smallest detritus and can be re-voiced only by those willing to bear its solitude. No character states the thesis; the final “Listen” is an image, not a moral. The motif of glowing dust reweights from debris to archive, earning resonance without overt symbolism. Ambiguity remains—will anyone else hear?—inviting reflection rather than prescribing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—his fingers, his breath, his private laugh—creating a hushed, incantatory rhythm. Syntax lengthens during the song fragments, then shortens at the flash of speech, mirroring tension. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness is judged solely through narrative texture, which remains consistent and character-specific. The final sentence lands with cadential certainty without slipping into editorial uplift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive; every sentence either advances the ritual or deepens atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—dust “swirled like a tiny storm,” radio glow “spilled like liquid gold”—and never clusters into purple. No loops, scaffold, or register drift detected. One tiny filter-verb trio (“he began to glow… began to form… began to speak”) could be trimmed, but it occurs early and does not obscure the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “story famine” world and luminous dust-radio fusion feel fresh, yet the pirate-broadcast motif has prior literary echoes; the piece transcends them through sensory specificity and Elias’s quiet vocation. Risk is present—quiet lyric stakes instead of thriller beats—but the closure commits fully to its own logic. Transformation test passes: swap dust for seeds or radio for book and the emotional arc collapses. A hair more external complication would have lifted the score further.</comment>
