<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—tame the volcano vs. honor its wild voice—surfaces early and drives every tactile choice. The trembling hand that steadies after decoding the letter embodies earned shift; the cost (she will now “listen,” not control) is legible. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and alters tactics, meeting BRR exception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the floodgates become “listening,” not silencing, with conceptual cost—she surrenders absolute safety. Causal chain holds: letter decryption → reframed goal → final adjustment. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint (the mountain’s breathing) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Amphitheater-as-body and surveyor’s chain-as-river compress setting into micro-objects that constrain choice. Volcano breath and shifting stone charge the final image of “dancing” with the past. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s engineer gaze—brass gears, cracked wax, metal temperature—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean; no weather clichés.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—valley safety vs. cultural memory—tightens when letter rewrites floodgates from betrayal to dialogue. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed. Cost visible: she abandons failsafe control and accepts shared risk. Agency drives turn; coincidence only complicates (warm chain hints prior visitor).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through water-as-voice motif: control silences, listening liberates. No explicit thesis; final “dancing” image reweights earlier “betrayal” without moralizing. Subtext in envelope notches and chain warmth invites second reading. Ambiguity remains—volcano may still erupt—yet stance is crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—gears “whisper,” adhesive “glints like dried tears.” Rhythm compresses under pressure: “She laughed, a sound that was slyly heartfelt.” No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Diction stays within engineer lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“silver river,” “dried tears”—never muddles causality. Information density high: chain unspooling also signals prior presence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; closing line “They were dancing” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Volcano-heart-as-water而非fire flips expected disaster trope; surveyor chain becomes decryption key. Premise feels specific to this valley and this engineer. Risk taken in quiet, lyric ending rather than eruption spectacle. Could edge higher if chain cryptography were seeded earlier; still, synthesis is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
