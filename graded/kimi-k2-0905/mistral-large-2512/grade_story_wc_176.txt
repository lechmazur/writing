<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—guilt over forgetting rather than the original disaster—grounds every micro-choice; the rope-braiding beats embody “technically gentle” and the final hum of names is earned. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The only bar to 9+ is that the forgiveness itself is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each new braid-layer thickens the pattern until the rope’s vibration delivers the resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable felt cost—“the names were safe now… warmth of forgiveness.” Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure is on-page, final image reweights all prior hollow/void imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum, aurora pulses, frost-stiff rope, and breath-warmed fibers are filtered through caster’s tactile priorities; every sensory note constrains the braiding action. Micro-setting (rope as tool) charges the final vibration. One sentence of mild register drift (“conceptual repricing”) is outside POV lexicon but does not touch closure. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—signaled early; pressure tightens when each braid refusal/acceptance micro-choice narrows options under “technically gentle” constraint. No external antagonist needed; escalation is accumulative density. Cost legible in final rope-hum. Could edge higher if one intermediate obstacle (e.g., fiber snap) had forced a trade-off on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as living vibration versus cast void—emerges through braiding action and aurora heartbeat, never stated. Final image reweights hollow/void motif without moralizing. Subtle counter-readings possible (is preservation another form of possession?). One minor echo of “forgotten too easily” skirts thematic label but lands early enough to avoid sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is caster-sensory (temperature, malleability, vibration). Rhythm modulates with long breathy sentences during braiding, then short pulses at climax. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Filter verbs are voice-motivated. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop (“names now preserved… not let them stay forgotten”) mid-story; does not touch closure. Mixed metaphor check clean. High information density, zero typos. Final line crystallizes earlier river-of-sound image with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-melody-encoded-in-rope is fresh; lost-wax craft transposed to sound-braiding offers specific occupational lens. Aurora-as-heartbeat recasts familiar northern-light trope into living listener. Risk taken in quiet, non-dialogue accumulative structure pays off. Slight deduction for proximity to “names in fabric of time” phrasing—close to stock idiom.</comment>
