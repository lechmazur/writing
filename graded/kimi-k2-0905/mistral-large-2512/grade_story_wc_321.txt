<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through calm micro-choices under pressure, but interiority stays generic (“his chest tightened”) and the climactic speech is unconflicted. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the commuters’ disappearance costs him nothing and he ends unchanged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ferry still, the lantern steady, the commuters gone—cost is felt in the emptied space. Causal chain is thin, however; the hourglass hum but no beat shows Elias using it, so the merge feels willed rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Spectral grotto, salt-worn timbers, ozone scent—details are selective and filtered through Elias’s practiced eye. Stars-as-loom image recurs and charges the final bridge of light, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep the ferry from vanishing”—is declared early; pressure escalates when echoes board. Yet Elias faces no trade-off; the merge succeeds without forfeiture, so cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of time-as-tide emerges through recurrent water and star imagery; the empty hourglass reweights meaning when it hums at the climax. Final image of steady lantern implies endurance without moralizing, though insight stays safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is maritime and tactile. Rhythm modulates from long lyrical cadences to clipped bridge dialogue; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and texture; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. One scaffold pair (“He knew what that meant. The ferry was vanishing.”) and a few filter verbs keep it from the 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Time-adrift ferry trope is refreshed by sideways clocks and commuter echoes; star-bridge merge feels inevitable yet not over-familiar. Risk is moderate—lyric speculative rather than structural innovation.</comment>
