<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren’s grief for lost wonder is embodied in the tremor of her hands at the end, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“bridge,” “thread,” “cathedral”) that tells us the emotional arithmetic rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. The only micro-choice that costs her is the sustained song; everything else—planting, touching bark, exhaling—reads as ritual confirmation of what she already intends. Because the travelers’ echoes supply the decisive magic, her agency is observational, so the renunciation feels gentle rather than freighted with a visible price. Still, her tactile intimacy with the tree and the orchard’s history keeps her from sliding into archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bud’s ruby-gold swirl visibly reweights the world’s color palette and confirms the orchard’s rebirth, with Maren’s trembling hands supplying felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each refrain of her wordless song thickens the shimmer until the travelers cross, not because/therefore but by density. Orientation is clear by line 5; the waterfall–parapet–tree anchors hold. The piece obeys single-scene default, one transition (seed → shoot), and the mosaic pattern is not taught, so lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The parapet’s runoff soil and the waterfall’s mist are not backdrop; they literally enable the shoot’s first drink and final shimmer, so environment constrains outcome. Sensory triage is POV-loyal: Maren notices bark temperature, sap scent, and color shifts first, sound second, aligning with her arborist gaze. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, pressing seed, sitting back—no floating bodies. The “upside-down trees” myth is the one detail that edges toward tourist-catalog exoticism, but it is filtered as her speculative memory, not world-guide fact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightens through the seed’s sprouting and the travelers’ return, a single deepening rather than reversal. Pressure is lyrical, not causal: each leaf adds chromatic density until the world’s palette is irreversibly repopulated; the cost is the exhaustion visible in Maren’s tremble. No antagonist or trade-off narrows options; the risk is failure of imagination, not external opposition. Escalation stays within Accumulative bounds and reaches legible intensity, but the absence of a foreclosed option keeps it just below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through color’s return rather than statement: the story argues that wonder is not nostalgia but living pigment that can be re-sung into being. The travelers-as-seeds image reconfigures ancestry as collaborative germination, avoiding moral binaries. Subtext resides in Maren’s wordless hum—her refusal to name the color she saves keeps it from commodification. The ending’s “radiant hush” is a Charged Poise that invites counter-readings: rebirth may also mean the orchard will again be lost, so complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Maren’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens and softens during the song, mirroring breath control; short clauses return at the tremble, a rhythmic echo of fatigue. Diction stays rural-metaphoric—“gnarled,” “runoff,” “wind chimes”—never drifts into academic register. The lyric elision (“not in words, but in hums”) is taught early and paid off at closure, so compression reads intentional rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “silver thread woven through the hush” is singular and sustained. One scaffold pattern—“seed was not just a bridge, but a vessel”—is allowed because it serves as conceptual pivot. Information density is high; most sentences do two jobs (image + causality). The only overwrite risk is the triple adjective swirl (“gold and crimson” repeated) but it culminates in the final bud, so the repetition is purposeful cadence rather than decoration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inversion of colonization myth—travelers planted here, then faded—flips familiar orchard-origin tales. The “color of wonder” as literal photosynthetic pigment is a fresh materialization of abstract nostalgia. Risk is taken in the wordless climax, yet coherence holds. While echoes of “ruby apples” and “starlight roots” nod to fairy-tale tropes, they are re-specificized through Maren’s arborist craft, so template DNA is transformed rather than copied.</comment>
