<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “kindly methodical” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices—glove adjustment, finger on cuneiform, deliberate seed insertion—so the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak; the ache at “almost brush its edges” shows contradictory tenderness and scientific detachment. The only bar to 9 is that the cost (permanent solitude? lifelong vigil?) is implied rather than dramatized on her body or future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cuneiform rewrite reweights the premise—spirit migration is real, physics revised—while the notebook act makes the cost visible (she is now the new bridge). Causal chain holds: seed → fissure → script shift → her vow. Orientation is swift; “above the clouds” by line 1, no penalty. Lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative; the final cadence shift satisfies the tightening test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The metallic arbor is no backdrop; its pulsing bark, fissure depth, and warming alloy constrain every action and supply the literal socket for the seed. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the tree’s vibration through her bones charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight—no visual overload—yet “scent of rain before a storm” gives atmospheric mirror. Missing 9 only because weather never quite turns into an active obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reestablish connection—signals early and tightens once: the seed insertion irrevocably commits her to translator-bridge duty. Pressure is accumulative; each pulse raises the psychic temperature until the script flips. Cost is legible—she will spend her life translating—but not yet visceral (no cramp in her hand, no blood on the bark). Sufficient for 8.4; 8.8 would need a sharper physical price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-transformation emerges from the seed–script reweighting, never sermonized. The final “Only changed” reprises the guardian’s earlier line, turning epigraph into lived insight. Ambiguity remains: is she blessed or condemned? The emotional aftereffect lingers as awe rather than message. No thematic echo penalty; the insight is imaged, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—cuneiform as tactile code, spirit as electromagnetic field. Syntax is calm, slightly academic, matching her methodical kindness; no register drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. Final notebook line modulates to quiet resolve without voice slip. One clause—“her kindly methodical mind”—edges toward authorial label but is instantly grounded in action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative control is precise—“clouds shifted like a restless sea” is the only simile, earned. No scaffold, loops, or filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines bracket the arc with mirror pulses. Minor alliteration (“pulse…pocket…pressed”) reads intentional, not purple. Ready for print.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of cuneiform linguistics with quantum-botanical afterlife feels fresh; the “knowledge fruit” trope is inverted into a data-transfer capacitor. Specificity—gold-veined seed, metallic bark, script rearranging itself—makes the concept inseparable from this story. Risk is present but moderate; no formal acrobatics. Not quite 9 because the emotional arc (lonely scholar chooses service) is familiar beneath the shiny worldskin.</comment>
