<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is textured—her fingers “brushing” extinct engravings, the vibration “traveling up her arm”—and her micro-choice to read the scale-book crystallizes her arc. The contradiction between wanting to “coexist with the past, not be consumed” is dramatized, not declared. Yet the curator’s warning is received, not tested under pressure, so the relational crucible is absent and the final cost feels lightly weighted for 700 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library reconfigures around her, the past and present “coexist without conflict,” and the cost is the unspoken solitude she accepts. Causal chain holds: sundial-shadow → correct book → spoken words → architectural response. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3), one transition (memory shard) is cleanly handled. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure intensifies through pattern density rather than plot reversals—and the final image reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<comment>The tidal library is not postcard scenery: shelves rise and fall like breathing, the hum travels through floorboards into her bones, and the atomically reflective brass constrains her next search. Micro-setting (sundial surface, obsidian shelf) doubles as emotional barometer. Spatial choreography is immaculate—kneel, press palm, reach for scale-book—every object handled, never floating. Environment directly guides choice and charges the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate isolation into independence”—is signaled early and tightens once: the library’s rearrangement forecloses the option of remaining a passive archivist. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is the hum that forces her to speak the lost words. Cost is legible: she gains agency but remains alone under the crystalline dome. A second reversal or higher bodily price would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of using an anchor (sundial) to achieve buoyancy (independence). The final image—books drifting toward her like tide-pulled islands—reprises the coexistence motif without moralizing. Subtext hums in the curator’s warning and the unspoken price of solitude. The piece resists tidy closure: independence is not absolution, only a chosen burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual filter: she notices “creatures long extinct” first, light second, her own tremor last. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action (“She read aloud, her voice steady”). No dialogue, so voice is carried by tactile diction and rhythmic cadence that mirrors the stone-circle hum. The lyric compression is taught early and pays off in the final lit sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “atomically reflective” does explanatory double-duty for both surface and theme. Metaphors are coherent—tidal shelves, heartbeat of the world—and never mixed. One paraphrase loop (“she had learned… she had spent”) is forgivable at 700 words. Final paragraph avoids syntactic monotony, letting the last line ring without ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The reincarnation-library-sundial fusion feels inevitable, not stitched: extinct contemporaries, tidal architecture, and memory-as-vibration cohere into a singular mythic science-fantasy. Risk is taken in quiet climax—no explosion, only architectural inhale—but the pattern is taught early and earned. The premise could slide toward abstraction, yet tactile handling keeps it grounded. Not quite 9.0 because the conceptual leap is large and relies on lyric trust rather than dramatized rule-proof.</comment>
