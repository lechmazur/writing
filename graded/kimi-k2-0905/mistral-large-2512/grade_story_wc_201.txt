<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s need to “quantify mercy” is concrete and idiosyncratic; the interiority stays physical (phantom pain, pulse-matched light) rather than diagnostic. The final refusal to keep drinking/seeking absolution is credible, but the stranger’s bone-mask is too lightly sketched to act as a true crucible, so the relational pressure promised in the prompt never fully materializes. Micro-choices (drinking the vial, reading the glowing numbers) track cleanly with his math-obsessed lens. Cost is present—he now carries the knowledge of when to stop—but the emotional price feels calibrated rather than raw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the equations rearrange, mercy is revealed as a variable, and Elias’s stance crystallizes into “knowing when to stop.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each ultraviolet image thickens until the grid appears and reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—UV forest, post-surgery, present-tense action by line 5. The vial beat supplies the single meaningful tightening required at this length; no off-stage shortcuts or resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>UV resin, ozone-metallic air, and pewter strap give tactile anchors that double as trauma triggers; the forest’s light pulses in sync with Elias’s heartbeat, integrating setting into body. Spatial choreography stays clean: strap found beneath chair → coiled in palm → edge glows after vial, tracking state change. The “ultraviolet penance” concept is learned through ingestion rather than exposition, satisfying world-rule consistency. Environment directly constrains the final image—he braces against the tree not for balance but to measure the new weight of mercy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can mercy be calculated?—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tested by the vial offer. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the geometric grid moment reweights all prior suffering into a usable formula. Agency is present—he drinks, he deciphers, he decides to stop—yet the stranger’s off-stage origin blunts the pressure gradient slightly. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, acceptable under the Accumulative lens but keeping the score just shy of the 8.2 gate for high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of Elias’s own tool: numbers that once predicted torture now predict the threshold of cessation. No character states the moral; the final line “knowing when to stop” is an image-bound answer. Subtext resides in the strap’s glow—mercy as a measurable yet portable burden. Complexity is honored: the equations remain amoral; they simply reveal the tipping point, leaving ethical weight on the human wielder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—numbers, geometry, phantom burns—without head-hopping. Syntax is clipped under stress (“He uncorked it and drank.”) then expands into lyric enumeration of floating equations, mirroring the vial’s cognitive dilation. The bone-mask stranger’s dialogue is minimal, dry-leaf diction, distinct from Elias’s numeric interior. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; voice modulation tracks pharmacological tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “ghost of its numbness clinging to his nerves” delivers tactile metaphor without purple spillover. Sentence rhythm accelerates into the vial burn, then fractures into short declaratives as the grid stabilizes, aligning syntax with revelation. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, body, or concept. A single mixed metaphor—“balance tipped into irredeemable cruelty”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of mathematical obsession with post-torture trauma feels fresh; the “mathematics of mercy” is not a stock trope. UV light as both interrogation weapon and revelatory sacrament reconfigures a familiar sci-fi glow into moral instrumentation. Risk is taken with the stranger’s unexplained ontology, but the story commits fully—no late retreat to realism. Specificity of the pewter strap’s numbered edge prevents the concept from drifting into abstraction.</comment>
