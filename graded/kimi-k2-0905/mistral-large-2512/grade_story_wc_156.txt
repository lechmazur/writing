<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s “methodically playful” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—hovering fingers, nickel flip—that tilt the scaffold and the stakes; the final surrender to the archangel’s question costs him certainty and is earned by these visible quirks. Interiority stays concrete, but the fourth awakening leans on abstract sensation (“coiled around ribs”) rather than embodied contradiction, keeping him just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the trumpet lifts, the nickel burns, Elias is invited through—cost is the foreclosed path of safe restoration. Causal chain (nickel contact → dishes spin → mural opens) holds; orientation is anchored by 80 words. One minor causality bump: the garden’s autonomous tilt is asserted, not cued, but the effect is paid off in the same beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden, scaffold glass, and nickel form a micro-setting triad that constrains every move: parabolic tilt limits retreat, cracked glass forecloses safety, nickel becomes key. Selective sensory hierarchy—fogged breath, spinning rims—keeps texture urgent and POV-filtered. The garden’s physics is lightly hand-waved (dishes pivot without motive), but the image charges the final threshold enough to touch 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve professional certainty vs. surrender to unknown—tightens at each awakening; the fourth turns the screw by weaponizing the very tool (nickel) he fondles for reassurance. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each brushstroke removal narrows options until only the doorway remains. Price is legible (burning palm, cracking scaffold), though the garden’s agency could carry a sharper cost cue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as living portal, not relic—emerges through nested images rather than statement; the nickel’s reprise reweights the premise from curiosity to summons. Final image of trumpet-as-question offers Conceptual Repricing: restoration becomes initiation. No moralizing, only charged ambiguity whether curiosity is vocation or trap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a precise perceptual signature—pianist metaphor, “pause between question and reply”—that modulates under pressure into shorter, breathless clauses. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elias’s restorer lexicon. Compression (“sound wasn’t random; it was a language, or the shadow of one”) teaches the lyric pattern early and pays it off at the threshold beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet sonorous: varied sentence openings, strong verbs (“shivered,” “flaring”), no scaffold loops. One mixed metaphor stretch—“bell flaring like a flower in fast motion”—slightly blurs metal botany but occurs pre-peak and doesn’t dull the final image. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates cleanly into the last line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing sound-sculpture garden, hobo nickel, and nested mural yields a fresh occult-restoration myth that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—angelic doorway via carved coin—commits fully without gimmickry; specificity of parabolic dishes and buffalo ridges anchors the surreal. The synthesis is non-obvious yet coherent, meriting the +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
