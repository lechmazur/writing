<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora’s pruning-rough hands, the letter’s ash on her skin, and the micro-choice to watch the bus leave give embodied contradiction; the final hand-brush is earned. Yet the interior line “I finally understood that love isn’t about fitting perfectly” drifts into diagnostic-speak, softening the peak beat and keeping her from a full 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hand-brush reconfigures their stance with the felt cost of past hurt still unerased. Causal lens holds—because the letter arrived, she waited; because he arrives after the last bus, reconciliation becomes the only live option. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber pavilion canvas rippling “like a living thing” and the frost-bent vines supply tactile, POV-filtered specificity that mirrors internal give. Environment does not directly constrain the final choice (no one is blocked by a locked gate or weather), so the 9-band gate is missed, but atmosphere is vivid and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she reopen her heart—is signaled early and tightens once: the burned letter forces her to stay after the bus leaves, narrowing exit options. The hand-brush costs her the shelter of old grievance; price is legible. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vine/olive-root imagery: love as slow co-habitation of unlike organisms. Final image of swaying vines offers non-literal answer without moralizing. The “destined mismatches” line in paragraph 5 is a near-thesis utterance, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Liora’s tactile attention; perceptual signature is consistent—“breath fogging the window,” “calloused fingers.” Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped dialogue under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. One paraphrase loop—“the way the amber light caught the silver at his temples” immediately after describing his eyes—drops it from 8+. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vineyard-reconciliation frame is familiar; freshness comes from the burned letter as palimpsest and the grandmother’s botanical mismatch metaphor. Risk level is moderate—no structural experimentation—so the score sits mid-high band.</comment>
