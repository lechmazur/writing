<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s memory gift and subterranean exile are vivid, but his interior contradiction—why the laughter compels him to “bring them home”—is asserted rather than dramatized. The final step through the golden door feels willed by the story, not by a visible internal split that costs him anything we can feel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dream→painting→door sequence supplies a coherent causal chain and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the laughter swells and Elias crosses. Cost is implied but not made visceral; the door opens because the story needs it, not because Elias’s prior choices have foreclosed any alternative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The amethyst cathedral is rendered through Elias’s charcoal-stained touch and the violet shadows that guide his gaze; the lock’s cold hum and the painting’s flaking paint constrain his next move. The cave’s light reappears in the final image, tightening the visual cadence and charging the threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“uncork suppressed creativity” and “bring them home”—are declared early; pressure tightens when the dream reveals the door. Yet the escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no choice narrows options until the turnkey moment, so the cost feels conceptual rather than lived.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The theme of art as resurrection emerges through charcoal ghosts lining the walls and the final golden spill that promises restitution. The laughter-as-homing-signal reweights the portraits from memorial to ferry, but the absence of a visible price keeps the resonance one beat short of piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter—“charcoal-stained fingers,” “knees popping in protest”—and the syntax lengthens then fragments in step with the rising laughter. No head-hopping; diction remains within a draftsman’s lexicon, and the final image lets the light speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, sensory hit, emotional tilt—without scaffold; metaphor is selective (“laughter poured out like honey”) and avoids purple drift. One paraphrase loop (“He had spent years down here…”) costs a −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with the beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Memory-wizard artist in a singing crystal graveyard is fresh, yet the portal-behind-a-painting beat leans on familiar gothic fantasy scaffolding. The lock’s broken dial and the laughter’s smoke-slither tilt the combination toward singular, but the final threshold glows a touch too generic.</comment>
