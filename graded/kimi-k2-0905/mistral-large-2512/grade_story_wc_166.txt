<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—yearning to remember yet fearing exposure—surface in her tactile micro-choice to grind the forbidden moonstone against her skin. The final decision to tattoo the man is earned: her isolation, the stone’s glow, and the widening star-gaps compound to make silence intolerable. Cost is legible: “You’ve made me a criminal twice over” simultaneously brands them both. Interiority stays concrete, though occasional poetic abstractions (“the cosmos breathing”) flirt with diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden darkens, the stone stills, and exile mutates from solitude into shared fate. Causal chain holds: moonstone heat → star-gap perception → tattoo act → joint outlawry. One soft spot: the nostalgia ban’s off-stage brutality is told, not shown, slightly diluting the causal punch. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The twilight garden’s salt wind, moss-slick stones, and star-gaps are filtered through Liora’s dancer body, constraining her barefoot balance and guiding her finger-dance of ink. Spatial choreography is exact: stones, undergrowth, wrist proximity track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and kinesthetic over visual, apt for a tide dancer. Environment mirrors internal shift: dusk edge mirrors her move from isolation to alliance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“dance the tides in silence or be heard”—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the moonstone’s spontaneous anchor converts passive memory into active criminal tool, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: shared outlawry, “nailed to the city gates” risk. Agency is micro but decisive: finger-dance transfers sea-myth onto skin, crystallizing exile dyad.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of forbidden memory emerges through gesture—moonstone rubbed in storms, inked waves on flesh—never abstract lecture. Subtext peaks when the tattooed man laughs “like breaking waves,” equating art and crime. Final image of wind carrying salt reweights exile from loss to erotic solidarity. No thematic echo sentence; silence itself becomes eloquent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Liora’s proprioception: “toes curling against the earth’s pulse.” Syntax lengthens during ink-dance, mimicking tidal flow, then tightens into outlaw laughter. Diction stays within dancer-poet lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature: she reads the world as rhythm, gaps, salt, never as objects.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm surges and retreats like surf; sentence openings vary, avoiding template cadence. Metaphors are coherent: star-gaps as breathing cosmos, ink as sea-in-vessel. One paraphrase loop: “salt-laced breeze... lover’s whisper” revisits salt in next paragraph. No mixed metaphors in peak tattoo beat; clarity intact.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: tide choreography + skin-poetry under nostalgia ban. Moonstone micro-grain as contraband ink is ingenious, inevitable in hindsight. Risk in second-person address (“you’ve made me...”) pays off by turning reader into accomplice. Not wholly original dystopia, but dancer-poet dyad feels singular.</comment>
