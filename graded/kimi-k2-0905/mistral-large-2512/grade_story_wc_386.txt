<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her skepticism, her methodical dream-collecting, her refusal to speak the final truth all emerge through embodied beats. The “salvager of echoes” self-label is the only diagnostic-speak slip, but it is brief and early. Her renunciation at the end is earned: every shard of evidence she gathers makes silence the costly, legible choice. Contradictory impulses (hunger for truth vs respect for the dead) coexist in-scene when she cups the globe and still walks away.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s decision to bury the truth is foreclosed by the prior accumulation of sabotage evidence and the red-coat apparition’s challenge, cost felt in the tear-like droplet. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each dream fragment tightens the pattern rather than causing a new external turn. Orientation is swift: who/where/when clear by line 5. No causal breaks; the sabotage revelation reweights earlier stakes without contradicting them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shrine, globe, and glacier constrain every move: warmth of the melted glass against ice, candle limit against darkness, final ripple in the globe charging the last image. Sensory selection stays urgent—saltwater smell in sheets, breath fog on ice—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; Mara’s body and the altar remain anchored across beats. Environment mirrors interior: the “groaning” ice externalizes her relief after the choice to seal the truth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to unmask the quartermaster—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when each dreamer’s fragment forecloses the accident theory. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes the woman is not victim but perpetrator; this reweights all prior evidence and narrows her options to silence or public accusation. Cost is visible: the shrine’s hush after she decides to “never tell” is the forfeiture of moral clarity she sought. Agency remains hers throughout—she collects, synthesizes, and finally withholds.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: some truths destroy the living more than they honor the dead. No character articulates a moral; the final image of borrowed starlight reframes the entire quest as a necessary burial. Subtext lives in gesture—the single tear-drop globe replaces any speech about guilt. The red coat shifting from warning to indictment to silent plea supplies a charged motif that reconfigures meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter: “she believed in windows of connection,” “she cupped the globe.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure—sentence fragments mirror breath as she decides to leave. No head-hopping; the red-coat woman’s dialogue is reported within Mara’s sensory frame. Voice remains distinct and consistent, with rhythmic control that accelerates toward the final beat then releases into the starlit hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare—only “glacier’s ancient breath,” “borrowed starlight”—each earns its place and charges closure. One minor scaffold: “she’d been analyzing cameo appearances…” tells a method that could have been shown in one micro-beat, but the lapse is brief and early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ghost-whispering wreck-diver who refuses to whisper the final ghost is a fresh inversion; the sabotage twist on a 1920s Arctic liner feels inevitable only after the last shard clicks. Specificity—Reykjavik baker, Nuuk fisherman, Oslo librarian—grounds the global pattern in lived detail. Risk is taken with the quiet ending: no public reveal, only moral reconfiguration, yet coherence holds. The synthesis of salvage ethics and ghost-story eeriness is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
