<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s grief-loneliness is viscerally embodied (“gnawed at her ribs”); the vial-as-mother’s-gift motivates the climactic surrender. Interior contradiction—clinging to the unopened scent while chasing others’ memories—peaks when she uncorks it, dissolving the diver and her own nostalgia in one beat. The cost (empty vial, last link to mother gone) is legible on the final line, earning a Resonant Reconfiguration. Minor slip: the diver’s dying words feel slightly expository, blunting micro-choice immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the temple’s silence shifts from predatory to “vast,” Lira’s empty vial the visible price. Causal chain holds—signal leads → temple feeds on memories → vial offered → current released. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One causal gap: how the perfume’s starlight “unsnarls” the hush is asserted more than shown, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Abyssal pressure groans through hull and rebreather seal; salt-laced dark, coral-encrusted spires, and “honeyed poison” air are filtered through Lira’s survival attention. The vial’s cold weight against thigh and the statues’ outstretched hands constrain her final gesture. Micro-setting (body-suit-tool) literally charges the closure when the emptied crystal reframes the temple’s silence. One hairline slip: “ceiling lost in darkness” is generic placeholder amid otherwise razor specifics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve sender before O₂ expires—is signaled early and tightens as the needle flirts with red. The temple’s memory-current externalizes internal stakes: surrender mother-scent or die. Agency crystallizes in the uncorking, foreclosing retrieval and motherhood alike. Cost is visible (diver dissolves, vial empty), though escalation is single-step rather than iterative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—ephemeral memory must be met, not mined—emerges through gesture, not thesis: statues offering “something just out of reach,” vial’s release, silence turned spacious. Subtext in the final image (empty vial = acceptance of impermanence) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. No echo of prompt language. Minor deduction for thematic articulation via diver’s last speech; still earned by embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lira’s perceptual bias—starlight scent, “honeyed poison” tongue, suit hum muffled. Syntax lengthens underwater, then fractures as O₂ dwindles: “She had minutes, maybe less—” mirroring pulse. No head-hop; diction stays within a salvager’s lexicon. One clause drifts toward omniscient (“the abyss would remember her”) but reads as poetic license justified by final resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, pressure, metaphor—without clogging tempo: “coral-encrusted edges slicing through the gloom.” No loops, no filter stacks. Figurative density peaks at climax yet remains legible. A single mixed vehicle (“liquid starlight”) is forgiven because the vial’s impossibility is established as inherited lore.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Combines deep-sea salvage, memory-eating ruin, and scent-as-key in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet unseen. The “gathered hush” as palpable current reframes classic ghost-temple into biomechanical metaphor. Risk taken: dissolving the sender into light motes sidesteps corporeal rescue, but cost is felt. Not quite 9 because premise still orbits familiar “sacrifice relic to appease place” orbit, albeit with fresh sensory wiring.</comment>
