<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-strained caution versus the need to weaponize her father’s nib—play out in embodied beats (gloved fingers, blood-bright ink). The decision to “intervene” is earned: each letter she drafts visibly forecloses retreat and binds her to the shovel-and-printworks risk. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; the heirloom nib carries paternal accusation that sharpens her resolve. Only the journalist remains off-page, so status/relationship crucible is not tested; within single-POV limits, motivation is vivid and escalation legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because the archives are scrubbed, therefore she writes; because the nib is intact, therefore murder is assumed; because proof-by-contradiction is inherited, therefore letters → printworks → exhumation. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “Then I won’t” crystallizes options and cost under the observatory witness. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—midnight sealing of wax—marks the point of no return with felt cost. All linkage survives the high-band test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Observatory as micro-setting constrains every move: the brass telescope swivels from sky to city, the gaslight limits visibility, the wind on the balcony physically tugs her coat as she commits. Rosewood nib doubles as tool and setting-in-hand, its grain dictating grip and memory. Sensory triangulation—iron-gall scent, molten wax hiss, radio crackle—filters through Elara’s stargazer bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms or impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when the archive footnote appears. Agency drives escalation: each letter narrows her tactical space and raises social/existential cost. The midnight wax seal is the visible price that forecloses anonymity. No coincidence resolves; journalist warning complicates rather than saves. Pressure coheres under causal lens without slack loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited observation weaponized against erasure emerges through image pattern—ink, sky, print—never exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: pressing the nib into wax = filial oath made indelible. Final image of stepping “into the light” reweights the observatory’s traditional upward gaze into a ground-level confrontation, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: success is not guaranteed, only chosen.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice carries stargazer precision—“orbits of regret in the way streetlamps flickered”—yet stays concrete under pressure. Syntax lengthens for reflection, then fractures into telegraphic radio reply, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Elara’s. Diction stays within her educated lexicon; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “The nib had snapped…not from clumsiness, but from the force of writing the final word” advances plot, deepens character, and re-tools motive in one breath. Rhythm modulates from long reflective cadences to staccato final exchange, supporting momentum. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent. Iron-gall scent, molten wax, and wind gust provide tactile propulsion without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: astronomical observatory repurposed as investigative war-room, merging celestial mechanics with investigative epistemology. Proof-by-contradiction becomes lived inheritance rather than abstract device. Risk is taken—letters, shovel, printworks—yet causality stays intact. Specificity of rosewood nib and overwritten obituaries prevents swap-out genericity.</comment>
