<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “courageous anomaly” is asserted but never dramatized as a contradictory impulse; the interiority is poetic but generic (“weight in his chest lifted”). The final act—hurling the shard—aligns with stated motive, yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals a competing value, so the change feels pre-declared rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lighthouse beam reweights the premise with conceptual cost (“reconstituted the light”). Causal chain holds—fragment → mirrors → path → beast → dissolution—though the mirrors’ rule-set is late-introduced and the village’s vulnerability is told, not tested, slightly blunting cost visibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orchard-lighthouse-ice triad is vividly sketched in compressed, sensory strokes; the “gnarled apple trees clawed at the frigid air” anchors POV bias. Micro-setting (the crystal warming in palm) constrains the decisive beat. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the mirrors’ interior layout remains white-room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“ice will claim us all”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the path opens and the beast breaches. Escalation is linear, not recursive; no option is foreclosed on-page, so cost feels prospective rather than paid. Still, agency drives every beat under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges through the mirrors’ externalized fear and the final image of shared stillness. Subtext stays implicit; the child’s smile reconfigures meaning without moralizing. The concept never deepens past its first articulation, keeping resonance at solid rather than luminous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“shadow-laced,” “frigid air”) is textured and POV-consistent. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under peak pressure (“He didn’t know if it would work…”). No dialogue to test voice divergence, yet narrative voice carries perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-rich, largely loop-free; occasional poetic overlap (“ice screamed”) is earned. One scaffold paraphrase (“weight in his chest lifted”) repeats prior release without new charge. Strong verbs dominate; metaphors stay coherent. Final line lands with cadence that re-illuminates prior motifs.</comment>

<comment>Lighthouse orchard above shifting ice feels fresh; the mirrors-as-oracle twist refracts familiar chosen-one beats. The “reconstitute” mechanic risks abstraction, but the shard’s mirror-born path literalizes it. Risk is moderate—no structural gamble—yet specificity of frosted arboreal sentinel keeps the concept memorable.</comment>
