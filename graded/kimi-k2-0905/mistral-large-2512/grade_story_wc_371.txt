<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through an on-page contradiction or micro-choice; the bread-eating is passive, the seed-planting is obedient. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“weight in his chest felt lighter”) rather than embodied tension. No contradictory impulse is acted out under pressure, so the final gesture feels granted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a gentle Conceptual Repricing: the seeds in soil re-weight the premise that absolution must be grown, not granted. Causality is soft—Elias is told, then complies—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds because the final image crystallizes the pattern of slow persistence. Cost is present but diffuse; the loaf is already consumed, so the price feels retrospective rather than a fresh forfeiture that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is selective and POV-filtered: frost, yeast scent, damp soil, steam from tea—each detail is tactile and stakes-bearing. The tea-house micro-setting supplies the table for the bread offering and the window-ledge for the seeds, so environment constrains the final choice. The “overgrown palace courtyard” never complicates movement or resource, keeping it just shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can memory-loss be resisted?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: when Elias realizes no one else remembers the bakery. The seed-planting is acceptance, not a tightening that narrows options; no visible price is paid on the page after the choice. Under Accumulative lens the single deepening is sufficient, but the lack of live cost caps the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as seed that must be secretly replanted—emerges through image rather than statement. The bread’s ghost-taste and the unnamed seeds reconfigure meaning without moralizing. Final line’s bird-call out-of-season offers quiet irony that reweights “ordinary sacred,” but the reprise is faint, not charged enough for the highest band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual bias: filtered, winter-lean, scent-anchored. Syntax lengthens with reflective beats, then shortens during seed-planting, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hop; diction remains within plausible lexicon for a quiet city observer. Voice is consistent but not yet idiosyncratic enough to be unmistakable.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative layering is restrained and purposeful. One scaffold echo—“the way things slip… the way the river…”—is allowed because it teaches the pattern. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts are crisp. A single paraphrase loop (“real… real… real”) nicks the final third, disallowing 9+.</comment>

<comment>The “vanishing bakery no one remembers” is a fresh emotional engine; guerrilla-gardening-as-absolution is an unexpected synthesis. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but the combination feels specific to this narrator’s winter-city loneliness. Could use one more concrete detail that could not appear in any other story.</comment>
