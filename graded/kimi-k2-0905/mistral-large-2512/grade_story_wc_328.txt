<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with “the hum” and his refusal to release the phone give him a clear, escalating motive. Interiority is concrete—arrowhead burns, fingers translucent—yet the final beat drifts toward aphorism (“punchline”) rather than embodied cost, muting the earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s metamorphosis is irreversible, cost visible in glowing veins. Causal chain holds—arrowhead warms, phone invites, he accepts—though the moment of consent is compressed to a single smile; a beat of explicit choice would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Damp-earth mint, pulsing foxfire, and the yellowed phone create a tactile micro-setting that actively pressures Elias. The underground garden’s “gravitationally playful” air is more asserted than demonstrated, but the final image of translucent flesh lets the environment rewrite his body, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—survive the garden’s rewrite—tightens when the phone’s invitation turns his body translucent. One meaningful escalation suffices, yet the cost is more shown than felt; a sharper forfeiture (voice? memory?) would have lifted the beat into the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “bitterness as punchline” emerges through Elias’s embrace of cosmic irony rather than exposition. The reweighting is legible—joke overtakes fear—but the final aphoristic line slightly abstracts the cost, keeping the resonance just shy of the 9-tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent: crushed-mint air, arrowhead “pressing like a promise,” static that “crackles with voices that aren’t quite voices.” Syntax stays controlled under pressure; no head-hop or register drift. A hair more idiosyncrasy in Maren’s brief speech could have nudged 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective, never crowding a single beat. No loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold—“the way the air bends here” repeated near midpoint—dulls momentum slightly; trim would clear 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Missing return” and haunted cordless phone remix folk-horror tropes, but the gravitational garden and flint arrowhead tether the uncanny to botanical specificity. Risk is evident; the metamorphosis commits fully. A fresher angle on the phone-static voices could push 8.8.</comment>
