<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s root-bound paralysis is vivid, but the arrival of the woman collapses his agency; he never actively chooses the intersection, only assents. The scar-link method is shown once in memory and once passively touched—no micro-choice alters tactics. Interiority is atmospheric but generic (“fear, hope, anxious elation”) rather than embodied contradiction. Earned stasis is implied, yet the cost feels off-loaded onto the dream-realm rather than paid by Elias in the glade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star-plain image reweights the covenant and the clipping’s pulse supplies felt cost. Causal chain is thin—pluck → meet → shift planes—but the dream-logic lens holds. Orientation is swift; the glade’s bruise-color and dusk light anchor by line 3. One non-closure slip: the woman’s sudden materialization skirts prior cause, yet coincidence is allowed under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt bruise-color, ozone scent, and bark-split blood give tactile specificity; the glade’s whispering trees function as micro-setting that pressures Elias to listen. Spatial tracking is clean: clipping in palm → labyrinth center → dusk edge → star plain. Weather and light evolve with beats, mirroring tension. The maze hedge could constrain movement more actively, but the description still charges the final otherworldly tilt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remake the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and tightened when the clipping pulses against his scar. Escalation is lyrical, not causal: atmosphere thickens, woman appears, plane shifts; options narrow only metaphorically. No tangible price is exacted from Elias before the threshold crossing, so pressure feels aesthetic rather than jeopardy-driven. Sufficient for short-form lyric escalation, but lacks a tactic-altering reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of fractured dreams vs. reparative imagination emerges through image pattern (scar, root, clipped leaf) rather than statement. Final star-strewn plain offers Conceptual Repricing: the covenant’s cost is vast unknowability, not moral lesson. Subtext in the woman’s “sad and triumphant” smile complicates hope with mourning. One soft echo: “the future had arrived early” is repeated without new inflection, slightly dulling resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains cobalt/ozone diction and rhythmic parallelism (“rooted… bleeding… whispering”) that mirrors Elias’s trance state. Perceptual signature is consistent—synesthetic color-scent and arboreal pulse. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Compression in the final paragraph (“world tilted”) is taught by earlier dream-logic, so elision reads intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet musical; mixed metaphors are controlled (“bruise deepening” beside “ink into parchment”) and serve mood. One scaffold loop: “the future had arrived early” appears twice with no additive pressure. Strong verbs dominate—“plucked,” “traced,” “tilted”—and sentences vary across paragraph breaks. No artifacts intrude on the closure beat; clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dream-covenant via topiary key is fresh; scar-as-modem for collective dreams repurposes body-horror trope into lyric mode. Specificity of cobalt glade and clipped maze leaf prevents abstraction drift. Risk lies in elliptical causality, but dream-logic is declared early and followed through. Not radically novel, yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
