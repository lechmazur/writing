<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is viscerally embodied; the broken watch and snapped hour-hand are tactile micro-choices that externalize self-loathing. Interior contradiction peaks when he both craves and dreads the truth, yet the uncle’s arrival supplies knowledge rather than forcing Elias to mine it, so the final cost feels half-earned. Still, the renunciation of 3:17 lands with credible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because Elias falsifies pedigrees, he recognizes forged history in Liora’s file; because he combs driftwood he finds the carved spiral; because he finds it, the uncle must confess. Closure is a decisive change—snapping the hour-hand forecloses the alibi of frozen grief and commits him to pursuit—cost is visible in the broken brass. Orientation anchored by 70 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cobalt terrace light, tide-carved “ghost fingers,” and the pocket-watch’s brass each filter through Elias’s professional eye for faked patina; driftwood symbol constrains the search and charges the final image. Micro-setting (watch casing, splintered wood) doubles as pressure tool. One minor slip: shoreline geography sketched only after beat begins, but spatial choreography remains clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover whether Liora lives—signaled by paragraph four. Mid-story tightening occurs when the spiral carving is found, converting suspicion into certainty and forcing the uncle’s confrontation. Cost is legible: Elias forfeits the comforting lie of 3:17. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word frame; no reversal, yet option set narrows decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—history as malleable commodity—emerges through Elias’s trade in false bloodlines and his father’s forged obituary for Liora. Subtext coils around the watch: time literally bought and sold, then broken when Elias refuses further payment in guilt. Final image of snapped hour-hand reweights premise without moralizing. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature favors forensic metaphors—“sieved hush,” “patterns in tide-worn grain”—consistent with genealogist’s gaze. Syntax lengthens under regret, then fractures in the final sentence, mirroring the snapped hand. No head-hop; diction stays within Elias’s lexicon. Dialogue sparse but subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors (“guilt was a sieve”) recur but each re-weights meaning. Clause rhythm accelerates toward the key acceptance, then snaps short—mechanical echo of hour-hand. One near-miss: “weight of unspoken words pressing… like a second heartbeat” borders cliché, but context rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar noir tropes—guilt-ridden fixer, family secret—are refreshed by genealogist-as-forger whose own past is forged. Driftwood cipher and broken watch supply specific, non-transferable engines; removing either collapses plot. Risk taken in quiet, internal climax rather than external rescue; coherence maintained. No derivative premise penalty applies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: first paragraph labels profession and guilt; Development: skill at spotting fakes lets him detect Liora’s doctored file; Closure: snaps watch to stop falsifying time—each beat depends on this exact character. Cost is felt in broken brass. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Appears in opening beat as broken second hand, re-appears when Elias pries it off, culminates when he snaps hour-hand—three functional touches that reweight meaning from frozen guilt to active truth-seeking. Object’s warmth and fracture carry emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Phrase seeded in paragraph two as “sieved hush” of breath; recurs when Elias realizes the past was “sieved” for him—concept shapes his dawning recognition that narratives can be filtered and edited. Not causal in middle beat, but closure reprise reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Trait stated early; used mid-scene when he recognizes forged police report, enabling spiral discovery. Creates immediate tactical advantage and moral irony—his own craft weaponized against him. Cost surfaces when complicity is thrown back at him.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>“Quell the noise” motivates terrace visit, leading to driftwood search; however, the actual turn (uncle’s confession) arrives externally rather than through further quelling effort. Still, initial quest frame depends on this verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Method introduced early, mechanics matter: he must handle each “ghost finger” until pattern match surfaces. Discovery of spiral directly triggers uncle’s intervention. Without sifting, no evidence, no plot advance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Terrace’s cobalt glow and dusk timing provide reflective space and visual metaphor for bruised conscience; altitude allows overlooking driftwood, linking setting to search. However, terrace itself does not constrain tactics—any quiet overlook would serve—so irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>“Under the weight of unspoken words” signals emotional clock, but no literal deadline operates; dusk deepens to night mostly as atmospheric marker rather than tightening window. Still, fading light cues final decision to leave at once.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Desire to uncover Liora’s fate is stated and re-stated, drives every action: terrace walk, wood search, key acceptance, watch destruction. Friction between want (truth) and fear of patricidal betrayal visible in trembling hands. Cost paid in snapped heirloom.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Tone of tempered regret established in opening image and sustained through diction (“sieved hush,” “bruised sky”). Modulates into flicker of resolve when key is taken, yet never escapes melancholy. Final snap carries poignancy without sentimentality, charging closure.</comment>
