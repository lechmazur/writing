<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The courier’s trembling hands and the pendant’s hum give us embodied stakes, but interiority stays generic (“wonder settled into her bones”). The final inward step is earned, yet her contradictory impulses (deliver vs. keep) are told rather than dramatized in scene. Mentor absence motivates but never complicates her on-page choice. Still, the micro-choice to turn inward supplies visible cost and lifts the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ridgeway empty, pendant spent, air still humming—cost is felt. Causal chain is thin (mentor → pendant → stranger → inward turn) but coherent under Hybrid lens; the “germinate” beat supplies the single required tightening. Orientation is clean by line 5. No teleporting props, yet the relic’s rules remain vague; that vagueness is tolerated because the final image reweights meaning rather than resolving plot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Aurora light, ozone scent, and shifting stones are filtered through courier perception and guide her final inward pivot. The ridgeway itself breathes, constraining her stance; micro-setting (pendant against collarbone) doubles as environment. Selective sensory hierarchy holds; no static postcarding. Meets 9- gate: the setting’s living breath charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—carry vs. become—is signaled early and tightens once: “germinate wonder” forces her inward renunciation. Pressure is coherent, not escalating in causal leaps but accumulating texture until the ridgeway breathes. Cost is legible: magic spent, path foreclosed. Sufficient for 600-word scope; lacks persistent constraint but lands the required deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—wonder as vocation, not destination—emerges from pendant, ridgeway, and final stillness. No moralizing; stranger’s single line “germinate wonder” is subtext, not thesis. Final image reweights prior deliveries as hollow, paying off mentor echo. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature (“fractured light,” “scent of ozone and old stone”) is courier-specific. Compression and elision (“towers of glass, rivers of silver”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; syntax modulates with pressure. Dialogue minimal but subtextual. Meets 9- gate on texture and control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, high-density, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is purposeful, not purple. One mixed metaphor (“ridgeway like a scar across the sky”) but clarity intact. Clean grammar and tense. Final line crystallizes without overwriting. Minor hairline keeps it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar arc—object chooses bearer, threshold crossing—but refreshed by aurora-cloak stranger and inward closure. Specific sensory detail and earned lyric lift it above template. Risk is moderate; no gimmickry. Transformation test: names/places could not swap without losing light-born texture. Fresh enough for elite tier.</comment>
