<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s pacifism is stated, not embodied; she never confronts an active choice that would test mercy, so the trait stays ornamental. The interiority is lyrically voiced but generic—no contradictory impulses play out in real time. Her final “smile” is unearned because the cost of becoming the wound is asserted, not dramatized. Still, the micro-choice to empty the locket does foreclose her path, giving a thin but visible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ship dissolves, the locket is empty, and Liora floats lighter—an undeniable before/after. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern (each photograph stitched → ship unravels into light) is taught early and holds. Orientation is swift: recycled ship, last pacifist, locked dimension, all inside 50 words. The only slip is the late claim “she wasn’t the one who needed to enter”—a motivational retro-patch that slightly blurs agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ship’s hull, algae glow, and curling photographs are tactile, selective, and filtered through Liora’s grief-attuned gaze. The micro-setting of the locket-against-photograph becomes the final constraint that triggers the dimensional gash. Gravity loosening is sensed through her bare feet no longer touching, marrying body to environment. One minor over-tell: “floating reliquary of human regret” abstracts what the corridor images already show.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the locked dimension—signaled in line 9 and tightened with each stitched photograph. Pressure escalates accumulatively: every suture thins the air and deepens shadows, a visible price that forecloses retreat. The final turn—she must become the wound—forces stance crystallization and costs her the locket and the ship itself. No reversal is needed; the deepening pattern suffices under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of sorrows into a single aperture of release; no character moralizes it. The photographs’ brittle smiles and missing button eyes particularize collective regret without abstract sermon. The final image—child laughing, soldier laying down gun—reweights the premise: mercy survives only by dissolving the vessel that carried it. Ambiguity remains whether this is transcendence or extinction, a complexity the story refuses to resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter: she traces “the shimmer of long-dried tears,” hears the ship “groan as if waking.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during stitching, then compresses into single-sentence paragraphs at the gash—rhythmic control under pressure. One register slip: “shadow work, the old texts called it” sounds expository amid otherwise seamless diction. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence either stitches atmosphere or advances the ritual. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—“a pocket of the universe where time had folded in on itself” is abstract but physically legible within the SF frame. Only micro-flaw: “the ship shuddered” repeats twice in quick succession, a tiny cadence echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The recycled ship as reliquary, sorrow-as-substance, and pacifist-as-surgeon synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh ritual logic. Kwan Yin’s Tear repurposes religious iconography without didacticism. The gravitational happiness trait is subtle world-building that doubles as emotional barometer. Risk is taken with the lyric structure, and it pays off in a closure that feels both inevitable and unrepeatable.</comment>
