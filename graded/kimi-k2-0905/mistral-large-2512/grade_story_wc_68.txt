<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “ink-stained fingers” and sewer exile give a vivid thumbnail, but interiority soon turns abstract (“refusing to let the past be smoothed over”). The decisive turn—surfacing to confront the fishermen—rests on a single sentence of resolve without showing contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices under pressure are missing between the cog study and the climb out, so the final cost feels asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias chooses to leave the sewer, re-weighting his isolation versus civic duty. Causality is clean—cog study → sediment timeline → decision—but the pivot from private obsession to public action happens in one expository line (“he would take his findings to the surface”). No intermediate beat tests or narrows his options, so the tightening is only conceptual; cost is implied, not dramatized. Accumulative lens holds, yet the final image lacks a palpable constraint or price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reek, damp stone, and brackish water ground the reader quickly; the chronometer cog performs as micro-setting, its “brass teeth worn smooth” anchoring texture. Spatial choreography stays coherent through the single location. Environment does not actively constrain the final choice, so it charges atmosphere more than tactics, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the “whispered” plague narrative—remains stable. Pressure builds only intellectually: sediment rings equal lies, but no external force (scholar patrols, rival historians, sewer collapse) complicates the excavation. The one meaningful tightening is internal; options narrow only in Elias’s mind, so escalation is textual rather than dramatic. Cost is present as future social risk, not on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—collective amnesia versus individual accountability—emerges through the cog’s sediment timeline and Elias’s contempt for “progress.” Subtext stays implicit, avoiding sermonizing. The final image reconfigures meaning: truth dragged from sewer to dock reweights whose voices count. Complexity acknowledged, yet theme is largely intellectual; emotional aftertaste is moderate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is erudite, salt-corroded, and consistent (“waterlogged parchment,” “rusted blades”). Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses at the exit beat, mirroring tension. No dialogue to test voice distinction; prose texture itself characterizes. One filter-verb cluster (“he realized how little…”) slightly dulls immediacy, but voice remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences show varied rhythm and strong verbs; information density is high—“sewers reeked… but Elias didn’t mind” layers stakes, attitude, and sensory data in nine words. Occasional lofted diction (“conceptual repricing” terrain) nudges register drift. No loops or mixed metaphor in peak beats; line-level artifacts are minor and do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Combining a marine chronometer cog with plague historiography gives a fresh investigative angle; sunken-city noir is familiar but salvaged by sediment-as-archive mechanic. The transformation risks little structurally—plot beats follow a standard scholar-ascends pattern. Specific brass grooves and harbor silt supply authenticating detail, yet emotional stakes stay generic rebel-vs-official truth. Solid particularity, not startling reinvention.</comment>
