<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s muteness and vocation are vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“the world below had forgotten how to speak”). The final act—shattering a child’s toy to feed the sculpture—carries cost, yet the choice is reported rather than dramatized, blunting the felt price and capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each shard adds chromatic density until the final sapphire lattice reweights the stake. Orientation is swift (bluff, dusk, lone tuner). Closure lands as Charged Poise—colors flare, child may remember—cost is the stolen toy and accelerating melt. One transition (descent/ascent) is clean; pattern taught early via “symphonies are uncovered.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bluff wind, frost bite, and spinning iceberg light are filtered through Elias’s tuner-biased senses. The sculpture’s silver arms and melting shard track spatially and constrain later tactics (must find next pigment source). Final image of sapphire lattice crystallizes the setting into the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder’s colors—is signaled early and tightens when the iceberg shrinks. Agency: Elias steals the orb, trades a child’s wonder for the sculpture’s song; the price (theft, faster melt) is visible. One meaningful intensification suffices for 700-word span; coincidence (storm-delivered ice) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: wonder as finite pigment, art as extraction. Subtext in the silent theft—Elias cannibalizes a child’s toy to keep the world bright—complicates the tuner’s saintly aura. Final lattice reframes prior shards; no moralizing statement, only image and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Elias’s tuner-perception: wind “hummed…into his bones,” colors “preserved in frozen water.” Rhythm modulates—short declaratives under pressure (“Winter was coming early”), longer coils during tuning. No head-hopping; patterned elision (“the silence was not empty”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech. High density: “kinetic sculpture of spun silver and hollow reeds” does triple duty (material, motion, sound). One paraphrase loop (“the bells remained. / And the bells remembered”) is purposeful incantation, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mute bell-tuner harvesting glacier pigment for wind-sculptures to reboot a color-drained world feels fresh; synthesis of climate grief and synesthetic craft is specific. Risk: lyric stillness could flatten tension, yet pressure holds via shrinking ice and stolen toy. Not a near-echo of familiar canon.</comment>
