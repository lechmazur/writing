<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and profession-specific, but the only micro-choice—sketching dust—arrives after the climax; no contradictory impulse is acted upon under pressure, so the “renunciation” of drama feels declared rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of continuing to watch reweights her vocation under the Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the quiet forfeiture of grander quests, though the beat is a single static stance rather than a tightened turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse shards, warped notebook, and damp bench constrain her movements and supply the microscope and dust map; the cracked glass recurs in the final auditory image, charging the closure with physical specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stake—learning humility through minutiae—is signaled early; pressure deepens once as she sees “constellations” in decay, but no option is foreclosed and the cost is conceptual rather than tactical, keeping escalation moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet persistence emerges from dust patterns and neutron-star echoes; the final sketch crystallizes the reconfiguration without moralizing, though the insight is single-note and lacks counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature—cosmic metaphors filtered through an astrophysicist’s gaze—modulates rhythm and diction, peaking in the microscope paragraph without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; a few near-adjacent echoes (“dust,” “storm”) and one mixed metaphor (“greenhouse groaned like a ship”) slightly dull the final third, but information density stays high and no loop obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Neutron-star mind-set colliding with butterfly-scale fragility offers fresh synthesis; risk is quiet rather than bold, but specificity prevents swap-out and the concept commits fully to its micro-cosmic inversion.</comment>
