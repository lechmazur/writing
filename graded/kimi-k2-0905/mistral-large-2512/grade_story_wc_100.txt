<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The undertaker’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is shown, not told, through his refusal to leave the lens alone and his solitary march into the sea; the stolen funerary book and the trembling hands give concrete interiority. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the interior conflict never sharpens under pressure; the final stillness is felt but not paid for by an on-page choice that costs him something visible. Character voice is consistent and specific, yet the absence of any live relationship or secondary character keeps the crucible narrow. Meets the 9+ quick test on causality but not on simultaneous contradiction, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lenses ignite, the city breathes, and the undertaker’s reading voice becomes the new “light,” a charged poise that reweights every prior beat with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is clean—lens arrival → memory → return → revitalization—each “because” link visible on the page. The reflective block (library memory) is anchored to the present object and tilts his stance, satisfying BRR. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors are clear by line 5. Lens holds accumulative/textural pattern to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The broken lens is the micro-setting that constrains every move: its weight, teeth-like edges, and refracted rainbows dictate pacing and bodily handling. The underwater library is sketched with three sensory strokes—salt-crisp pages, domed ceiling, stained glass glowing—yet each detail is filtered through the undertaker’s mortician gaze. Environment, tool, and body intersect when the lens hums against his palm, forcing him to kneel in the drowned aisle. Meets 9+ gate: the lens’s final glow is inseparable from the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rest must be given a permanent address”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the logbook entry forces a choice: become the keeper or let the drowned stay forgotten. One meaningful deepening occurs when he places his stolen book beside the broken lenses, turning personal guilt into communal duty. Cost is felt (the cold sea, the solitary walk), but no tangible loss (time, tool, social credit) is forfeited on the page, keeping the score below 8.8. Pressure accumulates under the textural lens; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the undertaker’s occupational paradox: he who seals the dead must now open the city of memory to keep the living from drowning in forgetting. The lens’s shift from fracture to glow reweights “rest” as an active, ongoing vigil rather than a terminal state. No moralizing line articulates this; the final image of golden light seeping through shelves supplies the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—will he ever leave?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to the undertaker’s mortician sensorium: every noticed detail (oilcloth, algae-slick sand, salt-crisp pages) carries death-care precision. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses as the sea rises, then exhales into longer, luminous sentences when the light returns, mirroring his inner stillness. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: “occupying impossible spaces had always been his gift” could only belong to this narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or theme. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“jagged edges catching the dim light like teeth”—then stops before overcrowding the climax. Syntax varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the lens motif. One hairline slip: “the water was clearer than he remembered” is mild tell, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of undertaker + drowned library + lighthouse lens feels inevitable in hindsight and could not swap genres without collapse. The notion that funerary rites can power a beacon for the drowned is a fresh emotional equation, not a trope twist. Risk is taken in the quiet, non-violent climax—reading aloud as apotheosis—yet coherence holds. Specificity of the stolen book on funerary rites anchors the concept in lived detail.</comment>
