<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora’s “warmly methodical” nature is shown through tactile, patient handling of the rope and seal, but her interior contradiction—curiosity vs. institutional caution—stays summary (“She had always dismissed them as myths”). The final resolve to archive truth is credible, yet the cost is asserted rather than embodied; no immediate social or professional price is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vanished door and new braid-pattern make the obliteration of House Vaelis undeniable and re-weight Liora’s future duty. Causal chain is clean—seal glows because rope is re-braided; vision is triggered because seal is touched. Orientation is swift: archivist, clock-tower, midnight, impossible door all inside 80 words. One minor slack: the voice from the shadows is never sourced or paid off, a dangling beat that slightly dilutes the final resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory triage—oil, parchment, warm wax—roots us inside the mechanism room and later inside the vanished hall. The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting: its tension and shifting glow physically constrain Liora’s fingers and decide when the vision releases her. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the door’s vanishing is anchored to the final chime. No environment detail is wasted; each smell or gleam feeds the next causal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Liora expose or bury the erased history—tightens once: the rope’s re-braiding literally narrows her options to “see truth” or “stay blind.” The vision of obliteration raises the cost from academic curiosity to moral complicity, a clear deepening. Agency is present (she chooses to keep braiding despite the warning voice), but no external obstacle or institutional pushback surfaces on the page, so the price feels prospective rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—how institutions manufacture absence—emerges through the glowing seal and re-patterned rope, never sermonized. The final image of the vanished door reweights the tower itself from neutral archive to active eraser, a resonant conceptual flip. Ambiguity lingers: will publication restore Vaelis or doom her? The refusal to moralize keeps complexity alive. One soft echo: “fables of absence” is repeated with identical phrasing, slightly undercutting organic accrual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly glued to Liora’s perceptual filter—wax “softening under her touch,” rope “as if alive.” Syntax is calm, methodical, mirroring her archivist rhythm; no filter-verb clutter. The single line of dialogue is unattributed and ghostly, fitting the uncanny register. No head-hop or distance slippage occurs; voice remains consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence either advances action or recharges atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “Fables of absence whispered about them” is abstract shorthand that could be replaced by a concrete archival example. Otherwise, clauses vary, verbs stay strong, and the final line lands with cadenced finality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The erased-house trope is familiar, but the mechanic of re-braiding a centuries-old rope as a temporal index feels fresh and specific to this tower. The synthesis of archival craft with time-slippage produces a non-obvious image that could not be transplanted to another setting without rewriting the stakes. Risk is moderate but successful; no gimmickry obscures clarity.</comment>
