<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s desire to “bottle presence” is concrete and embodied; the curl’s pulse against her skin externalizes the internal want. Elias’s return carries credible weight—thinner, bright-eyed, changed—yet the beat where she decides to share rather than hoard the distilled moment lands cleanly. The only drag: “I needed to know if you were still you” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the contradiction that could have been sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drop of twilight distillate onto the curl crystallizes a new shared stance—“Now we decide what to do with it”—with felt cost (the curl’s awakening, Elias’s lost “felt time”). Causal chain holds: curl gift → vanishing → return → shared decision. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One minor slack: the note “I’ll return differently” is off-stage exposition, not dramatized causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus is filtered through Liora’s alchemical gaze—molten copper light, charred cedar, ozone—each sense selected for her craft. The curl micro-setting acts as portable environment, constraining her final choice when it glows. Spatial choreography on the bridge is clean; bodies track. One missed beat: no tactile interaction with the stone or heat that could have sharpened the cost of staying.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can presence be shared without being consumed?—tightens once: from solo capture to joint guardianship. The vial’s appearance forces the choice; curl’s glow forecloses hoarding. Cost is legible: Elias’s “time you feel” is spent; Liora forfeits sole authorship. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shift from solitary distillation to collaborative stewardship of memory. The curl’s spiral reweights from map of lingering to promise of shared future without moralizing. Final image—embers flaring as they clasp hands—offers non-literal answer: presence is multiplied, not diminished, by being given away. One soft echo: “density of presence” risks thematic slogan, though it is earned by tactile handling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Liora; perceptual signature is alchemical—light pools, vials hum, air hums with “weight of forgotten secrets.” Syntax lengthens under emotion, contracts at the drop. No head-hopping; Elias’s interior remains opaque, forcing Liora’s reading of his “bittersweet smile.” Dialogue is spare, indirection carries history: “You kept it” says everything about vanished years.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but controlled: “molten copper… seeping into the cracks” does double duty for light and alchemical ingress. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. One metaphor cluster near peak—“embers glowing like dying stars… world holding its breath”—skirts purple but stays legible under Accumulative lens. Final line lands with rhythmic snap after longer prior sentence, earning cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Pocket-sun alchemist” and “distillation of presence” feel fresh, not standard fantasy fare; the science-poetry fusion gives specificity. Nautilus curl as time-map that becomes shared key transforms familiar shell trope. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric reunion rather than world-quake—but stakes stay personal, avoiding gimmick. Slight deduction: the vanished-friend-returned frame is recognizable; transformation rests mainly on alchemical detail.</comment>
