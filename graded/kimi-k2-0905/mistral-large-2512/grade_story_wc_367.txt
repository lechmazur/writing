<comment>Veyra’s ink-stained past and present star-weaving give her a sharp, specific interior; the mirrored gesture with the ink-fingered woman crystallizes her drive. Yet the laugh-as-key never collides with a contradictory impulse—no moment where joy falters or costs her anything on the page—so the arc feels performative rather than pressured. The final “step into the light” is foreshadowed but not earned by a prior micro-choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the overlapping handshake-reach reconfigures time’s loom and carries undeniable conceptual cost—she commits to birthing a city that will demand her disappearance. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens; each adjustment of the lantern tightens possibility because/therefore. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (who, when) is taught in the first 120 words and pays off in the mirrored city reveal.</comment>

<comment>The emerald beam, glass walls, and star-wick are tactile tools that constrain every move; adjusting the lantern’s angle literally bends destiny. Salt-laced dark and refracted starlight narrow perception to the immediate act of weaving. The lighthouse itself functions as micro-setting—its spiral stairs and curved glass dictate pacing and bodily choreography, charging the final mirror-gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she birth the city at personal cost?—is signaled early and tightens once: the accidental prophecy narrows options from “tend the beacon” to “become its seed.” Agency is visible when she angles the lantern to sharpen the vision, accepting the price off-stage. A clearer on-page forfeiture (loss of her own solidity, laughter dimming) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: legacy media ink mutates into starlight script, suggesting every end is raw material for another dawn. The final image—her shadow stretching into the unbuilt city—reweights the premise without moralizing. No motif is forced; the emerald glow recurs because it is the literal mechanism, not a harvested symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively lyric—compressed, rhythmic, salted with nautical physics and print-shop diction (“bottled lightning,” “margins when the rain came”). Perceptual signature stays consistent: Veyra notices refraction angles and ink smudges, never tourist vistas. One hairline slip—“laughing storm herald” risks label-speak, but the laugh is repeatedly enacted as vibration-key, preserving credibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short pulse to winding accumulative clauses that mimic light spirals; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“blade of bottled lightning”) and paid off in the mirror-city reveal. One mixed metaphor—“threads were time itself”—is momentarily abstract, yet the loom image is immediately grounded by the physical act of turning the lantern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The star-powered lighthouse-as-loom reframes prophecy as manual craft, transforming a familiar “seer on a cliff” trope into artisanal astrophysics. Risk-taking—total internal reflection as literal plot engine—pays off causally. The ink-to-starlight through-line feels inevitable yet fresh, though the laughing-key concept flirts with quirk; it barely escapes gimmick because the laugh is later shown to tremble the wick.</comment>
