<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s refusal of false comfort and his turn to “alchemical memory” are sharply particular; the interior contradiction between contempt for wishes and secret hunger to resurrect the town is embodied in the ache of his hands on the bottle. Yet the climactic choice—releasing the remembered wish—remains a solitary epiphany without micro-opposition or visible bodily cost, so the arc feels slightly under-forced for elite tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: unopenable bottle → memory experiment → conjured wish → lanterns flare, hammers sound. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town’s silence is replaced by audible rebuilding, the cost is Elias’s abandonment of his anti-wish stance. One transition (table → cove) is legible; orientation is fixed by word 80. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Salt-cove is sketched with lantern-light, rotting wood, and amber refraction that doubles as emotional lens; the bottle itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains every tactic. Spatial choreography is tight—bottle, table, cove line-of-sight track cleanly. Environment directly charges the final image: lanterns “burn steady” as the new reality ignites.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Elias birth a living future without recourse to miracles—tightens once: the memory experiment forecloses his nihilism. Escalation is single-crystal but sufficient for 700 words; cost is conceptual (he pays with his ideological purity). Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no fake reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—creation ex nihilo through disciplined imagination versus passive wishing—emerges from the bottle’s resistance and the hammer-sounds that answer it. Subtext whispers in the lantern-flame shift rather than exposition. Final image reweights “Wishwell” from con-artist relic to generative wellspring without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: alchemist’s diction (“distilled potential,” “silt of the old docks”) and synesthetic light-notice. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato “He closed his eyes… let the image go,” mirroring the breath-release of the wish. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; only one paraphrase loop (“the town was a skeleton… its buildings sagging”). Mixed metaphors are avoided; “lanterns burn steady as if fed by an invisible flame” risks slight abstraction but lands because the prior beats have literalized invisible fuel. No filter-verb stacks or scaffolding in the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The unopenable bottle as womb for an unspoken civic wish is a fresh inversion of the genie trope; memory-alchemy as working-material turns interiority into plot engine. While “last alchemist revives dead town” has archetypal DNA, the specific mechanism (working-memory distillation) and the refusal of personal wish-fulfillment keep it from template territory.</comment>
