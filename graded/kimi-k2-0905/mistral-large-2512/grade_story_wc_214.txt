<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet, custodial interiority is rendered through tactile ritual; the lantern glass acts as an embodied memory-map. The final witness-moment crystallizes his shift from caretaker to co-participant, cost paid in trembling fingers and warmed glass. Motivation stays soft but consistent: vulnerability sought through service. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the station becomes “a beginning,” the glass hums with remembered light—undeniable conceptual repricing with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds: each polishing, sweeping, and star-tracing beat thickens the texture until the slow star reweights meaning. The lantern glass pattern is taught early and returns to charge the final image. No causality breaks; orientation anchors within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ozone-and-parchment air, patched dome, cold tracking array—selective sensory triad anchors world without catalog. The station’s decrepitude constrains Elias’s ritual movements and is re-charged when the alarm sputters, turning setting into participant. Spatial choreography stays clean as he moves from console to window. Micro-setting (lantern glass) ultimately carries the closure glow, meeting the 9+ constraint test but with minor over-reliance on visual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to extract meaning from overlooked stillness. Pressure escalates via pattern-break—the star’s slow arc versus expected streak—forcing Elias to literalize his lifelong tracing into one charged gesture. Cost is legible in trembling fingers and the glass’s retained warmth. No visible tactical forfeiture beyond emotional stakes, keeping the score just shy of the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: custodial humility as aperture to cosmic belonging. Subtext resides in the glass’s cracked memory and the station’s silent alarms—no authorial thesis stated. Final image reweights “flourishing stillness” from absence to generative space without moralizing. The reader left holding the same thread Elias grasps, resonance intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: dust motes, metal sighs, fractured constellations. Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under alarm, mirroring breath. No dialogue to test voice divergence; internal diction remains consistent with self-taught astronomer-janitor. Minor elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing”) occur in narration, not interiority, so register holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “the stillness here was not empty—it flourished” performs double duty. Metaphors stay coherent (glass as constellation, station as forgotten prayer). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed moment—“weight of centuries” vs. “decades ago”—is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Star-tracking janitor who cleans abandoned instruments to feel cosmos is fresh angle. Stillness refigured as fertile void avoids nihilism cliché. Lantern-glass memory-tech feels specific, not prop-like. Risk is quiet, but coherence and lyric precision elevate it above template.</comment>
