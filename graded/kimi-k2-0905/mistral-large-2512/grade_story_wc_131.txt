<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “kindly methodical” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices (butter-knife pry, tape pocketing) and a believable seven-year concealment, but the final freeze behind the shelf is pure avoidance; no contradictory impulse or cost is dramatized on the page, so the arc stalls at observation rather than change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear—tape find → outage cover → cache check → Mara intrusion—but closure is withheld: Elias neither steps forward nor loses anything now; the story simply suspends. Because no decisive change, renunciation, or charged poise lands here, the required closure unit is missing, capping the score regardless of earlier competence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Library is etched with lived-in specificity—lemon-oil scent, marble under flicker, butter-knife tool—each detail filtered through Elias’s covert touch. The vent-crawl micro-setting constrains every move, and the shoebox under the floorboard literally dictates his path, meeting the 9+ gate even though closure itself is weak.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes (stay hidden vs. risk exposure for Voss truth) are signaled early and tighten when Mara enters, but escalation plateaus: no new obstacle, loss, or trade-off occurs on this page. The protagonist’s agency is arrested at crouch-and-wait; therefore pressure neither deepens nor forecloses options before the cut-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispered vanishing of an archivist seeding fragments through walls speaks to memory’s fragile persistence, but theme remains atmospheric rather than re-weighted; without a final crystallizing choice, the idea stays elegant yet inert.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual lens—smudged lenses, sweater bulk, heartbeat-paced flicker—syntax tightens under threat (“He swallowed hard”), and no head-hop occurs. The voice carries a hushed, archival precision that feels character-native and supports tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with action—short bursts when the light dies, longer reflective cords for memory—while information multitasks (tape label carries both plot and ghost). One paraphrase loop (“frayed edges of his own frayed existence”) and a mild filter stack (“he’d found… he’d assumed… he’d spent”) keep it shy of 9-band polish but remain below artifact penalties that would dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The “homeless scholar in the walls” trope is refreshed by librarian-specific stealth (cataloging while crawling, butter-knife burglary) and the retro reel mystery; risk is taken by refusing to let the protagonist act, though that same refusal denies closure punch. Specificity of scent, tool, and archive lore lifts it above stock.</comment>
