<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and tactile habit of tapping rhythms are cleanly individuated; the interior contradiction between scientific duty and creeping suspicion is dramatized through her page-by-page hunt. Yet the climactic “answering knock” is accepted without visible fear or second thought, so the final micro-choice feels slightly under-costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hidden atlas paths are reclaimed and the decision to keep tapping back is crystallized with conceptual cost—she now shoulders solitary custodianship of a suppressed past. Causal chain holds: torn page → deleted data → floor-panel hoard → reciprocal knock; no late rule changes or off-stage fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Salt-stained archives, tide-gauge blinks, and the jagged atlas edge are filtered through Elara’s scientific gaze, grounding orientation early. The station’s lowest level—loose panel, blinking monitors—supplies the concrete tool that enables the final discovery, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why do some paths disappear?”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when she uncovers the deliberate purge; the escalation is one steady ramp rather than a reversal, but the final image narrows her options to perpetual vigilance, so cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of collective amnesia versus individual remembrance emerges through the slow surfacing of torn pages rather than exposition. Final tapping duet reweights the premise: memory is an active, rhythmic resistance against an ocean bent on erasure—no closing moral is stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature favors metallic tastes, paper smells, and numerical rhythms. Syntax flexes from clipped observation to longer, tide-like sentences during discovery, maintaining coherent distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; sentences rarely duplicate work. Occasional minor filter verbs (“she felt,” “she woke”) slightly dull two beats, but no loops or mixed metaphors obstruct the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The eco-ghost story trope is refreshed by focusing on data erasure rather than overt eco-catastrophe; the rhythmic tapping-as-communication device is new to the climate-fiction palette. Specificity of coral atlas pages as memory artifacts keeps the concept from feeling generic.</comment>
