<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena’s grief is viscerally embodied in the charred-lace dress and the geode’s burn; her contradictory impulse—to hunt yet to “show me” the ghost—creates live interior tension. The final micro-choice, clutching the searing geode and running back toward the fire, crystallizes an Earned Stasis that costs her flesh and forecloses safety. Interiority stays concrete, but the scientist-ghost’s flicker is observed more than interacted with, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin. Still, the hunt motive escalates credibly and the flaw (hunger for awakening) drives the mistake that ends the piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the geode’s searing pulse and the decision to re-enter the wreckage reweight the stake—she chooses to weaponize grief rather than escape it—visible cost is the blistering palm. Causal chain holds: geode hum → ghost solidifies → system reboot → flight back into fire, each beat tightening options. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“rusted girders,” “central chamber,” “circuit breakers below her feet”). One minor lapse: “the logs” are cited without prior on-page cue, but the ghost’s flicker immediately pays it off, so causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory’s groaning metal, fractured dome-glass, and hissing breakers constrain every move—Lena times her crawl to the cooling cycle, and the final dash is forced by the reboot’s red flash. Body-as-setting works too: the charred lace clings like memory, and the geode’s rising fever tracks escalation. Selective sensory triage—heat on soles, drone-hum in bone—keeps crisis filtration tight. Environment is not backdrop; it literally times the climax and brands her skin, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused potential pools” to weaponize grief—tightens when the ghost’s appearance proves the geode can manifest the intangible, forcing an immediate choice: flee or seize the power. The cooling-breaker clock escalates pressure mechanically and credibly. One meaningful turn suffices: she demands “Show me,” narrowing her path from stealth to confrontation. Cost is legible—burnt palm, reboot alarms, return to fire—though the ghost dissolves rather than counter-escalates, capping intensity just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges: grief as raw fuel that can either consume or be forged, never healed. The geode’s pulse and the dress-ash reprise this without sermon, culminating in the charged image of a woman hugging a live coal to her chest. Subtext in the ghost’s flicker—“It’s not just energy—it’s choice”—reweights the premise silently. No final moralizing; the silence after alarms is the answer. Ambiguity lingers: is she becoming what she hunts? Complexity holds, but the ghost’s single line feels slightly expositional, keeping the score south of 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lena’s perceptual sieve: rust groans “like a dying beast,” geode heat “pools in the hollows of her bones.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments (“She had minutes.”) mimic shallow breath. No head-hop; scientist-ghost is purely external flicker. Diction stays within her lexicon until “perturbation theory” intrudes via log-whisper, justified as found text. Rhythmic control is purposeful: longer clauses for nostalgia, staccato for reboot panic. Voice is distinct, consistent, and propulsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The circuit breakers below her feet hissed as they cooled, their heat bleeding into the metal grating” advances time, sets stakes, and textures sound. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 700 words, each charged (beast, dying bulb, heat off pavement). No scaffold loops; each paragraph shifts knowledge or tactical option. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” in prior log—reads as in-world jargon, not author intrusion. Closure line (“The hunt wasn’t over. It had only just begun.”) is deliberate echo of opening, earning its cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic grief-crystal is familiar terrain, but the fusion of observatory-as-carcass, cooling-breaker countdown, and wedding-ash dress gives the trope new skin. The ghost as failed scientist who literalizes choice rather than warns is a fresh inflection. Risk: lyric compression could have tipped into purple, yet restraint keeps it lean. Conceptual integrity holds—every rule introduced (geode manifests potential) is paid off in the blistered palm. Not radical novelty, but specific lived detail transforms the template.</comment>
