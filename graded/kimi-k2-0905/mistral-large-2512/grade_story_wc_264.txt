<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s dreamlessness and sudden archive summons are evocative, but interiority stays abstract (“he understood, or thought he did”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the choice to pocket the clock and “guard the sparks” is declared, not embodied. Cost is asserted, not felt. Meets basic arc, falls short of earned turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the backward-then-forward clock reconfigures his mission with conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin—touching artifact → teleport → new mandate—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final image reweights stakes. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Enough for solid mid-band, not flawless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glowing dune, cold clock glass, ozone/paper scent create selective sensory triad that guides attention. Micro-setting (the half-buried clock) literally triggers the archive shift, constraining next action. Spatial logic holds across beats. Environment charges the final image—clock ticks toward dawn—earning high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“guard cargo” reframed to “guard sparks”—is signaled early and tightened once. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no visible price paid on-page. Escalation is a single cadence shift (dawn approaching). Sufficient for short-form, but lacks felt cost that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of salvageable futures emerges via archive imagery rather than statement. Final line reframes prior motifs (trains, embers, clock) into quiet hope without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—what “sparks” mean—inviting reflection. Clean emergence, no echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “dust on his boots,” “hummed in his bones.” Rhythm tightens under pressure—fragments (“His breath hitched.”) then longer cadence as archive expands. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within guard’s lexicon. Minor generic phrasing (“world flickered like a candle”) keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences dual-task. One scaffold loop: “He had never dreamed… he had felt something” restates without new pressure. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final third is clean, allowing high-band finish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-forest, time-split archive feels fresh yet inevitable. Chess clock as temporal key is elegant, not gimmicky. Concept synthesizes cli-fi and metaphysical heist in miniature. Could swap guard for another sentinel, so not fully singular, but risk-taking within word count earns upper band.</comment>
