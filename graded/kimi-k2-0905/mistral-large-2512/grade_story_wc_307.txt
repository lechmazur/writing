<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts into self-diagnosis (“afraid of failing, afraid of succeeding”) without embodied contradiction. Grandmother memory supplies motive yet arrives as summary; no micro-choice dramatizes the shift from researcher to believer. Final “presence” insight is declared, not paid for by an on-page renunciation or loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—time-stepping reframed as presence—with cost signaled by vanished rings and younger hands. Accumulative lens holds: ripple pattern tightens until stillness reweights stakes. Orientation clear by line 5; no causality break. Beat sequence is iterative meditation, not escalating chain, so tension plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating platform, lodestone grotto, and sycamore hush are tactile, sensorily balanced, and return in the final image. Micro-setting (her smooth palms) literalizes the conceptual change. Selective detail—cool stone, starlit lodestone—anchors without catalog. Environment does not constrain tactics, so stays below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove vanishing—signaled early; pressure is textural (hum intensifies, rings freeze) rather than causal. One deepening: rings stop, forcing recognition. No visible price or option foreclosure; success feels predestined. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping tension flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—presence over chronology—emerges through ripple imagery and grandmother echo, avoiding explicit moral. Final whisper reweights prior material with quiet irony: she sought youth and found stillness. Ambiguity is coherent; no platitudes. Lacks a sharp ethical edge or counter-reading to reach 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: lodestone “like the tug of a forgotten dream,” sycamore “murmuring.” Syntax lengthens during trance, shortens at snap-back, mirroring state. No head-hopping; diction remains within her scholarly-yrning register. Distinct rhythm and metaphoric control support 8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; most sentences dual-load image + interiority. Occasional soft filler—“cool, smooth surface” twice, “rings still spreading outward in perfect, silent circles” could trim one modifier. No mixed metaphors or loops; clarity intact. Final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Backwards-aging-as-meditative-art is fresh; magnetic grotto + ripple divination gives concrete mechanics. Grandmother twist subverts expected sci-fi payoff. Risk is moderate—lyric time-walk rather than tech—but execution is coherent and specific to this lake-night. Does not radically rewire genre, so stays sub-9.</comment>
