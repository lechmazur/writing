<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s ritual fatigue and the key’s uncanny weight give him a concrete interior contradiction; the woman’s mirrored ache externalizes it. Yet the climactic transfer of the tag feels willed rather than wrested—no micro-choice visibly costs him anything on the page, so the renunciation reads mild.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky reconfigures meaning, the tag passes, and the lens stays Accumulative—pattern of light-images tightens until perception flips. Causality holds; the library discovery and the woman’s arrival both complicate, not solve. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Algae-slick ladder, warped shelves, moonlit page—selective sensory triad anchors every beat. The ship’s library literally supplies the book that reweights perception, so environment constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“see the color of sound”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the open book redefines perception and the woman demands stance. One visible trade-off: he forfeits the Lumen key, foreclosing his old anonymity. Cost is present but light; still, escalation coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited luminous debt emerges through keyed light-objects and sky-lantern color, never sermonized. Final image reweights prior lamps as vow-keepers without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what seeing costs him.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s salt-stung senses; perceptual signature is steady—he notices rust, paper scent, lantern hues. No head-hop; syntax lengthens during wonder, shortens during descent, mirroring pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—action, atmosphere, metaphor—without overcrowding. One mixed metaphor (“lanterns like liquid gold” beside “meteor hush”) but it clears before closure; no loops or scaffold, rhythm breathes with beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lantern-release as perceptual cipher rather than nostalgic set-piece feels fresh; sunken library supplying moon-lit manual is specific twist. Risk is moderate—lyric Accumulative pattern taught early and paid off—so small bonus applies.</comment>
