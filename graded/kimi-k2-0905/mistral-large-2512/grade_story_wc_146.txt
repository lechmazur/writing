<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tuner’s quiet obsession is rendered through embodied ritual—tracing cracks, pacing the square—but his interior contradiction (restore what can never fully return) stays summary. No micro-choice visibly risks failure or forfeits an alternative path; the final exit feels predetermined rather than renounced. The “infinitely patient” label never collides with a moment where patience costs him something we can feel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden shimmer of invisible foot-traffic reconfigures Hollow’s End from silence to listening, and the cost is the tuner’s perpetual exile. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each day’s footfall pattern layers density until the cadence itself becomes the decisive change. Orientation is swift, the single transition (day 3→5→7) is legible, and no causal promise is broken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archway, tuning fork, and cracked cobblestones function as micro-setting that literally vibrate under the tuner’s touch, constraining how and where he can “rebuild.” Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: bruise-colored cloak, patina-stained fingers, the hush that “settles” rather than arrives. The final golden shimmer grows out of these same stones, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the town’s lost resonance—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each calibrated footstep; the risk is over-tuning and shattering the ghosts. Escalation is textural: day-3 click, day-5 murmur, day-7 golden light, each layer foreclosing silence forever. The price (irreversible awakening that still leaves the town empty) is legible but lightly felt; a sharper personal cost would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the audible cost of resurrection: echoes demand a listener who must then walk away. Subtext resides in the tuner’s refusal to claim the community he revives—balance restored only through self-exile. The final image of the archway whispering behind him reweights “ghosts are not spirits but echoes” without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the tuner’s perceptual filter—sound before sight, rhythm before rationale. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the pacing ritual; diction favors metallurgical hush (“patina of a thousand forgotten chimes”). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the voice modulates from patient to quietly bereft in the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: each sentence advances atmosphere or ritual motion. Figurative layering is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Minor cadence repetition (“day X…”) is pattern-taught and pays off in the seventh-day crescendo. One paraphrase loop (“the town had been…”) costs a sliver.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “tune a ghost town back into audibility” premise feels fresh because the mechanism is pedestrian—footstep rhythm—rather than occult technobabble. Specificity of the cracked bell, bruise-cloak, and ebony fork prevents trope drift. Risk is present in the quiet ending, but the concept commits fully; no late rule changes.</comment>
