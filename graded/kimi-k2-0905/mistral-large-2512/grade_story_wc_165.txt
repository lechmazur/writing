<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s boredom-with-craft is vivid, but the “analytical” trait is asserted more than enacted; the bishop drop reads as impulse, not calculation. The duet moment embodies her desire, yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the change feels lightly earned. Cost is atmospheric, not personal—she walks away energized rather than foreclosed. Interiority is sensory-rich, but emotional summary (“she was tired”) substitutes for embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arcade’s hush becomes collaborative music, reweighting her private ritual into shared risk—cost felt in the vanished bishop and the unrepeatable after-hours moment. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tide, lantern light, and stranger coalesce; no causal chain is broken. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. The only drag: “orchestrated serendipity” is declared twice rather than demonstrated through visible tactic, slightly blurring agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tidal arcade’s salt-bleached ribs, starlit water, and cracked lantern are filtered through Lira’s performer eye; every prop is handled, swung, reflected. Environment constrains footing, sound carry, and visibility, directly shaping the improvised dance and the violinist’s approach. Micro-setting (bishop, lantern) doubles as emotional gauge without overt symbolism. Sensory economy is high; no atmospheric detail sits idle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stake—break personal monotony through creative risk—is signaled early and sharpened when she sacrifices her talisman. Escalation is textural: water stilled, lantern arcs, stranger enters; pressure mounts but options widen rather than narrow. No reversal or trade-off forecloses a path; the climax is additive joy, not costly choice. Cost is aesthetic, not tactical, keeping the beat below high tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—art as deliberate surrender to chance—emerges through image (bishop sunk, music found), never sermonized. Subtext resides in the unspoken contract of the lantern invitation and shared grin. Final image reweights the bishop’s loss as gain, achieving quiet CR. Ambiguity lingers: will tomorrow repeat or ruin the spell? Complexity acknowledged without forced balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, consistent and apt for a performer who stages herself. Syntax ripples like tide—long breaths for starlight, staccato for lantern swings—mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Diction stays within Lira’s lexicon; “orchestrated serendipity” is the sole elevated phrase, repeated but justified as her private mantra.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (“ribcage of salt-bleached wood”) are precise, not piled. One mixed moment: “stars seemed to hold their breath” borders cliché, but context rescues it. Final paragraph avoids explanatory swell, trusting image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusing fire-eater craft with chess-piece divination into an improvisational midnight duet feels fresh, not gimmicky. The tidal arcade as liminal stage is a memorable spatial invention. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than plot twist—but coherence rewards the gamble. Could transpose to another performer/setting only with loss of salt-wood specificity, so transformation passes.</comment>
