<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—gloved fingers, warm arrow tip—yet the climactic “understanding” is declared, not dramatized: “Resilience wasn’t about resisting change…” strips embodied cost. Still, her micro-choice to stay kneeling while gravity flips shows a visible wager, earning the Earned Stasis closure with skin in the game.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrow cools, seeds drift upward, and the inverted world is accepted rather than fought. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (humming air, glowing fruit, warming metal) tightens until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The floating rock arches aren’t backdrop; their undersides become sky during inversion, forcing Lira to land on what was once ceiling. The silver water ribbon and condensation-slick stone constrain navigation and physically guide her to the echo-grove, charging the final image when seeds rise past the same arches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes are legible early—one hour until inversion—and tighten when the arrow tip warms, signaling the grove’s anomaly. The single meaningful deepening occurs as she kneels, letting gravity reverse rather than fleeing, trading safety for communion with the echoes; the cost is the risk of being crushed, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion metaphor: endurance equals bending, not resisting. The final seed-burst image reweights the settlers’ buried hopes without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Only the brief “Resilience wasn’t about resisting change” skirts overt thesis, kept from 9+ by that declarative slip.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lira’s perceptual filter—cracked leather, hum in the air, arrow warmth—without head-hopping. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“She didn’t move. The echoes swelled…”), then opens into the lyrical final line, proving deliberate sonic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The gravity inversion was coming” anchors stakes and clock; “seeds drifted upward like stars” closes the arc. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse, each metaphor (apples as dandelion seeds) precise. One minor filter verb cluster (“She understood now”) barely dulls the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The orchard planet with gravity inversion is fresh, yet the core insight—resilience as surrender to change—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression (“world turned itself inside out”) is taught early and paid off when Lira smiles into the chaos, transforming cosmic spectacle into intimate ethos.</comment>
