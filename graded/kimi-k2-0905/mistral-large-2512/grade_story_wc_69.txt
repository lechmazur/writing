<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Miss Voss’s interiority is restrained and consistent; her “quiet certainty” is shown through calm micro-choices (placing the zither, sustaining the note) rather than label-speak. The choir members move from stock types toward individuated voices, but Maren’s pivot is still reported rather than embodied in a visible beat. The final renunciation—she came to listen, not teach—carries cost, yet the causal chain feels lightly sketched because the hatred is dissolved off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stilled wind and joined hands reconfigure meaning with felt cost under an Accumulative lens. The zither’s pattern is taught early and returns to crystallize the shift; silence replaces discord. Orientation is clean within 60 words. One soft spot: the “unlearning” turn is asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible beat, keeping the causality just shy of 9+ tension.</comment>

<comment>The velvet library, cinnamon air, and mother-of-pearl rosette are filtered through Elara’s preservationist gaze, so sensory detail doubles as exposition. The zither functions as micro-setting: its fragility constrains tempo and forces the choir to lean in, directly shaping rehearsal tactics. Autumn leaves mirror internal decay but never overplay symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies circle the piano bench without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—braiding voices by subtracting hatred—signals early and tightens through each rehearsal shard. Pressure escalates by accumulation: dissonant glares → tentative humming → unified chord, with the zither’s fragile sustain acting as physical constraint. Cost is visible when Maren’s hand finds Liora’s, trading prior contempt for vulnerable contact. No reversal reverses the trend; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through sonic metaphor: harmony is not additive but subtractive—remove noise, music remains. The vanishing arts motif moves from abstract worry to embodied practice as the choir relearns listening. Final image of drifting leaves reweights the premise: preservation happens not by archiving scores but by letting old grievances fall. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara’s calm, slightly archaic perceptual signature—“expectantly resigned,” “velvet library smelled of aged paper and cinnamon.” Syntax lengthens under emotion, then contracts at the fragile zither note, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; choir interiority is implied through gesture and timbre. Dialogue is minimal but idiomatic when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense: each sentence advances atmosphere or beat. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “ice over a pond” is singular and apt. One paraphrase loop—“the kind that lived in the silences between notes” restated two sentences later—triggers a −0.2. Otherwise rhythm modulates, paragraph lengths vary, and no filter-verb clusters stall immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar “outsider healer unites divided townsfolk” frame is refreshed by the subtractive music method and the zither’s antique fragility. Specific choral sociology—southern-valley altos, farmer-tenors—grounds conflict in lived detail. Risk is moderate: accumulative lyric structure rather than dramatic showdown. The final hand-brush feels inevitable yet not derivative, lifting the score.</comment>
