<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s longing to “translate what’s left behind” is consistent, but the interior contradiction between exile and legacy never collides in a single, embodied beat; the girl’s arrival supplies outside validation rather than forcing a cost-laden choice, so the arc feels observed, not forged under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—Elias re-names himself “translator” with felt social cost (no more exile, now responsibility to the child)—but the lens stays Accumulative; the final reweighting is legible yet leans on narrated summary rather than a decisive, on-page action that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Salt-crusted wood, warped boards, and the music-box brass give tactile specificity; the loft itself never physically constrains choices, but the micro-setting of the jars-on-shelves becomes the charged final image, satisfying the 9+ gate by reconfiguring the space as archive rather than hide-out.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue ephemeral sound from erasure—surfaces early; escalation is textural (each new jar thickens the archive) rather than a tightening that forecloses an option, so pressure plateaus until the girl’s arrival supplies external recognition; cost is present but diffused across summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of trans-generational memory emerges organically from the jar-archive and the child listener; no explicit thesis is stated, and the final re-naming lands as earned wisdom, though the emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than searing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—salt, rust, ghost-metaphors—without head-hop; rhythm modulates between long reflective sentences and short tactile beats, creating a hushed, oceanic cadence that supports the lonesome splendor tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; occasional soft repeats (“the kind that…”) and a late cluster of abstract nouns (“purpose, silence, dust”) slightly dull the final paragraph’s edge, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Sound-capture-in-jars is fresh yet internally grounded; the vagrant-poet trope is familiar, but the accretive archive and child witness transform it into a quiet fable of transmission, not self-destruction—risk is modest, yet specificity rescues it from cliché.</comment>
