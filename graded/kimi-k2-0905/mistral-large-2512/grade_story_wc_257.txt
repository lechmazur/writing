<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is palpable through tactile detail (ring, stencil, wrist) and micro-choices (tracing, climbing, pressing ink). The interior contradiction—clinging to Liora while chasing her ghost—drives every beat. The final tattoo act crystallizes a credible shift from drowning to wearing grief, paying the cost of perpetual thorns. Missing only a second on-page character to test status dynamics, but solo arc holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reopened dome and blooming constellation reconfigure Elias’s stance with visible cost (thorned ink on wrist). Accumulative lens holds: each origami shard adds density until the pattern breaks skyward. Coordinates sequence risks mild teleportation, but lavender scent and deliberate pacing keep causality intact. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 5; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory gears, shattered conservatory, and crimson hand-painted rose function as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply imagery for the final reconfiguration. Brass frozen mid-turn mirrors Elias’s stasis; painted petals echo “genuinely artificial” rule. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and scent over visual catalog. Environment actively guides the origami trail and final telescope gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he stay frozen or re-enter the living—tightens through each origami waypoint, narrowing options from workshop to dome. The “Illuminate” lotus forces the decisive look skyward, costing him the illusion that Liora can return. Pressure accumulates via pattern density, not external antagonist; coincidence (girl vanishing) complicates rather than resolves. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “wither to bloom” emerges through recurring vegetal imagery (thorned vine, painted rose, lotus) and the final constellation bloom; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext lives in origami scent and shuttered starlight. Final wrist image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: bloom may still hurt, refusing tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—calloused fingers, brass sighs, lavender ghost. Syntax lengthens during ascent, then fractures into short breaths at the eyepiece, mirroring pressure. No dialogue to test, but interior diction remains artisanal rather than academic. Distinct rhythm carries the accumulative pattern without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “dust motes swirled in the slanted light” does double sensory duty. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each origami reprise adds new information. Metaphors (curtains of intention, gears frozen mid-sigh) stay coherent and character-bound. Final sentence pair (“The origami figures would keep coming… And so would he”) lands with cadence-earned lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of horology, mourning jewelry, and origami scavenger hunt feels fresh; none are mere window dressing. “Genuinely artificial” rose and stalled clocktower create off-kilter world logic that pays off in the painted bloom. Risk taken in accumulative shard structure is justified by taught pattern and resonant closure. Could edge higher if city’s timelessness carried social consequence beyond personal grief.</comment>
