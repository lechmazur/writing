<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—regret as “damp mist,” the camera wheel still warm—yet the decisive renunciation (letting the wheel sink) is under-motivated; no prior beat shows her ready to surrender that talisman. The ghost’s accusation “You took too long” lands as label-speak without embodied cost, blunting the emotional spike. Micro-choices are present but clustered in exposition; only the final dip of fingers into lagoon dramatizes shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wheel’s silent drop reweights the premise—she forfeits the last relic of her past self. Causality holds under Accumulative lens; each fragmentary overheard story layers until the ghost’s single line crystallizes the cost of endless deferral. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. The only slack is the ghost’s exit—dissolving rather than forcing a tangible last refusal—keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lagoon’s “mirror that refused to hold a single truth” is not postcard scenery; it supplies the literal surface that returns her younger self and forces the final stance. Micro-setting of the rusted platform creaking under her boots anchors body-in-space and times the beat before immersion. Sensory triage favors touch and temperature over visual catalog, mirroring her scavenger bias. Environment constrains the only possible confrontation—no other terrain could stage this negotiation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep collecting fragments or relinquish the past?—tightens once: the ghost’s appearance collapses the distance between collector and collected. Pressure escalates by accretion of overheard regrets until the camera wheel’s loss forecloses her compulsive archive. Cost is legible in the wheel’s silent sink; no coincidence resolves the tension. One meaningful deepening suffices, but a second micro-turn (e.g., failed attempt to retrieve the wheel) could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative act of collecting broken stories until the collector recognizes herself as another broken artifact; no character moralizes. The camera wheel’s reprise—first warm, then vanished—reweights the motif from hope to surrender without commentary. Ambiguity lingers: is listening without hoarding enough, or merely another form of deferral? The refusal to declare a moral keeps the resonance raw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“rusted platform,” “frayed thread”) stays inside the scavenger’s worn vernacular. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for foggy rumination, clipped fragments at ghost encounter. No head-hopping; the ghost’s dialogue is filtered through the scavenger’s perception of “wind through broken glass,” preserving POV integrity. Voice is distinct without forced quirk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no synonym loops or scaffold. Metaphors are few but precise—“time slipping through fingers” justifies the camera’s empty click. One mixed register slip: “conceptual repricing” tone in “negotiating with her own ghost” momentarily lifts above scavenger idiom, but recovers quickly. Final paragraph breathes correctly, mirroring release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “kinetic lagoon above the clouds” and carousel corpses synthesize post-apocalyptic and magical-realist tropes into a fresh crucible for regret. Collecting overheard stories as currency is a sharp, underused mechanic that charges every beat. Risk is evident—quiet lyric ending instead of spectacle—yet the closure remains legible. Slight deduction for echo of “man emerges younger” trope, but the emotional use here is specific.</comment>
