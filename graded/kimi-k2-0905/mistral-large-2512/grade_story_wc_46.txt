<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s grief and need for atonement are vivid; the sea-glass pocketing and wading are embodied micro-choices. Yet the interior contradiction between reckless past and cautious present is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene, and the final stance (“let them shine without consuming her”) resolves without a visible flaw-cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored light builds to Charged Poise closure when the pearl’s glow refracts through her. Orientation clean by line 3; single transition (grotto → village) is legible. Cost is conceptual—she must hold still, not burn—but felt in the hush that spreads over the crowd.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Grotto mist, bioluminescent walls, and cold water constrain her pace and make the pearl’s stillness tactile. Sea glass recurs as micro-setting, charging the final image when its refracted hues echo in the village dawn. Selective sensory triage keeps the 780-word count lean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the grotto’s cold and silence force her to choose stillness over spectacle. One meaningful deepening: the pearl’s glow demands passive transmission, foreclosing her old pyrotechnic tactics. Cost is legible in the hush, though external consequence remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of mediated light—reflection over generation—emerges through sea-glass memory, failed lanterns, and the pearl’s refracted dawn. Final image reweights earlier hubris without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: will stillness suffice next winter? Resonant, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter; diction (“earthbound star watcher,” “dust…like a second shadow”) is consistent and character-specific. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for nostalgia, clipped fragments under cold-water stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong verbs and concrete nouns; only one paraphrase loop (“light…without burning anyone, least of all herself”). Figurative layer is disciplined—mist as dragon, glass as moon-capture—never dense enough to stall momentum. Final paragraph lands with cadence shift that mirrors the hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“Pearl of stillness” trope is refreshed by the optics rule: light must be reflected, not generated. Sea-glass memory and gem-polishing heritage particularize the premise. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks. Transformation test passes: swap gem-craft for pottery and the optics collapse.</comment>
