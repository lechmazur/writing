<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from voyeuristic death-tourist to volunteer is sketched via two embodied beats—accepting the clipboard, feeling the parasol tip in lining—so the renunciation carries cost. Interiority stays concrete (“skin felt thinner”) and avoids label-speak. Yet the contradiction between seeking “his own ending” and finding “others’” is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, muting the hierarchy-of-values test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the death-tourist path by taking the volunteer list, cost legible in the parasol’s relocation from palm to coat lining. Accumulative lens holds: each breath-rattle, frost cue, and object reprise thickens the texture until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is filtered through Elias’s slowed perception—groaning planks, salt wind, frostbitten fingers handing tea—so environment constrains where he can stand, what he hears, when he offers the parasol. Micro-setting (parasol tip as tactile anchor) charges the final image. One minor slip: spatial relation between cot cluster and dock edge remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias keep consuming death or step into agency?—tightens once: the dying man’s rattle forces the parasol transfer, after which Elias accepts the clipboard, narrowing future options. Pressure is textural, not causal, fitting the accumulative lens; cost is felt in the silence after the last breath. A second tightening beat would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed endings versus shared mortality emerges through the parasol’s passage and breath-sound imagery; no final-statement sermon. Subtext in the woman’s clipped directive (“If you want to hear it, go there”) carries more weight than exposition. Resonance lingers in the windborne solace image, reweighted by Elias’s choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual lag: sentences lengthen, verbs soften (“gripped reality loosely”). No head-hopping; dialogue sparse, idiomatically plain. One register drift: “euthanasia tourist” feels academic against the lyric texture, but it is introduced early and reused, so the pattern holds.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional adjective pairs (“low, mournful creak”) stay purposeful. Strong sentence variety and paragraph breath. One paraphrase loop: “sound of endings” is repeated four times—acceptable under accumulative pattern but slightly dilutes final punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Death tourist” premise is fresh; coupling it with climate-collapse volunteerism and a Victorian parasol creates idiosyncratic synthesis. The object-transfer beat feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate; no formal gimmicks. Could edge higher if the ice-marina itself forced a more singular tactical choice.</comment>
