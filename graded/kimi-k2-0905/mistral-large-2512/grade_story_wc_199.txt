<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s seed-sorter precision seeds her leaf-sorting obsession, but the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“absorbed some of the arbor’s quiet wisdom”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The final smile and silent sorting gesture earns a quiet renunciation, yet the cost feels lightly sketched—no irrevocable loss is made visceral. Still, her micro-choices (plucking the moon-dusted leaf, crumbling the pebble spiral) keep motive legible and accumulate to an earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the circle of stones and shower of lit leaves reconfigure Liora’s life toward perpetual translation of arboreal text, with the moss on her sleeves the visible price. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each leaf, speck, and monument layers density until the pattern break crystallizes meaning. Orientation is swift; the arbor’s geography and twilight timing anchor by line 3. One minor causality gap: how moonstone “multiplied” overnight is elided, but the lapse doesn’t derail the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arbor’s ashen branches and whispering leaves are tactile filters for Liora’s attention; the moss stain on her hands at the end literalizes setting absorbed into body. Micro-setting—the moonstone speck on a single leaf—becomes the pivot object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean: kneeling, plucking, stacking stones track without drift. Weather and light evolve causally with the beat sequence, tightening atmosphere rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or surrender to randomness—tightens when the spiral monument crumbles and moon-dust settles, forcing the choice to build the larger circle. Escalation is textural: dust multiplication and leaf-light shower intensify pattern density rather than external danger. The cost is conceptual but legible: Liora forfeits ordinary life, becoming folklore herself. One beat more showing what she loses (village conversation, seed jars abandoned) would push pressure into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of ordering entropy: the same impulse that once sorted seeds now commits Liora to endless arboreal translation. Subtext resides in the unspoken bargain—she gains cosmic syntax but loses human chronology, signaled by moss and vines colonizing her body. No moral is declared; the final image of silent sorting lets ambiguity linger. The refrain of “forgotten things” accrues poignancy without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Liora’s perceptual bias—precise, taxonomic, slightly cold—until the syntax softens in the final paragraph (“edges softened, her movements slower”) to mirror transformation. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for twilight hush, clipped fragments for dust revelation. Distinctiveness stops just shy of the 9-band because the voice never risks an idiosyncratic metaphor that could only be hers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence advances pattern or atmosphere without scaffold. Figurative layering (“skeletal hand,” “constellation of tiny stars”) stays coherent under arbor logic. One mixed micro-metaphor—“hush where past meets prophecy”—slips toward abstraction but is forgiven as it is taught early and reprises at closure. No loops, no template cadence, no register drift; clarity remains intact even at the luminous climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Folklore of whispering dead transformed into a living linguistic system feels fresh, avoiding haunted-tree cliché by making the leaves a syntax rather than a séance. The seed-sorter turned translator is an occupation rarely seen in fantasy micro-fiction, giving the piece idiosyncratic traction. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation replaces plot reversals, but coherence under the chosen lens keeps the gamble from tipping into gimmick. Could push higher with one more concrete detail that could not exist in any other story.</comment>
