<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lena’s motivation is clear and personal, but her interiority slips into generic “truth-seeker” shorthand (“the archive had already changed her”). The decisive act—copying the video—lacks a visible, immediate cost; we’re told danger exists but don’t feel it constrain her fingers on the keyboard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: patch → numbers → hidden folder → video → choice. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost (she picks a side), yet the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no supervisor walk-in, no alarm, no breath of consequence on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Archive static, server glow, and the frayed patch give tactile anchors; the “digital graveyard” metaphor is controlled. Spatial clarity wavers once: the server-room video appears without confirming whether Lena is watching from her desk or has physically entered the facility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering deletion—tightens when the 4-7-11 folder surfaces, forcing a go/no-go copy decision. Pressure is coherent but single-stage; the risk never escalates within the scene (no countdown, no ping from IT), so the tightening feels one-note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of erasure vs remembrance emerges through the archive’s ghost-language and the reappearing numbers; no explicit sermon. Final image—“battleground”—reweights the archive from repository to contested space, though the reconfiguration is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lena’s perceptual filter; diction tilts technical without losing rhythm. Occasional cliché clusters (“pulse pounded in her ears,” “weight of the truth”) flatten the voice under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and propel; information density is high. Minor loop: “the numbers appeared…4-7-11” restates twice within fifty words; one metaphor mix—“echoes linger like ghosts” plus “digital graveyard”—slightly blurs sonic vs spatial imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Corporate data-archivist-as-detective is fresh, and the numeric breadcrumb trail feels novel. Premise skirts familiar “company makes people vanish” territory, but the archive-as-battleground reframe and the cloth patch keep it from feeling templated.</comment>
