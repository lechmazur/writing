<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—clinging to recovery yet accepting loss—surfaces only in final two beats; earlier beats summarize rather than dramatize competing impulses. Micro-choice (pocketing seed) is present but cost is abstract; no embodied tension between want/fear before that moment. Trait “recollectionist” stays label-level; no on-page transliteration failure that would sharpen stakes. Acceptable for length, yet not fully individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: seed + acceptance reweight the premise “some pieces stay missing” with undeniable emotional cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift in final paragraph reconfigures meaning. Causality intact—bird-seed trail → cave → glass → seed—but middle lacks tightening beat; escalation is gentle pattern break rather than forced choice. Orientation clear by word 90; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Crystal geode functions as micro-setting: reflective surfaces externalize Liora’s shifting emotions and permit the transliteration beat. Light refraction, algae glow, crater glass weight—all tactile, POV-filtered, and mirrored in her final stance. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Object-as-setting (glass) charges closure image. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why do some paths disappear?”—signaled early. Single meaningful deepening: glass shifts blue→red, forcing confrontation with unrecognizable emotion; this tightens her stance toward acceptance. Pressure is situational/accumulative rather than adversarial; no external antagonist. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the quest) but not viscerally felt on page; keeps score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the dignity of letting absence remain. Final image of pocketed seed reweights earlier “missing pieces” without moralizing. Subtext in color shift of glass implies wound that will not close. Avoids tidy epiphany; ambiguity lingers. Could ascend higher if emotional cost were more embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature anchored in light, texture, and emotional chromatics. Prose rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences contract into short declaratives at tunnel mouth, mirroring hesitation. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb clusters. Distinctive without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety and paragraph pacing breathe with scene. Figurative language disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the glass was showing her something new” could compress to “the glass showed,” but does not dull closure. Zero loops, clean grammar, precise nouns. Within striking distance of 9 but final beat still leans abstract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of memory-curator + emotion-transliteration + crystal cave feels fresh; not a trope stack seen before. Conceptual risk—quiet acceptance instead of recovery—pays off. Could edge higher if transliteration mechanic were dramatized rather than reported, deepening the speculative edge. Sufficiently singular for elite venue.</comment>
