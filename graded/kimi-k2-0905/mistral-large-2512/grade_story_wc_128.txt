<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s broker instincts surface only once (ledger touch) and don’t complicate the choice; the interiority is warm but generic (“breath caught,” “pieces clicking”). The final yes is credible yet cost-free—no visible trade-off or contradiction in scene. Mara’s tremor is good embodied detail, but her arc is off-page; relationship shift is asserted, not crucible-forced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: misdelivery → recognition → reciprocity → fund pledge, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Decisive Change with light social cost (Elias commits time/money). Orientation clean by 50 words; single transition (library→inn) legible. No persistent constraint or price returned to Elias personally keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Salt-air library and flour-dust bar are sketched with economical sensory triads; open-air roof and ledger function as micro-settings that guide handling of the envelope. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. Final image of breeze through inn window reprises salt note, lightly re-weighting possibility, but environment never actively blocks or endangers choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor unseen labor—signaled early; pressure tightens once when Elias decides to act before Mara’s shift ends. Agency is present but low-risk: no personal loss, deadline, or pushback. Coincidence (envelope found tonight) complicates, does not resolve, so allowed. Cost is social/forward-looking (future fund work), not felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet gratitude emerges through the locket’s journey rather than commentary; subtext sits in Mara’s thumb trace and tremor. Final image of “salt and possibility” offers a Charged Poise that reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids tidy uplift by leaving fund work ahead, though emotional complexity is gentle rather than thorny.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is mildly mercantile (“profit margins,” “shrewd”) but drifts toward poetic generics under pressure. Syntax is controlled, rhythm varied; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue is sparse, natural, carries subtext of mutual sizing-up. Voice distinctiveness plateaues just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, read-aloud smooth; sentences double-task (action + atmosphere). No mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“reason the symphony played on…”) but occurs early, low-pressure. High information density maintained; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. Minor cliché cluster (“salt-tinged night air”) does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar “lost letter delivered” frame is refreshed by maritime working-class lens and mutual aid pivot; locket-as-gratitude-token feels specific. Risk level moderate—no structural experimentation, but specificity of dockworker fund keeps it from template drift. Synthesis is coherent rather than startling, landing in solid upper-tier territory.</comment>
