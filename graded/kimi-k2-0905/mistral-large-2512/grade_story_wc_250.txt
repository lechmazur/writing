<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris’s silence is embodied through tactile ritual (mirror, shutters, pebble) rather than label; the girl’s micro-choice to pocket the pebble and revise “witch” shows earned reweighting. Interior contradiction is hinted but not fully simultaneous under pressure—Maris never risks failure or loss, so cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. Still, the final smile in the mirror crystallizes a quiet hierarchy of values: teaching stars outweighs being understood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the girl’s departure with the mica-lit pebble reconfigures both characters’ stances; cost is felt in Maris’s continued solitude and the town’s half-spoken fear. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of light/dark fragments tightens until the last glint of mica becomes the “star” the premise promised. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. Could edge higher if one shutter pattern had backfired, sharpening stakes.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and canal lap anchor every beat; the dental mirror’s worn handle doubles as micro-setting that constrains gesture. Shutters-as-lanterns teach the world’s rule-set early and charge the final image when mica replaces daylight. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies, mirror, pebble, and reflected sky track cleanly. One step from 9+: weather never threatens the ritual; dock stays permissive rather than adversarial.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“teach darkness the value of stars”—is signaled early; pressure escalates by pattern intensification: daylight ribbons → vanishing glow → mica spark. Girl’s accusation supplies external pressure, but Maris’s silence never wavers; absence of personal risk keeps cost aesthetic. The tightening is lovely yet safe; one failed pattern or a slipped mirror that cuts her finger would sharpen price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: empathy as counter-light that revalues darkness. Subtext lives in gesture—mirror offered, not explained; pebble given, not preached. Final image of stars reflected in dental mirror reframes the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide whether the girl’s pocketed stone is shield or seed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Maris’s perceptual filter—braille-reading planks, spiraling calm arcs—creating a hushed, tidal rhythm. Diction is precise: “stillwater tension,” “bruised evening sky,” never purple. Girl’s dialogue is spare and child-true, contrasting with lyric narration without register drift. One hairline slip: “metronome to her thoughts” edges toward cliché, but cadence recovers instantly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short pulse (“Maris didn’t turn.”) to long, weaving clauses that mimic shutter spirals; no template cadence. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—reflection, stitching, stars—each image pays into closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor: “spiralingly calm” is an awkward adverbial coinage; smoother phrasing would nudge 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar “silent mystic teaches child” arc is refreshed by dental-mirror lantern and shutter kaleidoscope—concrete, low-tech magic that feels site-specific. Risk is quiet rather than bold; story chooses meditative beauty over jeopardy, but specificity rescues it from trope drift. The mica-pebble star is a fresh inflection that grows inevitably from earlier light-play.</comment>
