<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-shaken hands and the leaf talisman give concrete interiority; the decision to re-enter the tunnels is foreshadowed by the wax-sealed memory and the cylinder’s call. The contradiction—seeking the dead to quiet ghosts—drives every beat. Cost is legible: he forfeits the fragile stasis he bought with isolation. One decimal off 8.8 only because the renunciation beat is a single sentence; a sliver more embodied hesitation would lock the hinge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: riddle → cylinder → Hollows → re-entry, each step a because/therefore. Closure is Earned Stasis: he shoulders the old vocation, trading isolation for probable self-annihilation. The cost is felt in the final image—“walk into the dark”—which forecloses the safety he spent years buying. The Orientation Test is waived: the scrapyard’s skeletal geography is taught by line 3 and pays off when the drum becomes the portal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Scrapyard is not backdrop; the hollowed truck, rusted drum, and groaning metal constrain movement and hide the cylinder. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s tracker bias: scent of decay, wind-borne whispers, tactile wax. The leaf’s micro-setting recharges the final image—its sealed veins mirror the tunnel map he now accepts. One notch below 8.8 because spatial choreography inside the drum insertion is elided; we lose a beat of body-to-object scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—will he re-engage the war’s unfinished casualties?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the cylinder names Liora. The reversal is micro but decisive: from refusal (maps on walls = distance) to re-entry (packing leaf and knife). Cost is the forfeiture of protective distance; options narrow to one: descent. Pressure stays causal; no coincidence resolves anything. Held shy of 8.8 because the escalation is a single hinge rather than a progressive vise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as both wound and compass—emerges from the leaf and the echo riddle, never abstractly named. Subtext lives in the phonograph’s warped chorus: the past literally speaks back, distorted. Final image reweights the leaf from souvenir to torch; closeness now means confrontation, not nostalgia. Complexity remains: no guarantee he will save anyone, only that he must try.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Elias’s tracker sensorium: “nose leading,” “wind like thousand voices,” “wax sealing in scent.” Syntax lengthens in dread, then fractures during playback—“voice warping into something almost inhuman.” No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue is absent, so voice evaluation is pure narrative texture; the absence is purposeful and does not harm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “rusted carcass,” “phonograph needle skipping grooves.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, memory, or choice. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure; wax/vein/corpse imagery builds a single lattice. One hairline slip—“perfume of the world before the fires” edges purple but is saved by POV’s nostalgic distortion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-war bloodhound lured underground by analog relic is fresh; the cylinder-as-message-in-bottle revitalizes a dead medium. Leaf-in-wax as memory core feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risk is taken by refusing on-page action, opting for quiet stasis, yet coherence holds. Slight deduction for echo-riddle being a known riddle, though its deployment is recontextualized.</comment>
