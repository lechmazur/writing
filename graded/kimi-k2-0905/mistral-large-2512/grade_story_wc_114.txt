<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s fever-fragile interiority is concrete—thumb-smudging ink, knees in disturbed earth—and his guilt is embodied rather than labeled. The contradictory pull between fleeing prophecy and needing to witness the aftermath is present, but the decisive shift to “present, not right” feels slightly under-cued; one more micro-choice showing him relinquish the need to predict would have locked the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: illustration → encyclopedia → dig → photograph → renunciation. Each beat tightens Elias’s options under the Situational lens until the final Earned Stasis (“breathed without the weight”). The photograph note acts as the irreversible cost, reconfiguring his prior guilt; closure lands with felt weight and no retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The station’s groaning bones and auroral dawn are filtered through Elias’s fever-heightened senses; cold bites, dirt scrapes, tin box rasps—each tactile detail guides his next move. The clearing’s uneven earth literally constrains where he can dig, charging the final uncovering. One minor slip: “valley like a bruise” is vivid but static; if it had mirrored his internal shift the image would have capped the ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt over the needless evacuation—is signaled early and sharpened by each artifact (illustration, photograph). The mid-story tightening occurs when he realizes the flower marks disturbed earth, forcing the dig that forecloses his exile. Cost is visible in the rusted photograph and the note’s admission, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the future’s value lies not in predictive accuracy but in accountable presence. The reweighted illustration—mystery → invitation → absolution—carries the conceptual repricing. Final light on the peaks offers a resonant, non-moral answer: truths are unearthed, not foretold. No tidy moral, no echo-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovering close to Elias maintains perceptual signature—“auroral sorrow,” “residue of fever”—without purple drift. Syntax lengthens in reflection, shortens under physical action, mirroring fever-ebb and breath-return. No head-hop, no filter-stack; diction stays within a weather-man’s lexicon. One clause (“oracle’s burden wasn’t to be right…”) nears editorial intrusion but is saved by immediate bodily payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with pressure: wind-howling fragments give way to longer encyclopedic cadence, then spare unveiling. Metaphors are coherent—“petals like shattered glass” mirrors the broken prophecy motif; no mixed vehicles. Tiny scaffold: “weight of prophecy / weight of truth” is a near-paraphrase but occurs low-stakes; closure image is untouched. High density, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle who values imprecision is itself a fresh angle; pairing it with post-disaster archaeology rather than prediction spectacle deepens the irony. Photograph-in-tin feels inevitable yet unforeseen, transforming the flower clue into communal absolution. Risk is moderate—lyric ellipses, no explosions—yet fully commits to the quiet concept. Could edge higher with one more specific village detail to ground the calamity.</comment>
