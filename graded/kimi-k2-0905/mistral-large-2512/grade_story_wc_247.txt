<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena’s quietly-charismatic trait is shown through gesture and attention rather than label, and her interior contradiction—composing joy out of grief—remains embodied. Elias functions more as admiring mirror than advisor; he never supplies new information or risk, so the relationship crucible stays cool. The final “Keep going” choice is credible but costs nothing on the page; the story therefore lands in competent mid-band rather than high.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena accepts her vocation publicly, reweighting the camera from capture-tool to baton. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of silence-to-music—held cleanly to the last line. Cost is implied, not felt; the reader sees no concrete forfeiture, so the piece stops just short of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, salt wind, and the dock’s geometry are filtered through Lena’s selective attention; the camera body serves as micro-setting that constrains her final conducting gesture. Spatial choreography is flawless; the two bodies never ghost. Environment does not yet force a tactical sacrifice, so the 9-band gate stays closed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only atmospherically; no beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The final acceptance deepens tone but does not foreclose an alternative path, so escalation remains gentle, parking the score just below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “joyful sorrow” emerges through image—camera framing emptiness, hands conducting absence—never named until Elias whispers it once. The final reconfiguration lets the paradox stand without moral, inviting after-echo. Depth is present yet not devastating; the piece earns upper-mid resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lena’s perceptual signature: light as music, silence as score. Syntax lengthens and contracts with her conducting motions; no filter-verb clutter. Voice remains consistent and pressure-responsive, meriting high-band placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphors (moonlight as benediction, silence humming) recur with purpose. No loops, no mixed vehicles, no scaffold. A single paraphrase loop—“the way the…” x3—drops the score a hair beneath the 9-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Using sign language to compose unheard music is fresh; the camera-as-conductor’s-baton reweights a familiar object. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist—but specificity of gesture keeps the concept from feeling recycled. Lands at high-mid originality.</comment>
