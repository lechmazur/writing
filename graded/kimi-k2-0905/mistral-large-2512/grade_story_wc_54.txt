<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity-driven interiority is concrete early (“weight of her curiosity pressing against her ribs”), but the decisive turn—choosing to pocket the sextant and later sketch the greenhouse—rests more on thematic echo than on a visible internal cost; the final acceptance of the blueprint feels lightly earned because her prior flaw/limits are never dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sextant warms, the terminal becomes “a beginning,” and the cost (she leaves with responsibility instead of mere assessment) is legible in the final image; causal chain holds—find object → follow water → meet caretaker → inherit mandate—under an Accumulative/Textural lens that reweights hope from decay to stewardship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Terminal’s collapsed lattice, condensation-fogged greenhouse, and brass sextant are tactile and specific; the greenhouse glass charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining her next act—she sketches its irrigation math, so environment shapes choice. Spatial choreography stays clean across one continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether abandoned structures can still nurture life—tightens once: assessment shifts to participation. The deepening is textural (pattern of redirected flows) rather than a reversible causal turn, but caretaker’s revealed garden forecloses the option of pure detachment; cost is felt in Mara's silent pocketing of the sextant and implied future labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: abandonment → stewardship, decay → redirected growth. Final image of “beginning” reweights earlier “cathedral of forgotten dreams” without moralizing; ambiguity remains (will she return?). Subtext in caretaker’s weary smile conveys years of unseen sacrifice, avoiding explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filters decay through engineering eyes—“calculating load-bearing points,” “equations in the way water carved stone.” Syntax modulates from long lyrical openings to clipped discoveries (“Her breath caught.”), supporting stoic wonder without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“neon residue…half-remembered promise”). One scaffold pair appears (“She had come to assess decay, but she was leaving with something else—a blueprint for resilience”) where second clause restates the obvious; otherwise no loops or register drift, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Post-carnival spaceport greenhouse is a fresh synthesis; sextant-as-seed metaphor transforms standard salvage narrative into quiet stewardship. Specificity of irrigation rerouting gives the trope new engineering grit. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist—but execution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
