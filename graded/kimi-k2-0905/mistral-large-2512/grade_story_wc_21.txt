<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—microfilm smudges, trembling fingers—but her decisive sprint with the ledgers feels sudden; the diary-touch visions show contradiction, yet the final risk isn’t prefigured by an on-page micro-choice that costs her something visible. Lila’s fifty-year vigil supplies emotional weight, but the relationship crucible is asserted more than staged under joint pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: storm → letters → diary → lagoon → ledgers → escape. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon re-swallows the pursuers, repricing the past as an active predator; Elara’s airborne gaze carries felt cost—“the truth was safe—for now.” Orientation is clean inside 120 words. One causal leap—Lila happens to possess the exact rusted key—slightly strains linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory triage works: brass shelves groan, salt-and-gun-oil scent, black water “cold as a corpse’s touch.” The obsidian lagoon re-appears at closure as the agent that reclaims killers, turning setting into antagonist. Micro-setting (rusted key in rock crevice) directly enables the final ledger retrieval. Proper-noun economy is tight; no anchor drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surface the buried voter-suppression evidence—signals early and tightens when headlights appear. One meaningful tightening: the key/crevice beat converts abstract cipher into physical evidence, narrowing options to “grab and run.” Cost is legible—lagoon devours pursuers, Elara forfeits any return to the dunes. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence (key fit) slightly tempers the climb.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—history as living predator—emerges through lagoon imagery and ledger retrieval, never sermonized. Subtext of erased Black voices is embodied in Miriam’s waterproof case rather than asserted. Final image of black water reclaiming men reweights the premise without moralizing. One thematic echo line (“the past … just waited”) is allowed because it crystallizes the CR.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: microfilm smudges, salt sting, retrocognitive overlay. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences in zeppelin, staccato beach sprint. No head-hopping; Lila’s dialogue carries distinct diction (“She wasn’t the first”). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Psychic distance cleanly compresses during truck chase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences advance multiple jobs. One paraphrase loop—“the lagoon’s surface rippling without wind, as if something beneath had exhaled” followed immediately by “the water began to churn”—costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. No scaffolding or filler stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing civil-rights archival thriller with retrocognitive eco-horizon feels fresh; the lagoon as retrocognitive prison literalizes “buried history.” Cipher diary, zeppelin library, and voter-suppression ledgers braid into a singular stakes engine. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic swamp or random documents. Risk in genre mash-up heightens rather than obscures clarity.</comment>
