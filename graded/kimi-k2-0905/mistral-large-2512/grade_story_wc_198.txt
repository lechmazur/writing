<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s lifelong decoding mission is palpable; the final exhaustion and lighter case give concrete cost. Interiority stays sensorial (“lungs burned,” “reed trembled”) rather than abstract. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the high band is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is not destroyed but quieted at visible physical cost (“lungs burned,” weight lifted from case). The causal chain—decipher → play → absorb → hush—holds start-to-finish. Orientation is immediate (“morning fog,” “prism atrium”) and never clouds the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism atrium, saxophone, and grotto are tactile, bioluminescent, and return in the final image; the sax’s changing weight even guides the last beat. Selective sensory triage (mist, reed, dew) keeps the 800-word economy tight. Setting never blocks action, though spatial footprint of grotto remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hush the prophecy”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened once when music must absorb the words. Agency is clear: only Elias’s playing can avert the city’s sonic drowning. Cost is legible in fatigue and the case’s lighter weight, meeting the 8.2 bar for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence as preservation emerges through action, never thesis: music dissolves words, mist swallows faces, final hush is felt, not explained. Ambiguity lingers—prophecy still exists—avoiding moralistic closure. The grandmother’s wordless melody supplies concrete ancestry for the idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s perceptions; diction (“spectral shards,” “vested hush”) is consistent with a musician’s synesthetic bent. Rhythm swells and contracts with breath and phrase length, teaching its pattern early. No dialogue appears, so voice purity remains unbroken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the breath-music metaphor. Figurative language is restrained to one striking image per beat, avoiding purple overload. Occasional adjective coupling (“quietly vivid”) is earned by thematic payoff; no loops or scaffold detected in closing third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Sound-eats-prophecy” is a fresh inversion of the Orpheus trope, grounded in tactile sax detail rather than abstract magic. Risky negative-space playing method is shown, not declared, and charges the final silence. While mist/music imagery is familiar, the bioluminescent grotto and weight-shifting case particularize it.</comment>
