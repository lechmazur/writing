<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s obsession with “the beginning in every ending” is declared early and circles back in the final Charged Poise, giving her a coherent arc. Interiority stays concrete—tuning dials, breath fog, pulse quickening—yet never slips into cliché. The only missing torque: we see no contradictory impulse under pressure; she glides smoothly from seeker to initiate without interior resistance that would deepen cost. Still, her renunciation of physical existence feels proportionate to the length and is earned by the pattern the piece teaches.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the tower falls (visible cost), Mira vanishes into the “shard of hush,” and the rule-set is repriced—time folds, beginnings/ends collapse. Accumulative lens holds throughout; each sensory layer (rusted girders, lunar pull, interpreter hum) tightens the texture until the final image reweights everything. Orientation is established by line 3 (“radio tower city of Vaelis… gorge”), well inside the 120-word waiver. No causal break or convenience; even the fragment’s dissolve is pre-figured by geometry matching the anomaly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The suspended tower city is sketched with merciless selectivity: “rusted girders groaning” under lunar gravity, wind-buffeted platform, wreckage below—every detail either constrains Mira’s footing or warps the signal she chases. Micro-setting (the interpreter’s cracked screen, the shard’s mirror-gleam) doubles as sacred relics, guiding her final tuning choice. Weather and physics stay consistent; perigee is not decorative but literally bends the broadcast medium. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves while she handles device and fragment mid-plunge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled in para 1 and escalates through texture: static thickens, tower bolts scream, gravity spikes. One meaningful deepening occurs when she pivots from capturing first signal to listening “for the silence between them,” narrowing options to a single irrevocable frequency. Cost is legible: bodily obliteration and the fragment’s dissolution. Under Accumulative lens that deepening is sufficient; no extra reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: origin as recursive illusion, silence as plenum. The Hollywood relic—humanity’s first light—dissolving into pre-vibration hush enacts the concept without sermon. Final image of tower impact + shard fade offers a resonant, non-literal answer: endings generate beginnings only when self is relinquished. No thematic echo or moralizing sentence intrudes; the reconfiguration is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a hushed, reverent diction (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”) that modulates into staccato urgency as bolts shear. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices electromagnetic textures, geometric patterns, weight of moonglow—never touristic filler. No dialogue to test, yet interior monologue stays in her plausible lexicon (no academic jargon). Syntax mirrors lunar drag—long sentences early, brittle fragments at climax—demonstrating rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musically varied; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every metaphor (tower as forgotten dream, shard as mirror world) is reused and pays off in closure. One minor scaffold: “serenely electric” appears twice within four lines; compression would strengthen. Otherwise information density is high, propelling forward without hedges or boilerplate.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Risk is high—lyric sf collapsing into metaphysical transfiguration—yet executed with disciplined specificity. The “first film fragment” conceit rewrites the Genesis myth through analog tech, a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Setting, artifact, and concept interlock so tightly removal would shred the fabric. No obvious trope recycling or pop-culture borrowing; even the Tower trope is re-cast as antenna to pre-creation silence.</comment>
