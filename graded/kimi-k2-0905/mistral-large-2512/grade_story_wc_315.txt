<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—observer who must now act—surfaces early and drives every tactile micro-choice (vine-harness, buckle re-thread). The final refusal to let go crystallizes a visible, bodily cost (buckle bite, gasping) that satisfies Earned Stasis. Still, the “trust” motive is asserted more than dramatized in mid-scene beats, keeping the arc just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each climb move is a because/therefore linkage propelled by the snapped branch crisis. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (city lights, arbor spine); the closing image of brighter city lights reconfigures the stake—proximity to the world he only watched—delivering Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the harness gouge). One minor scaffold: the phrase “soundless echo” is used twice without tonal payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The arbor’s blackened ridges, wind direction, and city shimmer are filtered through Elias’s aerial cartographer gaze; every tactile detail (bark Braille, vine bite) doubles as tool and threat. The parachute buckle evolves from talisman to load-bearing anchor, directly shaping the final image—meets 9-band gate. A sliver off for near-repetition of “leaves whispering / wind rattling leaves.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove patterns matter by surviving—tightens when the branch snaps and forecloses the option to wait; the vine-buckle improvisation is an on-page trade-off that escalates physical cost. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no second reversal keeps it from 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: abstraction vs. embodied participation. The arbor descent enacts the shift from reading signs to writing one’s own. Final image (brighter city lights) reweights earlier “dying stars” without moralizing—resonant, not declared. Lacks the conceptual punch or social cost needed for 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s aerial cartographer perceptual signature—precise, metric, synesthetic. Syntax lengthens under duress then fractures in the fall, mirroring breath. No head-hopping or register drift; “soundless echo” tic is minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without purple overload. One paraphrase loop: “the way the wind had torn… / the way he’d yanked” costs −0.2. Otherwise tight, clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “fallen observer must climb” arc is refreshed by the nocturnal arbor above cloud-deck and the buckle-as-climbing-gear reversal. Specificity of Elias’s pattern-seeking background and the radio-static silence cue keep it from template territory, but premise isn’t radically new.</comment>
