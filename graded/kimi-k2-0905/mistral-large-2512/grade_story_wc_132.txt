<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s need to control vs. the tree’s demand for surrender—is dramatized in one continuous beat: her hand meeting wax-soft bark, the laugh-gasp, the deliberate unclenching of shoulders. The moment carries visible cost (she kneels in mud, renounces intervention) and is rooted in earlier textual clues, so the arc earns its quiet stasis. Minor slip: “she understood transformation better than most” is diagnostic self-label, but it sits outside the climax and doesn’t deflate the choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of kneeling in rain crystallizes the new stance—study replaced by surrendered witness—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern (storm-season upheaval, leaf-in-pocket, bark-silver shift) tightens once and lands with conceptual cost: her life’s method is foreclosed. Causality holds; no teleporting props or retro-patches. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mossy trellis, cool soil, and rain-soaked greenhouse function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: mud on knees is the price of staying. Sensory triage (cool earth, singed-leaf scent, silver shimmer) is filtered through Mara’s cultivator gaze and escalates with the pattern break. No white-room syndrome; spatial track is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—tightens once when bark yields under her fingers, forcing the renunciation. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each sensory anomaly (leaf pulse, bark iridescence) increases density until the single option—let go—becomes undeniable. Cost is legible in the final image; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete inversion of botanist-as-master to plant-as-inviter; no final-paragraph thesis states it. The linden leaf’s reprise (edges curling in her palm) reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: we don’t know what the “something older” is, but the cost of not-knowing is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s cultivator idiom: “quiet revolutions,” “circuitously sincere,” “reconstruct the world in her image.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under the tactile shock (“A sound escaped her—half gasp, half laugh”). No head-hopping or register drift; perceptual signature is consistent and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is spare and accurate (“yielding like warm wax” is single, apt simile). Opening and closing lines book-end the storm arc with sonic economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The botanical-horror-of-wonder angle feels fresh: a linden turning *into* something else via seduction rather than attack. Folklore texts are hinted, not dumped, keeping the rule-set mysterious yet coherent. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than shock—but the specificity of cultivator perception prevents generic “evil tree” tropes.</comment>
