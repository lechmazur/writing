<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s skepticism is declared, not dramatized; the pivot to belief is a single beat of palm-on-tile with no interior contradiction shown. The notebook transcription is the only micro-choice, but it carries no visible cost or risk, so the arc feels observed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tile dims, the notebook is full, and Elias stays to watch—cost is the responsibility of carrying strangers’ memories. Causality is thin (whale-song coincidence triggers the tile), but the accumulative lens holds: each memory shard adds weight until the final image reconfigures his stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tower, tile, and whale-song are filtered through Elias’s bodily attention—salt wind on skin, dust under fingers—so the micro-setting actively constrains the moment he presses the tile. The open arch framing the ocean becomes the final image that holds the new charge, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he listen or walk away?—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: the tile simply activates, no escalation or trade-off complicates the choice. The whales’ crescendo is atmospheric, not tactical, so the tightening is emotional, not optional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory emerges through the accumulating shards rather than statement; the unheard symphony reweights from mournful ambience to ethical summons. No moral is declared—Elias’s silent vigil lets the image carry the repricing—avoiding the echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: wind-scoured stone, grandmother’s constellations, the faint shimmer of symbols. Rhythm modulates from longer skeptical sentences to shorter beats under the tile’s flare, keeping psychic distance clean and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, vivid, loop-free; only one scaffold pair (“wasn’t magic…was something deeper”) that restates without new pressure. Metaphors are spare and coherent (tapestry threads, unheard symphony), never clogging the high-pressure tile beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tile-as-memory-constellation is fresh, and linking whale song to archival ethics gives the migration new symbolic weight. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but the synthesis feels specific to this cliff-top moment, not generic magic-item fare.</comment>
