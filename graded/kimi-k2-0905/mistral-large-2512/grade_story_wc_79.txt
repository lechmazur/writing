<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity and defiance are vivid early, but the interior contradiction—why she keeps digging after the hollowed expedition warns her—never crystallizes in-scene; the final sprint to the ship reads as adrenaline rather than earned renunciation. Embodied emotion is strong (“lungs burning”), yet the micro-choice to flee is not shown colliding with an alternative want, so the cost feels generic. The flaw is sufficient for this length, but not yet indelible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: crack → descent → revelation → flight, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Decisive Change—she abandons land for sea—paid for by the visceral sight of the changed explorers; cost is on-page (“did not stop… did not look back”). Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. One causal bump: the whistle set-up never recurs to alter tactics, a minor unkept gun.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shell-streets, salt haze, and grooved carapace are tactile and immediately filter through Mira’s cartographer gaze. The green glow and stone pillars are sketched with just enough sensory data to re-weight the premise without slowing flight. Micro-setting win: the hairline crack’s warmth and groan constrain her chisel tempo, charging the final image. Environment actively guides her hand and later her sprint—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map the cracks / find a door”—is signaled in first 120 words and escalates from cartographic curiosity to survival reflex. The midpoint reversal (expedition still “alive” but wrong) narrows her options to flee or become them; flight is a visible price. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; however, the watchers’ threat remains abstract, muting the final tick of cost compared to bodily injury or social loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of forbidden knowledge versus communal safety emerges through spiral motifs and silence rather than exposition. The reprise of “watching” shifts target from city to cracks, a quiet Conceptual Repricing that lands in the final line. No moral sermon; ambiguity lingers about whether flight is courage or repetition of elders’ cowardice. Could sharpen subtext in one object beyond the whistle to hit 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—spiral shells, salt scent, pattern whispers. Syntax lengthens during descent, then fragments as she runs, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; diction remains within a cartographer’s lexicon. Reed whistle motif is seeded but never acoustically returns, a small missed voice beat; still, rhythmic control under pressure is evident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sunwashed dread”) fits tone, but “the darkness yawned” edges cliché, a −0.2 nudge. Sentence variety propels the sprint finale. Clean copy; no clarity breaks. Within hailing distance of 9-band if final metaphor were more particular to shell or map lore.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>City-turtles and pattern-language silence fuse into a fresh cosmology; the expedition’s living husk subverts the lost-colony trope. Spiral motifs evolve from decorative to warning, showing transformation rather than ornament. Risk-taking (no dialogue, lyric escalation) heightens dread without gimmick. Not quite 9 because watchers’ ontology stays off-page—one more specific rule would make the reprice unforgettable.</comment>
