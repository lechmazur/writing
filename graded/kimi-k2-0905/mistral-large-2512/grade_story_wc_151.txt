<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s puzzle-solving itch and filial ache are credibly fused; his chalk transcription on the arcade floor is a sharp micro-choice that externalizes both. Interiority is concrete (“clipboard pressing against his ribs like a secret”) and avoids label-speak. The mother’s sudden appearance is motivated by her prior chalktrail, so the final recognition carries earned emotional cost without overt exposition. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc is slightly tidy, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: chalk numbers → letter memory → dawn arcade → maternal reveal. Orientation is clean by line 8; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the golden light re-casts Elias’s lifelong identity-making as self-search, cost felt in “clipboard suddenly heavy.” One minor elasticity: mother’s off-stage knowledge of the PO box is unexplained, but the emotional logic overrides.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Golden arcade at dawn functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its “liquid honey” glow becomes the mirror of Elias’s self-recognition. Selective sensory triage (“joystick worn smooth,” “neon flickering weakly”) keeps momentum. Spatial choreography stays clean; no prop teleporting. The clipboard’s silver filigree catches the same light at the end, satisfying the 9+ object gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elias decoding the chalk summons—tightens once when the letters’ postmarks confirm local stalker-knowledge, narrowing his safety. Escalation is modest: no external jeopardy beyond existential recognition, but the “truth hides in margins” line raises conceptual stakes. Cost is legible: his satchel strap digs, clipboard grows heavy, identity vocation reframed. Could use one more tangible forfeiture for 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-erasure vs self-inscription emerges through recurring marginalia (letter margins, chalk on floor, arcade edge-light) without explicit statement. Subtext in mother’s first line implies she disappeared to let him hone his craft, a quiet parental sacrifice that re-weights the premise. No moralizing; final image invites multiple readings (reunion, indictment, inheritance). Sentimentality avoided.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is coder’s pattern-seeking (“numbers corresponded to letters”). Syntax flexes under pressure—“His breath caught” as single-sentence paragraph. No head-hopping; mother’s dialogue carries subtext, not exposition. Register remains consistent; no corporate drift. Distinctive without showy pyrotechnics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, no scaffold loops; “liquid honey” metaphor is sustained without contradiction. Sentence rhythm modulates—calm descriptive clauses accelerate into staccato beats at reveal. No filter-verb stacks; active verbs drive momentum. One paraphrase loop: “golden light…golden glow” within 30 words, minor −0.2, not closure-touching. Otherwise clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hard-boiled code-breaker heritage meets lyric retrofuturist arcade; chalk-as-cipher literalizes “margins” metaphor. Mother-son reunion twist is familiar but re-cast through pseudonym-creator lens, giving inherited pattern-hunting a genealogical sting. Risk taken with quiet, non-confrontational climax; coherence maintained. Not radically groundbreaking, but specific enough to linger.</comment>
