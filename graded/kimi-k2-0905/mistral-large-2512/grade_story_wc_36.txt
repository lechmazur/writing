<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and curiosity are palpable, but interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“harvest insights from that failure”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from sealing to weaving is credible because the flute’s warmth and the shadow-figure’s cue have been physically prepared. Still, we never see Elias wrestle with a live moral or tactical choice—he obeys instructions once the threshold is crossed. Cost is implied, not felt; the beat remains observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is lean and coherent: silence → flute → path → cavern → tear → other-side lesson → melodic stitch. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the boundary re-imagined as thread—visible in the smoothing of the tear and the released canyon hush. Orientation is swift; driftwood pattern is taught by 25 % mark. The −0.3 non-closure cap applies because the Protagonist makes no micro-choice under pressure; he plays the melody once told, so agency is thin.</comment>

<comment>Thunder-echo Range is more than postcard: footstep tremors, damp earth, cavern air that “smelled… older” all filter through Elias’s hyper-alert guilt. Flute-as-micro-setting qualifies: its rising heat and shifting glyphs constrain when and how he acts. The driftwood markers evolve from external trail to internal re-patterning, charging the final weave. One slip: “avalanchingly quiet” is used once as adverbial flourish without sensory ripple elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mend the tear before reality bleeds—signals early and tightens when the figure declares the boundary a thread. Single meaningful deepening: failure-to-seal becomes opportunity-to-weave, foreclosing the wall-building option. Cost is conceptual (paradigm shift) rather than visceral; no tangible price is risked or lost on the page. Sufficient for this length, but the absence of a personal trade-off caps the band below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: repair versus integration, wall versus weave. The flute’s reed-as-thread and the canyon’s echo-turned-hush supply concrete correlatives without sermonizing. Final image of “held breath finally released” reweights the opening silence, offering quiet resonance rather than moral. No thematic drift, though the insight is delivered by an external mouthpiece rather than wrested from action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature favors hush, vibration, and temperature. Syntax lengthens under tension then fractures into short beats (“Play.”) to mirror breath control. No dialogue until the shadow exchange; that single line carries wind-through-canyon timbre, distinct from narrative register. Occasional elevated diction (“avalanchingly,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges against POV lexicon but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative layers are selective (sliver of captured sun, reeds in the wind). One paraphrase loop inside the cavern—“something older, something that didn’t belong”—slows momentum. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing sentences form a satisfying echoic bracket. Line-level artifacts do not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Frayed-reality trope is refreshed by the weaving metaphor and the sonic mechanic of a reed flute. Driftwood markers as living sigils supply tactile novelty. Shadow-figure exposition edges close to familiar “guide spirit” template, blunting surprise. Overall synthesis feels specific to this canyon, this sound, this guilt—yet risks remain modest, not bold.</comment>
