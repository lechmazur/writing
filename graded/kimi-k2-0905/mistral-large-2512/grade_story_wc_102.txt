<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lien’s contradictory impulses—clinging to unused love vs. giving the tear away—are dramatized in one embodied gesture; the renunciation costs her the literal talisman and the fantasy of private salvation, a price legible in the final image. Micro-choices (kneeling, pressing tear into stranger’s palm) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Only the father’s instant pivot from hollow to hopeful feels slightly over-calibrated, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tear’s transfer reweights the premise—unused love’s storage site is externalized, not hoarded. Causal chain holds: memory surfaces → method practiced → stranger arrives → gift given → breath reveals path. Fog-parting mechanic taught early and paid off at climax. Cost is unmistakable: Lien permanently relinquishes the relic that anchored her identity. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s damp stones, camera obscura’s warmth, and violet wisteria constrain Lien’s posture and timing; the tear’s cool weight in pocket literally tips the decision to kneel. Fog’s thickness responds to exhalation, turning environment into tactical interface. Selective sensory triage—visual violet, tactile brass, acoustic cough—mirrors crisis attention. Micro-setting (palm-to-palm tear exchange) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where does unused love go?”—tightens once: private memory → public gift. Escalation is a single deepening: the stranger’s arrival forces the stakes from metaphysical quest to immediate life-or-death test. Agency is renunciation with visible price. No reversal, but the tightening forecloses hoarding as an option; coincidence complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the tear’s migration: compassion is a circulating current, not private property. No moralizing; the final image of light seeping into the boy’s skin reweights all prior wisteria-and-fog imagery as communal circuitry. Ambiguity lingers—Lien is now emptied, possibly bereft—avoiding tidy uplift. Subtext in the father’s raw “please” carries more meaning than any exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Lien’s perceptual filter: brass warmth, jade coolness, fog response to breath. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short imperatives (“Breathe”) at climax, mirroring respiratory method. No head-hopping; father’s interior accessed only via observable hollow eyes and shoulder easing. Diction remains within Lien’s artisanal lexicon—no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene: long clause for twilight bleed, staccato for “He inhaled, sharp and shuddering.” Figurative density peaks only in the opening, then yields to tactile propulsion. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. One near-mixed metaphor (“sparks not in the air—they are in her”) is immediately grounded by the next breath beat, so clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Reincarnation trope is refreshed by respiratory mechanics: breath as spark-transfer device rather than abstract karma. Camera obscura—inverted inner image—becomes literal metaphor for past-life inversion, not set dressing. Risk taken in merging Buddhist relic, Victorian optics, and lyric fog pays off in a single gesture. Could not swap tear for any gem; jade’s cultural specificity is integral to the compassion circuitry.</comment>
