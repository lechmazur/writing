<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is legible—restore dawns to save the realm—but interiority stays generic (“her throat tight,” “heart ached”) and never fractures under contradiction. The keeper’s dialogue supplies thematic exposition instead of forcing Elara to test belief; no micro-choice visibly risks or costs her anything until she kneels to plant. The ending song relies on communal participation that the page hasn’t earned from her prior isolation, so the shift feels eased rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the first pale dawn appears and the realm “breathes again,” reconfiguring hope with the cost of Elara’s raw throat and the keeper’s dissolution. Causality is soft—singing is declared sufficient rather than tested in failure—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: pattern of seed-song-light accumulates and finally breaks the night. One transition (greenhouse → village) is clean; orientation is anchored by word 60. No meaningful tightening inside the middle beats keeps it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mica window, vines, and liquid-gold fruit are tactile, refracted through Elara’s wonder; the greenhouse air (“overripe fruit and damp earth”) grounds every beat. Spatial tracking stays coherent—boots sink, vines coil, seed is planted—though the village square is sketched in two lines. The window recurs at closure, glowing, but never constrains choice; hence capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared early—realm dying, nights endless—but the only escalation is the keeper handing over a seed and saying “sing.” No obstacle, failed attempt, or rising cost narrows options; the song works on first try. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical, satisfying the Accumulative lens yet lacking a visible trade-off that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective memory as seed-and-song emerges through image, not lecture, culminating in the communal chorus. The keeper’s line “hope is only sleeping” flirts with echo but is earned by prior greenhouse imagery. Final dawn is understated yet resonant, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity about who first forgets songs invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“liquid gold,” “raw throat”) is consistent, rhythmic, and slightly elevated without purple drift. No head-hopping; keeper’s dialogue carries subtext of farewell. Occasional template cadence (“she sang until… until… until…”) is purposeful, mirroring song-swelling momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective, never clustering in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“the people… the people…”) is minor. Strong verbs dominate; only one filter verb slips in. No grammar or pronoun errors; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Alchemical orchard that grows dawns under forgotten songs is a fresh synthesis of mythic botany and sound-magic. The mirror-world frame is named, not explored, keeping novelty surface-level. Yet specificity of mica refracting dawn-fruit and vines greeting ankles makes the image stick. Risk is moderate; transformation stays within fairy-tale register but feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
