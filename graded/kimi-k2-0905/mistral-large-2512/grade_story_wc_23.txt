<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-propelled quest is vivid, but interiority slips into abstractions (“geography of loss”) rather than contradictory impulse in scene; no micro-choice inside the station alters his next step—he simply obeys the next call. The censer warms, yet he never weighs keeping vs. abandoning it, so the final walk-off feels pre-ordained, not earned renunciation. Missing beat where moon-shifted symbols could force a costly decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonlit horizon re-weights the censer’s pull, cost felt in “some paths weren’t meant to be left behind.” Causal chain, however, is thin: each midnight call is an off-page gift; the sister’s voice sets up but never pays off inside this scene. Orientation is clean by line 5; only one shard, so default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Signal station’s rusted ribs, salt wind, and moon-cast shadows filter through Elias’s sailor-senses; the censer acts as micro-setting that “clicks” to metal, constraining placement and pulse. Selective sensory triage—visual, tactile, acoustic—mirrors his narrowed grief. Spatial track stays clean across the single room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find meaning in the dried seabed loss—signaled early. Pressure rises only atmospherically; no concrete trade-off or narrowing option inside the scene. The midnight call promises next coordinates but doesn’t test Elias’s commitment here; escalation is accretive, not decisive. Cost is lyrical, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of return-as-repair emerges implicitly through reverse migration refrain and censer’s return to station; final image reframes abandonment as rebuilding. No moral summarizing; ambiguity lingers. Could deepen if moon-phase mechanics tied symbolically to cyclical return rather than atmospheric glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s patched-coat perception; diction favors maritime rust and harbor silt, rhythm lengthens under moonlight then shortens on ring tone. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Distinctive attention to “moon-pulled tides when the tides were gone” crystallizes POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, imagistic, with high density: “patina bronze censer foot sat heavy… etched with symbols that fluctuated with the moon phases” carries object, material, and magic in one stroke. Occasional metaphor cluster (“geography of loss”, “skeletal against the starlit sky”) but spaced enough to retain clarity. No loops or scaffold detected; final line breathes with open cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration and moon-reactive relic fuse drought-SF with ghost-call quest; combo feels fresh rather than trope check-box. Image of a tideless moon still tugging people inland reconfigures familiar climate-fiction into mythic register. Risk is moderate but coherent; not radically avant-garde yet specific to this voice.</comment>
