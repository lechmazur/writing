<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nabu-sharru’s frugality-as-devotion is embodied in every beat: the hush of his sandals, the trembling finger on the tile, the refusal to flee when mercenaries close. The final renunciation—accepting that the tile’s purpose is preservation, not power—carries visible cost: he kneels empty-handed among ashes. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic; the only slip is a brief “understood then” summary that slightly blurs the peak shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tile dissolves into a future library, reweighting the premise from binding stars to seeding knowledge. Causal chain holds: theft → incantation → offer → renunciation → shard. Orientation is anchored by word 80; the oculus star mirror is set up and paid off. Cost is palpable—he forfeits the tile and any future claim on power—so the lens (Causal) remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The palace’s cracked lapis, cedar oil, and descending star-through-roof constrain movement and symbolism; the body-under-pressure is the setting. Every sensory note is filtered through Nabu-sharru’s astronomer gaze—myrrh reads as “faint scent,” not catalog. The star-mirror final image recharges earlier “constellations caught in a god’s breath,” earning the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve knowledge beyond empire—tightens when the figure reveals the tile’s true covenant is with the future, foreclosing personal mastery. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required. Cost is legible: he surrenders the relic and accepts anonymity. Pressure escalates under Causal lens because each beat narrows his options from theft → negotiation → relinquishment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: devotion measured not in blood but in withheld gold, in nights saved for stars. The encrypted devotion motif reconfigures from secret numerals to the living archive of scholars yet unborn. No moralizing final sentence; the shard of clay in an empty hall reweights everything without commentary. Ambiguity lingers—was the vision promise or burden—yielding resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Nabu-sharru’s perceptual syntax: “sandals whisper,” “numbers pulsed with his heartbeat.” No head-hop; the veiled figure’s speech is wind-through-reeds, yet diction remains inside the astronomer’s metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into single-clause breath as torches approach, then collapses into the quiet final image—precise modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, artifact-free: no filter stacks, no synonym loops. Figurative layer is spare—one metaphor per beat, each paid off (“star caught in god’s breath” → star-mirror). Sentence variety propels: long inhalation of opening sentence, staccato mercenary shouts, final fragment of shard. Only a hairline slip: “empirically ironic” feels tagged on rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: astrolabe-era data preservation as insurgent act against regime change. Magic square becomes seed-crystal for a library rather than weapon—non-obvious reframe. Risk taken in quiet, non-violent climax pays off. Slight deduction for recognizable “last scholar in fallen palace” scaffold, but specificity of frugality-as-devotion and future-archive vision transcends template.</comment>
