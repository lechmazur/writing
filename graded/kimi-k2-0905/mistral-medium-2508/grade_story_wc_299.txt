<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liam’s contradictory impulses—cataloging facts vs. craving meaning—are dramatized in the tactile handling of the cloth; the final pocketing is a credible renunciation of appraisal logic with felt cost in the steady breath he accepts. Interiority stays concrete, no therapy-speak. The “confidently uncertain” tag is shown, not told, through micro-choices like tracing the hem and refusing to price the scrap. Secondary characters supply brief pressure only; widow memory is summary, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the road ahead reweighted by the cloth in pocket, uncertainty now space-between-notes rather than failure. Causal chain holds—cloth cue → memory → refusal to appraise → drive off—each beat narrows options under lens of accumulative resonance. Orientation clear by line 3; no penalty. Cost legible in final image: headlights cutting dark, quarry applause fading—applause itself priced as expendable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Trailer, quarry echo, and grille cloth act as micro-setting; cloth final placement in pocket charges the last image, meeting 9+ gate. Sensory selection is urgent—old coffee, damp cardboard, dust motes as crowd lighters—filtered through roadie-appraiser priorities. Spatial choreography clean: box, tape, foreman entry, truck exit. Weather unused but unnecessary. Detail economy high; no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he assign value or accept uncertainty?—tightens when the cloth rekindles band memory, forcing micro-choice: pocket, not price. Escalation accumulative: each sensory echo (dust motes = lighters, quarry blasts = drum machine) reweights appraisal habit as hollow. Cost visible in final breath-as-metronome, foregoing cash and certainty. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict sufficient and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: applause → after → silence → engine hum; no explicit thesis. Subtext in cloth’s Sharpie word “After” reframed from set-closer tag to post-career credo. Resonant reconfiguration: applause no longer validation but quarry echo to leave behind. Avoids sermon; final image ambiguous yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice distinct—roadie-appraiser hybrid, tactile lexicon of cables, logos, estate dust. Rhythm mirrors heartbeat under pressure: short clauses during blast shakes, longer when coiling memory. No head-hopping. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays embodied. Register stable; no corporate drift. Dialogue brief, natural, subtextual—“Suit yourself” = dismissal of appraisal logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs. Mixed metaphors avoided—“dust motes like lighters” sustains single vehicle. High density: one line can set, characterize, and echo theme (“trailer smelled like old coffee and damp cardboard”). Minor paraphrase loop on “uncertainty didn’t feel like failure” / “felt like the space between notes” but spaced enough to pass. Clean grammar, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise—ex-roadie valuing post-fame detritus—fresh angle on familiar midlife quest. Cloth-as-memory-talisman repurposed from trash to existential touchstone. Risk taken in quiet ending without external payoff; coherence maintained. Could edge higher if quarry setting had mirrored sound-memory more structurally, but still specific and memorable.</comment>
