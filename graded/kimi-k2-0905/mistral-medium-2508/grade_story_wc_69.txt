<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—his fingers “tracing the carved edges,” the comparison to “a student who had forgotten their music”—and his micro-choice to hum the negative space is the earned pivot. The four remnant singers are sketched with economical, body-based tags that distinguish them (tremor, bullet-scarred folder), satisfying the ≤2-character default expansion. Motivation remains coherent: the drive to reclaim harmony by listening to absence. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test marginally missed, but the visible cost of enduring fragmentation holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final shimmer of “what they were learning to hold” reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—silence itself becomes the new music. Causality is interior but legible: because the rosette remembers, Elias subtracts noise instead of adding notes, therefore the choir reconstitutes as a listening body. Cost is palpable—twenty voices shrunk to four, the hollow rosette as persistent constraint. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“The velvet library exhaled…”), well within the 120-word window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its “traveled stillness” and amber-stained shelves actively shape the tactic of listening rather than singing. Autumn’s leaf-fall is filtered through Elias’s musician ear—“each leaf a note falling silent”—so environment mirrors internal cadence. Spatial choreography is clean; five bodies circle one table, rosette centered. The rosette itself is the charged object that constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can harmony exist after cultural noise has stripped the choir?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of absence increases as each singer drops out, tightening the remaining four around the rosette’s hollow. The meaningful tightening is Elias’s decision to lead with silence; this narrows options from “rehearse” to “listen,” with felt cost of perpetual fragility. Agency is renunciatory rather than proactive, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the vanishing of art is answered not by restoration but by attending to the hollow itself. Subtext operates in gesture—the tenor’s hesitant finger-touch of the rosette speaks the fear of re-trauma louder than any confession. Final image reweights prior motifs: the shimmer of held absence is the non-literal answer to “whose pain deserves to be heard.” No articulated moral; resonance lingers in the cracked quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature—“expectantly resigned sigh,” “slow fire” of stained glass—syntax mirrors musical phrasing. No head-hopping; choral voices remain external, heard, not interiorized. Compression is purposeful: paragraph lengths modulate like breaths, longest where silence is taught. Register remains within Elias’s professional lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “the autumn wind rattling the panes like an old man tapping his cane” fuses sound, body, and time in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language peaks only at high-emotion beats, never overwrought. Rhythm accelerates into the final shimmer, then arrests—line-level craft mirrors musical fermata.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle: a choir that heals by subtracting sound rather than adding it. Rosette-as-absence reverses the expected relic trope; the missing zither matters more than a whole one would. Risk of quiet ending pays off—no triumphant song, only shimmered air. Specificity of “bullet-scarred folder” and “expectantly resigned sigh” prevents generic trauma chorus.</comment>
