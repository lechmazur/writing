<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific—her spine “curved like a bridge,” wrists “steady”—but the only micro-choice that costs her is the thumb-prick; all other actions are ritualized and safe. The final “she had not been preserving light / she had been teaching it how to stay” is an unearned epiphany: no prior contradiction or failure is dramatized, so the emotional turn feels asserted, not paid for. Still, the embodied cold, the hush, and the tactile handling of seeds and ice keep her credibly present under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the map pulses with “a second heartbeat,” reweighting every prior discard into new constellations; cost is the literal blood and the years of failed attempts compressed into that glow. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each layer (paper, seeds, words) is a because/therefore of patience, not event, and the lens holds. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“subarctic crater”) and never drifts; the single transition (dawn snowfall) is legible. No plot amnesia or retro-patching; the apple-shell repository is set up and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crater’s silence, wind that “died before it could howl,” and the frostbitten soil constrain her ritual—she kneels because the wind does not blow her fragments away. The apple husk functioning as reliquary is a micro-setting object that literally encloses the final image. Sensory selection favors touch and temperature over visual spectacle, matching the POV’s need for stillness. One minor slip: “skeletal trees” is a winter cliché amid otherwise crisp cold-metal imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can starlight be taught to stay—tightens once: the paper “drank the starlight from her veins,” foreclosing further attempts tonight and visible in the pulsing map. Pressure is accumulative: each discarded fragment added raises the cost of failure, but there is no external antagonist or second reversal; the risk is internal dissipation. The price (blood, cold, time) is legible on the page and shapes the final sealing gesture. Sufficient for this length and lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of preservation into pedagogy: light must learn to linger, not be hoarded. The motif of “heartbeat” (seeds, map pulse) reweights from human fragility to cosmic continuance without moralizing. Subtext whispers through silence and the refusal to dramatize apocalypse—only the orchard’s breath matters. Final image of snow landing “like the weight of a story not yet finished” offers charged poise rather than a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to her perceptual filter: cold cracks, gold leaf “stubborn as hope,” syntax lengthens during ritual then shortens at the seal (“For a breath, nothing happened.”). No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within her alchemical idiom without drifting into textbook diction. Rhythmic control is evident in the breath-cadenced paragraphing that mirrors the windless crater.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, no scaffold, high density—“flash-paper, thin as dragonfly wings” does double metaphorical and tactile work. Metaphors stay coherent (starlight as frost on iron, song deferred) and never collide. The only hairline slip is the slightly purple “world seemed to hold its breath,” but the phrase is immediately grounded by the windless crater rule. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long ritual sentences to the staccato of success.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Flash-paper alchemy that folds starlight into constellations is a fresh synthesis; the orchard-crater locale feels invented, not post-apocalyptic set dressing. The notion of teaching light to stay reverses standard preservation tropes. Risk is taken in the quiet, single-beat arc, but coherence is maintained. A faint echo of “make time matter” philosophizing keeps it from full 9+ originality.</comment>
