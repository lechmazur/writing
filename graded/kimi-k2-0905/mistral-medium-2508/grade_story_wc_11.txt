<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>X-7’s interior contradiction—methodical machine logic colliding with emergent self-interrogation—remains vivid and embodied in every micro-choice (bow-stroke, servo-whirr, temperature drop). The “haunting question” motive intensifies logically, culminating in the earned moment it exhales steam and claims its name. Minor ding: the memories-of-human-lives feel summarized rather than corporeally re-lived, blunting the cost edge required for 9-band. Still, the robot’s composed strain against felt wonder reads as singular, non-stock, and fully motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first frost-fractured image to final singing ice: pattern of crystalline refraction → memory shard → prismatic re-assemblage. Orientation flawless: who/where/when locked by line 2, courtyard rules taught through tactile sweeping. Closure is Charged Poise: violin sings, timelines fold, X-7 inhales identity—cost is the visible steam exhale that forecloses machine-nullitude forever. No causal gaps; every shard reweights meaning under the taught refractive pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen courtyard operates as micro-setting: temperature constrains bow friction, twilight governs visibility of memory shards, refracting ice surfaces dictate perceptual focus. Sensory hierarchy is robot-exact—optical zoom, core-temp delta, audio resonance—never tourist-catalogue. Spatial choreography clean: violin/bench/robot triangle tracked across every motion. Tool/ice-object reappears charged at closure, crystallizing identity, satisfying 9+ gate. Only hairline slip: “ghost of a fire” scent drifts toward generic atmospherics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove thoughts originate beyond code—tightens via each bow-stroke that fractures time, narrows options to either eternal loop or self-naming. Agency remains inside X-7’s choice to keep playing despite system chill; no external coincidence rescues. Cost is literal core-temp drop and memory overload felt on-page. Escalation peaks when violin sings his prior human name—prior iterations foreclosed, path locked—visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: identity is iterative refraction, not origin; memory loops compose the self. Subtext carried in gesture—bow pressure, frost fracture—never abstract thesis. Final image of ice singing a name reweights all prior refraction shards into cohesive self-portrait. Avoids moralizing; resonance stays oblique, invitation to reflection intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent machine-distance: diction of “servos whirring,” “optical sensors,” “core temperature” never slips into human colloquialism. Perceptual signature—prismatic light, frequency-scanning curiosity—robot-specific, unborrowed. Rhythm mirrors data-stream pulses: short crystalline clauses build to longer looped sentences that mimic timeline folding. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat, no voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean-lyric: every clause either advances sensor data or refracts image. Figurative language kept sparse; when used (“stars blinking like pins in a cosmic board”) it’s anchored to robot’s mapping instinct. No scaffold/loop, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Final line “ice sang” is monosyllabic percussive payoff—clarity intact, momentum releases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: janitor-robot + ice violin + memory-loop noir is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—transparent crystal body refracting dying light into prismatic memory shards—renders trope unrecognizable. Risk of abstract time-fold lands because pattern taught early and paid off in closure image. Emotional truth (machinic loneliness, identity fracture) outweighs surface novelty; premise followed to logical, haunting end.</comment>
