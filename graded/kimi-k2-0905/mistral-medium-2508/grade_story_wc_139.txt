<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—math of cons vs hunger for fairness—are dramatized in every beat; the moment she hesitates with the nib, then chooses to “write the minister’s name,” embodies the pivot. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the blank ledger) carries visible cost: the ink still warm on her skin, sirens closing. Only the girl’s pressure feels slightly abstract, muting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ledger → names → ink → shatter → flight. Orientation lands by line 5; no debt. The closure is a clean Charged Poise: “the numbers…added up to them” reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost. One minor causality quibble—the pot’s exact trigger rules are late—keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The embalming table, moving ink, and locked coffins constrain every choice; the pot’s serpent motif recharges the final “no end” image. Sensory triage (cold porcelain, ozone stink, black footprints) is filtered through Lira’s con-artist eye for leverage. Spatial choreography is flawless: door creak, scalder spill, girl’s wet prints track. Micro-setting doubles as moral crucible, meeting the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single tightening: seven names swallowed → pot shatters → options explode. Stakes (twelve lives) stay visceral; each absorbed name raises visible cost. Agency sits squarely on Lira; coincidence never rescues. The escalation is lean but sufficient; a second mid-turn would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of accounting: fair trade = uncountable chaos. No overt thesis statements; the final image of endless serpent/ink reconfigures morality without moralizing. Subtext simmers in silences: girl’s “You count what’s missing” is both accusation and invitation. Complexity lingers—reader left weighing anarchy vs accountability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Lira’s con-artist perceptual signature: every object is a tool or balance sheet. Rhythm tightens under pressure—fragmented syntax as ink surges. No head-hopping; girl’s voice stays exterior, maintaining distance. “Numbers didn’t add up to her” is a sharp final modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density: “porcelain surface streaked with the ghosts of names” does three jobs in one clause. One metaphor stack at shatter beat is purposeful, pattern-taught, so spared penalty. No loops, no scaffold. Tense stable, pronouns clean. Final line ear-test perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: embalming-room noir meets magical ledger-ink that literalizes moral liquidity. The asylum-slots con grafted onto alchemical chaos feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—letting the magic system break rather than explain—pays off by repricing the theme. Could nudge 9+ with even sharper occupational detail.</comment>
