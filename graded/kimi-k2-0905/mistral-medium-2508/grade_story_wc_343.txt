<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s “diligently curious” label is shown, not told: she trespasses, sketches the glowing cracks, and convinces the captain. Interiority stays concrete (“the words hummed in her ribs”). One contradiction—rule-fear vs. sky-lust—drives every choice. The micro-choice to trace the hopscotch sequence directly unlocks escape, so agency and flaw are locked together with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the hopscotch grid’s light snaps into alignment and engines roar, making the before/after legible. The cost is the crew’s weeks of drift and Liora’s trespass risk. Causal linkage holds: each starling loop → phrasebook clue → grid sketch → physical jump → engine restart. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Brass portholes, warped charts, and the dusty hopscotch board are tactile, not tourist gloss. The ship’s creak and starling shadows braid external threat into Liora’s body: she steadies against the wall, breath fogs glass. The hopscotch grid literally routes the ship, so micro-setting constrains the final choice. Sensory economy is tight—no checklist, just three senses, all filtered through map-apprentice bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“break the loop or drift forever”—is signaled early and tightened when the hopscotch glow answers Liora’s charcoal. One reversal: Captain Veyra moves from scold to “show me how to jump,” forcing Liora to stake her authority on the pattern. Cost is the crew’s dwindling fuel and the personal risk of trespass. No coin-flip luck; the solution emerges from Liora’s iterated observation and Veyra’s conditional trust.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Theme—“seeing pattern where others see chaos”—grows solely through action: starling murmurations, phrasebook dog-ear, hopscotch grid. No character spells it out. The ending image of starlings reforming from cage to guide reweights earlier menace into promise. Subtext stays implicit; the reader finishes the equation. Final line “Here, the sky remembers” is concrete, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Free-indirect style stays inside Liora’s map-obsessed perception: “patterns where others saw chaos,” “horizon unfolded like ink on parchment.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments when engines lurch. Captain Veyra’s diction is saltier (“you’re supposed to be plotting our descent”) contrasting Liora’s quieter awe. No filter-verb stacks; perception is embodied. Voice is consistent, never drifts into committee exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with beats: long sentence for drifting, staccato when engines cough. Figurative language is sparse; when used—“starlight trapped in cracks”—it is precise and paid off. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Final line “Here, the sky remembers” is clean, propulsive, and echoes earlier parchment image without strain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The “hopscotch-as-navigation-key” is a fresh synthesis of sky-island tropes; without it the plot collapses, satisfying the transformation test. Starlings shift from omen to compass, re-inflecting a familiar image. Antique airship plus linguistic archaeology feels organic, not checklist. Risk is moderate but successful: the lyric loop lands because pattern is taught early and closure repays it.</comment>
