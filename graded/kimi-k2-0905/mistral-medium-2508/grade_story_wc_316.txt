<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s split-mind numbness is shown through gesture—shallow breath, finger on glass—rather than label. The jars act as externalized interiority, giving us two silent “selves” whose pulse he reads like a polygraph. Veyra’s single line of dialogue forces status shift and crystallizes stakes. Only lapse: the merge pain is summarized in one clause, muting the embodied cost that could have cemented the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the jars exist and custody looms, therefore he bleeds to merge. Each beat tightens options—arrival of second jar, threat of judicial dissolution, act of blood—until the Schism knits and history halts. Closure lands on-page: “the valley’s echoes didn’t change” is the audible cost, proving the merge rewrote reality. Minor warp: timeline of “three days” is announced then ignored; no tactical use of the ticking clock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is not scenery but leverage: its altitude above the valley literalizes “above history,” and its creak under the merge gives haptic feedback that the world is rewriting. Moss-slick edges and tatami wet-prints are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered. The storm is kept external, never allowed to become melodramatic mirror. Micro-setting triumph: the dagger forged from Schism metal is both tool and origin story, constraining the only possible method of repair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wholeness versus erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates by judicial countdown and jar-pulse. One meaningful tightening: the second jar’s arrival makes dissolution concrete, forcing the blood ritual. Cost is visible—the empty glass, the burning banners below—but the merge pain itself is blink-fast; a longer beat of agony could have pushed higher. Still, agency is absolute: Kael’s palm opens the only path that forecloses non-existence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of authenticity versus manufactured history emerges through the physics of the setting: when minds fuse, external propaganda literally stops rewriting. No character ever names “truth”; instead the valley’s unchanged echo is the non-literal answer. Subtext carries in silence—Veyra’s smirk, empty jars—avoiding sermon. Only tick down for the final spoken line “truth sliced through pretense,” which edges toward thesis-statement but is saved by its immediacy after the image of burning banners.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at knife-edge distance: close enough to feel pulse in amber, wide enough to register banners burning below. Diction—“vivify the severed,” “conceptual repricing”—stays within monk lexicon without sliding into RPG jargon. Rhythm tightens under stress: spondaic clusters (“blood welled, dark and slow”) mimic heartbeat. No dialogue bloat; Veyra’s three clipped speeches contrast Kael’s compressed interior, keeping voice distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is deliberate—long atmospheric openers collapse into fragment beats (“Pain lanced—*his* skull…”) to mimic syncope. Metaphors are few but precise: Schism wound “like tearing silk” is tactile, not ornamental. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct (“He pressed his palm to the glass”). One paraphrase loop: “since the war ended… since the monks… since the two halves…” accumulates without new pressure, a minor drag that keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The brain-jar custody hearing is a gleefully fresh splice of legal SF and monk mysticism; the merge through complementary opposites weaponizes an abstract philosophy into plot device. Transformation test fails for any generic clone story—only this altitude dojo, Schism metal dagger, and memory-wiping historiographers could produce this exact closure. Risk is taken and paid off: the protagonist literally deletes his own exhibit to render the case moot, a stunt that feels inevitable only after it happens.</comment>
