<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s trembling hand, meteorite pressed to palm, embodies the contradiction between fleeing music and needing its echo; the pigeon’s return crystallizes his Earned Stasis—he hums rusty notes, the attic now “smells like the sea,” a sensory reprice that costs him the safety of silence. Interiority stays aria-specific (sheet-music wings, ink like dried roses) and never drifts into therapy-speak. The only cap: off-page Luca never applies direct pressure, so relationship-as-crucible bullet remains inactive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pigeon returns with fresh sheet music, dust swirls to the resurrected song, and Elias’s refusal to stay silent lands with visible cost—his voice is rusty, the ledger margins blank. Accumulative lens holds: dust-mote constellations, meteorite star, and paper trails all tighten into one final chord that reweights the attic from mausoleum to rehearsal room. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3; no penalty. One micro-turn—lying to Madame Holloway—sets up the Earned Stasis without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The attic as instrument—skylight conductor, dust-mote score, pipe-smoke resonance—literally constrains flight tactics; misread the motes and birds scatter. Micro-objects (meteorite, ledger margins, harness) function as movable set pieces whose altered states shift choices. Sensory economy favors sound and smell over visual clutter, mirroring Elias’s composer bias. Weather evolves from smoke-ghost to sea-breeze, tracking his internal re-oxygenation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias risk trusting sound again?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when he whispers “Find him” to the pigeon, trading silence for possible rejection. Escalation is accumulative: each reprise of dust, meteorite, and paper thickens the emotional cost until the returned sheet music forces the audible test. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is the attic’s acoustic promise versus the fire-scarred reflex to flinch. Price is audible—rusty voice, smudged cuffs—and alters tactics: he pens new notes in the ledger margin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring “paper trail” motif: ledgers, sheet music, almanac, pigeon-route maps—all fragile media that outlast flames if someone dares rewrite them. Subtext sits in silence: the unsung aria between Elias and Luca is felt in the blank ledger margin and the meteorite’s sharp edge, never stated. The final image refuses moral symmetry—trust is not victory but a cracked hum—delivering resonant ambiguity without sermon. Sentimentality is dodged by keeping Luca off-page; the emotional aftereffect is the attic’s sea-smell, not a hug.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: composer brain converts every sense into musical notation—coos are “notes from a broken record,” dust motes are “sheet music,” perfume is “bergamot and mothballs” scored for attar and decay. Syntax lengthens and syncopates during lyric memory, then tightens into single-line commands (“Find him. Bring him back.”) under pressure. No head-hopping; Madame Holloway’s status shift is read entirely through Elias’s auditory filter—her cane “taps up the stairs” like a metronome. Register never exceeds Elias’s 1923-almanac lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry multi-duty density: “He balanced the meteorite on his fingertip, watching the particles shift as if directed by an unseen conductor” fuses object handling, wind prediction, and metaphor in one clause. No paraphrase loops; each dust or music image returns with altered stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent—meteorite as star, ledger as score—avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. Final line “Some paper trails were meant to be rewritten” reframes prior motifs without preachiness, earning its abstract noun through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fused premise—post-fire composer rewrites his life via pigeon cryptography and dust divination—feels fresh yet inevitable. The Mars meteorite chip repurposes a familiar MacGuffin into a phonograph needle that can draw blood and music alike. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could slump into vignette, but the dust-mote conductor pattern taught early holds closure tight. Specificity of 1923 almanac and Marseille dock letter resists generic anywhere-setting.</comment>
