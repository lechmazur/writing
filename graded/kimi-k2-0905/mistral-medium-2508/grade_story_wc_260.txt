<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictions—healer/con-man, trembling hands/steady care—are dramatized in every beat; the tail-repair micro-choices externalize the self-repair arc with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“tremor in his chest” vs. “steady fingers”). The final “balance” image is earned because the tail regrowth and the tincture gift are already on-page; no safety-hedging. Slight over-articulation of the “layers” metaphor keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the translucent tail-tip reweights the whole moral ledger under the Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—because he withholds the real medicine, the con collapses; therefore each restorative act sheds a layer. Orientation is nailed in the first 30 words. The single lens holds; cost is visible in the apothecary’s silence and the locket he never retrieves. Reaches 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, terrarium glass, cicada membrane, and starlight are not backdrop—they restrict movement and supply repair materials. The workshop’s “groaning beams” echo Elias’s own load, mirroring without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless: fingers, tail, salve, silk wrap tracked beat by beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys a night-time healer’s priorities: scent of herbs before color. Micro-setting (the tail itself) charges the final image, satisfying 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can he shed the con and still heal?”—tightens through each layer: tail gift → medicine gift → labor offer. Each act forecloses an easier path (money, anonymity, denial). Cost is legible: the apothecary’s silence is a social burn; the locket’s absence is a concrete loss. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload. Just shy of 8.8 because the off-page child fever could have been re-tightened on-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the chameleon’s literal regeneration as mirror: regrowth is possible but never identical—tail and conscience remain scar-translucent. No moral is stated; the final “balance” is an image, not a verdict. Subtext lives in gesture: the cicada-shell silk clings “like a second skin,” merging restitution and self-identity. The refusal to promise forgiveness keeps ambiguity alive and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s perceptual filter: marigold scent, tremor in chest, starlight through fogged glass. Diction—“jagged absence like a half-told lie”—is character-specific, not writerly flourish. No dialogue, so voice texture is carried by rhythmic, breath-controlled syntax that mirrors salve application. Filter verbs appear only when they serve tactile immediacy (“felt the tremor”). No head-hop; psychic distance tightens across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with the salve strokes; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are few but precise—“pearl of new growth glistens, translucent as dawn on spider silk”—and avoid purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances healing or self-reckoning. One register slip—“conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not Elias’s—costs a hairline −0.1. Otherwise clean, propulsive, read-aloud ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combines con-man redemption with biological regeneration; tail-as-conscience is fresh yet inevitable. The circus backstory could feel tropeish, but the child-medicine rupture and apothecary gift subvert expected revenge beats. Specific detail—cicada membrane, locket pawn, indigo cloth—anchors the premise in lived world rather than fable. Risk is moderate; freshness resides in repair-as-atonement mechanics. Not quite 8.5 because Mara’s villain arc remains off-page.</comment>
