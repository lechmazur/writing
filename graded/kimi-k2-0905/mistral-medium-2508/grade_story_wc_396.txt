<comment>Elias’s quietly proactive stance (“step onto the ice with her”) gives him agency and a visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Interiority stays concrete—gloved fingers on frost, fragment pulsing—without label-speak. Calm-intuition trait is shown through mirrored visions and micro-choice to angle mirrors, not declared. One flaw: we get no contradictory impulse mid-scene; the decision path is almost linear, keeping him just shy of exemplary.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias steps forward, mirrors shatter, reconfiguring the night from solitary to shared risk; cost is the foreclosed safety of observer status. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—visions and fragment density build to the final crystallising image; linkage holds. Orientation is clean by word 60. No meaningful escalation beat after the mirror-adjustment; tension mainly thickens atmosphere rather than narrowing tactical options, capping score just below 9.</comment>

<comment> lighthouse orchard + ice floes + warped mirrors form a micro-setting that literally directs the climax (“angling them toward the cliff’s edge”). Salt-cracked earth, clicking branches, and frost-rimmed door create multi-sense specificity integrated into action. Spatial choreography stays coherent as Elias descends, exits, positions mirrors. Environment does not constrain a later tactical choice (the ice will break regardless), so misses the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the girl’s solitary sacrifice—emerges via visions early; tightening comes when Elias angles mirrors to “rewrite the ending.” Cost is the surrendered safety of passive peacekeeper role. Escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no new obstacle or reversal after mirror adjustment, holding score in strong but not exceptional band.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathetic intervention emerges through image pattern (offering hands vs mirrors that “catch light like trapped screams”) rather than statement. Final image answers the thematic question: solidarity replaces isolation. Subtext stays in gesture and object; no closing moral. Some abstraction in “reconstitute the moment itself” skirts sentimentality but still edges toward thesis, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elias’s perceptions; diction stays within his contemplative register (“the weighted breath before reply”). Rhythm modulates—short sentences under peak tension, longer reflective ones elsewhere. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged via interior texture, which is consistent. Mirrors’ “whisper” is the only minor POV stretch but reads as personification, not head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences frequently double-load (advance atmosphere + stakes). Metaphors are coherent—“lighthouse stood sentinel,” “roots tangled like old men”—without mixed logic. One scaffold: “the beam above swept…counting down” appears twice in similar form; minor loop. No artifacts near closure; final mirror-shatter image is clean and earns its density.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combining orchard, lighthouse, and shifting ice is fresh; using antique warped mirrors as scrying tools instead of generic crystal ball reconfigures a familiar trope. The peacekeeper who dulls conflicts by presence is inverted into someone who must join the danger—specific, non-obvious turn. Some DNA of Arctic Gothic, but the synthesis feels singular. Risk doesn’t distort clarity, so earns upper-band credit.</comment>
