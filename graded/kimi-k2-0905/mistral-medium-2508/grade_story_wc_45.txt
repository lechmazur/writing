<comment>Liora’s “forgiving skeptic” trait is dramatized through her calm handling of the tooth and her refusal to recoil from the changeling; the micro-choice to press the tooth to her palm and then offer it back shows interior contradiction in scene. The emotional arc—from curiosity about the substituted body to the bargain that restores her brother—tracks credibly under pressure. The brother remains slightly translucent (we get no interiority from him), but Liora’s own hierarchy of values is legible and the final “setting the world” renunciation carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment stays concrete (“hands steady,” “needle hums”).</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s sigh, the dissolving tooth, and the brother’s smooth palms reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—because Liora offers the tooth, the garden listens; because the garden listens, the map of constellations appears; because she names the bargain, the brother returns unmarked. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (hedge gap, golden light), well within the 120-word waiver. No lens ambiguity; the story’s logic is “causal-fantastic” and holds to the final image. Persistent constraint: the needle’s faint hum in her pocket keeps the price tactile.</comment>

<comment>The garden is not backdrop—it actively withholds or grants access, forces the bargain, and supplies the black-silver water that becomes the star-map. Micro-setting (the tooth, the needle) constrains choice: she can’t enter the bargain without the tooth, and the needle’s charred history links the river corpse to the garden. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Liora notices medicinal scents (mint, iron) consistent with her bone-setter eye. Spatial choreography is clean—she slips through, crosses to the well, steps back through; brother waits “by the river,” anchoring the returned geography. No static museum tour; every detail is touched or inhaled.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“make it right” after the world allowed a fake brother—signaled by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the changeling’s forehead press collapses Liora’s options into either bargain or permanent loss. Cost is visible: the tooth dissolves, the changeling sheds its skin, the needle keeps humming—payment is ongoing. Escalation is causal, not additive: each beat narrows exit ramps until only the star-map offer remains. No coincidence resolves; the garden’s response is conditional on her framed offer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via the star-map image: wounds transformed into navigation points—an answer that is shown, not told. Subtext operates in gesture (the changeling’s lunge is plea, not attack) and in the final silence about who/what now wears the brother’s shape. No moral sermon; the story accepts ambiguity—some doors stay cracked. The needle’s hum and the smooth palms invite the reader to feel the uncanny rather than decode a thesis. The thematic question (“how to live with substitutions?”) is repriced, not answered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; syntax flexes under pressure—“the garden sighed around her” compresses personification without overwriting. Diction stays within Liora’s plausible lexicon (medical, rural, skeptical). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Perceptual signature is specific: she evaluates joints, notices blood color, smells iron. Rhythm accelerates at the forehead-press memory dump, then exhales into short declaratives for the return—cadence mirrors emotional arc. Dialogue is minimal but subtext-laden: “You’re late” carries entire rewritten history.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“the garden had taken the wound and spun it into a door” advances plot and reweights metaphor). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are coherent (tooth → lock → star-map) and internally consistent. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Opening and closing lines are sharp—first line poses riddle, last line re-casts her occupation as cosmology. Minor near-repeat of “something older” and “something darker” is the only scaffold trace, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: changeling folklore retooled as orthopedic cosmology. The “bone-setter who sets the world” twist feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Specificity—river-reed corpse, charred needle, mint-and-iron air—grounds the fantastical in tactile detail. Risk taken with quiet, non-violent bargain rather than heroic conquest; risk pays off via Charged Poise. No close echoes of famous scenes; the star-map exit is new. Conceptual integrity: follows the garden’s logic without late rule patches.</comment>
