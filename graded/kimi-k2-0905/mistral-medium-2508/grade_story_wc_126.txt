<comment>Liora’s interiority stays concrete: her father’s unfinished melody haunts her fingertips, the bowl’s ping tests aliveness. The arrival of the girl forces a micro-choice—she trades solitary grief for collaborative creation—paid for by the dawn-choice that will cost her either exile or guardianship. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, but the sustained tension between memory and forward motion is credible and particular. The cap is the slight under-show of her body under violin-fatigue; still, the final note of tomorrow earns its poise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each droplet, ember, and broken string thickens the silence until the girl’s stick-scratch becomes the pattern-break that reweights beauty. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sunken orchard greenhouse”), transitions are seamless, closure is a Charged Poise—“the chronic hush learned to sing”—with undeniable conceptual cost: Liora forecloses the option of staying alone. No telegraphing or soft resets; every beat adds density. Cost is legible in the final line’s future-tense sacrifice.</comment>

<comment>The cracked dome, salt-stiff wrecks, and condensate dripping into the bowl are not backdrop; they constrain where Liora can sit, how she harvests water, and supply the acoustic shell that keeps sound alive. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: she hears humidity, smells old fire, feels callous against bow. Spatial choreography is immaculate—girl enters at fire-edge, sleeps curled, dome groans overhead. Final image recharges the greenhouse as resonator; environment shapes the note that reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can music survive unfinishedness without becoming silence? Pressure escalates through accumulating droplets, embers, and the girl’s demand for continuance; each adds density until the stick-scratch forces Liora to trade isolation for shared creation. No antagonist beyond time and hush, but that is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is the foreclosed solitude—visible in her lifted bow toward dawn. One meaningful tightening: the moment she answers the girl’s dirt-line with a curving note.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulates: unfinished melody, cracked glass, droplets, unclosed circle. No thesis stated; final image of hush learning to sing reweights the premise that beauty needs endings. Subtext lives in the bowl’s ping—aliveness tested, not begged. The girl’s charred stick is both torch and pen, rewriting ash into score. Resonant ambiguity: tomorrow may be exile or chorus, but the reconfiguration is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s sensorium: “humidity clinging to her skin,” “strings humming faintly.” Syntax lengthens during violin phrases, fractures during rustle-alert. No dialogue until the sparse exchange—“You’re real.” / “So are you.”—which carries subtext of mutual rescue. No head-hops; perceptual signature is violinstic—she hears silence as taut wire. Register never drifts; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences that mirror bow strokes and clipped fragments at rustle-alert. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds either sensory density or causal cue. Figurative control precise: “ribs of forgotten beasts” is fresh, not mixed. Final line—“the chronic hush, at last, learned to sing”—is a clean, resonant closure cadence. Minor −0.1 for one adjective stack (“damp air”) that could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic violinist in shipwreck greenhouse is fresh, but the unfinished-music trope is familiar; the girl-as-echo device rescues it through embodied enactment rather than metaphor. Risk: lyric accumulation could slump into lit-song, yet the stick-score keeps it tactile. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—ash, glass, gut string, and dirt line become a new notation. Not quite a 9 because the core chord is recognizable; the voicing, however, is singular.</comment>
