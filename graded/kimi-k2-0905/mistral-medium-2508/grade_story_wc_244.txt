<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete—her “grin of desperate jocularity” shows contradiction under pressure—but the promised “elusive logistician” never once deploys a believable professional tactic; the rock is passed along by rumor, not logistics. The final renunciation lands with felt cost, yet her competence feels writer-ordained rather than job-trained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each micro-exchange layers the reciprocity ledger until the rock’s final re-gift triggers a resonant reconfiguration. The causality is soft—Carter’s “cure = list of names” arrives as a bardic reveal—but the pattern is taught early and the closing image reweights loneliness as communal motion, paying conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station’s ivy-choked platforms and kudzu-veiled freight car act as micro-setting that literally narrows Lena’s path to Carter; glass shards underfoot and the hand-painted “NEXT STOP: POSSIBLY” sign return as tactile, choice-guiding objects. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment is lived-in, not postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—find the loneliness cure—tightens when the rock becomes social currency; each trade forecloses anonymity. No visible price (injury, cash, betrayal) is exacted from Lena, so cost stays conceptual, but the ledger metaphor keeps pressure coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transit as mutual recognition. The moon rock’s migrating meaning reconfigures value from geologic rarity to social glue, a Conceptual Repricing that avoids moralizing. Subtext in gesture—leaving the rock on the desk—carries more weight than any stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lean, lyric, perceptually specific—“boots crunch on glass that had once been a ticket booth window” compresses history and触感 in one stride. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, staccato for trades. No head-hopping; diction stays within Lena’s plausible range even at metaphoric height.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density—single sentences fix radio, diagnose rheumatism, swap bread for story—without scaffold. One paraphrase-loop inside the freight car (“camphor and old paper… camphor and old paper” echo) docks −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo and closure line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The loneliness-cure-as-ledger is fresh; the moon rock turned social promissory note reweights scarcity into solidarity without workshop echo. Risk in concept is high but coherence holds, and the final image of collective score-keeping feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
