<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s reluctant caretaker persona is vividly embodied in her ritual precision (nut-carving, frost-timing) and the single, costly exception she makes for the freezing girl; her interior contradiction—yearning to guide yet fearing cost—drives every beat. The “offhandedly exact” trait is not label-only but enacted in the micro-choice of pressing nuts “just hard enough,” revealing a hierarchy of values under threat. No second on-page character means status/relationship bullets don’t apply, but the earned stasis—she keeps the last nut, accepts perpetual burden—lands with visible cost. Hairline slip: “graceless beauty” is asserted once rather than shown through gesture, keeping her from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final nut pressed into dirt reconfigures the labyrinth from trap to potential door, with the cost felt in her return to cursed solitude. Causal lattice holds: blueprint discovery → years of nut trials → exception for girl → last nut withheld → future promise. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor within first 100 words. One persistent constraint—mechanical birds locked by frost—shapes the tactical timing of every move. Lens (Causal) holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth, frost-clock, and brass birds constrain every tactical choice; the orchard’s violet fruit is a tactile hazard that charges the final image. Micro-setting of the nut—carved, warmed, pressed—functions as tool and talisman, its evolving state tracked across beats. Spatial choreography is flawless: birds patrol routes, distances metered by frost line, descent crevice mapped. One hairline slip: “stone throat” leans metaphoric rather than sensory, barely keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Liora’s refusal to let another traveler vanish—tightens when she breaks her own rule for the half-dead girl, foreclosing the option of eternal detachment. Escalation is causal: each nut left is a gamble that could expose her; withholding the last nut caps the risk. Cost is visible: she accepts continued exile among memory-stealing trees. No secondary reversal, but one meaningful tightening suffices at this length; the price is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: caretaking as quiet rebellion against a system designed to isolate. Subtext lives in gesture—nuts pressed “just hard enough” encode mercy without announcement. Final image reweights the premise: the labyrinth can remember how to lead, not merely trap. No moralizing; the cursed fruit remains uneaten, underscoring endurance over conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers at a lyric distance that matches Liora’s solitary vigilance; perceptual signature is selective—she clocks joint stiffness in brass birds, frost timing to the minute. Syntax stays lean, then frays slightly in the final paragraph to mimic fatigue. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register remains within her lived lexicon; “stone throat” is the lone poetic reach, forgiven by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“silver fingers creeping” echoes frost without mixed metaphors. High information density: one sentence can convey time, temperature, and emotional shift. Rhythm breathes with the frost-clock, accelerating toward the final pressed nut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—cursed orchard, mechanical sentinels—are reanimated through Liora’s exacting nut-craft and the inversion of the labyrinth from trap to guide. Blueprint-as-repair-manual feels fresh, not MacGuffin, because it shapes her years of micro-experiments. Risk taken: quiet lyric ending rather than set-piece escape, paid off by Charged Poise. Specificity of violet memory-fruit and brass frost-locked birds is irreproducible.</comment>
