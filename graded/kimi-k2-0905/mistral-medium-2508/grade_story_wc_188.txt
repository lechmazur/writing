<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is concrete—her chant, her finger on the rag knot, her decision to climb. Contradictory drives (loneliness vs defiance) stay active in-scene. The final “heavier” self-recognition is earned, but the leap from spectacle to personal cost is compressed into one sentence; more body-level fallout would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: rag knot → flame → rocket → star-return, each because/therefore. The mosaic note “Defy the weight” seeds the closure, paid off when Liora feels heavier yet walks on. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Cost is conceptual—sky restored but personal weight gained—visible in final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glowing blossom vines, kerosene scent, and tower spatial logic all constrain action: she climbs what once was a fortress of war now made flammable by nature. The rag knot reappears as charged micro-setting. Final starlight re-illuminates the mosaic, reweighting the visual rule-set. Selective, never catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore stars—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation: starless hush → rocket burst → ground tremor → sky reignition; each step narrows failure options. Cost is transferred from village to Liora’s body (“heavier”). Agency drives every turn; no coincidences resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through images—fire as memory, light as counter-gravity—never thesis. Final “world was heavier… so was she” reprices the concept of defiance: victory carries weight. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who bore the true cost. Resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited stays close to Liora’s perceptions: “petals like embers caught in slow motion.” Chant rhythm threads through syntax, modulating under pressure. No head-hops; diction remains within artisan traveler’s lexicon. Filter verbs serve voice (“she smelled,” “she saw”) without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence lengths vary to mirror rocket arc. Figurative language is disciplined—one striking image per beat, no metaphor pile-ups. “World was heavier than it had been yesterday. But so was she” lands with punch. No scaffolding loops; every line advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “curse lifted by art” frame is retooled through fireworks craft specifics and sensory inversion—flowers as fuel, stars as debt. Conceptual twist: restoring hope literally increases personal gravity. Risky night-launch scene pays off in new starlight without gimmickry. Specificity makes trope fresh.</comment>
