<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is rich and embodied—his cold fingers, the tremor in his pulse—contradictory impulses (curiosity vs dread) act simultaneously. The final act of sketching his own fear-pattern and burying the wax beneath the oldest tree crystallizes a renunciation with visible cost, earning Charged Poise. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choice hierarchy (record fear, seal, bury) is legible and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wax prophecy reweights Elias’s archival oath into personal hinge-duty; cost is felt in the shaken hands and the burying that forecloses denial. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → prophecy → self-recording tightens stakes through density, not causal turn. Orientation anchored by ~120 w via rooftop garden, phonograph, crate label. No lens ambiguity; final image of roots deciding keeps tension legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is not backdrop: grafted pear trees constrain Elias’s ritual (rainwater basin beneath branches, burial site at oldest root). Micro-setting objects—wax shaving, rainwater tinted with orchid—are tactile and re-used; the shaving becomes translucent, veined like blood, charging the final burying. Skyscraper abyss below mirrors the conceptual drop into prophecy. Sensory economy favors salt-thick air, gnarled bark, petals skittering—each filters through Elias’s monkish attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve emotional patterns vs. absorb lethal prophecy—tightens when Akkadian voice names him “hinge,” foreclosing passive archiving. Escalation is textural: each immersion darkens water, increases semantic weight, until the shaving adheres to his temple and cannot be filed away. Cost is felt pulse, cold fingers, and the burial that transfers responsibility to roots. No coincidence; pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from recurrent listening motifs—phonograph, foghorn, oath to hear—culminating in the inversion: he must record himself. No explicit moral; final image of roots deciding reweights premise that archives are neutral. Subtext operates in silence of foghorn, smudged ink of child’s label, and the unspoken vow that “the garden will remember.” Ambiguity lingers: will roots keep or discard the prophecy, letting reader carry cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person hovers at Elias’s shoulder, lexicon of monastic craft—“crushed orchid petals,” “Akkadian syllables”—perceptual signature of an antiquarian who tastes dead languages. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for ritual, fragments under prophecy (“He exhaled. Hinges held doors…”). No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Filter verbs serve voice (“he remembered,” “he knew”) rather than dull immediacy. Compression in final paragraph mirrors wax sealing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies: spondaic stresses (“salt-thick air,” “root breaking stone”) accelerate tension; longer sentences breathe during ritual. Metaphors stay coherent—wax “veined with something like blood” sustains organic through-line. No synonym loops; “garden,” “roots,” “wax” return with reweighted meaning. Scaffolding minimal; only “He exhaled” could be cut, yet serves beat pause before ledger sketch. Density high: one sentence often does three jobs (image, world-rule, interior).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fusion of rooftop orchard + wax phonograph shaving + accidental Akkadian prophecy feels inevitable in hindsight, not collage. Fresh angle: archivist compelled to archive his own fear, turning preservation inside-out. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with Charged Poise. Specificity of St Marrow’s 1987 field trip and grafted monastery pears anchors concept in irreplaceable detail. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—oath scribe needs monastery DNA and city foghorn.</comment>
