<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—clairvoyant hunger vs. self-protection—pulse in every tactile choice (threading the reel, palming the crystal). The final renunciation lands because each micro-choice has stored him inside her ribs; the cost is the silence she now agrees to carry. Voice never slips into diagnostic speak; instead, “lyrics humming under her skin” bodies the feeling. Cap at 8.7 only because the off-page lover remains a cipher; his absence is intentional but limits relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each reel touched adds density until the projector beam becomes the decisive reconfiguration—silence as Charged Poise with undeniable cost. Orientation anchor (“projection booth…rusted reels”) arrives by word 20; no debt. Closure is the exact moment the bulb dies and the dark speaks; no causal leap, only pattern culmination. Meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (the booth’s hungry dark) shapes every tactic and charges the final image.</comment>

<comment>The mislabeled canister, frayed celluloid, and dying bulb function as micro-setting that literally constrains choice—only this reel, only this threading sequence, unlocks the silence. Ozone smell and vibrating floorboard track bodily attention; spatial choreography never drifts. Final image of dark booth reconfigured by spent light satisfies 9+ gate. Weather (storm) mirrors without overt symbol, staying causal—rain lashes when the beam extinguishes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens from abstract search to embodied silence as the projector eats the words. One meaningful deepening: the letters are discovered not as ink but as absences between frames, forcing a renunciation rather than retrieval. Cost is legible: she forfeits the audible goodbye and accepts interior storage. Agency is attentional; still, the tightening forecloses the option to hear him again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular physics of film: light can’t fade what the bulb never reaches. The final silence reweights earlier motifs—hungry light, frayed edges—without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: her steady fingers on the final threading show acceptance greater than grief. No abstract thesis; the conceptual repricing is that unspoken love is not lost, only archived in darkness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, pattern-taught compression (“reels…ghostly flicker…lyrics slipped away like your name”) maintains perceptual signature throughout. Syntax mirrors sprocket rhythm: fragments when film stutters, longer coils when memory unwinds. No head-hopping; unreliability accrues through selective sensory narrowing. Register stays within Elara’s lexicon; “psychometry” is never explained, only enacted. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates with beam intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “celluloid warming as if alive” does setting, character, and metaphor in one clause. No synonym loops; “reel,” “strip,” “film” appear only when physical state shifts. Metaphors stay coherent—light as hunger, silence as spool end. One hairline slip: “incubate the truth” edges toward therapeutic diction but is saved by immediate bodily context (breath fogging glass). Final line breathes; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—unused love archived in unreadable film—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test: swap projection for any other archive and the emotional physics collapse. Specific detail (mislabeled canister, ozone smell) prevents generic “memory” tropes. Risk in quiet ending pays off: silence is not absence but mastered medium. Minor proximity to “ghost in the machine” trope is subverted by making the machine itself the ghost.</comment>
