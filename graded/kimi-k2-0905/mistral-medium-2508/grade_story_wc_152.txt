<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet, fiber-deep resistance is embodied in every stitch; the contradiction between his public “fool” persona and the private astronomer’s precision is lived, not labeled. The final smile while the dome shatters is a credible renunciation that costs him everything, yet the interiority never slips into self-congratulatory wisdom. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; his solitude is the point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: because Elias has spent years hiding star-truths in flawed embroidery, therefore he can weaponize that archive when the courier’s warning arrives. The telescope-flame sync is a single decisive act that reweights the entire city’s narrative; the cost is the exploding dome and Elias’s death, legible in the final cascade of “seeds.” Orientation anchored by line 3; no late ambiguity. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sky itself becomes a broadcast medium, options reconfigured irreversibly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt dome, autumn twilight, and needle-glint are not backdrop but tools: the dome’s color determines how starlight refracts, the season’s slant light dictates when the flame shadow grows long enough to hide messages. Micro-setting mastery: the loom’s wooden gears, the ink smell on courier’s hands, the mortar breathing stitched starlight—each tactile detail constrains the next move. Final image of flame burning “in the cracks between worlds” recharges every prior thread; environment is the protagonist’s co-conspirator.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—can the sky’s truth survive the coup—tightens when the courier’s warning converts abstract censorship into dawn raid. Escalation is one swift compression: sync telescope → flame → broadcast → dome shatters; options narrow from private resistance to public martyrdom. Cost is paid in glass and blood; the city’s lies unravel because Elias refuses the soft reset of escape. Coup remains off-stage, but its encroaching silence is felt in every tick of ancient clockwork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse ratio: the more the Council stitches a “unified narrative,” the more Elias’s deliberate errors accrue into an counter-archive. Final image of scattered embroidery-seeds offers a non-literal answer—truth survives as latent possibility, not victory. No moralizing sentence articulates this; the reweighting is visceral when citizens wake to find lies literally falling from the sky. Ambiguity is meaningful: the coup may still win, but its story is now porous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-sharp: Elias thinks in star-catalog syntax—constellations “long collapsed into silence,” light “bent into secrets”—a lexicon no other character could own. Rhythm modulates from long, breath-tuned sentences during embroidery to staccato warnings (“They’re coming”). No head-hopping; courier’s interiority is kept opaque, filtered through Elias’s needle-noticing gaze. Compression such as “stories stop everything” is earned by prior tapestry of concrete stitches, not asserted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: caesuras mirror telescope clockwork, em-dashes enact thread tugs. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—mixed metaphors (“bruise against the sky,” “fabric of the cosmos”) accumulate into a single textile-astronomy imagery system. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances loom-state or stakes. Minor scaffold: “the flame wasn’t just light; it was a voice” edges toward thesis restatement but is saved by immediate sensory payoff in the broadcast beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of embroidery and insurgent astronomy feels inevitable yet unseen before; the eternal candle as pirate radio transmitter transforms quaint observatory into insurgent broadcast tower. Risk—the dome’s explosive exit—pays off by making the sky itself the final pamphlet. Specificity anchors novelty: silver needle through star-fabric is not a metaphor but a lived tool whose teeth bite mortal cartilage. Conceptual integrity: never flinches from the cost of beauty-as-weapon, refusing safe elegy.</comment>
