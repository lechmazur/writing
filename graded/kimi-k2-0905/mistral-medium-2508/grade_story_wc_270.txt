<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Liora’s contradiction—gardener-grandma obeying plants while defying Council—drives every micro-choice; her laugh in the mud shows cost paid in social ostracism. The amber crack is earned by telepathic labor, not epiphany. Flaws (insurgent streak, plant-obedience) directly enable victory and risk, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: because she hears plants → disobeys Council → decodes kite → speaks name → amber opens → vines rebuild. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Council elder’s boot sings, forcing kneel. No teleporting props; kite symbols planted early, paid off in final flower script.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Hot-spring heat syncs pulse, constrains timing of amber opening; volcanic minerals feed newborn vine. Black sand, splintered bamboo, glowing resin create tactile triad that charges final image. Spatial choreography clean: overseers approach at dusk, grandson steps through vine-woven wall at midnight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: evolve tradition vs. preserve order. Tightening: each act—testing spring, reading kite, speaking name—raises personal risk (Reconstruction ban) and communal possibility. Visible price: Council exile threat becomes public kneeling; social credit spent. Final image narrows options: rebuilt temple is living organism, irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific horticultural insurgency: tradition as ladder, not cage. Subtext in grandson’s mortar-dusted boots shows generational relay without说教. Final flower etches kite-script, reweighting relic into living alphabet—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost: old texts are now obsolete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays inside Liora’s plant-hearing sensorium; diction—“roots breaking stone,” “iridescent green shoot”—is gardener-precise. Rhythm accelerates at amber split: short clauses mimic seed-pod sigh. No head-hopping; grandson’s admission filtered through her leaf-brushing gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances root-pressure or image. Mixed metaphors disciplined: “roots breaking stone” aligns with volcanic spring cracking amber. High density: “steam curled… testing the future” sets stakes, senses, metaphor in 12 words. Final line breathes, no drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic horticulture meets post-war reconstruction via encoded kite-DNA. Implanted destiny trope inverted—embryo is not ruler but ecosystem reset. Risk of Council heresy fully embraced; no retreat to metaphor. Specificity of volcanic minerals feeding vine makes concept inseparable from setting.</comment>
