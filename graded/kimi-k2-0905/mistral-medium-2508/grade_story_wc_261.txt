<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulse—yearning to decode scars yet finally choosing to carry rather than read them—crystallizes in an embodied, costly renunciation. The scar on her collarbone remains warm, pulsing under her palm, a tactile price that drives the final stance. Interiority is concrete, character-particular, never diagnostic: “the ridge of it warm as if the knife had only just withdrawn.” Micro-choice of writing beside “unremarkable” rewrites her mother’s story and her own in one visible stroke.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hourglass empties, the tower’s wounds stay open, Liora tunnels into question-bearing hush—cost is the ache she stops trying to decode. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frozen sand → thawing hiss → final run-out reweights the stake chronotope. Pattern taught early (frozen hourglass) pays off in last-line image. One causal tightening: archive file slides free, mother’s liver scar mirrored in Liora’s collar, forcing the pen stroke that forecloses closure-seeking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Tower, hourglass, scar, and ivy function as micro-setting that constrains every move: stone whispers, sand refuses to fall, vegetal voices tunnel through walls. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias—damp stone skin, frost-laced glass, warm ridge—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography remains coherent across kneel, press, slide, write. Final image of dust settling on empty hourglass recharges the dawn-lit tower, now allowed to stay wounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she keep decoding or consent to carry—tightens once: frozen sand thaws only after she writes meaning beside the dismissed liver scar, foreclosing the old tactic. Pressure grows via vegetal memories that crowd her skull, narrowing options until renunciation becomes the only breathable stance. Visible price: the scar keeps pulsing, the tower keeps groaning, the hourglass runs out—options are reweighted, not solved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverted miracle: wounds remember when healing forgets. No abstract statement; insight is earned through the dandelion pollen stuck to a skinned knee and the pen annotating “unremarkable” with love’s shape. Final image of open wounds and empty hourglass offers resonant non-moral: some stories are carried, not read. Complexity lingers—she neither transcends nor cures, she endures with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: coffee rings as “concentric confessions,” ivy “thin with thirst,” tower beams whispering of dragged-from earth. Syntax grows clipped under stress—“Sand hissed onto the sill, counting down to something”—then lengthens into the final hush. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly Liora-bound. Register never drifts above her lived lexicon; vegetal voices slither, never “communicate.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines do triple duty: “Displaced miracles—that’s what scars were” compresses concept, theme, and character insight. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to fragment—“Of course it didn’t.”—mirroring the halted hourglass. One mixed-metor slip: “stone skin still damp from the night’s slow weeping” drifts toward personification overload, but recovers immediately. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; final paragraph is propulsive despite quiet content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing surgical scar-telepathy with vegetal memory and chronotope-frozen hourglass yields a synthesis not seen before. The displaced miracle concept reframes healing as mnemonic failure, turning medical archive into necropolis of unremarked love. Specific detail—“golden pollen sticking like a failed miracle”—grounds freshness in tactile specificity. Risk of lyric non-linear structure pays off: pattern taught early, closure legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
