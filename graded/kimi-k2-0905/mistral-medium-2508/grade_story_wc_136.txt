<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-anchored precision and the sister-shaped hole inside it are rendered through tactile micro-choices—compass adjustment, punch tremor, final crease—so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete; only the sister’s direct dialogue slips toward exposition, slightly blunting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the platform vision rewrites the premise, the punch dissolves, and Elias steps back into questions, all with felt grief-cost. Causal lattice holds—cracks → vault → punch tear → platform—though the sister’s appearance is a lightly-motivated gift that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist, starlit lattice, and the pedestal’s arrow-cracks constrain every move; the phantom punch even serves as micro-setting that finally tears open the platform. Selective sensory triage keeps the ruin vivid without catalog bloat; spatial choreography stays clean as Elias steps, places, and withdraws.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—name the unspeakable loss to regain motion—tightens when the punch literally bites air and forces the whispered admission. One meaningful escalation under causal lens: the slit widens only after the confession, trading certainty for possibility; cost is legible in dissolved tool and reopened grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: mapping as grief-avoidance, cracks as invitations to admit not-knowing. Final image—map crease that will never align—reweights the whole quest, achieving quiet CR. Subtext in punch silence and ticket mirage keeps sentimentality at bay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction—“quivering,” “bit,” “trembling certainty”—mirrors Elias’s analytical lyricism. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent even at platform vision, reading as projection of his rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never clotted. Only minor scaffold—“the tool was cold, its mechanism silent”—adds slight redundancy. Propulsion remains high; information density strong; no mixed metaphors or loops obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phantom ticket punch that perforates reality instead of paper, and a cartographer who maps absences, synthesize into fresh mythic realism. Risky platform vision pays off by reconfiguring the rule-set rather than explaining it. Close echoes of Gaiman-esque stations are transformed through Elias’s specific grief-craft.</comment>
