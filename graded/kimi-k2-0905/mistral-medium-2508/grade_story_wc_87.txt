<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to flee vs. need to stay—are viscerally embodied (compass pressed to ribs, salt on knees). Interiority avoids therapy-speak; the “ghost with a paddle” barb stings because it’s her concrete words, not his self-label. Micro-choices (tucking compass, turning inland, ordering whiskey) steadily re-crank values toward reunion; cost is the surrender of his horizon myth. Voice collapse under pressure is minor: “navigating by utility poles now” borders aphorism but lands as earned resignation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure = Earned Stasis: he renounces departure, walks inland, felt cost = the hollow compass weight vs. older letters. Causal chain intact: daughter’s words → compass humiliation → pole-counting ritual → post-office steps → bar admission “Just late.” Orientation taught inside 120 wds (saltwind, dock, leaning pole) and serves final image (golden poles). Lens = Causal: every beat narrows option from sea to letters. One micro-turn at “Instead, he turned inland” cleanly forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coastal micro-setting (skeletal buoys, sagging wires) stays tactile and POV-filtered; the leaning utility pole recurs until it gilds the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Salt-kelp-jasmine sensory triad mirrors emotional thaw. Spatial choreography clean: launch → seven poles → bar → post office, all tracked on foot. No museum tour; each detail either blocks escape or lures homeward.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem vs. repeat abandonment—signalled in paragraph 1. Escalation: each pole walked increases social exposure cost; tightening peaks when he opens tear-stained letter in public. Agency drives every increment; luck absent. Price visible: surrender of sea-self, visible bruise of compass digging ribs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—navigation as proxy for accountability—emerges through compass/pole inversion, never stated. Subtext in bartender’s “You lost?” tightening to Elias’s “Just late” (temporal, not spatial failure). Final gold-washed poles reweight prior regret map into homing grid. Ambiguity preserved: no promise of forgiveness, only stance shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains salt-cranked perceptual signature: brass smell, rope fray, neon hum. Syntax flexes from lyrical longings to clipped bar dialogue without register drift. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (rotted hull, dying star) stay in POV lexicon. Rhythm mirrors tide-turn urgency then steadies on inland steps—intentional deceleration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: “compass grew warm as if sensing hesitation” does triple duty—embodiment, animism, time passage. No synonym loops; each metaphor advances stakes. Final paragraph varies sentence length to create cadential release. Minor scaffolding: two stock phrases (“gathering dusk”, “dying star”) but neither touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar prodigal-father arc refreshed by maritime compass vs. utility-pole inversion and the daughter’s “ghost with a paddle” epithet. Coastal regret palette is common, but pole-counting as map of scars feels idiosyncratic. Risk—quiet renunciation instead of sea-storm climax—pays off via golden final image. Could edge higher if sea/land symbolism carried sharper local detail.</comment>
