<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory drives—grief for her lost art vs. need to confront her brother’s guilt—are palpable in her micro-choice to release the ledger. Interiority stays concrete (“ash in her lungs”), but the epiphany that “truth, like glass, is clearer when broken” drifts toward aphorism. Adaptive trait is shown when frost replaces glass as her medium of pattern-seeking. The renunciation costs feel scaled to a 700-word arc: she forfeits both the ledger and the illusion of rescue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: frost, stars, and ledger build density until the release reweights meaning. Anchors clear by line 4. Closure—letting the strip fall—creates Charged Poise; the path is now internal, not cartographic. Cost: abandoning physical proof of kinship. One soft spot: the brother’s handwriting is revealed late, so the causal jolt could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Canyon, frost, and body act as micro-settings that constrain movement and mirror fracture. Early frost patterns return in the final image, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy—smell of charcoal, bite of parchment edges—filters through artist perception. Spatial choreography holds as she kneels, stands, drops, walks; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—what to do with damning knowledge—arrives with the ledger on page 1. Pressure tightens when she locates the entry “pay in silver or the girl,” forcing the choose-what-to-follow decision. The meaningful turn is the release: it forecloses revenge/justice and chooses self-authored path. Cost is legible: she sacrifices both evidence and the hope her brother can be innocent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—finding purpose in absence rather than creation—emerges via frost patterns replacing molten glass. Subtext of sibling betrayal is carried by the single ledger line, never stated as “he trafficked people.” Final image of stepping into “quiet light” reconfigures prior motifs without moralizing. The frost’s fragility and clarity become the resonant answer to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent, glass-fragile cadence; perceptual signature is artist-attuned to refraction, fracture, negative space. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Compression (“the canyon held its breath”) is taught early and paid off in final exhale. Psychic distance tightens under pressure: long clause clusters shorten to “One step. Then another.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: most sentences layer internal, sensory, and symbolic work. Figurative language stays coherent—frost as text, glass as truth—without mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase echo: “pauses” is repeated six times; but repetition is pattern-taught and pays off in closure. No register drift, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The glass-artist-turned-reader-of-fractures is a fresh inflection; trope of post-catasthesis quest is grounded in specific material craft. Risk: lyric repetitions could read as loop artifact, yet they build texture that culminates in the ledger drop. Transformation test passes—only an artist would relinquish evidence to preserve negative space. Specificity of “molten tears” and “brittle frost script” keeps it from generic revenge/redemption arc.</comment>
