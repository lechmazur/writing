<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The historian’s interiority is lyrically particular—her refusal to “bind the past with logic” shows embodied contradiction—but the absence of a second on-page character caps relationship-as-crucible, and the final renunciation, while earned, is stated rather than dramatized with visible bodily cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the pagoda dissolves into light that conceptually reprices “to purify is to let go.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image adds density until the cadence shift—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bronze pagoda functions as micro-setting: its facets fracture light and constrain her counter-clockwise turn, charging the final image. Dust, dome cracks, and saffron scent are filtered through the historian’s perceptual bias, anchoring the single-scene window without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“drink without drowning”—tightens when the pagoda’s scream forces the choice to unmake rather than decode. Agency is legible in the counter-clockwise turn that forecloses pursuit of answers; the conceptual cost is felt, but the absence of a tangible price keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of historiography: knowledge as poison flipped to knowledge as release. The saffron veil’s fade and the pagoda’s dissolution reweight the premise without moralizing; the silence between answers lingers as purposeful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet precise—“atoms of nostalgia,” “held-breath hum”—with rhythmic control that accelerates into the scream. Perceptual signature is consistent: the historian notices via tactile bronze, dying light, and scent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from elongated lyric cadences to fragmentary beats under pressure; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—“dissolving into atoms of nostalgia” returns in closure—though a few adjectival stacks (“rusted-amber twilight”) flirt with over-density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The inversion of archive-as-wound and purification-as-erasure feels fresh; the prism pagoda’s vibration-language is a specific sci-inflection not generic MacGuffin. Synthesis of lyric historiography with speculative artifact raises the stakes without gimmickry, though the broad strokes of “civilization ended by knowing” edge toward familiar cautionary territory.</comment>
