<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract—mood swamps motive. “Loose grip on reality” is asserted repeatedly yet never dramatized as a concrete trade-off that alters tactics; we are told, not shown, the cost. The final renunciation (“They set it aside and waited”) is thematically apt but causally thin: no prior beat establishes what waiting forfeits. This is character-as-mood-board, not character-under-pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a lyric Earned Stasis: the keeper refuses the external world, accepting fusion with the library. The cost—self-erasure—felt in the final “edges blurring” image. Causality, however, is loose; the obsidian gate opens because origami folds “match,” a rule never seeded or constrained, so the threshold turn feels arbitrary rather than earned. Pattern holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: silence pools rather than propels.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Library-catacomb texture is vivid, olfactory, tactile; moss, mold, river-breath anchor every beat. The obsidian monolith and paper swan function as micro-setting that governs access, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment is not backdrop but final antagonist that swallows the protagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is the keeper’s commitment to witness without judgment; pressure is existential stasis, not rising jeopardy. One meaningful deepening: the act of folding a new swan signals recommitment after each collapse, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is cadence-based—silence thickens, river rises—yet options never narrow; the keeper could leave at any point. Coincidence governs the gate, not agency, so tension plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges through recurring images of dissolution—ink in rain, paper birds drunk by stone—never abstract lecture. Final image of the keeper as “another fold in the quiet” crystallizes the argument: meaning is surrender to entropy. Subtext is strong; no reader feels preached at. Complexity acknowledged: library both buries and births knowledge; keeper both sacrifices and is rewarded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained lyric-hypnotic, syntactic rhythm mimicking slow breathing: long cadences, repeated anaphora (“Somewhere…”), diction of sibilance and soft consonants. Perceptual signature—keeper notices decay, spines, creases, never sunlight—remains consistent. No head-hop; distance is steady slight-omniscient hovering inside the keeper’s skin. Experimental compression (“time did not pass so much as pool”) is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly loop-free; a few soft repeats (“they had…they had…”) but not in peak beats. Metaphors stay coherent—river as tongue, dust as language—no mixed vehicles. Density high; most lines do two jobs (image + character state). Occasional elevated diction (“regenerative silence,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift but fits lyric mode and does not obscure causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic memory-monastery is familiar, but treatment is fresh: silence as active solvent, library as carnivore, origami as skeleton key. Risk taken in eschewing plot for trance-mode pays off because closure image is indelible. Could swap keeper with another hermit-figure without breaking arc, limiting score. Specificity of paper birds dissolving into black stone supplies the needed irreplaceable detail.</comment>
