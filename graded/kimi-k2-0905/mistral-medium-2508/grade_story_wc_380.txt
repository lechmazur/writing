<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lantern lighter’s grief-driven obsession is viscerally embodied—his pockets bulging with talismans, his hands steady even as the stone’s weight shifts. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. knowledge that “some things… were taken”) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—emptying pockets into the tide—carries visible cost and is causally earned by every prior micro-choice. Dockside status dynamics are absent, but the interior crucible is so tight that no external relationship is needed.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lit wick, coffee spiral, and petal curl adds density until the gravity pocket tears the wife’s name into a ripple. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the gravity… always hungry” reconfigures the night’s stakes without tidying grief. Cost is legible in the final image—lanterns burning on while something stirs below. One hairline slip: “the whale’s bones would be gone by morning” is forecast, not dramatized, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>The salt-crystal chamber functions as both setting and antagonist—its jagged walls narrowing movement and its ozone taste forcing shallow breaths. The brass hook, stone, and lantern are tactile extensions of the body that constrain kneeling, waiting, letting go. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a dockman notices iron rings, kelp rot, and the weight in his pocket before any sky or horizon. Final image re-uses the lanterns’ gleam to mirror the crystals’ “silent stars,” re-charging the opener.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieving excised memories—tightens when the stone’s weight lurches and the air tears open her name-shaped gravity ripple. Escalation is textural: each pattern (grounds, petals, salt) accretes until the chamber’s pocket yawns, foreclosing the possibility of full recovery. Visible price: stone dissolves, flowers ash, lantern guttered; tactics must shift to “new flowers, new grounds” for the next whale. Cost is felt, though the external risk (death) remains conceptual rather than corporeal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as excavation, not erosion—gravity as the ledger of stolen love. Subtext lives in gesture (pressing flowers into salt) and silence (the scream with no sound). Final image of “gleaming and silent” tide refuses moral, instead re-pricing the night as eternally indebted to hunger. Grief’s incompleteness is embraced; no tidy wisdom is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is salt-grained and dock-rough: “salt crystal chamber,” “air tasted like ozone and old pennies.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—“The weight *shifted*… Not his imagination—it lurched.” No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal diction staying within a working-man’s lexicon. Compression and elision (“the whale—its skeleton already half-picked clean”) are taught early and paid off in the final lantern round.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence propulsion is high: “The stone was the key”→paragraph break→immediate chamber entry. No filler, no loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal data. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“gravity pooled like ink in water”). Final paragraph cadence slows to match exhausted acceptance—three short sentences echo tide breaths. One near-loop: “the lanterns burned on” repeats the opener’s phrasing, but it is intentional resonance, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity pockets as physicalized grief ledger, dockside mysticism grounded in coffee-ground cartography. Risky second-person address (“you’d be ready”) is earned by accumulative pattern and heightens the cyclical doom. Concept commits fully—no retreat into metaphor; the stone literally dissolves under tidal rules. Transformation test fails: swap dock for desert and the salt-crystal gravity chamber collapses—integral, not ornamental.</comment>
