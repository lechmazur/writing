<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses stay interior; the engineer’s choice to turn the key is embodied and irreversible, but the “logic/emotion” split is named more than enacted in scene. The cost—cell-by-cell unraveling—is felt, yet the prose keeps her interiority slightly abstract, blunting the last increment to 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lighthouse beam becomes a hymn, her body rewired, artifact stable—cost unmistakable. Causal chain holds: thinning ice → key turn → vibrational match → beam, all on-page. No orientation debt; lens stays Accumulative/Textural to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and brass resonator constrain every tactical choice; even her body becomes a micro-setting that is re-tuned. Black-glass sphere recurs with escalating specificity until it charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight—salt peeled from the air—without checklist drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent sphere resonance—tightens once: key turn forecloses retreat and triggers visceral cost. Escalation is Accumulative: subsonic ache → molar hum → bone vibration → cellular unraveling, all legible. No reversal, but the single deepening is decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges through the sphere’s song and her bodily transmutation; no moralizing line states it. The final “hymn” reweights monks’ dogma into physics-forgiveness—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Ambiguity lingers: martyrdom, adaptation, or work—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“language only she understood”) and paid off in the listening ice. Syntax mirrors vibration—clause lengths oscillate—without monotony. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature stays singular and coherent under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>High-density lines (“salt peeled from the air”) advance both image and causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative control holds even in the climax’s “reverse lightning strike.” Rhythm accelerates with pressure, then exhales into the final star-pierced quiet—read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Sonic-absolution-as-bomb, drift-ice dampener, and vibrational self-unraveling synthesize familiar sf/horror tropes into a fresh, inevitable arc. Risky lyric compression pays off: the lighthouse beam becomes hymn without cliché. Specificity of key, sphere, and marina makes the concept impossible to transplant unchanged.</comment>
