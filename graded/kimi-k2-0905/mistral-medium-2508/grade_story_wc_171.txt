<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra’s contradictory impulse—clinging to ritual while admitting treaties break—lives in embodied micro-choices: thumb on fresh notch, steady hand despite tremor. Kael’s armor creak & reluctant signature show parallel fracture. Cost is visible: new soft notch = fresh graves. Interiority avoids label-speak; “quiet violence of hope” is specific to her trained restraint. Both remain credibly flawed; neither is redeemed, only “installment” paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each signature notch → next war → next treaty. Closure is Earned Stasis: Kael signs, Veyra accepts repeat betrayal, cost legible in “soft wood” and his parting taunt. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; clipboard, ink, terrace all track. Final image of rain-washed terrace reweights premise: peace is temporary rinse cycle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terrace stones, lavender/gunpowder scent, midsummer light are filtered through Veyra’s war-weary perception and constrain ritual placement. Ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting: its polished grief dictates where pen can be set. Spatial choreography clean—bodies, blade, parchment occupy fixed stage. Final rain promise evolves setting causally, prepares next cycle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: “price of stopping” signaled early. Escalation is tightening of ritual obligation: blank parchment → signature → soft notch. Cost visible in Kael’s shaking hand & Veyra’s admission “Probably” will break again. Agency preserved: he could refuse; she could walk away—both endure instead. Coincidence absent; pressure is historical weight, not external twist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repeated failure of peace rites rather than assertion. “Redemption in installments” reweights earlier notch imagery. Subtext in Kael’s parting taunt: cynicism is residual belief. No final moral—only charged poise of rain coming. Lavender/gunpowder pairing carries thematic duality without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed third-person intimate stays inside Veyra’s perceptual filter. Diction—“operatively gentle,” “quiet violence of hope”—is POV-consistent negotiator jargon. Rhythm accelerates during pen hover, breathes with sentence fragments: “No. I want you to muster…” No head-hop; Kael’s interior read through gesture & speech. Filter verbs serve voice, not clutter.</comment>

<comment>High density: “ink dark as terraces’ shadows” does three jobs (color, time, mood). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stake or image. Metaphors (clipboard = polished grief) stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long river sentences to clipped fragments at climax. Final line “for now, that was enough” lands with cadence-earned breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “endless war/fragile truce” frame is recharged by negotiator’s notched clipboard as literal ledger of recycled hope. Ritual ink from ashes of dead is fresh sensory twist. Risk taken: no victory, only iterative endurance—yet causality & cost hold. Specificity of “soft wood” makes repeat betrayal tactile. Not wholly new, but synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
