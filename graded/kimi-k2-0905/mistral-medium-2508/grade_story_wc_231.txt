<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s compulsive noticing of absences (third-piling gouge, lavender scent) makes his eccentricity observable, not merely labeled. The moment he steels himself to steep the flower, then re-pins it, dramatizes a hierarchy of values: duty to strangers > self-protection. Interior contradiction is alive—he both clings to and surrenders the memory—yet never slips into diagnostic speak. Final renunciation costs him the flower and the stranger’s echo, foreclosing any future custodianship; cost is visible in the crumble promised by dawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the beam’s arc re-weights the premise—keepers are not hoarders but channels. Causal chain holds: because the boutonnière is preserved, therefore it can be returned; because Elias is last willing vessel, therefore he must release. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensate fragment layers until the final image crystallizes the social cost of endless memory inheritance. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) land by line 5; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight are not backdrop but filters that narrow Elias’s perception—visibility dictates his investigatory method. The brass buckles and Fresnel lens provide tactile occupational detail that constrains the final lens-adjustment act. Micro-setting triumph: the boutonnière itself becomes terrain when its petals map a woman’s face. Setting charges the last image—beam skimming the horizon where stranger vanished—making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible by line 3: will Elias keep or release the borrowed memory? Pressure tightens accumulatively—each sensory gap he notices deepens his implication. Escalation beat: steeping the flower = irreversible narrowing; once petals unfurl, refusal is no longer safe. Cost is on-page—warmth against chest becomes impending crumble, a palpable forfeit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: memory is tidal, not proprietary. Subtext resides in gesture—re-pinning the warmed flower is consent to transience. Final image (beam carrying goodbyes) offers non-literal answer to question of ownership. No echo-statement −0.0; complexity held.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: maritime lexicon, lighthouse physics, synesthetic shift of scent into visible memory. Syntax modulates—long breathless sentences under magnification, staccato climb of spiral stairs. No dialogue, so voice coherence rides on interior monologue that never exceeds POV lexicon. Compression “opal dock…half-remembered dream” teaches lyric pattern paid off in final beam sweep.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm is oceanic: swell–retreat sentence pairs mirror tide. Information density high—one sentence can layer tool, body, and metaphor: “calloused from winding the Fresnel lens.” No loops or scaffold; figurative control tight—mixed metaphors 0. Metaphors are maritime-consistent (driftwood voice, tide of goodbyes). Only micro-flaw: “breath of the sea” is faint cliché; does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise freshens ghost-story trope by shifting from haunting to voluntary stewardship. Edelweiss-as-vessel is non-obvious synthesis of alpine flower and maritime disaster. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could alienate, but payoff in final image justifies choice. Detail specificity (jars of preserved storms) prevents generic transfer to any keeper setting.</comment>
