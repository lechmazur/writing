<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete—her thumb-blood pressed into soil, her quivering hands, her humming—yet the “wistfully pragmatic” label is asserted rather than dramatized. The gauge-tooth micro-choices credibly foreshadow the ending renunciation, and the Earned Stasis (choosing to stay & plant) carries visible emotional cost. Elias functions as pressure, not crucible; his smoother tooth gift is the pivotal external trigger that crystallizes her shift. No orientation or knowledge drift; competence balanced with believable tremor under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the two gauge teeth in dirt reweight “locked vs. free” with undeniable conceptual cost—she stays, heart open, no longer needing the lock. Causal chain holds: gauge teeth → scoring soil → shared gift → open-door final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. Micro-turn is the smooth tooth offered, tightening options. Cost is felt in the “quivering hush” that becomes “something like hope” on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fire-escape-as-micro-setting constrains every move: pots balanced on rail, wind-shift felt at body height, moonlight angle dictating where Lena crouches. Harbor’s salt scent and lap-timing act as metronome for her tremor, charging the final image. Tool-detail (rusted tin can, bitting gauge) is accurate and tactile; spatial choreography clean as Elias climbs and hands over soil. Environment, body, and recurring object (gauge teeth) directly shape tactics and reconfigure final meaning—gate satisfied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she risk staying open?—is signaled early via rose petal & war-scarred heart. Escalation is situational: moonlit hush intensifies tactile exposure (blood, cold basil) until the gift of the second tooth crystallizes her stance; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful tightening: acceptance of Elias’s smoother tooth = acceptance of vulnerability. Cost is legible—she forfeits the old lock-logic, pays with trembling song that finds rhythm—meeting 8.4 threshold; lacks persistent tactical constraint for 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—locked vs. open heart—emerges via soil, salt, and metal without once moralizing. Subtext lives in silence: the unasked question between them, the offered tin can full of pocketed earth. Final image (two teeth gleaming in dirt) reweights prior imagery of locks & keys, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No tidy maxim; ambiguity lingers in harbor’s pulse, yet emotional after-effect is concrete—reader feels the door stay open.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains a hushed, moonlit cadence that mirrors Lena’s quiver. Perceptual signature—rust, salt, moon-blades, thyme-scent—filters every observation through her war-weathered bias. Syntax compresses under stress (“She curled her fingers…”) then elongates with song—rhythmic control without monotony. No head-hopping; Elias’s interior is inferred only through Lena’s gaze—distance modest, consistent. Voice remains distinct from boilerplate lyricism by grounded tool-detail and harbor grit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: single sentences carry sensory, emotional, and symbolic freight (“bead of blood… dark as the harbor’s depths”). Figurative logic stays coherent—moonlight as blade, hush as pulse—no mixed metaphors. Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm; zero paraphrase loops detected. Scaffold is minimal; only slight uptick in adjectival layering mid-paragraph (−0.2), but clarity at closure untouched, keeping 8.8.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rose-as-heart and lock-gardening are familiar tropes, yet the bitting-gauge-tooth repurposed for soil-scoring feels specific and non-obvious. Harbor/fire-escape micro-setting plus post-war emotional lock-picking offers fresh angle on healing-garden motif. Synthesis makes the gauge teeth inevitable—lock logic turned to growth tool, re-charged at ending. Risk is understated (quiet lyric rather than plot twist) but coherent; stays below 9.0 because core emotional arc could survive mild synonym swaps.</comment>
