<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“the hollows of the arches like a gathering of ghosts,” “whirling silence pressed against her eardrums”—and micro-choices (banking toward the fracture, landing, plunging her hand inside) track with her mentor-driven motive. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. legacy hunger) stay implicit rather than enacted in-scene, -0.2. Seed-taking is earned, the cost is the arrow’s dissolution into dust; still, no secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible waived. Meets 9+ gate on earned final choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the seed becomes a singing sapling, resilience is re-defined as something grown, not found, and the arrow’s dust is the felt price. Causal chain holds: inversion hum → arch fracture → moss/seed discovery → sapling birth → arrow forfeiture. No orientation debt; planet rules taught through flight and water reversal before they matter. Final image reweights mentor quest and planet lore in one compressed beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inverted river, bioluminescent boulders, gravity clock, and spongy moss on the arch skin all constrain tactics (flight path, sampling, landing site). The sapling inside the cockpit functions as micro-setting that charges the last image. Sensory hierarchy obeys pilot attention: air currents first, then rock crust, then sap viscosity. Spatial choreography keeps Veyra, glider, arch, and fracture in clean alignment; no impossible moves.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the source of resilience—tightens when the fracture is revealed as a living mouth, narrowing options to reach inside or retreat. One-hour gravity inversion acts as live clock; moss acceleration and seed pulse raise on-page cost of delay. Final choice to plant inside the untouched core forecloses safe return, scales stakes from personal to planetary. Cost is legible: mentor relic lost, skin colonized, next inversion risk assumed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Resilience-as-cultivation emerges image-by-image: floating roots, mid-air sprouting, arrow-to-dust, seed-to-sapling, pilot-to-gardener. No thematic label-speak; silent hum, chorus of arches, and sapling “song” carry the reconfiguration. Complexity preserved—planet’s violence accepted as generative. Final scream promises reciprocal creation, not conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight adopts pilot perceptual slang—“shuddered,” “skimming,” “craning”—with rhythmic compression under flight stress. Elliptical compression (“She landed… She reached…”) mirrors urgency without head-hopping. No dialogue, so voice distinctness judged through interior metaphor: “echoes weren’t ghosts. They were instructions.” Register stays within pilot lexis; no corporate filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long aerial glide sentences brake into staccato landing beats. Mixed metaphors avoided—“veins weeping sap,” “mouth lined with moss”—keep physical logic consistent. One paraphrase loop: “the moss didn’t just glow—it accelerated growth” could trim, but occurs pre-closure so −0.1. Information density high; every line advances flight, world rule, or stakes. Closure sentence “She was ready to scream back” propels without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Inversion ecology and up-flowing river invert familiar space-farming into fresh physics. Moss-acceleration biotech and rock-arch wombs fuse terraforming with body horror. Mentor relic arrow becoming literal dust seed-payment feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risk—planetary gravity flip—taken head-on, not hedged, enabling climax planting in planet core.</comment>
