<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is sharply particular—her fingers dusty from thrift, the locket pressed to her ear—and her micro-choices (opening the mailbox, reading aloud) visibly tilt the courtyard’s collective stance. The “listen instead” imperative gives her a credible hierarchy of values under pressure. She earns no decisive personal loss, so the cost is communal, not intimate; still, her refusal to “solve” Elena is an earned renunciation that fits the communal lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: locket hum → mailbox clang → letter → shared listening ritual, each beat narrowing communal options. The 1989-disappearance backstory is anchored to present stimuli within 120 words and repaid when Mrs. Delgado’s hands tremble, so orientation waiver applies. Closure is a Charged Poise: the courtyard’s new compact to keep writing letters crystallizes options with felt social cost—Elena stays absent yet present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The courtyard’s cracked tiles, rust-blue mailbox, and jasmine air are filtered through Mira’s thrift-curator eye; the mailbox’s cold metal against dawn heat constrains her touch and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—sound (tick-tick, radio static) overrides visual clutter. Micro-setting rule met: the mailbox’s hinged mouth reconfigures meaning at exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the courtyard reconstitute itself around absence—signals early via locket hum. One meaningful tightening: the lock gives way only when Mira accepts joint custodianship, foreclosing private ownership of story. Cost is legible: the courtyard must keep feeding the mailbox, a persistent constraint. Agency is collective, not solo, fitting situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—“listening heals absence”—emerges through gesture (Chen’s hum, Delgado’s tremble) rather than thesis. Subtext lives in the locket’s metronome and the unsent replies: absence is a shared instrument. Final image of the bell chiming for a new story reweights the premise without moralizing. The refusal to explain Elena preserves productive ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside Mira’s perceptual signature: brass-framed glasses slip, dust on fingers, sound of home inside metal. Rhythm modulates—long exhaling sentences at dawn, staccato “tick-tick” under pressure. No dialogue to distort voice; crowd’s murmur is reported through her filter, keeping psychic distance clean. Syntax mirrors curator precision without炫耀.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “mailbox creaked. / Not from the wind.” Micro-beat propulsion. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“light like a slow exhale”), paid off in final “soft air.” No loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density high. One mixed metaphor—“thread pulling them closer”—minor, doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar “haunted object + neighborhood ritual” core, but freshness comes from curator POV and communal rather than spectral resolution. Transformation test: swap Mira’s thrift eye for generic narrator and the ending collapses. Risk taken in refusing reveal of Elena’s fate; cost is social, not sentimental. Slight deduction for template cadence in “the world intruded…” line.</comment>
