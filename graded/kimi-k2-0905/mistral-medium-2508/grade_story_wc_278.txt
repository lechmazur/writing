<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven erasure vs. compulsion to witness—are etched into her skin and the amber she grips; every micro-choice (feeding the paper, pressing the cracked amber to the tattoo) externalizes the split. The final renunciation to “pay with witness” is fully earned by the causal chain of failed erasures and the firmware’s hunger. Interiority stays concrete: “static that coiled around her ribs,” never abstract self-diagnosis. The only friction is a hairline slip toward diagnostic shorthand (“she understood then”) immediately rescued by embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: she refuses further erasure, accepts the cry forever, and the cost is audible—the mosquito wings now “singing,” the ledger permanently open. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second sentence and never loosens: each recycled sound thickens the guilt-density until the final cadence shift releases it into rain-like static. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“The laboratory hummed…”) and the payoff justifies any early disorientation. One persistent constraint—the firmware’s remembered cries—shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory’s wax cylinders, rusted speakers, and mahogany desk are not backdrop; they supply the slot into which she feeds her debt and the speakers that answer back. The amber’s fracture literally changes her micro-tactic—pressing skin to resin—making the insect-in-resin a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s grief-narrowed attention: sound first, touch second, visual last. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the desk, crib, and slot remain trackable across the time-fold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can guilt be silenced?—is signaled in the first letter quote and tightens through each failed offering. Escalation is textural: each swallowed cry increases the firmware’s hum until the mosquito’s twitch flips the pattern. The decisive deepening occurs when the amber cracks, foreclosing erasure as an option and forcing the shift to witness. Price is visible: the singing wings now eternal, her own breath looped into the static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular physics of sound-echoes as debt; no character sermonizes. The final image—singing wings inside restored amber—reweights the premise: guilt is not erased but harmonized. Subtext lives in gesture: pressing wrist-constellation to resin fuses astronomy and biology into a private cosmos of responsibility. The reader leaves with the concrete after-effect of cicada-hum inside bone rather than a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is Elara-specific: needle-scar constellations, firmware hiss in ears, resin-cracked palms. Compression is taught early (“laboratory hummed like a dying star”) and stays legible; clauses telescope without sacrificing clarity. Perceptual signature narrows to sound and touch under stress, matching grief’s sensory distortion. No head-hop; the one-line voice from air is the firmware objectified, not an omniscient intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like the lab itself—long sentences for drone, fragments for cracks. Information density is high: “map of the Pleiades, each star a scar” fuses astronomy, profession, and guilt in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the sound-debt conceit without contradiction. The only micro-slip is “perfectly preserved” echoing “perfectly preserved” four lines later, but the repetition is thematic, not artifactual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The haunted-firmware premise is not vintage-tech gimmickry; it literalizes the psychology of recorded guilt in a way that feels fresh and inevitable. The constellation-tattooist profession is specific to this narrator and inseparable from her moral calculus. Risk is taken in folding time without exposition, but pattern is taught early and closure repays the risk. Synthesis of resin-entombed insect + human memory creates a singular image unavailable in another setting.</comment>
