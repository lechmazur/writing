<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—clutching versus surrendering the spiral—are dramatized in bodily micro-choices on the walkway and at the orb drop; the final decision to offer her own unsent letter costs her the safety of anonymity and is earned by the mirrored beat of the first spiral’s release. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers curled around a twig on her pillow”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The only minor softness is a slight therapeutic tint to “secrets were never meant to be kept,” but it is immediately complicated by the material act of returning, so the flaw stays sub-capsule.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the second spiral’s release reweights the premise—possession → offering—with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the image of dissolving orbs carries the price. Causality is internal-pattern rather than external event, valid under the lens. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“floating walkway”), transitions are legible, no props teleport. The ending earns its stasis: she leaves with emptier pockets and a fresh sheet, the thread now externalized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The damp walkway, petal-domes, and glass orbs are not postcard scenery—they constrain movement (boots sink, robes brush water) and supply the only permissible conduit for releasing secrets. The thrush-shadow cast by the orb is the exact image that reconfigures meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Micro-setting (twig on windowsill) also functions as a recursive object. One minor over-color phrase (“sky the color of old parchment”) is generic but does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release versus custody of secrets—tightens once: first spiral gone → second spiral offered, narrowing Liora’s identity from ghost to author of her own exposure. The tightening is textural rather than causal-oppositional, valid under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the hush after the second orb is lifted. No coincidence resolves the pressure; the final blur of ink accepts imperfection as visible price. The escalation is single but decisive, adequate for 700-word span.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete return of two twig-spirals: “rejoining” is dramatized, never moralized. Final image of ripples becoming light reweights earlier material without dictating a lesson. Subtext sits in gesture—artist’s ink-stained fingers accept the spiral before Liora speaks. The only near-echo is the monk’s line about “the thread,” but it is brief and offset by immediate sensory grounding, so the echo stays beneath the 0.4 deduction threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Liora’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors her circling thoughts—“half-finished constellations,” “slow unfurling”—without losing clarity. Filter verbs are minimal and rhythmically purposeful. The single line of dialogue (“You’ve brought a secret”) is crisp, subtext-laden, and voice-distinct from narration, fulfilling the 9+ micro-test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive: sentence variety, no template cadence, zero paraphrase loops. Figurative layer is dense but pattern-taught early (“petal-like domes,” “ghost of the thing”) and paid off in the dissolving orb image; no mixed metaphors at closure. One tiny scaffold—“the thread was there. It had always been there”—is justified as mantra-like recurrence. High information density: damp boots, ink bleed, thrush song all advance theme or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The love-letter ghostwriter who must finally author her own unmailed letter is a fresh inversion; the spiral-of-letters-as-prayer via public art installation transforms familiar “letting go” trope into concrete ritual. Specificity—silver thread, thrush shadow, ink bleed—prevents abstraction. Risk in lyric accumulation is purposeful and coherent at closure. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious, meeting the 9+ transformation test.</comment>
