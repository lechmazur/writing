<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—thirty-year linguist who now confronts word-death—shows in trembling fingers and shallow breath. Micro-choices (climbing, pressing lips to crystal) externalize the scholar’s reticence-turned-urgency. Taking the woman’s hand crystallizes earned change with visible cost: abandoning solitary archive for collective listening. Yet woman remains a functional envoy rather than a second crucible; no status push, so 9+ not met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s pulse reframes silence as “a breath held.” Causal chain holds—crystal test → pattern heard → alliance formed—each step narrowing options. Cost is felt: Elias forsakes archival safety for unknown field work. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library is rendered through sensory triangulation: stained-gold floor, sagging chandelier, cold vibrating prism. Each detail couples to action—ladder groan, crystal kiss—so setting literally bends sound and choice. Shadowed dawn light mirrors suspended language growth; chandelier prism functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Meets 9+ gate: crystal constrains and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode why language stopped—tightens when crystal reveals underground growth. Single escalation: solitary study → shared mapping. Agency visible: Elias physically tests crystal, then accepts stranger’s hand, foreclosing isolated path. Cost legible but not viscerally scaled; could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: growth migrates from public lexicon to subterranean, collective listening. Silence reframed as fertile pause avoids moralizing. Final image of dictionary cracking open reweights premise without statement. Subtle counter-readings possible—hope or dystopia—yielding lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—sound-bent metaphors, lexicon of lexicography—remains Elias-bound. Rhythm accelerates with short, breath-like sentences during crystal kiss. No head-hop; woman’s voice distinctively rough against Elias’s scholarly diction. Meets 9+ edge: texture and compression taught early, paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose carries high-density double duty: “fractured gold” paints floor and foreshadows sonic fracture. No loops; metaphors stay internally consistent. Minor register lift—“sonically reflective,” “conceptual repricing”—fits scholar POV. Closure beat crystalline, unmuddied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—dictionaries stop yet language keeps growing via sonic crystals—feels fresh synthesis of linguistics and subtle fantasy. Risky lyric structure pays off: pattern taught early, closure legible. Specific detail (prism reversing phrases) prevents abstraction. Transformation test: swap crystal for mirror, effect collapses—evidence of ingenuity.</comment>
