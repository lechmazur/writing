<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority remains concrete—her fingers “tracing the ridge where the stone curled like a sleeping eyelid” shows body-first knowing, not label-speak. The beautician/mortician duality is evoked through tactile ritual (preparing a corpse, reading static) rather than exposition. Internal contradiction surfaces in her need to hoard sparks for the dead while sensing her own pulse as rhythm not countdown—an earned micro-shift. Cost is present but diffuse: the chip’s light is “spent,” yet the price to her own future stillness is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the doorway dissolves but the static is “tuned to a new frequency,” reweighting stillness from wall to bridge. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each aurora shiver, breath pattern, and static code fragment layers until the mirror threshold appears. Orientation is anchored within 120 words via body, ledge, grotto, and aurora. The only minor slack: the chip’s rule-set is revealed rather than foreshadowed, but this is taught in-scene and paid off by the dull-green final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto under aurora is rendered through motion—“walls woven from petrified mist,” wind stuttering against stone—so setting acts as active agent, not postcard. The emerald chip doubles as micro-setting; its fracture plane and spent pulse track state change. Sensory hierarchy skews kinesthetic/tactile, matching mortician attention to corporeal thresholds. Environment constrains the final gesture: the ledge’s curl literally shapes Liora’s reach and limits escape, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carry the dead’s last spark across oblivion—is signaled early and tightens once: the mirror doorway forecloses her own safe retreat. Pressure accrues through pattern recognition beats; each decoded shimmer narrows options until only mutual touch remains. Cost is legible—chip light extinguished, aurora frequency shifted—but the price to Liora’s own mortality is still conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: thresholds are breaths between notes, not walls. The static-as-language motif reconfigures from alien noise to intimate bridge, reweighting stillness itself. No moral is declared; the final smile is an image-answer to the woman’s whisper. Minor abstraction in “radiance on the other side of silence” flirts with profundity but is anchored in the spent chip and retuned aurora, so resonance holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—synesthesia of sound into touch (“static that wasn’t random…a code written in tremors”) and mortician diction (“hollows of her hands,” “curve of her collarbone”). Syntax lengthens during infiltration, then fractures into short clauses at the touch beat, mirroring aurora flicker. No dialogue, so voice remains pure lyric interiority. Register stays within Liora’s lived lexicon; no thesaurus drift. The rhythmic drop at the end—“She smiled. The dead had given her a spark.”—earns Charged Poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers metaphor, body, and plot advance—“She pressed the chip to her temple, and the grotto’s walls shivered” moves object, setting reaction, and causal trigger in nine words. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (aurora as exhale, static as language) rather than repeating. One mixed metaphor—“echo of a choice never made”—is minor and does not cloud closure. Final-line spareness caps the lyric swell at exactly the right moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing mortician craft with aurora code-reading is fresh; the beautician half feels under-exploited but does not undercut novelty. “Threshold of stillness” as a breathable membrane rather than terminal wall offers non-obvious moral physics. Risk is high—lyric speculative vignette with no antagonist—but coherence never wavers. The emerald chip as memory key verges on trope yet is re-threaded as mirror, not portal, avoiding cliché.</comment>
