<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his palm against salt-crusted stone, the lantern slide “warm as if alive”—and his final carving of an open hand is a micro-choice that costs him the talismanic slide. Yet the leap from “perpetually learning” to “loom” epiphany is slightly abstract; the internal contradiction between commerce and legacy could be pressed harder in-scene to earn the renunciation fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered images (net, child, woman) tighten until the archway’s hum reweights Elias’s goal from selling driftwood to gifting a hand. Closure is a Charged Poise: the path home unspools because he has paid the slide’s cost, leaving the carving as future conduit. Orientation is swift—storm, lost GPS, arch by line 4—and causality holds: each vision bleeds into the next, foreclosing the market option without reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Storm, stone, and slide are tactile and selective: wind “howling through its jagged mouth,” slide edges “warm as if alive.” The blackthorn fragment becomes micro-setting, its grain dictating the carved hand that seals the loom. Spatial choreography is clean—palm to stone, slide to arch, hand to crevice—anchoring the surreal light-show in bodily logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—leave a mark vs. sell driftwood—is signaled early; the tightening occurs when the slide’s sideways light forecloses the festival option by revealing prior hands. Cost is visible: surrender of the slide and the market payday. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the pattern break (light spills sideways) forces stance crystallization under storm pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as communal loom—emerges through stacked hands across centuries, never abstractly named. The final driftwood boat slipped into a stranger’s pocket reweights the opening commerce motive into quiet legacy. Ambiguity lingers: will the boat guide or merely echo? The refusal to declare a moral keeps resonance alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature: “turbine-hum filled his skull,” “layers… a scaffold of simplicity.” Syntax lengthens then compresses with storm tempo; no head-hop. Diction—“timewoven,” “salt-crusted”—is consistent with a sculptor who sees grain and gesture. Final sentence cadence mirrors the loom: long breath, then clipped gift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Light spilled out—not forward, but sideways” advances action and motif in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (net, cement, basket) is purposeful, not purple. Only minor slip: “like a choir of lost things” edges toward familiar, but storm context justifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lantern-slide-as-loom is fresh, avoiding portal cliché by threading light sideways through stone rather than opening a door. Prior marks—compass rose, violets, rusted nail—feel specific, not sentimental. Risk: quiet gift instead of spectacle, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if relocated; the salt, storm, and driftwood are inseparable.</comment>
