<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s perceptual signature (“dusk noticer”) is vivid and specific, grounding her interiority in embodied, sensory detail. The contradictory impulse to both guard and surrender her shadow is dramatized in the final beat, where the cost—her own shadow’s diminishment—is felt on the page. The curator’s lie adds relational pressure, but his interiority is kept modest, so status dynamics remain legible without POV leakage. The only slack is the poet’s off-page arc, which is summarized rather than witnessed, slightly diluting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s offer of her shadow crystallizes a new equilibrium—the poet’s hope is housed, the library breathes, Liora’s stance is permanently altered. Cost is legible in the final image: her “thin but present” shadow and the stone’s faint pulse. Causality is clean: the stone’s arrival → footage comparison → recognition → sacrifice. Accum/Textural lens holds throughout; each reprise of “softly deliberate” deepens the pattern rather than advances plot, and the final merging reweights the entire texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The floating, blooming library is not postcard scenery; its shelves shift imperceptibly to “make room,” actively participating in the closure. The river stone functions as micro-setting: handled in multiple beats, its weight and warmth constrain Liora’s tactile choices and charge the final image. Light-petaled books and cloud-level altitude are filtered through Liora’s dusk-attuned eye, never described generically. Spatial choreography is flawless—stone passed from hand to sill, shadow curling like a cat—so environment, body, and tool converge to constrain the sacrifice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope—is signaled with the poet’s line and tightens when Liora realizes the shadow seeks a vessel. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the meaningful turn is her palm-opening offer that forecloses her own wholeness. Escalation is accumulative: each footage comparison thickens the dread, the stone’s pulse enlarges the stakes, until the only remaining option is self-gift. Cost is visible—her shadow thins—so the trade-off is felt, not abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular of a detachable hope-shadow; no moral is stated, only enacted. The final image—stone warm, library sighing—re-prices the premise: stories outlive bodies, but only at the price of someone’s partial self. Subtext resides in silence: the curator’s lie, the poet’s single line, Liora’s unspoken recognition that she was “already half-empty.” Regret is luminous, not bitter, because the reconfiguration is accepted rather than preached.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: Liora notices “the exact moment day surrendered,” tracks shadows “as if they were living things.” Rhythm modulates—long, breath-held sentences under pressure, then short release: “She set the stone on the windowsill.” No dialogue, so voice purity is never contaminated by speech-craft; the curator’s whisper is filtered through Liora’s ear, maintaining distance control. Diction stays within her lexicon—“softly deliberate,” “sharp-eyed dusk noticer”—and the lyrical pattern is taught early, paid off in the final merging.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “Its shelves heavy with books that bloomed with light when touched” fuses setting, magic rule, and emotional charge in one line. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors are coherent—stone as “breath held too long,” shadow as “sleeping cat”—and never mixed. Minor scaffold: “the library held its breath” appears twice, but the repetition is purposeful, creating a heartbeat pattern that culminates in the final sigh. Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence dulls the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The detachable-emotion entity is familiar from mimic/soul-loosening tales, yet here it is hope—not dread—that unhooks, reversing the trope. The floating blooming library fuses two stock images (sky-library, living books) but grounds them in Liora’s dusk-attuned gaze, making the fusion feel specific. The final transaction—shadow for stone—re-weights the concept so the cost is personal rather than cosmic. Risk is taken in the lyric, accumulative structure; the payoff is a quiet image whose freshness lies in its acceptance of partial loss.</comment>
