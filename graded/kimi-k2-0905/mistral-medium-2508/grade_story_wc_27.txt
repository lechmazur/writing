<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Lena’s barefoot habit is more quirk than crucible; the opera glasses and stone hum drive her turn, not her soles. Interiority is vivid (“awkward certainty like a bird with one wing askew”), but contradictions under pressure are only implied, not dramatized in scene. The final stance—standing in the wreckage and refusing silence—earns its cost via the bay’s reignition, yet her flaw/mistake remains offstage. Closure lands as Charged Poise; motivation suffices but falls short of 8-band micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bay’s hum becomes a communal name, visible cost written in rust flakes and coughing engines. Causal chain: Lena’s palm → stones flare → glasses pass → scouts light up → ships lift; each beat tightens options under a Causal lens. Orientation anchors (“abandoned spaceport repair bay… margin of daylight”) arrive well before 120 w. One minor loop: “rebellion’s lull… forgotten how to listen” restates stakes twice; does not dull final image. Lens holds without ambiguity; qualifies for 8-band but lacks persistent constraint that would push 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Setting is textured through action: grit against bare soles, rust flakes shaken loose by the hum, engine shadows stretching at dusk. The stone circle functions as micro-setting that physically constrains and re-energizes the rebellion. Concrete sensory triangulation—temperature of brass, taste of dust, vibration in bones—anchors the rebellion’s rebirth inside this single bay. Minor over-use of visual vs. other senses, but the bay itself is the final image; qualifies for 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“the rebellion has stalled and forgotten why”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and re-energized by the stones. One meaningful tightening: palm-on-stone narrows Lena’s options from passive watching to active ignition; cost is the bay’s physical shudder and the risk of renewed war. Agency is continuous: she scans, presses, shouts, passes glasses. No external antagonist needed; internal/external stakes fuse around silence vs. reignition. Price is legible but not persistent; edges 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is not found in clean victory but in the stubborn act of pulling a spark from wreckage. The opera glasses reweighted from nostalgic curiosity to lens-of-revival; stones from mute relic to communal heartbeat. No final moralizing; last image of shadow stretching “defiant across the cracked concrete” answers the thematic question non-literally. Resonant without preachiness; minor deduction for one overt tagline (“the rebellion wasn’t about winning”) mid-text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is concrete and idiosyncratic—“toes curling against the grit,” “hinge creaking like an old man’s joints.” Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences in calm, staccato bursts during hum surge. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Dialogue is brief but natural; scout’s single line advances the ignition beat. Voice distinct enough for 8-band, lacks the final sonic punch that would hit 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences do two jobs (atmosphere + action). One paraphrase loop: “the rebellion had stalled… forgotten how to listen” echoes thrice; mild scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (rust flakes as fallout, hum as second heartbeat). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final third clean; artifacts do not touch closure. Ear-test varies cadence; paragraph cuts purposeful. Solid 8, not immaculate 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of opera glasses + stone circle + spaceport bay yields fresh insurgency origin story; trope inversion turns nostalgic artifact into ignition lens. Barefoot stargazer and thunderous serenity are risk-laden juxtapositions that pay off without gimmickry. Specificity—spirals that shift when blinked, grit between toes—anchors universals. No close echoes of famous beats; feels inevitable in hindsight. Slight risk in lyric abstraction, but coherence holds. Earns upper-band originality.</comment>
