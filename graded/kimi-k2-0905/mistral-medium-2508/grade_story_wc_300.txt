<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inspector’s interior contradiction—duty vs. empathy—drives every micro-choice; the pearl’s absorption of confessions is embodied in trembling fingers and softened stone. The final renunciation (no radio answer, walking into light) is earned by the causal chain of shells and the felt cost of “every confession became her own.” Only the slightest safety-hedge—“wasn’t entirely hers”—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shell deepens pattern and reweights stakes until the pearl’s crown dissolves the bunker/world barrier. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of spreading sky-light—paid for by her vanished pearl and abandoned name. Orientation is clean by line 5; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal veins, silt, quartz grit, and bioluminescent pulse are filtered through the inspector’s procedural gaze; the shells-as-confessions turn the cave itself into a tactile crucible that constrains the final choice. The sky’s swirling light reprises the cave’s glow, charging the exit image. One notch below 9 only because spatial choreography inside the final chamber is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“dissolve the walls between hearts”—tightens via each shell’s confession; the pearl’s crown is the single decisive escalation that forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: pearl gone, identity subsumed, radio unanswered. No reversal is needed; the pattern’s intensification satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of confessions: vulnerability as the only real weapon. The final sky-streaked silence offers Conceptual Repricing—security bunkers become wombs, hearts the true frontier. No moralizing; resonance is carried by image and forfeiture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to the inspector’s perceptual signature—boots crunching, lantern flicker, spiral text shifting. Compression (“the caves had a way…”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at exit. No head-hopping; diction remains within her taciturn lexicon even under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates into breathless embroidery as light spills; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse until the final unfolding, preventing purple drift. One mixed metaphor—“light stitched… like embroidery”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “bunker-as-womb” trope via confessional seashells and a crown that dissolves walls inward. The pearl-as-method rather than MacGuffin feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric escalation is fully committed to and lands cleanly.</comment>
