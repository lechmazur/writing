<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mirror-maker’s renunciation/merger is legible, but the interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“grounding is just another kind of flight”) that tells us the emotional arithmetic instead of dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment of dissolution. Because the transformation is accomplished almost entirely by atmospheric fiat rather than a micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path, the cost feels conceptual rather than personal, keeping the score below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image reconfigures sky from boundary to door, and the lingering mirror-star in his pocket makes the cost tangible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of frost, fog, and mirrored light tightens until meaning flips. Orientation is swift, causality is dream-logic but internally consistent, and the sextant’s breath-driven restoration supplies the required constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard, frost-lensed twilight, and sextant-as-micro-setting constrain every beat; fog density literally governs visibility and memory, while frost melt marks the pressure shift. Sensory selection stays biased to the maker’s tactile precision—calloused fingers, brass chill—so environment and body interleave without tourist excess. One minor slip: “glass mountains” is invoked as tone label rather than lived terrain, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—erase the boundary between earth and sky to recover/merge with the lost brother—tightens once, when the maker decides to let the fog take him rather than resist. Agency is present but abstract; the price (self-dissolution) is felt, yet the escalation is more accretive than consequential, so the beat doesn’t quite foreclose a live alternative on the page. Sufficient for the length, but not the visible trade-off required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges inexorably from the central equation: reflection vs. refraction, holding on vs. letting go, ground vs. flight. The sextant-mirror fusion reweights these binaries without moralizing; the final image of pocketed star-light offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo or sermon intrudes—meaning stays embodied in the maker’s breath and the orchard’s new fruit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the maker’s perceptual signature—frost “like shattered glass,” fog as skin—while syntax elongates then compresses to mirror inhalation/exhalation. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction remains artisan-concrete (“calloused fingers,” “warped brass”) even at peak transcendence. One hairline slip: the brother’s disembodied voice momentarily ventriloquizes theme, but the POV recovers before closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with the beat—long inhalation clauses, sharp exhale fragments—without algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is selective: frost as shattered glass, sky as door; no mixed metaphors or purple stacks. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold; information density stays high. A single near-split infinitive (“began the work of recreation”) is negligible; otherwise copy-clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “mirror-maker dissolves into star-map via breath-forge” premise is fresh, yet the core trope—dead beloved beckons from reflective surface—retains a faint mythical echo not fully transformed. Specificity of the sextant-mirror fusion and breath-based metallurgy supplies the needed inflection, pushing the score above 8.0, but the lack of a further surprise or risk keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>
