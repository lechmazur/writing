<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The vine dresser’s quiet, ritual polishing of cracked marbles embodies her contradictions—caretaker and accused traitor—without exposition; her refusal to argue with the elders and instead lead them to the garden’s self-mending glass is a micro-choice that crystallizes her values and costs her the last vestige of official approval.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the elders kneel, ledgers unopened, as the vines visibly mend the cracked marbles—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights “luck” from countable to reciprocal; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, the tightening achieved by the image-pattern of cracked-yet-gleaming glass returning charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The garden is rendered as a tactile, reactive character—roots cradling marbles, ivy curling her name—rather than backdrop; the cracked marbles themselves function as micro-setting that constrains her ritual and finally converts the elders, meeting the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates through the accumulating insult of measurement—each ledger entry, boot-crushed shoot—until the single image of vine-wrapped glass forces a stance shift; the cost is the elders’ loss of epistemic control, legible when the one admits “This wasn’t in the tally.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: value resides in unquantifiable reciprocity between gardener and garden; the cracked marbles re-priced from luck currency to covenant tokens deliver the resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate voice carries a horticultural cadence—short, rooted clauses that mimic pruning rhythms; perceptual signature is botanical (“leaves brushed her shoulders like old apologies”) and never drifts into academic or ledger diction, sustaining lyric compression without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet airy: each sentence layers garden imagery with emotional charge (“breath curling around a marble”) while avoiding metaphor clutter; no loops, no filter stacks, final line (“so was she”) lands with rhythmic poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: measurable luck vs. vegetal sentience braided through cracked marbles as covenant currency; the inversion of elders kneeling to an unmeasurable shrine feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
