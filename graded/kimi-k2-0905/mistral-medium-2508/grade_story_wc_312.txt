<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is rich—his self-diagnosing “lukewarm” magic, the embodied tremor when drips stutter, the micro-choice to listen for silence rather than sound. His stubborn, math-soaked devotion is shown through tactile bell-handling and bloodied fingers, not labeled. The only slack is the single sentence of village label “earnestly naive” without on-page contradiction; still, his final refusal to claim heroism crystallizes the arc with earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because Elias studies drip rhythms → therefore retunes bell → bay revives. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—sealing the fracture with a “vow kept” and foreclosing his old outsider stance. Orientation anchored by word 30; no prop or knowledge teleporting. Persistent constraint: the bell’s newly sealed seam remains a fragile weld, shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s sapphire spine, salt-crack lines, and drip cadence are filtered through Elias’s mage-math perception; the bell’s bronze temperature and salt-taste ground every beat. Dawn light evolves from “bleary” to “gold,” mirroring the bay’s revival. Micro-setting qualifies: the bell’s fracture constrains the tuning attempt and charges the final image as a seam rather than wound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring the bay—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when drips stutter, forcing the tuning gamble. One meaningful reversal: bell weeps → bay answers, with visible price (bloody fingers, exhausted sleep). Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is legible on-page: the bell’s fracture is now a sealed but fragile seam, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: drip math as language, broken bell as healed conduit, “brittle devotion” paid for in blood. Final image of the bell singing back reweights the premise—possibility is temporary, fragility is permanent—without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: villagers climbing at noon find him asleep, smudged, smiling—quiet testament that miracles are labor. No thematic echo; the insight stays embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close focalization is stable; perceptual signature is mage-math (“droplets fell faster at dawn, slower at dusk, as if the stone itself breathed”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses when bell hums, longer when bay wakes. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-driven (“he reasoned,” “he knew”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“spine of frozen lightning,” “bronze throat split by time and salt”—each image advances stakes or object state. No mixed metaphors; scaffolding trimmed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image (“the viaduct sang back”) that recharges earlier drip motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ecological collapse reversed by drip-rate cryptography and a cracked bell’s resonance. Transforms mage trope into data-divination; transforms “cosmic imbalance” into measurable hydraulic cadence. Risk in quiet ending pays off—ancient sigh beneath waves reweights scale without breaking causality. Specificity of salt-crystallized fracture as tuning interface feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
