<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—grief for the lost crew vs. the need to make silence speak—are dramatized through embodied action (bleeding fingers, breath rhythm) rather than labels. The micro-choice to bleed onto the keys to thaw sound is earned by the heat-map foreshadowing and carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete: “salt in her veins,” not abstract therapy-speak. The Earned Stasis of walking back into the storm with the case forecloses safety and is scaled to length.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: silence is repriced as raw material for music, felt cost is the blood on keys and the open-ended march into the storm. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of frost vs. heat-map threads—held without wobble. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by line 3 inside the conservatory; no debt. One meaningful tightening: frozen air blocks sound → blood/heat-map melts it → winterglass sings. Cost is on-page at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: its frozen panes physically block sound, forcing the tactic of bleeding heat into the frame. Spatial choreography is clean—piano, case, windows track without drift. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and breath under crisis; visual detail is rationed. The final image of the doors swinging open re-weights the space from trap to launch-point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—make silence yield—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: frost thickens → keys stay mute → heat-map burns → glass sings. Agency is continuous: each attempt (exhale, strike, bleed) narrows options until the only path is to walk back into the storm with the instrument. Cost is legible: blood, forfeiture of shelter, open-ended peril.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence ≠ absence but unshaped material. The tuning fork case’s silver threads rewire from archive to tool, reweighting grief into generative force. No final moralizing; the last line is action, not thesis. Subtext resides in gesture—pressing forehead to lid—rather than explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, matching a musician’s perceptual signature: “taut beneath the dust,” “warped and wet, like a voice rising from deep water.” Rhythm modulates from long frost-images to staccato bursts mirroring jagged notes. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression (“world smothered in quiet”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: frost-long sentences vs. fragment bursts under pressure. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent (winterglass, heat-map) without mixed vehicles. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) appear but not in peak beats; closure line is clean. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, causal, and emotional work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: shipwrecked musician uses emotion-stitched heat-map to thaw frozen sound into playable storm. Premise is more than gimmick—threads constrain tactics and reprice silence. Risk of magical thaw is earned by bodily cost (blood) and consistent cold physics. Transformation test fails if case renamed or motive swapped: specificity is baked.</comment>
