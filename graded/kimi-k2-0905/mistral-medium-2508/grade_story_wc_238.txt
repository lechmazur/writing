<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation and regret are vivid, but the apology’s cost is more asserted than dramatized in her body; the final shovel pass is the first physical risk she takes. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward packaged lyricism (“weight of every unsent letter”) that flattens contradiction. Elias’s tremor and acceptance register, but his emotional hierarchy stays off-stage; we never feel what forfeiture hurts him most. Still, the pair’s shared silence carries enough earned history to lift the arc above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty vial and sprouting tendrils reconfigure their options without erasing the orchard’s doom, cost fixed in the scent of sap and pavement. Causal chain holds—accusation → rupture → perfume → joint planting—each beat altering the next. One transition (archive to dawn) is crisp; orientation anchored by line 4. No lens ambiguity; the final hush satisfies the Accumulative/Textural drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Archive air is lived-in—yellowed paper, glove-dust, cold glass—each detail filtering Mara’s vocational eye. The orchard never becomes white-room: falling apple, splitting fruit, pavement-memory keep space tactile even after the trees fall. Micro-setting works: the perfume bottle’s chill against wood cues the first touch of magic, constraining Elias’s choice to dip a finger. Atmosphere modulates from cloying rose to green bite, mirroring the shift from nostalgia to fresh graft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can apology survive public rupture—tightens when the last drop leaves the bottle; no second chance remains. Escalation is textural, not multi-turn: perfume spreads, tendrils thicken, orchard shudders, stakes deepen without reversing. Agency stays bilateral; Mara risks the final of her twilight serum, Elias risks bodily contact. Cost is legible in empty glass and blistered palms at dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of imperfect repair emerges through recurring vegetal metaphors that culminate in pavement-roots; no character sermonizes. Subtext lives in silence—the shovel hand-off carries more contrition than any spoken sorry. Final image reweights the premise: love doesn’t save trees but records their having-been-loved, a conceptual repricing that stings. Ambiguity lingers—city will still pave—yet resonance holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers in Mara’s sensory idiom—gossip ink, silver nib, twilight perfume—without head-hop. Syntax flexes from short percussive lines under tension to longer breaths at dawn, mirroring pulse of magic. Dialogue is sparse but carries indirection (“Stay for the dawn?” answered with a planting condition). No register drift; diction stays within singer-touched archivist lexis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned—liquid twilight, plucked strings—taught early and paid off. One paraphrase loop (“current” metaphor over-worked across three adjacent lines) dulls momentum mid-scene. Otherwise crisp: strong verbs, zero filter stacks, pronouns clean, closing line lands on image, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” is fresh synthesis—public rumor as haunt, perfume as ritual tech—without genre gimmick. Imperfect-miracle rule is stated, demonstrated, and priced on the page. Orchard erasure trope is inverted: victory is memory, not rescue. Risk in lyrical horticultural doom pays off; nothing feels borrowed from central casting.</comment>
