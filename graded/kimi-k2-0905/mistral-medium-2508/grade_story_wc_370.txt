<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s guilt-driven inertia and her empathetic curse are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tracing spines, pressing palm to bookcase). The final decision to lock the door is earned by the mirrored confrontation with Voss and the annotated thesis—cost is visible. Interior contradiction is present but slightly under-played in the staircase beat; still, the arc lands clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: invitation → hidden staircase → mirrored confrontation → annotated thesis → lock the door. Each beat tightens options; the midnight deadline and unlocked rule create persistent constraint. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—she can no longer hide. One transition (bookcase swing) is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Library, bakery steam, and ozone-scented staircase are filtered through Lena’s hyper-attentive guilt. The mirrored chamber functions as micro-setting that literally refracts her identity and forces choice. Brass plaque, ovens, annotated thesis all reappear to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she confront her mistake—tightens when the invitation burns in her pocket and the mirrors refuse to show her face. Agency is exercised twice: ascending the stairs, locking the door. Midnight clock and “never locked” rule create visible price. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—wisdom through refusing to bury error—emerges from the repeated blank page line and the annotated thesis, never sermonized. The nested paradox motif (nest inside egg) reweights at closure without overt statement. Final image of warm bread + locked door offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is obsessive bibliophilic guilt. Syntax lengthens under pressure then fractures in the mirror chamber, mirroring her unraveling. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Voice modulation supports emotional crest without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; paragraph cuts are surgical. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“phantom limbs,” “nest inside the egg”—never clotted. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Opening and closing lines anchor and release with image-driven propulsion. One hairline slip: “quiet hum of the city” is faintly generic, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The living library of unread guilt and the mirror fractal of selves feel fresh yet inevitable. Voss’s posthumous forgiveness via annotated thesis subverts vengeance trope. Risk is taken with surreal mirror chamber, but pattern is taught early through paradox books. Could edge higher with one more specific sensory hook in ovens/bakery axis.</comment>
