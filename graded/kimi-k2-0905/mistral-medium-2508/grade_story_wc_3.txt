<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-pressed curiosity and methodical habits are concretely rendered through tactile beats—brass magnifier, sap stylus, two-day climb—while the interior contradiction (yearning for the lost voice yet mistrusting it) stays active in scene. The final choice to return is credibly foreshadowed by his translator’s reflex to “trace the shape of transition,” so the renunciation carries visible cost. Secondary pressure is minimal (no on-page relationship crucible), and the wife’s reappearance is more closure device than character tension, capping the score just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the inverted Arbor’s blooming flower reweights the entire premise, letting Elias inhabit both love and loss simultaneously. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of “transition” imagery and magnetic micro-choices thickens until the world literally tilts—so the final image’s cost is felt as a bending rather than a causal punch. Orientation is secure by line 4; no teleporting props or late rule changes; the seed’s physics is seeded early and paid off in the bloom. Persistent constraint: the Arbor’s magnetic pull hums throughout, shaping every tool and bodily gesture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magnetic Arbor is not backdrop but tactical obstacle: metal tools tug, ironwood warms, leaves reverse gravity—each trait constrains Elias’s climb and charges the final bloom. Micro-setting inside the brass magnifier and the sap-glowing stylus likewise constrain translation choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys a scholar’s priorities—script before storm, etymology before canopy—so description never drifts into tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the two-day ascent; no impossible positions or weather clichés.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the physics of leaving”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the seed must be planted in the crown. One meaningful reversal: wind reverses, leaves ascend, gravity bends; this deepening reweights the stake from scholarly decipherment to embodied transition. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—Elias forfeits the fantasy of undoing death for the poise of double vision—but the price is legible in the final image. Agency is present but gentle; a more kinetic test of commitment could have pushed the score into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the negative space of translation: every attempt to “reestablish” a voice reveals that meaning lives in the bending, not the fixing. Subtext operates in gesture—the wife’s blank tablet handed to a man who no longer needs it—rather than assertion. The closing insight “some doors only open when you stop knocking” is earned through the physical act of letting the flower bloom, not stated as moral. Ambiguity is preserved: the vision may be real, metaphor, or both, yet the emotional aftereffect—acceptance of irreversible doubleness—lands undeniably.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s scholar-sensorium: diction favors “cipher,” “invocation,” “negative space,” never exceeding a translator’s lexicon. Rhythm mirrors methodical patience—long anaphoric cadences in climb description, then clipped fragments at the tilt—showing control without mannerism. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged solely through internal coherence, which holds. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; perceptual signature is consistent—he “reads” wind reversal as script.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “roots tangled in the storm-wracked heavens” does triple sensory-physics-worldbuilding work. No mixed metaphors; magnetic bloom obeys its own logic. Minor scaffolding: “like the fingers of a god” is a lone stock simile, but it occurs early and does not recur. Final paragraph achieves crystalline closure without overwriting; the blank tablet image recharges earlier tablets with zero paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The inverted magnetic arbor plus cuneiform seed is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable post-bloom. Risk—quiet lyric closure instead of spectacle—heightens thematic coherence. No recognizable template or pop-culture echo; the “physics of leaving” reframes portal fantasy as epistemic grief work. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
