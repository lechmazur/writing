<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—craving proof yet fearing the water—are alive in the scene: her thumb bleeds on the shell while she climbs to the ledger. The cast-reading beat crystallizes her stunt-trained pattern-recognition as a usable weapon, not backstory. Interiority stays concrete, no therapy-speak. Final stance—ledger under arm, fear still real—earns its cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: smudged cast → decrypt → ledger → proof → walk-out. The shell’s whisper is the hinge that converts pattern-recognition into agency; no off-stage luck resolves the core problem. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—she leaves the library bleeding and still water-afraid. One micro-turn, cleanly landed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rusted library is sketched with selective, POV-filtered detail—“warped bookshelf,” “iron shelves sagging like old bones”—and the atlas slot functions as a micro-setting that constrains the final discovery. Stars overhead mirror the ledger’s “constellation” of erased names, charging the exit image. Spatial choreography stays clean through ladder climb and shelf reach. No filler exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove she exists—tightens when the shell names her the “better performer,” turning shame into tactical fuel. The decrypt moment narrows options: only the ledger can convert silence into evidence, and obtaining it demands the bleed. Cost is visible (blood, stolen book, still-raw aquaphobia) and shapes the final stride into night. One meaningful escalation, lens-true.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal that vulnerability—bleeding on a shell, admitting erasure—becomes the weapon that overturns the system. No character sermonizes; the insight is compressed into the final image of riding fear like a current. Subtext sits in the crayon smudge: children inherit adult lies. Ledger as proof keeps the moral complexity messy—no tidy justice, just evidence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is muscular, stunt-performer precise: “pressure here, pivot there” echoes in her fingers tracing the cast. Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses as the guard approaches; longer, image-rich lines in the ladder beat. No filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is minimal but age-specific (“Told you”) and carries subtext. Free-indirect slips cleanly in/out without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “The title mocked her” advances theme, reveals history, tightens stakes). Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence runs. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“sky thick with stars” mirrors ledger’s name-cluster. Minor paraphrase loop on “adaptation” concept (−0.2) but does not touch closure. Clean proofing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Identity-theft via stunt-double shell ledger is a fresh synthesis; the crayon-on-cast decryption method feels specific to stunt-pattern cognition. Risk taken in letting a child catalyze the turn pays off without cute contrivance. Proximity check: no close pop-culture echoes. Could swap genre skin, but the emotional core—erased body reclaims proof through its own flaw—stays particular.</comment>
