<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The knight’s muteness and armor-weld function as lived, embodied costs; the final smile burns. Interiority stays sensory—metal whispers, paper warm like skin—never abstract. Yet we get no contradictory want (he never considers keeping silent) so the arc is linear, not torn. Still, the renunciation lands with felt price: shadows pour from the gauntlet and the stage invites him—an Earned Stasis that hurts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the unsnap rewrites prior siege memory from audience refusal to performer assent, wings of thread replacing chains. Causal lens holds—because he broke the seal, therefore the greenhouse exhales and the stage appears. Orientation is taught by word 60 (“alchemical orchard”) and the pattern of folding/timelessness is signaled early, waiving any penalty. Cost is indelible: the gauntlet splits, shadows escape, voice returns with “holy fire” pain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-moment constrains every move: glass panes weep, plants trace sigils, the knight cannot exit until he unsnaps. Micro-setting (armor seam, program paper) doubles as tool and terrain, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight—silverleaf, ozone, old roses—each returned in the exhale. Spatial logic stays intact: trellis → stem → clasp → stage line-of-sight remains traceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: break silence or remain withdrawn; the tightening is the gauntlet seal that must break for any option to advance. One meaningful turn—unsnap—immediately reconfigures reality from wound to stage. Under causal lens, agency is decisive: his fingers twist the clasp, shadows exit, threads become wings. Cost is visceral: metal groans, ozone scent, smile that “hurt like holy fire.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of siege-as-performance: refusal to applaud becomes the vow that restarts the show. Subtext lives in objects—program ink darker than ink, moths singing instead of screaming—never exposition. Final image (curtains part to empty dark) answers the central question: allegiance was never to silence but to the shape after. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to the knight’s perceptual filter: “metal whispering,” “color no human eye had named.” Syntax warps under pressure—sentence fragments mirror the *UNSNAP* command. No dialogue, so voice purity is total; diction (“rotten silk,” “sigils,” “hungry”) is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Rhythm accelerates into the final line without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence layers image + motion + meaning: “blossom shivered… into half-remembered oath.” No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (sky as silk, threads as manacles then wings). One clause drifts toward ornate (“echo of a color no human eye had named”) but the excess is brief and pattern-taught. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breath to staccato final sentence, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy siege reframed as involuntary participatory theater is fresh; the moth-banners dissolving into prompt-applause is unforgettable. Integration is organic—no tropes checked, every image grows from the knight’s silence. Risk of recursive meta-theater could collapse into gimmick, but the emotional burn of the smile anchors it. Specificity (“greenish patina of neglect,” “paper warm as if just held”) prevents abstraction.</comment>
