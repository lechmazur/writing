<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—writing futures yet trapped by the past—but the cost of conducting the unheard silence is gestured at more than performed. Micro-choices (ink, shell rotation, balcony pause) track clearly, yet the emotional fulcrum relies on lyric assertion (“second skin,” “when not a place”) rather than a beat where refusing to write would hurt. The arc moves from prophecy to performance, but the final conducting is still wish; we don’t feel what he forfeits if the city stops listening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: arms lifted, ice groaning, silence poised to become music—cost is the city’s impatience and his exposure to cold that could freeze the song un-sung. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mirrored surfaces (lake, spire, shell) teaches the logic early and reweights at the end when the horizon fractures into refracted hours. Only micro-softness: the courier knock is a false tightening that dissipates without altering tactics; still, the final image reconfigures stakes, earning its resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, rice-paper ink, and nautilus fracture form a tactile micro-setting that literally channels sound and light; each object is handled, turned, or pressed, so environment steers choice. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5—no orientation penalty. The mirrored horizon is not backdrop; it splits dawn into audible pressure that forces the conducting gesture. Specificity is high, but one slip—“tasted of ice and old electricity” drifts toward brochure—holds it sub-9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake: transform private prophecy into public music before exile by silence. Escalation is textural: each mirrored fracture intensifies the audible absence, culminating in the balcony stance where performance becomes irreversible. Cost is legible—exposure, courier impatience, potential ridicule—yet the tightening could be sharper; we never see a fortune actually fail or a reader confront him, so the price feels prospective rather than paid. Still, agency is entirely his: write, climb, conduct.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: home is a temporal score one must conduct to keep alive. Subtext works through acoustic imagery—shell, sewing machine, splitting ice—so meaning stays sonic rather than stated. The final image answers the central question without moral: silence is not emptiness but unperformed time. Only restraint from overt lyric thesis in last paragraph keeps it from higher band; the idea is felt, not told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Free-indirect lyricism stays tightly inside Li Wei’s perceptual filter: metaphors are acoustic, verbs are percussive (hummed, groaned, chuk-chuk-chuk). Rhythm modulates—short declarative beats under 3 a.m. fatigue, then elongated clauses as dawn swells. No head-hop; compression (“homesickness wasn’t a place but a when”) is taught early and paid off. Register spikes once—“conceptual Repricing” risk of overt thesis—is quickly re-grounded in shell-shadow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and sensory density are high; most lines do double duty (ink bleeding into treble clef shape). One scaffold lapse: “the weight of what he hadn’t yet written” is immediately restated as “the silence is not empty,” a near-paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles—and diction stays within a fortune-writer’s idiom. Final line breathes cleanly, satisfying the read-aloud ear, but the loop costs a tenth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing meteorological optics with musical vocation feels fresh; mirrored horizon as overture is non-obvious. Risk in quiet ending is earned. Cats-on-rooftop anecdote and reservoir relocation ground the concept in specific memory, preventing abstraction. Still, the “oracle hired by the city” premise flirts with fabulist convenience; we aren’t shown the bureaucratic interface, so the world logic strains slightly. Transformation test passes—story collapses without Li Wei’s acoustic map of exile.</comment>
