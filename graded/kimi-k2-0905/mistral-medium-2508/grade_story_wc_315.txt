<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers on worn brass, heartbeat as clock—while her contradictory twin imperatives (trust no one / preserve trust) tighten every choice. The micro-choice sequence *left-right-pause-twist* dramatizes her hierarchy of values under pressure and forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: the buckle’s weight on wrist and pocket, the boot-prints she leaves behind. Only the twelve-year gap in the mentor’s voice is asserted, not dramatized, a hairline unmotivated leap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the city wakes to *“absence of a disaster it never knew was coming,”* a reconfiguration of meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (arbor, spores, buckle, radio static) tightens until the final image reweights trust itself. Causality holds: each beat—radio cue, muscle-memory revision, silent descent—flows *because/therefore* to the landing. The Orientation Test is waived; initial mist-disorientation is taught early and pays off in the final shimmer of spores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arbor functions as micro-setting: its sway, height, and bioluminescent spores directly constrain her launch window and camouflage the landing. Tool-body-environment triad—buckle wrist-strap, branch curvature, dew that never falls—charges every motion. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices ozone shift before city lights, ignores visual skyline until clouds part. Final shimmer of spores on wind is a reweighted environmental echo of the choice just made.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the prototype from weaponization—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened by the silent descent that forbids radio reply. One meaningful deepening: clouds part to reveal curfew-emptied city, making the moral cost of silence visceral. Agency is renunciation; she *“didn’t answer”* the radio, accepting eternal isolation as price. Cost is legible on-page: boot-prints in damp earth, shimmer of spores she can never reclaim.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: trust as a parachute you pack yourself, silence as civic mercy. Subtext resides in gesture—radio left unanswered, buckle tucked away—never stated. Final image of city waking to *“static”* reweights earlier motif of radio voice without moralizing. No redundant thematic echo; the pattern *“soundless echo”* is lived, not labeled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: *“spaces between sounds,”* *“weight of absence,”* *“lattice of pressure points.”* Rhythm modulates—long lyric sentences aloft, staccato micro-actions on branch—mirroring altitude and risk. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (*“she noticed ozone”*) not dilution. Final whisper *“pattern isn’t in the noise”* crystallizes idiom without ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—arbor as ship, canopy as held breath—without mixed-vehicle crash. High density: *“branches heavy with dew that never fell”* does world-rule, mood, and foreshadow in nine words. Only hairline slip: *“skeletal glow”* edges toward stock, but saved by specificity of curfew-emptied streets.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bioluminescent arbor as drop-site, radio static as clock, parachute buckle as heirloom trust-meter—none are trope defaults. Risk of silent protagonist in soundless world pays off; voice never retreats to exposition. City wakes to *absence of disaster* is a conceptual repricing rarely seen. Could swap mentor gender or city name without structural change, keeping the −0.4 within-band adjustment.</comment>
