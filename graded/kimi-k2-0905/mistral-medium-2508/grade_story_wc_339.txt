<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Liora’s analytic nature is dramatized in the way she handles the globe and files the lie, but her interiority drifts into label-speak (“physics of letting go”) and the sister photo is pure exposition; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene, and the final “letting go” is asserted rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Earned Stasis—she lies and pockets the notebook, paying the cost of silence—but the missing Orientation Test (who/where not anchored until after p.1) slightly blurs the lens, and the Electra’s “holes from something passing through” is a late rule change not seeded earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The drowned library is tactile—warped mahogany, bloated books, brass ghosts—each detail filtered through Liora’s salvage eye; the snow globe’s counter-clockwise snow and the sub’s porthole bioluminescence constrain her epistemic stance and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate though the ship’s larger layout remains sketchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—understand Amelia’s threshold—tightens when the globe’s upward snow forces the realization that light has a shadow-cost; agency is intellectual (note the lie) rather than active, and the price is conceptual, felt on the page, but the escalation is one-step, not iterative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of threshold-as-loss emerges from the globe, notebook marginalia, and the lighthouse keeper’s dissolve; no overt thesis is stated, and the final image of sideways snow reweights the premise, though the sister photograph is a loose thread that never loops back to charge the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains a controlled, melancholic cadence; perceptual signature is exact—inked desk grain, cold globe against visor—without filter-verb bloat; compression like “ghosts of light” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the sideways-snow coda.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density, varied rhythm, and minimal scaffold; figurative language is selective (“sugar in tea”), but the phrase “cost of light” recycles four times and the final “the sea, finally, was quiet” edges toward poetic overstatement, keeping this just outside the 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The snow-globe-as-quantum-fold, Earhart-as-fold-seeker, and drowned quantum library synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious angle on disappearance myths; risk-taking (upward snow, sideways snow) is coherent under the accumulative lens and reconfigures the horizon trope with conceptual cost.</comment>
