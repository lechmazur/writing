<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—"their fingers brushing the damp earth as if it were a pulse"—and the contradiction between parental duty and the need to let vows fall is active in every beat. The final gesture of tying the ribbon around their own wrist crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices (digging, biting the apple) trace a clear hierarchy of values. Only the daughter remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is implied, not dramatized; still, the ache is palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the seed sprouting at the exact instant the mender whispers the question reweights the entire rule-set of vows and silence. The ribbon’s migration from branch to wrist is the on-page cost, making the before/after legible. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of cracks, roots, ribbon, seed—taught early and paid off in the final image. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (loam, rose-window light) are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard-as-cathedral is not postcard scenery: the apple boughs sagging through broken marble literally determine where the mender can dig and where light bends for the seed. Micro-setting objects—ribbon, trowel, doll—constrain tactics (they dig with the trowel, bind the ribbon, leave the doll as cradle). Sensory selection is POV-driven: the smell of forgiveness, the pulse under loam. The final image of the sprout pointing at the ribbon is charged by the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the mender re-bind or release the vow—tightens when the seed’s sprout answers the whispered question, foreclosing silence. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of ribbon/roots/apple intensifies the cost of persisting in the old vow. The apple bite is the visible price, acid against the tongue as irrevocable as ink once was. Agency is renunciation rather than explosion, perfectly scaled to 700-word lyric space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the living metaphor of deciduous vows—leaves, apples, ribbon, seed—without a single explicit thesis. The final image reconfigures the concept: vows don’t break, they compost. Subtext in the daughter’s jagged note—"ask me again why I left"—carries the accusation that the parent taught escape but couldn’t read their own cracks. Emotional aftereffect is bittersweet humility, earned through tactile particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers at poetic distance, filtering every detail through the mender’s synesthetic perception—earth as pulse, forgiveness as scent. Syntax stretches into litany under pressure ("Not for treasure, not for bones...") then snaps to short declaratives at the bite, mirroring breath control. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal—memory of daughter’s “endearingly feisty” syntax versus mender’s more formal grief. Compression is patterned and taught early; elision ("three years since...") is paid off in the sprout.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long, vine-like sentences to urgent fragments without algorithmic repetition. Metaphors are disciplined—"roots tangled through cracked marble like veins stitching wound to wound"—and stay within physical logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Opening and closing lines are propulsive, the final "They’d ask her about the stitches next time" leaving a charged echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The "deciduous vows" conceit feels inevitable only after the seed sprouts—risky delay that pays off. Orchard reclaiming a cathedral is fresh, yet grows from character need rather than spectacle. The ribbon’s migration from taunt to self-wounding bracelet transforms a familiar object without gimmickry. Emotional specificity—parent taught escape but couldn’t read child’s cracks—avoids generic reconciliation arc.</comment>
