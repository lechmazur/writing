<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. yearning—are alive in every micro-choice; the amber fly’s dissolve into her veins literalizes the cost of belief. Interiority avoids label-speak; her father’s trembling hands moment is specific, embodied, and motivates the final assent. The earned renunciation (she goes, never returns) carries visible price under the Accumulative lens. Only the figure’s dialogue slips toward allegorical convenience, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the galaxy-path reweights “homecoming” from hoax to invitation, cost legible in the twin footprints on the door. Causal linkage holds: amber → footprints → terminal question → galaxy → dissolve. Mosaic pattern (tower shards) is taught by 25 % and lands under one lens. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clean by line 3; no ambiguity at end. The −0.1 is for the slightly outline-like “It’s your turn” beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tower skin, ivy-swallowed sculptures, and rain-bronze smell are filtered through Elara’s scientific gaze; each sensory pick constrains her path (she touches, reads, smells her way forward). The spiral galaxy is rendered as micro-setting inside her ribs—setting becomes tool that charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from base to door to terminal. No environment-forcing; every detail either limits action or reconfigures meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—validate or refute the pilgrimage hypothesis—tightens when the terminal asks “What do you miss?” and forecloses the academic safe route. Agency is continuous: she chooses to follow weightless prints, to touch the galaxy, to leave Earth. Cost is felt: body dissolution, exile, lab left dusty. Under Accumulative lens the cadence shift (rain → star call) reweights the stake with undeniable price; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges as science = language of faith, not its enemy. Subtext operates through inverted motifs: the “crutch for the faithless” equation is erased yet fulfilled when E=mc²… + (memory) appears. No final-paragraph thesis; the star that remembers her hands is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—she may be consumed or translated—creating honest complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Single-POV interior texture is scientist-cool, synesthetic: ozone, spiral frequencies in ribs. Compression (“voice like rain on bronze”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from external observation to corporeal fusion. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at galaxy touch. Distinct perceptual signature holds under stress; final diction remains within Elara’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. High density: “tower’s stone skin slick with memory” does triple sensorial, metaphoric, thematic work. Metaphors stay coherent (rain on bronze, galaxy as homes). No register drift; scientific diction is POV-true. Final line “They remembered the shape of her hands” is crisp, propulsive, charged. One near-purple phrase “stars… homes” is justified by pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Takes the trope of alien-first-contact and flips it into cosmic homesickness; the pilgrimage is reversed—humans are the returning exiles. Amber fly re-enters as biotech key, not relic. Risky lyric structure paid off by closure legibility. Specificity of “rainwashed tower” anchors the universal. Synthesis feels inevitable: science-faith fusion grows from Elara’s lived contradiction. No close echoes; voice is singular.</comment>
