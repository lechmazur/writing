<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—her refusal to view her own reflection crystallizes the cost of her trade—but the borrowed heartbeat never manifests as bodily tension or micro-choice; it stays abstract. The final renunciation is earned, yet the soldier’s off-stage ache is told, not shown through her. Still, her stillness-as-grace reads as a consistent, character-specific ritual under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror slips away, foreclosing self-knowledge while the city’s need persists—cost is felt in the fading rainbows and empty pockets. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored possibility subtracts from another, tightening the ethical noose without causal reversals. The borrowed heartbeat’s price is legible in the aching ribs we never see but are told must ache; a hairline deduction for that off-stage tell.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The prism parapet refracts dying light into fractured rainbows that literally color every beat; the terrace’s wet stone guides Liora’s barefoot stillness and the final slide of the mirror. Spring air and cathedral bells function as a live clock, forcing her exit. Environment, body, and tool converge to charge the last image—no rainbows, no song—making the absence a felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“show me my son as he could be”—tightens when Liora realizes every possibility she paints steals from another; the cadence shift occurs as the heartbeat begins to unravel in her palm. Agency is renunciation: she drops the mirror before it can show her own face, narrowing her future to perpetual self-erasure. Cost is visible in the peeling silver of the cracked mirror and the hush that swallows her footsteps.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the moral algebra of borrowed futures: every consolation for one mother is a wound in a stranger’s dream. The final image—terrace empty of rainbows—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the coded lullabies bent sharp for the desperate; the reader carries the ghost song away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Liora’s perceptual filter: rainbows bleed, heartbeats seep like mist, bells swallow light. Syntax lengthens then fragments to mimic the mirror’s cloud-clear cycle. No head-hopping; every metaphor is motived by her craft—glass, light, song—creating a singular, irreplaceable voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the prism parapet refracting the dying light into fractured rainbows that bled across the damp flagstones” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, cost, or stakes. A single mixed vehicle—“ghost of his fear”—is minor enough not to dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mirage-painter who trades in stolen heartbeats and coded lullabies feels wholly new; the magic system is implied through ritual, not explained. The terrace-as-prism and the refusal of self-reflection synthesize into a fresh moral geometry. Risk lies in the quiet ending—no twist, only absence—yet it pays off by reconfiguring the reader’s sense of wonder and complicity.</comment>
