<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lysander’s contradictory impulses—boredom vs. the fragment’s seductive unknown—are alive in every beat; dropping the fragment is a micro-choice that costs him the last anchor of self-continuity. The copper vein he pockets is the visible, felt price of renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“weightless, dimensionally aware”) without label-speak. One hairline slip: “immortal” is stated not shown in the first 60 words, but later texture compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the escondite dissolves into a question and Lysander’s goodbye becomes the first honest utterance—cost is the fragment’s vanishing and the copper vein’s pulsing reminder. Causal lens holds: dropping the fragment → spatial mutiny collapses place → immortal is everywhere/no-where. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation; anchors arrive by word 80 and serve the final image, so Orientation Test waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The prismatic escondite is not backdrop but active antagonist—gravity flickers, corridor breathes, walls peel back—each environmental shift alters Lysander’s tactical options. Micro-setting (fractal-ice pillar, copper-veined fragment) doubles as tool and body extension, constraining the final release. Sensory hierarchy obeys immortal perception: color-knives, magnetic surges, dimension-flips. Final sky-sea-void recharges every prior visual motif, cementing 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—what happens when an immortal finally lets go—tightens once: the fragment’s curse offers exit, corridor demands decision, void exacts the price. Escalation is accumulative: each magnetic pulse deepens spatial mutiny until geometry capitulates. Cost is visible on-page: fragment lost, identity diffused, copper vein left as perpetual reminder. No secondary reversals needed; single deepening satisfies lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: goodbye as the only authentic act an eternal can perform. Subtext lives in gesture—hand opening, fragment not falling but expanding—rather than exposition. Final image reweights “immortal” from curse to continuum, re-pricing identity as diffuse yet sentient. No tidy moral; resonance lingers in copper pulse and void footstep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is singular, lyric-philosophic, compressed: “geometry gone feral,” “sky that was also a sea that was also the space between breaths.” Syntax warps with spatial mutiny—fragments, em-dashes, elliptical clauses—yet stays legible. Perceptual signature is immortal-specific: stars learning to die, marrow of infinite years. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; rhythmic control heightens pressure without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or stakes. High density: “walls shifting between violet and bruise-blue” fuses color + motion + danger in one stroke. No register drift; diction stays within immortal lexicon. Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentence swells, then clipped fragment “He dropped the fragment.” Closure sentence is clean, propulsive, image-locked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of high-concept cosmology with intimate emotional arc feels inevitable post-read: spatial mutiny as metaphor for immortal self-dissolution is non-obvious yet grounded. Risk—lyric collapse of setting into void—pays off by recharging every prior visual. Copper vein as remnant of curse is specific, not generic token. Synthesis transcends prompt parts into singular vision.</comment>
