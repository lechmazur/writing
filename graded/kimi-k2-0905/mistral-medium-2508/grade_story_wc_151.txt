<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; her “carefully inventive” label never concretely collides with a contradictory impulse or visible cost. The final mailbox beat is acceptance, not renunciation, so the “earned stasis” feels light—no path is foreclosed on-page. She remains a competent cipher rather than a person risking something we can touch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: neon–dust–chalk–ink density builds to the soft *thunk* of envelope drop, re-weighting anonymity as tactile ritual. Closure is a Charged Poise: the name is gone, future is open, cost is the faint absence in Lena’s palm. No orientation debt; transitions are clean single-scene. The price is present but thin—no persistent constraint or ripple follows the letter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Golden arcade at dawn is a living filter: chrome reflections, chalk grit under thumbnail, mailbox hinge squeak—all steer Lena’s micro-moves. The clipboard’s flex-screen and rice-paper envelope act as micro-settings that physically constrain procedure. Light glare at the end mirrors the over-brightness of giving a name away. Spatial choreography never slips; every object is handled, not displayed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“deliver the right name”—tightens once: from algorithm list to manual tweak to envelope sealed. Agency is present but low-temperature; the tightening is cognitive, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (loss of authorship) yet never jeopardizes her safety or resources; pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Enough for accumulative escalation, but borderline lightweight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of anonymity-as-craft emerges through chalk dust, rice-paper bleed, and the pause before mailbox lid falls. No explicit thesis, yet the reader feels the quiet transaction: identity is both artifact and gift. Final image of “edges of things” reconfigures earlier neon margins without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—meaning stays offshore, untranslated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close stays consistently inside Lena’s perceptual orbit: neon ghosts as half-remembered dreams, chalk grit like static. Syntax is supple—parallel fragments, tactile nouns—mirroring her cataloguing mind. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts smoothly to the envelope *thunk*. Voice never explains its metaphors, trusting the reader to feel the analogue ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long sensory coils and crisp verb-driven clauses, propelling the procedural pace. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—each image (neon ghosts, binary dust) is anchored to Lena’s tool-based worldview. No scaffold loops; every paragraph advances choice or texture. Minor over-pack in “chrome-and-glass skeleton” but it clears before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—name-forgery via retro analog rituals inside a retro-futurist arcade—feels fresh, not template. Low-tech dead-drop (sidewalk chalk) intersects with high-tech etymology engine, creating a specific cultural pocket. Risk is quiet: no chase, no violence, yet the story bets everything on the hush of a mailbox. Freshness dips slightly because “disappearing into a new name” is a known trope, but the tactile execution rescues it.</comment>
