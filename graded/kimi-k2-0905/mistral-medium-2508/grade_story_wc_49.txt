<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to safe stories while fearing the real songs—drives every beat; the cracked first note and burning throat embody cost. The micro-choice to keep singing even as her chest tightens crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Her shift from tinkerer to “keeper of songs” is earned by prior causal beats (pulse under palm, vines stirring). No safety-hedging; flaws actively complicate the climax.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: each sung phrase tightens the arbor’s response, narrowing failure risk until the living arch forms. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—burnt throat, heavier gourd, communal duty accepted. The hummingbird automaton’s return re-prices her old craft under the new covenant. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored in first 60 words.</comment>

<comment>The arbor is not backdrop but actor: soil pulse, stretching-silk tendrils, scent of ripe earth all feed the causal loop. Copper-winged automaton functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it perches on her shoulder, literalizing old tools under new vocation. Sensory selection stays POV-bound—Mira notices gear-oil and leaf-gold in proportion to her twin devotions. Spatial choreography clean; no floating vines or impossible positions.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—arbor survival—signaled in first paragraph and intensifies with every sung syllable. One meaningful tightening: the moment she feels the heartbeat slowing, silence becomes an existential threat; song becomes the only tactic left. Cost is visceral (burned throat, trembling fingers) and conceptual (lifetime avoidance abandoned). No coincidence; escalation is purely because/therefore linkage under song-as-key.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of safety: stories kept her safe, songs demand vulnerability. The final whispered promise “Next year, we’ll sing louder” offers non-literal resonance—no moral stated, yet the social cost of communal memory is undeniable. Recurring copper/gold motif reweights from mechanical art to living covenant. Avoids pseudo-profundity; wisdom stays rooted in soil-scented particulars.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—brass gears, leaf-gold, cracked note. Rhythm accelerates with shorter units during song-release, mirroring pulse. Diction stays within village tinkerer lexicon; no register drift. Automaton’s chirp functions as indirection—question, not exposition. No head-hopping; camera never leaves her shoulder.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; opening long sentence liquefies into shorter breaths as song climbs. Figurative language is selective—“liquid gold,” “moon’s cradle”—and never clusters in high-pressure beats. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image, sound, or causality. Strong verbs (twitched, plumped, wove) replace modifiers. Only micro-slip: “heartbeat slowing” borders cliché but is saved by tactile palm anchor.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar “save the grove” arc is retooled through song-as-mechanism and tinkerer–bard identity fusion. Copper automaton sidekick freshes standard nature-magic trope. Specificity of “spun copper wings catching dawn” makes the image memorable rather than ornamental. Risk taken: no antagonist except silence; pressure is purely internal–cosmic, yet coherence holds.</comment>
