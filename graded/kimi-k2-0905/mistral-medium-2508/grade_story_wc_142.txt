<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira’s double loyalty is vivid—the brass cuff and stolen chip are constant tactile reminders—and her spray-paint choices externalise the split. Interiority is concrete (“gnawed at her”, “chest tightened”). The final stance crystallises with cost: she forfeits mainland order for Lumina’s chaos, but the chip’s insertion into wet paint is more emblematic than causally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she stole the chip therefore she can embed it in the mural; because the mural encodes instructions the carnival can keep shifting. Orientation anchors (raft city, night before surveyors) land by line 5. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chip Monument re-weights the developers’ blueprint, tangible cost felt as “they’ll see it as vandalism”.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory triangulation is tight—acrid dough, swaying walkways, neon flicker—and the perpetual carnival is lived-in (mask-touching child, generators’ hum). The brass cuff and spray can function as micro-setting, constraining her dexterity mid-tag. The closing image of reflected lights on water reprises the city’s fluid ontology, charging the final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Lumina’s survival versus developers—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when surveyors’ arrival clock starts. One meaningful deepening: embedding the blueprint chip into the mural turns passive guilt into active sabotage, foreclosing return to mainland neutrality. Cost is visible: surveillance risk rises, paint still wet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete tension between fluid time (carnival’s eternal now) and mainland clockwork without sermon. Final image of “scattered promises” refracts earlier kite lanterns, reweighting the premise: order is a cage, drift is freedom. No abstract thesis stated; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elira; perceptual signature is metallic, gear-driven (“brass cuff whirring”, “paint hissed”). Syntax lengthens under pressure—periodic spray-can actions interrupt longer reflective clauses—mirroring pulse of graffiti strokes. Jax’s single voiced line carries working-class cadence; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can set, act, and emotion (“She’d pried it loose… burned like a guilty secret”). Occasional modifier stacks (“labyrinthine charm”, “sterile grids”) flirt with overwriting but stay within POV lexicon. No loops; rhythm rises toward staccato final paragraph, matching urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating gentrifying carnival is fresh; encoding resistance in graffiti map-mythos rather than protest march avoids cliché. The blueprint-chip relic turns developers’ own geology against them—an inversion that feels inevitable after setup. Risk: hopeful desperation tone could slide to sentiment, but grounded sensory detail keeps it earned.</comment>
