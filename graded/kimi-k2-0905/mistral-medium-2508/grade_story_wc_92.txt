<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s lock-savant competence is vivid and embodied; the bronze quill-holder pick-work shows micro-choices under risk. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of final cost is slightly under-dramatized—he “adjusts gloves and whistles” rather than registering irreversible exposure. Still, the earned shift from guardian to saboteur is legible and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: blackout → dial alignment → hatch → armory → signal → dawn escape; each beat narrows options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—fort’s grip broken, Kael exiled into “just another shadow.” Orientation crisp within 60 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silvered walls, trapped-light orbs, half-painted sundial—selective sensory triad that doubles as tactical map. The sundial’s coded angles physically constrain Kael’s timing, qualifying for 9+ gate, though environmental pressure could bite even tighter into his skin in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate valley by neutralizing siege engines—signaled early and tightened through each lock conquered. One meaningful escalation: armory bolt surrender that forecloses retreat. Cost visible in the lit parchment flare that seals Kael’s outlaw status. Could use one more micro-loss (tool fatigue? noise risk?) to hit top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silent systemic subversion emerges via lock-picking imagery and “cradle of sparks” refrain—no moralizing. Final whistle and child’s laughter reweight the premise: revolutions start not with banners but with lullabies. Ambiguity lingers on what replaces Veythar’s light, keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s tactile perceptions; diction metallic, rhythmic, mirroring lock tumblers. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“A breath.”). Distinct voice sustained; minor cadence repetition in “then” clauses but never clouds closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances gear or stakes. Figurative control strong (“fort clung like a lantern left burning too long”). A few near-adjacent participles (“His boots made no sound… revealing…”) create micro-simultaneity, but clarity intact. Zero loops or scaffold; earns read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy fortress revolt is familiar, yet lock-craft as revolutionary poetry feels fresh; sundial-cipher and light-orbs supply specific world logic. Transformation test passes—story collapses without Kael’s locksmith expertise. Risk taken in quiet, single-spark climax; pays off via resonant reconfiguration rather than spectacle.</comment>
