<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s hunger for serenity-through-sway is embodied in every micro-action (seed stolen, petal pressed into journal). Contradictory impulses—obedience vs. trespass—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation of stillness in favor of sway is earned by the corpse-flower mirror and costs her Elder approval; the tactile petal in the journal is the visible price. No safety-hedging: her flaws (obsessive precision, olfactory vanity) enable both the theft and the insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bridge strung with corpse-flower vines reweights “wisdom” into communal trust; cost is the irrevocable sharing of once-forbidden scent. Causal chain (seed theft → bloom → mirror → bridge) holds under Causal lens; each beat tightens options. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Final image reuses “sway” now charged with embrace, not threat—persistent constraint shaping future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is micro-setting done large: the swaying bridge itself becomes the charged object that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is character-specific—Liora’s nose edits the world; salt, bark, rot arrive only when they carry information. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms. The village’s vertical geography is learned through action (vault, balcony, new bridge) and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can serenity exist inside motion?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the bloom mirrors sway instead of halting it. Agency drives escalation: stealing seed, inhaling mirror, plucking petal, hanging bridge—each act narrows retreat back to Elder stillness. Visible price: the bloom’s public scent strips her privacy; the unlocked vault formalizes permanent loss of exclusivity. Cost is legible on-page in the violet ink bleed and the villagers’ silent permission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of “stillness = peace” to “sway = embrace.” No explicit moralizing; the final line is an image, not a lesson. Recurring doodle language (loops, leaves) and scent vocabulary weave into the mirror motif, re-priced when the bridge becomes a shared invitation. Ambiguity remains: the village may now overdose on wisdom—complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Liora’s olfactory conscience; no head-hop. Syntax coils like smoke—long sentences for inhalation, fragments for beat-timed steals. Diction never exceeds an herbalist’s sensorium; “olfactorily” is the only Latinate outlier and reads as self-diagnosis, justified by her precision obsession. Rhythm accelerates with tide-turn lines, then decants into the quiet final sentence that re-prices “sway.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often delivers scent, emotional state, and world rule (“scent coiled like smoke, then paused as the village’s central bell tolled”). No filter-verb clusters; metaphors stay physical and consistent. Single loop spotted—“sway” repeated three times in closing paragraph—but is purposeful repricing, not artifact. Closure image is uncluttered, propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar “steal forbidden wisdom” arc is transmuted through olfactory choreography and the inversion that wisdom = shared mirror, not hidden truth. Treetop village feels specific—bridges as tidal lungs, vault as scent-locked throat. Risk in letting antagonist (Elders) dissolve into complicity pays off: the unlocked vault is a collective character beat. Fresh synthesis makes the inevitable ending—communal sway—feel discovered rather than imposed.</comment>
