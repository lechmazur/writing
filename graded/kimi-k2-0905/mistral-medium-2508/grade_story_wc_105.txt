<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his nightly return to the greenhouse, the haptic memory of scars hissing against cooling copper—but his motives (“absences,” “trust breaking”) remain abstract. The contradiction between clinical day-job precision and messy nocturnal imprints is sharp, yet the stakes of losing/renaming trust never tighten into a single, testable choice; the ending’s renunciation is more atmospheric than earned. Still, his perceptual signature (violet hum of rust, aurora as banner for the drowned) is specific enough to lift him above silhouette.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each imprint layers density until the copper finale reweights meaning. Anchors clear by line 4; orientation test waived because disorientation serves the lyric closure. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias pockets the warm copper, wades into tide, aurora fills absences—cost is felt in the scars hissing under water. One tight micro-turn: metal *remembering* rather than melting re-codes the forge from loss-machine to memory-press.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glass panes “sagged like held breath,” submarine “crushed spine,” coal’s last embers reflecting in the wrecks—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s acoustical obsessions. Micro-setting (copper shard, anvil pit) constrains the final choice when he grips the searing metal. Spatial choreography holds as water rises ankle-to-knee; no floating props. Atmosphere marries rust-salt decay with aurora spectacle, mirroring internal corrosion without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Elias *hear* trust breaking before the greenhouse drowns? Pressure escalates via accretion—each imprinted absence loads the forge until the copper refuses entropy. No external antagonist; tension is temporal (tide) and conceptual (metal memory). Final cost: he forsakes naming/owning the absences and lets aurora drown them—choice forecloses future imprints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through tactile paradox: absence has weight, rust has voice, trust erodes rather than shatters. Subtext in gesture—extinguishing forge with bare hands—outsources grief to body. No moralizing; finalimage of ribboned sky re-prices earlier aurora-as-banner without commentary. Insight is earned via sensory particulars, not maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric first-person sustains a blacksmith-acoustical idiom: “violet hum of rust,” “frequency just below grief.” Compression taught early (“the sound bloomed behind his ribs”) and paid off in final listening. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under water. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for aurora, staccato for coal hiss—without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“water seeped… emerald and blood”). Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “the way…” anaphora at climax is deliberate pattern, not loop. Read-aloud ear passes—sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts carry emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of maritime graveyard + aurora + blacksmith memory-press feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could alienate causal readers, but closure stays legible. Specificity—copper etched with sister’s silence—prevents generic grief-template. Conceptual twist: metal *remembers* absences, reversing forge-as-destruction trope.</comment>
