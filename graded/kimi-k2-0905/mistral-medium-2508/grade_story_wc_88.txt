<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liam’s contradictory impulses—clutching the baseball while craving amnesia—are vivid in the tunnel beats; the final park scene crystallizes a credibly costly renunciation. Interiority slips once into “empathy…regrow like bone” therapy-speak, but embodied shame in the lake reflection quickly recovers it. Micro-choice hierarchy (ball vs. past) is legible throughout; the pawn-move is a believable cap on his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the path across the lake and the chess invitation re-configure options with felt social cost. Causal lattice holds—newspaper cue → lake test → ballthrow → dry path—each “because” tightens agency; no prop teleports. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 80; transitions are clean in this two-shard design. Persistent constraint: the neural scrub cannot be undone, so every new choice is freighted with irreversibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is not backdrop; its warmth and reactive light actively force Liam’s裸露 hand test, constraining tactics. “Baseball in damp tunnel air” and “city stink of rain on pavement” supply tactile, olfactory specificity filtered through a felon’s sensory priorities. Spatial choreography is airtight—tunnel fissure squeeze, kneel, throw, dry stone emergence—no impossible body moves. Environment charges the final image: the untouched ball in grass implies time’s labyrinth still rolls outside his reach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Liam will accept the cost of reclaiming empathy—tightens once yet decisively: the lake offers either erasure or stewardship, never both. Escalation is situational pressure, not multi-reversal; agency is expressed through the throw that literally parts his possible futures. Cost is visible: the collapsed tunnel removes retreat; the chess board in lamplight externalizes the lifelong match against his own violence. Coincidence is decorative (glow discovery) and does not resolve conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete paradox: a “clean slate” procedure that cannot delete relational debt; no explicit thesis states this. Subtext operates in gesture—sliding a pawn instead of a blade—and in the untouched baseball, quietly repricing time as something one serves rather than escapes. Final image answers the thematic question without moralizing: rebuilding the bridge begins with sitting at a board, not a sermon. One near-miss: the lake’s murmured “empathy is something you give” flirts with Echo but is saved by its immediate test (ballthrow).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is hard-boiled lyric: noir cadence (“ghost of a sting”, “city’s pulse muted to a distant hum”) yet precise diction. Syntax mirrors Liam’s wired alertness—short frag-staccato under flashlight flicker, longer flood as lake opens. Perceptual signature is ex-con (notices veins, switchblade weight, unmarked bills) without caricature; no head-hop. Dialogue at climax is minimal, indirection-heavy: “You here to finish it?” “No…to start.”—subtext over declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes: paragraph lengths visually track descent/ascent; sentence openers rotate. Figurative layer is dense but coherent—vehicles stay physical (lake as reader, ball as comet) and pay off in the parting image. No scaffolding loops; only one paraphrase hiccup (“the hollow behind his ribs said otherwise” / “he wasn’t sure he wanted it”) but the second line tilts choice, so earns its keep. Copy-clean: pronouns, tense, punctuation flawless; lake physics established before miracle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Time-travel autograph + neural scrub + empathy lake fuses noir and slip-stream without gimmick; each element pressures Liam’s specific guilt. “Delicately robust baseball” transforms from souvenir to key to path-finder—fresh functional metaphor. Stakes stay human (one owed boy) though world is near-future; genre hybrid feels inevitable, not stitched. Risk in quiet chess closure pays off by keeping focus on relational repair, not spectacle.</comment>
