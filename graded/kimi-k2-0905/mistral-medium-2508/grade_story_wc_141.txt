<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drives—debunker vs. seeker—are alive in every micro-choice (pluck, laugh, skin-ink). The final renunciation of “solving” for “adding” is credibly paid by the decade-long chase and the blank shell. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Only the grandmother’s voice edges toward convenient wisdom, keeping it from 8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dissolving texts / dissolving star-map teaches the rule early; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—ink on skin rewrites the ledger with undeniable cost. Causality holds: each musical scrape erodes paint and raises stakes. One micro-turn (shell blank) lands as earned stasis. No orientation debt; time/place anchored by ~70 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Observatory-as-body: cracked dome = broken skull, warped floor = rib-cage, wind as breath. Micro-setting of shell-cello dyad constrains every tactic; blank shell at end recharges first image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s myth-buster eye—he catalogues, then feels. Spatial choreography clean; no floating props. Weather is pressure, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: control over meaning-making vs. letting it remain collaborative. Tightening beat: journal pages dissolve → only skin left to write on; option foreclosed. Cost visible: shell erased, grandmother map lost, identity as solver forfeited. Agency is expressive—he plays the surrender rather than discovering escape. Could use one earlier material loss to push higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from transitive verb shift: “solve → add.” Subtext carried in shell-cello synesthesia: knowledge = resonance, not extraction. No moral statement; final line is invitation, not thesis. Gloomy cheerfulness modulates—laughs get louder as options narrow—creating ironic uplift that feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is poet-skeptic: scientific diction (“resonant hum, retelling”) collides with salt-skin physicality. Rhythm mimics cello—long bow sentences then staccato fragments under pressure. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent (hears paint flake, smells telescope oil). Compression taught early (“whisper of closing pages”) and paid off. Minor tic: two “then he” openings near midpoint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentence often layers tactile, sonic, and metaphysical data. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Mixed metaphor check safe—constellation/ledger/mural braid into one mapping metaphor. Final third clean of artifacts; cadence slows to match blank-shell silence. Opening sentence could trim one adjective for 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: myth-buster becomes myth-ampli-fier via musical engineering. Shell-cello compass is non-obvious instrument; blank return feels inevitable only after reveal. Risk of “dissolving book” trope rescued by skin-ink payoff. Still faint echo of eco-elegy ruins; could push higher with sharper socio-cost angle.</comment>
