<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyssa’s guardian identity is vividly embodied—crouching, tracing frost on a book, pocketing the pendant all reveal keeper vs. prisoner tension. Interiority stays concrete (“teeth ache,” “time slippery”) and her final laugh under threat shows contradictory fear/relief. The renunciation—handing over the key—carries visible cost: the garden unravels and she surrenders her known world. Micro-choices (salvaging the book, wearing the pendant, waiting, surrendering) align with her flaw of obsessive vigilance and foreclose her custodial path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of thawing/unraveling intensifies rather than causal chains. Orientation is secured by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the thirsty light swallows her and reweights “boundaries of light” with undeniable conceptual cost—she pays with self-dissolution. Pendant hand-off is the visible beat that triggers the final image; cost is legible in the dissolving ground and her laughter of terror.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen garden plus exhaling mist is filtered through Lyssa’s bias—she notices what threatens containment (mist as “second skin,” frost “etched,” trees “skeletal”). Micro-setting = the pendant against sternum; its humming cold directly constrains her choice to keep or yield. Sensory economy favors touch & cold; smell of burnt library lingers as stakes. Final image of “other side of light” reuses soft darkness, recharging earlier mist/fog motifs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep knowledge caged vs. release it—signalled by burned library & cultist mark. Escalation is textural: mist inhales, ground becomes a “breathing page,” tightening the surreal no-escape mood. Agency: her decision to surrender the pendant triggers irreversible unraveling; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is felt—her body and garden dissolve; refusal of old cage is paid with self-dispersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: books as dimensionally homesick refugees reframes censorship vs. liberation. Subtext in gesture—pendant hums like “hungry cold,” implying knowledge devours its guardian. Final image of darkness “like a friend” offers non-literal repricing: salvation = dissolution, friendship = obliteration. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers whether release is mercy or apocalypse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-close psychic distance stays stable; diction (“time slippery,” “words crawling like ants”) is character-bound. Rhythm accelerates with short paratactic bursts under peak stress: “She laughed, because the terror was familiar...” No head-hop. Lyric compression taught early (“mist was new”) and paid off at dissolution. Dialogue minimal, voice-like: “You’ve been holding my key” carries subtext of ownership vs. servitude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with participle or noun swaps without algorithmic pattern. High density: “frost-etched spine of a book she’d salvaged...” collapses backstory + object + action. Minor scaffold: “She waited. / Waiting was what she did best.” – adjacent restatement, one −0.2. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (mist as skin, ground as page) stay coherent. No artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle: “dimensionally homesick books” flips library-burning trope into cosmic refugee crisis. Pendant-spiral devouring itself becomes portal key without exposition dump. Surreal dissolution of setting-as-page feels inevitable yet new. Risky ending—protagonist erased—earned by persistent cold/reading motifs. Specificity: cult mark, cultist chant, librarian-spider fingers all particular, not stock.</comment>
