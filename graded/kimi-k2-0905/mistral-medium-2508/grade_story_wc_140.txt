<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Daniel’s erased existence drives every beat; the interior contradiction between clinging to scraps of identity and surrendering to erasure is vivid in his micro-choices—pressing the label to his chest, folding his own obituary into the crack. The final shedding of the ledger page is earned: he pays with total self-dispersal, a cost felt in the image of water closing without ripple. Flaw: we never see him risk discovery or confrontation, so the stakes stay internal; still, the endurance is credibly costly and specific to this ghosted psyche.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each fragment (label, ledger, offerings) layers until the final image reweights erasure as liberation. Closure lands in the “water closed behind him without a ripple”—a Charged Poise that makes the price of disappearance legible. Orientation is anchored by line 3; pattern taught early. Minor slack: no causal tightening after the ledger find, only accretion, but the cadence shift suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is no backdrop; its breathing steel and tide-flooded alleys physically steer Daniel’s path and final act. The poison-label’s creased edge recurs as micro-setting that constrains choice—he handles it, hides it, finally embeds it. Spatial choreography is exact: 47-B, knee-deep flood, sagging heart. The port’s salt-rust breath is filtered through a dead man’s senses, never tourist-catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the labyrinth re-remember him?—is signaled early. Pressure intensifies accumulatively: each fragment gathered tightens the cost of remaining nameless. The ledger page acts as the single deepening that forecloses return; once he locks his own name into the crack, the path dissolves. Cost is visible: he forfeits even the last paper proof of self.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges from concrete gestures (folded page, button offering) rather than assertion. Final image re-prices oblivion: erasure becomes authorship of a new, fluid archive. Subtext in stevedore whispers and cracked steel avoids explicit thesis; the reader left to weigh whether being swallowed by story is salvation or doom. Complexity lingers without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is saturated with port patois—groan of cranes, scent of diesel, language of rust—yet filtered through a ghost’s detached ear. Rhythm swells and contracts with tide and breath; short clauses mimic flickering silhouettes. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays locked to Daniel’s synesthetic dead-man sensorium. Experimental compression (“the labyrinth didn’t rest; neither did the dead”) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense, zero scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for syrupy time, fragments for heartbeat insomnia. “Some poisons were meant to be absorbed” recharges the faded warning into gold without overwriting. Only micro-slip: “thick and syrupy” abuts “time into something thick,” a faint echo, not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar motifs—ghosted man, industrial labyrinth—are rethreaded through port logistics and bureaucratic afterlife. The notion of paperwork that literally digests people feels fresh; the offering of receipts and buttons to containers anthropomorphizes capital in a way genre hasn’t overused. Risk: accumulative lyric structure could feel repetitive, yet cadence shift at end saves it from gimmick. Specificity of container codes and tide charts roots the concept.</comment>
