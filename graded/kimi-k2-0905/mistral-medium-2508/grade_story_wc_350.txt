<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—quiet librarian vs. cultural midwife—are alive in her pockets (music slips, brass weight) and in her body-language at the tower. The micro-choice to engrave the trilingual weight is the hinge that turns Elias; it carries visible cost in time, risk of theft accusation, and social capital. Elias’s own arc from accusation to rough laugh is sketched credibly, but his interiority arrives late and leans on summary (“his father used to say”), so the crucible of their status shift feels more asserted than fully embodied. Still, both characters end credibly altered, and the flaw is not large enough to nick closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the weight’s restoration + multilingual ledger arrival create a Conceptual Repricing of the elevator as a polyglot spine rather than a monolith. Causality is sequential—steal→engrave→return→ledger appears—each step shrinking options and raising social cost under a Causal lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 4; no penalty. The “borrowed starlight” motif and clock-tower geography are taught early and repay in the final image, so no lens ambiguity. The only hairline slip is the off-stage genesis of the translation ledger (appears ‘found’), but because it is the community’s answer to the weight’s prompt, the causality thread holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Grain elevator, clock tower, and spiral stairs are sketched with sensory economy—brass grooves, copper hands, scent of crushed grain—each filtering through Liora’s music-laden perception. The tower’s mechanism and the elevator’s control room function as micro-settings that physically constrain the final placement of the weight, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: Liora pockets→climbs→kneels→Elias descends; no impossible positions. One minor gap: the “loading dock” appears without prior map-anchor, but the choral scene quickly orients us through sound, so the stumble is momentary.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can the town’s working rhythm be re-synchronized across languages?—is signaled in Elias’s second line. Escalation is a single tightening: the missing weight → linguistic ledger; each step forecloses retreat to monolingual habit. The cost is visibly social and tactical: Liora risks ostracism for theft, Elias risks ridicule for trusting “a hunk of brass,” and both hazard the elevator’s final breakdown if the experiment fails. No reversal, but the deepening of communal participation (whistle answering whistle) gives agency to the whole cast without diluting protagonists’ choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—polyphony as social repair—emerges through the engraved weight, the multilingual ledger, and the closing chord rather than any explicit thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: Elias’s thumb tracing the inscription equals reluctant conversion; the whistle duo is an unsaid “yes.” The final image of laughter rising from the elevator’s belly reweights earlier silo-as-echo-chamber metaphor into silo-as-resonance-box, a resonant reconfiguration. The piece avoids sentimentality by keeping the choir’s song slightly off-key (“not harmony yet”), preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Narrative texture is musical—rhythmic clauses mirror metronomic clock gears; diction stays within Liora’s lexicon (choir, sheet music, “afterglow”). Free indirect slides cleanly between external grain dust and internal afterglow without filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is spare but idiomatic: Elias’s growl vs. Liora’s gentle corrections carry status and worldview. No head-hopping; POV remains latched to Liora except for one warranted external tag (“Elias met her gaze”), accepted under Hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long breathless climbs to short orchestral cutoff (“Not harmony yet.”). Information density is high: one sentence often delivers time, sensory cue, and social history (“beneath the hush of borrowed starlight, she climbed…”). No mixed metaphor; brass weight = balance + voice, a single coherent vehicle. Minor paraphrase loop—“elevator’s rhythms steady… elevator’s final rehearsal… elevator’s belly”—is purposeful motif-repetition, not scaffold, so no deduction. Final line lands with snap, recharging “singing in the same key” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing astronomical clock, multilingual labor conflict, and choral librarianship yields a fresh angle on the tired “town divided” trope. The weight as polyglot counterweight is an organic invention that could not swap with any generic token. Risk is taken in quiet resolution—no strike, no violence—yet the closing laughter feels earned, not safe, because the prior silence was so loud. Specificity of śliwowica bottle, moon-phase dial, and Polish/Ukrainian/English phrases roots the universals in unrepeatable particulars.</comment>
