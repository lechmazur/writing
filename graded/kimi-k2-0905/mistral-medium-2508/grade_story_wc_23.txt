<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s grief-riven vocation is vivid—her body remembers charts while her hands build “maps of string and nail.” Interior contradiction pulses when the bronze warms yet offers no answers, grounding her flawed hope. The midnight calls force micro-choices (answering, translating riddles, dialing out) that visibly cost her sleep and solitude, earning the ending’s lighter chest. Motivation stays character-bound; no diagnostic labels, only salt-stung ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Lena’s final candle and exhalation reconfigure her endless building into an anchored, forward ritual; cost is the acceptance that the station will keep eroding while she keeps answering. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each call and map-layer thickens the density of loss until the patina itself seems to breathe. The patina bronze object cues and participates in the final beat, satisfying the 9+ cost-proof test. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (cliff-edge station, midnight, single POV), no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is weathered, salt-cracked, and body-proximate: warped floorboards against crossed legs, bronze patina shifting under palm heat. The signal station’s dying relays and groaning antenna supply both tool and hazard, constraining her to candlelight and graph paper. Spatial choreography stays clean as she lifts, dials, lights, exhales. Environment mirrors interior—rusted antennae echo her rusted ribs—yet avoids overt symbolism by staying tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Lena convert cartography of absence into a livable forward motion? Pressure tightens when each call delivers a new riddle-coordinate that must be translated onto paper before dawn erosion erases it. The patina’s warmth and the candle’s flare mark visible cost—sleep, solitude, the cliffs themselves. Agency is incremental but real: she answers, maps, dials back, lighting the next wick; no coincidence resolves the ache.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as salvage: grief can be re-tooled into a beacon for others if the builder accepts perpetual partial return. Subtext lives in the bronze’s mute listening and the maps that lead inland—an implicit inversion of maritime rescue. The ending’s “lighter weight” is an earned stasis, not a moral; ambiguity lingers about who truly walks home. No thesis statement intrudes; meaning accrues through patina, paper, and candle smoke.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, salt-bitten, rhythmically controlled—“rusted antennae swaying…humming with the ghosts of transmissions”—yet stays within Lena’s plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is selective: she notices oxidation bloom, graph-paper grids, tide-echo in her ribs. Dialogue is minimal, rough as gravel, distinct from narrative texture; no head-hopping. Compression (e.g., “Midnight calls were never for the living”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at the candle-lit close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, avoids scaffold; sentences perform double duty—image + motive (“she built things instead—towers of driftwood…anything to chart the geography of loss”). Figurative runs are patterned and paid off (antennae as barnacles, bronze breathing). No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacks. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing”—is narrator’s metaphor, not academic drift, hence forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lonely coast, ghost calls, grieving artisan—are re-wired through reverse migration maps and a bronze censer foot that listens rather than speaks. The idea that drowned souls walk inland feels fresh and is grounded in tactile specifics (string, nail, graph paper). Risk is moderate: accumulative lyric structure, not causal whodunit, yet coherence holds. Transformation test passes; place and object are inseparable from arc.</comment>
