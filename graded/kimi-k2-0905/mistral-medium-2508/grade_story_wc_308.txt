<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skimmer’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fingers “tracing the edge,” the arrowhead “worn smooth by generations of palms”—and his refusal to flee crystallizes into Earned Stasis with visible cost: he becomes “a tower,” pulse-anchored, bones vibrating. The contradiction between immobility and agency is dramatized, not told. Flaw: no second character means status/relationship bullets don’t apply, but single-POV depth is strong. Still, the final self-transformation is credible and scaled to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the skimmer’s shift from passive listener to active anchor reweights the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens—the flock’s re-harmonization is the cadence shift that makes the cost legible. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3; canyon, twilight, bone towers instantly legible. Causality holds: because he endures stillness, the Hollow Maw passes unsated. One soft spot: the Maw’s “ripple of wrongness” is slightly abstract, but the beat still lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arrowhead functions as micro-setting: its changing temperature and vibration against his sternum constrain every tactical choice. Canyon acoustics are filtered through POV bias—“echoes curled around him like a warning”—and directly guide the climax (he teaches the towers to sing). Spatial choreography is clean: birdfalls, wind shifts, tower ribs track without drift. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to tactile resonance, satisfying 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “stars blinked above him” is mildly postcard, but the final image recharges the stone-as-anchor motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the flock’s harmonic pulse—signals early and tightens when the lagging bird drops. Escalation is Accumulative: density of vibration, wind, panic layers until the skimmer’s stance crystallizes. Cost is felt: he forfeits physical safety to become “stone,” a visible price. Missing a second tightening beat keeps it from 8.8+; one deepening is sufficient but not exceptional.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: stewardship versus predation, memory versus hunger. The arrowhead’s reweighting from relic to active instrument supplies Conceptual Repricing—history’s cost is paid in present flesh. No moralizing; final image of canyon silence reconfigures meaning without statement. Subtle counter-reading possible: his solitude may doom future pulses, adding ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “hollow spires that hummed,” “pulse left wandering,” syntax compressed under pressure. No dialogue, so voice purity remains un-contaminated. Psychic distance tightens from cosmic to sternum-bone interface; rhythm accelerates with fragment-like beats. Register stays within plausible archaic hermit diction; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-loop-free; only microscopic echo is “the skimmer” repetition, but it serves mantra effect. Metaphors are coherent: “echoes curled,” “storm of erratic vibrations.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with wind cadence. One sentence—“He had done what his ancestors could not”—is summary, but it compresses rather than stalls. Closure line “the canyon breathed” is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<comment>Freshest synthesis: harmonic ornithomancy via bone-lithic seismograph. Hollow Maw as acoustic predator transforms familiar “bird-reading” trope into survival instrument. Risk-taking—entire plot in stillness—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of arrowhead lineage makes premise feel discovered, not invented.</comment>
