<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is deftly embodied—her palm on frost-bitten metal, the warming compass rose—and her contradictory need to stay yet leap is held in tension until the final beat. The micro-choice to align the charcoal sketch with the stars is causally earned, paying off her family’s custom and paying the cost of leaving air, history, and body behind. Flaw is implied (obsessive solitude) but never triangulated against another live character, so status crucible is absent; at this length it is acceptable. Voice is specific, not stock, and the final renunciation is felt as both liberation and death.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Home was a direction” re-weights every prior map image under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern—sketch, rose, deck, leap—tightens once via the warmed applique and the page held to glass, forcing the protagonist’s irreversible act. Cost is visible in the final image: empty deck left behind, air lost, body released. Causality holds: because she overlays sketch to glass, therefore the compass needle snaps and the station’s chime answers; no retro-fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frost-bitten railing, cracked glass, and thinning air are tactile constraints that shape her ability to lean, breathe, and finally step off. The compass rose operates as micro-setting: its gilded warmth and needle snap physically permit the leap “through.” Spatial choreography is clean—her boots on railing, sketch to glass, body released—no impossible positions. Detail is selective, never touristic; the station’s groan and the single underwater chime anchor scale and era without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—find true north after beacons died—tightens when the needle swings from nowhere to “through,” foreclosing literal survival. Escalation is one-step but sufficient at this length: the glimpse of light → sketch alignment → warm needle → leap; each beat increases cost (air, gravity, isolation). Agency is hers; coincidence (the light) merely ignites, never resolves. Visible price: her breath stops, deck empties, station left derelict; survival path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: navigation as identity, not destination. The family custom of anniversary sketches is re-priced at closure—sketch becomes key, not record. No moralizing; the final line “The stars, for once, didn’t lie” is imagistic, not assertive. Ambiguity lingers: is she transcendent or dead? That unresolved charge invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: breath fog warps starlight, metal contracts, compass “wakes”—all filtered through an observer’s precise, lonely attention. Rhythm accelerates into breath-short fragments as she steps off, then elongates in the light-bloom sentence—mirrors time stretch without dropping clarity. No dialogue, yet voice remains idiosyncratic and stable. Patterned elision (“echoed silence”) is taught early and paid off in the underwater chime.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work—e.g., “curved glass still holding against the void” does setting, stakes, and body in one stroke. Figurative control: stars “unwinding into threads” extends textile metaphor without mixed-vehicle clash. One scaffold loop: “the silence so deep it echoed” is borderline paraphrase but serves cadence; forgiven under lyric license. Zero filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines derelict-space station with cartographic mysticism in a way that feels fresh yet inevitable. The compass rose as aperture rather than symbol transforms familiar “find home” trope into literal transit through spacetime. Family custom of sketching evolves into cosmic key—non-obvious yet foreshadowed. Risk-taking (step into vacuum as transcendence) is bold but fully grounded in sensory causality; no gimmickry.</comment>
