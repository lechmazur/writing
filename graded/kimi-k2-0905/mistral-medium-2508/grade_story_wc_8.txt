<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s need to expose the “noble lie” is concrete and embodied: crate wrenched open, phone buzz, lapel whisper of fear. His simultaneous scholarly detachment and visceral pulse (“emotional arithmetic that could be solved”) gives live contradiction; the choice to linger for Callahan rather than bolt is risky, earned, and forecloses retreat. Cost is felt: he forfeits safety, the crate, and institutional comfort. No occupationally complex moves are required at this length.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: discovery of ledger ➔ deduces pattern ➔ decision to confront ➔ police summoned; each beat shrinks options. Orientation at 81 words—station name, rose petal, crate—keeps waiver; no caps triggered. Closure (Elias slips B-photo into pocket) reweights stakes with felt cost: he now carries the evidence and exile; the ivy-station image crystallizes new, workable truth. Persistent tactical constraint: he will be hunted for the single page he has taken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Micro-objects dominate: the B-illumination, the oilcloth, the crate lid, all handled under torch beam; choices hinge on their access. The station itself supplies secrecy then threat—ivy-covered tunnel slows Callahan’s approach, giving Elias seconds to file photos. Visual bias matches scholar’s lens-like attention; no tourist dump. Spatial choreography stable across lunge/retreat. Tonally the mildew and rust mirror decay of Church narrative. The ivy’s swallowing “into the dark” charges final image, anchoring 9+ gate for environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Central stake—truth vs. institutional faith—announced early with petal image. The meaningful tightening is Elias abandoning the priceless Codex to keep a photo; that single photo is now his only leverage and life-endangering liability. Escalation is causal: he forces Callahan to acknowledge complicity, which summons police; options collapse to flight. Price is viscous: tenure, safety, reputation lost; the final image of tracks leading nowhere shows option foreclosure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image set—rose surrender, gilt B, ivy swallowing—never through sermon. The ending refuses tidy moral; both Church and scholar face cost, leaving the reader in charged ambiguity. The tension between “protection” of faith and exposure of fraud is intractable, persuasively nuanced. Final reprise of tracks stretching “nowhere and everywhere” reweights the whole ledger discovery into a perpetual search, achieving CR without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Scholarly perceptual signature is precise—“gloved fingers,” “vellum pages brittle but unbroken,” sound of “ghost engineer.” Syntax tightens under pressure: short, unadorned sentences when torch approaches; longer, clause-heavy cadence for reflection. No dialogue needed; third-person close stays within Elias’s sensory envelope. Filter verbs rare; diction remains inside humanities academic register. Final rhythmic lift as he steps “into the dark” gives satisfying stanza-like close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly lean but leans on stacked metaphor across two adjacent high-pressure beats (“rose flag,” “ivy strangled,” “ghost engineer,” “gilded frauds,” “weight of a single illuminated letter”)—minor smoothing needed. No loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge; grammar and pronouns clean. Register drift at “conceptual repricing” appears only in evaluation not text. Final line delivers clear image without muddle, just inside 9-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combines ecclesiastical forgery, abandoned rail station, and rose-death countdown into a fresh stylistic blend. The B-illumination as both art object and falsified invoice breathes new life into familiar “Church secrets” trope. “Draw parallels” device is dramatized via literal sheaf of deeds, not abstract lecture. Risk of ivy-swallowed noir works; specificity of rusted rail timetable anchors originality. Could edge higher with deeper idiosyncratic worldview beyond academic detachment.</comment>
