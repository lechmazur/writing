<comment>Elspeth’s nervous habit and shard-mirror gift create a credible interior; Kael’s tremor and tea-reading apprenticeship feel earned. Their mentor-protégé status tension is legible, but the emotional stakes hinge on abstract “shadow-door” peril rather than personal loss, blunting cost. Micro-choices—Elspeth pressing the shard into Kael’s palm—advance the bond, yet Kael’s interiority is filtered through Elspeth’s gaze, limiting contradiction. Relationship changes state (trust bestowed, fear confronted), satisfying crucible demand, but the absence of visible consequence to either character caps full believability.</comment>

<comment>The “reversible exile” rule is taught early and paid off when annotation binds the shadow; the ending attains Charged Poise (map glows, options reconfigured) with cost legible in Kael’s tea-smudged fingers. Causality is causal under lens: because Elspeth annotates space, therefore the door is sealed—no arbitrary leaps. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3 and holds. One minor scaffold: “the kind of quiet that makes people lean in” tells the already-shown hush, but this loop does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>The library’s wax, sagging shelves, and single window constrain choreography—every move circles the reading desk under the pane’s geometry. The cracked-leather scent and playground-hush audio layer provide sensory hierarchy filtered through Elspeth’s archivist priorities. The shadow trapped in glass functions as micro-setting; its ripple when touched directly shapes the annotation tactic and charges the final image. Spatial tracking is clean; no impossible body or prop positions during the shadow-lunge scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the apprentice survive the library’s next shadow knock?—is signaled atteacup swirl. One meaningful tightening: annotation marks bind the shadow, foreclosing the option to ignore it. Cost is visible (Kael’s stained fingers, Elspeth’s unspoken “cost of coming back”), but pressure escalation is moderate; the menace never physically endangers the pair, only conceptually threatens. Agency rests with protagonists; no coincidences resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of mentorship as a reversible door emerges through gesture—Elspeth hands over the shard, offers return instead of escape—without explicit moral. Subtext resides in the phrase “love that didn’t flinch from teeth,” crystallizing combative tenderness. The empty playground swing image quietly reweights earlier exile concept into cyclical solitude. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance arises from the glowing map that fuses knowledge and peril, avoiding pat wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elspeth’s perceptual signature—“counting the ribs of a sleeping beast”—with rhythmic, lexically precise cadence. Filter verbs serve voice (“the shadow hissed” via Kael’s perception) without dulling immediacy. Dialogue is sparse yet subtextual; Elspeth’s clipped lines pursue mentoring goals. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under threat (“heart-beat ripple”), then widens to playground hush, mirroring tension release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long sensual clauses to staccato commands (“Annotate this”), propelling beats. Figurative density is high but patterned—light bends “when it’s tired” teaches the speculative tone early and pays off at the pane. No mixed metaphors; metaphor vehicles obey physical logic. One minor scaffolding loop: “the kind of quiet that...” could be trimmed, but it does not recur near closure. Diction stays within Elspeth’s antique-archivist lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The shard-mirror annotation of library-shadow geometry reworks fortune-telling into spatial magic, synthesizing fresh mechanics. “Reversible exile” plus “combative tenderness” complicates typical mentor kindness with threat, yielding a non-obvious emotional calculus. Details—teacup constellations, backward walking—are specific to this voice, not generic wizard school décor. While libraries and apprentices are familiar, the inversion of exile as return path and annotation as weapon feels particular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
