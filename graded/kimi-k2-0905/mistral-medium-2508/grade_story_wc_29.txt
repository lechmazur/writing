<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—her decade of muscle-memory dialing, the way her thumb “hovers” over the switch, the embodied ache in her teeth under alien pressure. Contradictory impulses (paranoia vs. scientific rigor) coil inside single beats. The final refusal to explain herself to the dean crystallizes an earned stasis with visible social cost. Only minor stretch: her overnight mastery of “subsonic counter-melody” edges on competence-porn, slightly softening struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the signal taunts campus fractures, Liora therefore retaliates with subsonics, which in turn forces the alien pattern to modulate from predatory to curious. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing—“I was just fixing the radio” reweights the entire power struggle under a new, wry rule-set. Cost is legible in her exile status and the building’s unsettled bones. No orientation or telegraphing issues; anchors arrive by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The radio station itself behaves like a character—old current humming through locked doors, its bones shivering under her pulse—creating micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice. Astronomical charts smudge under sleeves, inked stars shifting in the ventilation blast, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices notch positions and static timbre, not décor. Could edge higher if subsonic apparatus had tactile specificity, but the charts satisfy the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can humans assert agency against cosmic manipulation—tightens precisely: each frequency tweak narrows options (argument falters, signs droop) and raises bodily cost (skull-pressure, tooth-ache). Escalation is because/therefore driven; no coincidence resolves anything. The final modulation from menace to curiosity is earned by her sustained interference, not luck. One missed beat: no concrete on-page loss (job, relationship) shown, only implied exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the university’s internecine grant wars mirror cosmic trickster games, both exposed as fragile human constructs when one woman hijacks the stage. Subtext lives in gesture—charts fluttering like protest signs, static laughing without sound. Final image reframes “academic integrity” memos as petty cosmic jokes without moralizing. No redundant statements; resonance comes from the echo between departmental splits and signal fractures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is musically syntactic—sentences vary from staccato bursts under pressure (“The first pulse sent a shiver…”) to lyrical elongation when she listens to curiosity. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: “nest of angry stars,” “needle pulling string.” No filter-verb clutter; compression taught early (“static hissed…”) pays off in altered cadence at the end. Dialogue line is minimal yet idiom-perfect: “I was just fixing the radio” catches her wry deflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable—each sentence advances stakes or sensation (“headphones warm against her ears” couples body and tool). No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; “cosmic static” stays within her lexicon. One near-scaffold: “charts…smudged where her sleeves had brushed them” repeats fabric-contact twice in three lines, but the second adds causal star-shift, so forgiven. Peak beats stay lucid amid figurative load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes SETI, campus cancel-culture, and pirate-radio rebellion into a single inevitability that feels freshly minted. Risky choice—alien signal as literal department-politics puppeteer—could have collapsed into satire, but grounded in tactile radio guts and one woman’s exile. Specificity of “frequencies aligned with fractures” transforms abstract premise into lived stakes. No recognizable template; the closing shrug is a distilled inversion of first-contact tropes.</comment>
