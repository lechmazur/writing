<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s transformation from dockworker to whale is anchored in tactile memory and guilt; the scrimshaw pulses against his thigh as both talisman and trigger, making the final shift feel like inevitable self-recognition rather than magic. Interiority stays concrete—“bones hummed,” “lungs remembered a shape”—avoiding diagnostic labels. The only motivational thinning arrives in the single line “He’d stopped asking why,” which summarizes rather than dramatizes the surrender that precedes the call. Still, the earned cost is visible: the island dissolves behind him, a permanent forfeiture that seals the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: scrimshaw theft → carried guilt → whale-call summons → body answers → island-cage collapses. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Veyth’s disappearance rewrites the entire premise from landmass to prison, and the price is Elias’s human past dissolving in saltwater. The one micro-turn—carving slips from fingers—simultaneously frees whale and self, tightening stakes in a single beat. Orientation is anchored within 80 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Salt-stiffened ropes biting into palms” and “sublittoral fringe” ground the body and place without tourist catalog. The trench off Veyth isn’t backdrop—it’s the lock mechanism that rises to meet the key. Micro-setting works: the scrimshaw acts as portable environment, constraining hand and memory until released. Weathered pier, fog, and dissolving cliff edge evolve with action, never described static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus belonging—surfaces early in the whale-call name. Pressure escalates through physical tightening: ropes → carving vibration → bone hum → actual transformation; each increment carries higher corporeal cost. The island’s vanishing is not coincidence but direct consequence of returning the key, satisfying causal lens. One deepening is enough; the final image of open sea narrows options to forever-swim, no return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “freedom is chosen bondage”; the whale’s closing aphorism is earned because the narrative has literally enacted it—Elias trades land-legs for tail-bonds. Subtext resides in silence of dockworkers who “wouldn’t meet his eyes,” indicting collective complicity without speech. No final-paragraph sermon; the song itself is the argument. Ambiguity lingers: is the pod a family or another tribe with its own debts?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression—“He unfolded”—teaches the pattern of bodily elision early and pays it off at transformation. Perceptual signature is dockworker-anchored: notice goes to tide-pull, crate weight, rope bite. No head-hopping; collective “they” stays external. Rhythm modulates from gritty Anglo-Saxon nouns to liquid sibilance post-shift, mirroring medium change. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“seemed to say”) they signal species-to-species translation uncertainty, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is alive: fragment (“Not in collapse, but in release—”) accelerates breath, then long participles mimic whale glide. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphor density peaks at transformation yet stays coherent: “pain was bright, clean, like the first breath after a dive” links mammalian lung memory to newborn tail. Opening and closing lines frame voice and image with zero fat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Were-whale trope is refreshed by treating island-as-cage and scrimshaw-as-key, a synthesis that makes the familiar arc feel discovered rather than retold. Specificity of “sub-littoral fringe” and dockworker kinesthetics anchors the myth in maritime labor. Risk of lyrical elision is taken early and paid, so compression reads as胆识 rather than evasion. Only mild proximity echo: Melville-ish whale eye, but the inversion—human choosing cetacean—twists it enough.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Grace is more than epithet; it enables Elias to balance crates while metamorphosing without stumbling, making the physical transition credible. His dock-honed precision—“quiet precision of a man who had spent a lifetime on the docks”—carries into the fluid dive, linking occupations of land and sea. Remove grace and the transformation risks slapstick, breaking the lyric tone.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Scrimshaw is seeded in paragraph 3, vibrates mid-story, and releases at climax; its whalebone origin fuses cetacean and human flesh. The theft-backstory primes guilt; the return actuates island dissolution. Without the carving, the whale has no contractual trigger and the lock metaphor collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Island disappearance is not scenery but structural reversal: Veyth literally un-exists once the key is returned, revealing the cage. The crumbling edges foreshadow this throughout, and the final shimmer retroactively justifies earlier coastal erosion. Story logic would require total rewrite if island remained solid.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Detach is dramatized as bodily unfolding, not metaphoric leave-taking; ribs ache to “detach from the weight of the land.” The verb recurs at molecular level, making the action irreversible and costly. Any softer synonym would undercut the visceral rent between species.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Whale-call is introduced as sound, then recognized as name, then answered by bone-key; each layer escalates causality. Mechanics stay mysterious yet consistent—sonic summoning compatible with underwater acoustics. Remove the call and Elias has no external trigger to override lifelong human identity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sublittoral fringe is named once but charged: the trench where island roots unravel is the same zone Elias must cross to transform, making the setting an active gate. The phrase also signals briny light-diffusion that justifies the final glow. Generic “deep sea” would lose specificity and spatial stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Post-war impossibility of violence is stated early, creating a world where only natural erosion remains; this frames Elias’s past killings as anachronistic guilt rather than ongoing threat. The temporal frame narrows choices to internal reckoning, justifying the lyrical rather than combative climax. Could be swapped with “post-plague” but would lose maritime-pacifist irony.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>True-nature desire is dramatized through body-horror joy: “laughing, the sound bubbling up from a place that had never known shame.” The motive conflicts with terrestrial guilt until the laugh declares reconciliation. Without this desire, transformation reads as curse, invalidating the celebratory ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combative tenderness oscillates between salt-stiff ropes and whale song, between violence of bones reshaping and tender welcome of water. The tonal tension peaks when Elias laughs while shedding human skin, fusing aggression and affection into a single exhale. The modulation is essential; a purely gentle tone would sentimentalize the pain, purely combative would undercut liberation.</comment>
