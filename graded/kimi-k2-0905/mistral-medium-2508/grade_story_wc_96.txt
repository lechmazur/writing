<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is rich and specific—his cracked fingers on the tin, the itch behind his ribs—showing contradictory impulses (restlessness v. loyalty) that culminate in the violet-hand-off. The molt trait is more label than lived-in obstacle; no beat shows a prior name failure that raises stakes. Micro-choices (lying about leaving, gifting the violet) crystallize a hierarchy of values with felt cost. Voice stays distinct, but secondary status dynamics with Maren are under-explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Charged Poise: the violet transfer reweights “bloom” from metaphor to mutual vow, cost felt in the lie and dawn separation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of books/flowers/names tightens the stake until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“rusted library’s sagging awning”) so waiver applies. Persistent constraint (guards will come) shapes tactics and charges the final image; no causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting objects—tin, violet, lamp—constrain choice and charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Library’s rusted shelves and broken bars are filtered through Elias’s scavenger eye, guiding access and risking capture. Spatial choreography is clean: books are stacked, bodies crouch, violet passes hand-to-hand. Weather (wind through bars) is linked to stakes but not over-described.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—“beauty outlasts anarchy”—tightens when the lie about leaving forecloses retreat; cost is the risk of future loss when guards arrive. Pressure is textured, not causal-reversal: each salvaged book and the violet deepen the library’s fragility. One meaningful intensification: the violet’s insertion reweights the bloom concept, narrowing options to staying/loss. Agency is endurance/renunciation, consistent with Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: bloom = resistance through shared fragility. The violet’s journey from discard to gift reconfigures beauty as mutual vulnerability, not triumph. No final moralizing; final line “even in ruin, they would bloom” is image, not thesis. Subtext in Maren’s humming and Elias’s lie carries the cost of hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: soot-ink, cicada-molt, “silver wound” sky. Syntax mirrors scavenger mind—elliptical, tactile. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Dialogue minimal but natural (“Some of us bloom in the dark”). Register stable; no filter-verb stacks. Metaphor density is high but patterned early and paid off in violet return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic control: sentence length varies from fragment to lyrical cascade, accelerating with dawn. No paraphrase loops; each line adds texture or knowledge. Figurative language stays coherent—no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “bloom” repeated across three contiguous lines mid-story (−0.2); does not touch closure. High density: “stitched meaning into chaos” does world/character/theme work simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle: post-collapse library as living organism, resistance as pressed-flower archive. Transformation test passes—swapping names/places would break the violet’s specificity. Risk in lyric density succeeds; no gimmick. Slight echo of “cracks where the light gets in” (Leonard Cohen) but reweighted through rusted sky wound; not derivative enough to penalize.</comment>
