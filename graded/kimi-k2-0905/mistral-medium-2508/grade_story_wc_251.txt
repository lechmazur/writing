<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet strategist persona is vividly embodied through tactile repetition—spectacles, pawn, filings—under pressure; the internal contradiction between teaching foresight and needing immediate rebellion is dramatized when he pockets filings that later “sing,” showing micro-choices that foreclose violence and cost him anonymity. Student relationships remain off-page, so status/relationship bullets do not apply; interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak. Closure renunciation (no credit, no fame) is earned by earlier causal plant of humming filings; flaw (obsessive quietness) drives both tactic and final isolation, satisfying 9+ quick test despite limited cast.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the humming metal chains reweight the town’s perception of the library from “relic” to living circuit; cost is felt in council retreat and Elias’s anonymity. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural—pattern of quiet window installations intensifies until magnetic grotto reprises the image; transitions legible, pattern taught early, coherent at end. One shard, no orientation debt; prop track (pawn → filings → chains) never breaks; council retreat is off-page but the perceptual shift is on-page and undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt library, mist, grotto starlight, and filings function as micro-setting that constrains every tactic: filings’ pull dictates non-violent barricade; star-cracks time the midnight raid. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s quiet lens—muted light, ozone, low hum—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: filings travel pocket → door chains → window panes without teleport. Final image of humming chains recharges earlier grotto pulse, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“save the library”—signals early; escalation occurs via accumulative tightening: each window display increases social visibility until magnetic grotto reprises the pattern, foreclosing violent eviction. Agency is quiet curation, not confrontation; cost is council’s public retreat and Elias’s permanent anonymity. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence used to resolve. Persistent constraint (filings’ pull) shapes final barricade tactic, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular tactic—silent, aesthetic displays—rather than assertion; final image of humming chains reweights “quiet things that refuse to be forgotten” without moralizing. No thematic echo line; ambiguity remains—town may still strike later. Emotional aftereffect is hush of snowfall on still-humming metal, not sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s perceptual filter—spectacle cracks, pocket warmth, filings’ bee-swarm vibration—no head-hop. Diction stays within quiet lexicon; rhythm accelerates under humming crescendo. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style clean; no POV modesty breach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (bruise, bleeding windows) stay consistent with bodily/library fusion; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one line often does image + motive + foreshadowing. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes charged poise without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—magnetic grotto as quiet insurgent infrastructure—is fresh synthesis of library-saving trope. Town-wide chessboard window pattern is non-obvious escalation of coach identity. Risk-taking (no shouting, no confrontation) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Specificity of filings’ hum versus generic “magic” keeps it unswappable. Emotional truth of anonymous caretakers lands harder than heroics.</comment>
