<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lior’s guilt-born solitude and the bird’s mirrored isolation feed each other; the feather-offering beat crystallizes a credible, costly shift from penitent witness to self-forgiven exile. Interiority stays concrete—"etched into his ribs"—and the final micro-choice (letting the bird go) is proportionate to the 800-word arc. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ bar is missed, but motivation tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial drinks the feather, the hum softens, and Lior’s stance flips from haunted to unapologetically alive—cost legible in the "brittle awakening" that no longer hurts. Causal chain holds: reflection-split → book of mirrors → insight → surrender of penance. Orientation is taught by line 4; no lens ambiguity at exit. One causal leap (book appears from nowhere) is genre-consistent and waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Library-as-body: floating shelves, tidal motion, and atomically reflective brass constrain every beat—books rearrange, the dial’s shards redirect action, the stone circle’s hum paces time. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lior’s scholar-filter—mist-damp pages, click of claw on brass—rather than tourist catalog. Final image of doors opening is charged by the dial’s earlier constraint, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to live with the memory of genocide—is signaled early and tightens once: the bird attacks its reflection, forcing Lior to trade guilt for independent life. Pressure grows under causal lens (each sundial shard narrows options) and the price—perpetual exile—is felt when he steps through the newly material door. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: mirror/reflection → memory as weight → independence as release. No moralizing; the final "cost of being alive" is shown by the open door and vanished book. The Hesperornis feather reweights from relic to ransom, achieving Conceptual Repricing without exposition. Ambiguity lingers—world below is indifferent—yet remains coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Lior’s sensory filter; diction ("atomically reflective," "brittle awakening") stays within scholar-poet lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for awe, fragments for impact ("It wasn’t rebirth.")—without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is N/A; internal voice is distinct and consistent under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid—each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are avoided; "bones groaning like old ship timber" is single, apt. One paraphrase loop ("the hum swelled, the shelves groaned") is minor. No filter-verb stacks or scaffolding in the closure third; high-band slips are hairline only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of extinct bird, floating tidal library, and guilt-powered reincarnation feels singular; no template plot. The sundial-as-mirror-engine repurposes a familiar artifact into memory-translator, culminating in a door that opens only after the past is relinquished. Risky speculative elements serve emotional stakes, not ornament. Transformation test: swap any detail and the arc collapses.</comment>
