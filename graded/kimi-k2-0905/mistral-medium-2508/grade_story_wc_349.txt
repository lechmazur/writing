<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s calm, attentive stance is consistent and embodied; the micro-choice to accept moonlight for an unwritable absence shows a clear value hierarchy. Yet her interior contradiction (commerce vs. reverence for silence) stays static—no compounding error or visible flaw drives the final beat, so the renunciation feels preordained rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fracture on the slate reweights the premise—stories start in silence, not inscription—at visible cost (the traded moonlight, the patron’s hunger). Causal chain holds: incise-listen-trade-fracture; no teleporting props. Orientation is swift and tethered to Liora’s counter; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) stays coherent as density and cadence tighten into the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystalline branches, quartz counter, and bottled moonlight are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered; the library’s “ink and ozone” scent anchors every beat. The micro-setting of the slate’s hairline fracture becomes the charged object that constrains the final meaning—without it, the repricing fails—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who controls the gateway to narrative silence—tightens once: the patron’s demand forces Liora to risk her first sale and her creed. Agency is present (she incises, trades, fractures), cost is legible (moonlight surrendered, slate irreversibly altered). No escalation loop; a single deepening suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—absence as generative origin—emerges through the slate’s fracture and the moonlight’s darkness, never named aloud. Final image of bottled dark reweights the opening belief that stories start before writing, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the patron’s “rough as crumpled parchment” voice implies their own erased narrative, deepening the thematic web.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter; diction (“mindfully scattered,” “glimmering parole”) is hers, not authorial. Rhythm modulates: long inhalatory sentences in lull, then clipped beats at fracture. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language appears sparingly and purposefully. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; sentences vary in length and opening. “The lull of opening day stretched around her, thick with possibility” does double duty—atmosphere + interior state—without overwriting. Clean grammar and precise punctuation throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “clean slate vendor” trading silence in a floating glass orchard feels sui generis; the concept of quantifying absence via an unwritable incision is a fresh synthesis of bibliophile and metaphysical tropes. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the fracture image. Removing any core element—library, moonlight, parole—would collapse the logic, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
