<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—prudence vs. the dare to “finish it”—are alive in the moment she cracks the pillbox; the micro-choice costs her the safety of denial and is paid for with the key she pockets. The scarred face, misaligned eye, and coat of “silvered stains” give embodied history without exposition. One beat later the stakes recede into abstraction (“not for them. For the girl she’d been”), softening the cost and keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>The causal spine holds: message in snow → arrival → pillbox key → choice to go. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—she takes the key, leaves the empty pillbox, forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in the relinquished relic and the footprints that can’t be recalled. Orientation is secured by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Zephyr Bluff’s wind, thawing earth, and mist function as active curtain: swallowing sound, erasing tracks, forcing close-quarters encounter. The cedar’s frost-bitten bark becomes tactile cover and later the altar where the pillbox is sacrificed. Weather shift—“scent of green things struggling upward”—mirrors her internal break toward action and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is personal redemption vs. permanent exile; the pillbox key tightens the noose by giving her a route back in. One meaningful escalation: refusal to open → opens → commits to coordinates. Cost is the physical pillbox left behind and the exposure of moving toward a target she once fled. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “fixing what’s broken” emerges through the key and the abandoned pillbox—tools of repair and relinquishment—rather than exposition. Final image of first footprints in melting snow reweights earlier ledger imagery without moralizing. One soft echo of prompt language (“unused courage waits”) is uttered by her past self, not narrator, so survives the ban.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lena’s sensory filter: wind scent, pillbox warmth, eye drift. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short beats when the man appears, mirroring threat. No head-hop; diction stays within her spy-trained precision. Dialogue is minimal, gravel-rough, and subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual cost,” “conceptual repricing”) appear in the rubric, not the story, so ignored. One mixed metaphor cluster around “ledger” and “vouchsafe” slightly thickens the climax, keeping it shy of 9-band purity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-war spy summoned by snow-code is familiar terrain, but the pillbox-as-ledger, the burn-scarred coat as map of failures, and the choice to leave the empty box behind give specific inflection. Risk lies in the quiet refusal to name sides or ideologies, forcing stakes onto personal absolution. Fresh enough to rise above template, though not radically so.</comment>
