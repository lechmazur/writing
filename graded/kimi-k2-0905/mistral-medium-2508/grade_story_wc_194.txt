<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—dynasty shame vs hunger for legacy—stays active: he strikes the floorboard because he both fears and needs the truth. Emotion is embodied (cold brass, breath-held wave) not labelled. The final micro-choice—writing for an unknown successor—caps a believable arc, though the shift from passive muser to bridge-scribe feels slightly abrupt; one more beat of visible cost would lift this to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pattern of “listen vs seek” tightens through sensory density (standing wave, mirror ripple) until meaning reweights. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias does not act dramatically but the ledger = room reconfigures stakes with felt cost—he forfeits certainty and embraces perpetual stewardship. Causality is internal and lyrical; still, the ledger-room equivalence is seeded early enough to satisfy because/therefore logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sepia reading room is sketched with economy: “golden shadows,” “mahogany,” “floorboard groove” all filter through Elias’s scholar-bred attention and constrain his next move (tuning the board). Micro-setting (mirror, crank) doubles as tool and symbol without crowding. Spatial choreography stays clean as he kneels, strikes, writes; no impossible positions. The environment’s final glow equates to his internal shift, giving the 9+ gate for constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he hear the dynasty’s truth—tightens once: from dismissal to acceptance of intuitive listening. Escalation is textural (density of wave imagery, mirror reversal) rather than causal reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Cost is conceptual, not visceral: he surrenders the safety of failure-narrative and accepts endless responsibility as bridge-keeper; visible price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: legacy is not a book but a room one must silently inhabit. Intuition = resonance between mind and physical space reframes inherited guilt into stewardship. Final image of golden ink drying reweights all prior shadows without moralizing. Subtext in mirrored self-confrontation carries the conceptual shift; no thesis statements intrude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—book-spine metaphors, acoustic metaphors—feels scholar-specific. Rhythm swells and narrows with procedural tension: short actions (“He struck it once—sharp, like a tuning fork”) against longer reflective swells. No filter-verb clutter; diction remains within erudite but not showy register. Lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence shapes tighten under discovery beats. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective (“skin of a molting serpent” appears once at high-pressure beat). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. Minor overworld near “symphony of scholars” but it’s brief and serves tone; does not disturb closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Conceptual twist—ledger = entire room seen via standing waves—feels fresh against familiar hidden-manuscript trope. Specific detail (blackened mirror, tuning the floorboard) grounds the invention. Synthesis of acoustics + generational guilt is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyrical structure pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
