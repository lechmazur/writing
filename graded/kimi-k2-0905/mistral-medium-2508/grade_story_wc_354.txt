<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—teacher of precision who questions the blood-drawn borders—drives every beat. The dented stone as tactile flaw-sensor embodies his need to translate silence into legible beauty; handing it to the girl externalizes the cost of that translation. Micro-choice hierarchy is vivid: he kneels to read earth-quivers instead of claiming victory, then renounces the board-edge he once taught. Earned renunciation lands with felt weight: the stone’s imperfection passed on, chest lighter than silence—palpable, scaled to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the worry-stone transfer crystallizes a new covenant between tutor and child, foreclosing Elias’s exile-loops with unmistakable emotional cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of gaps, pauses, magnetic shimmer accumulates until silence is re-weighted into breathable beauty. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“edge of the magnetic nexus”). No causality breaks; every beat enlarges the silence rather than explains it. Final image of the board “remembering how to breathe” recharges all prior gap-talk without moralizing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the dented basalt stone and magnetic field-lines function as environment, constraining every tactical choice (pawn hover, tremor-readings). Twilight scale narrows perception to shimmering air-paths, mirroring internal knight-moves that never landed. Sensory economy—single worn dent, vibrating ground—outperforms landscape breadth. Stone handed upward in final beat re-weights the whole spatial lattice; remove it and the closing breath collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence be made beautiful before the next phase erases all rules? Pressure tightens when the girl unveils the Eclipsed Covenant board, forcing Elias to decide whether to reenact the blood-opening or invent a gap-based reply. His renunciation (handing over the stone) forfeits authority yet creates the first non-violent covenant—cost legible in the lighter-than-silence chest. Agency throughout; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring gap motif: the ethical call to hear what boards refuse to say. No explicit thesis; final image of breathing board reweights all prior blood-edges into living silence. Subtext in gesture—stone transfer—answers the grandfather’s claim that “nexus remembers” without stating it. Complexity preserved: beauty is possible yet remains difficult, half-glimpsed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: magnetic tremors as knight-paths, silence as tactile substance. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“pawn trembled”—then exhales into longer cadence at hand-off. No head-hopping; girl’s voice is external, preserving mystery. Diction stays within exiled tutor’s lexicon—covenant, gambit, correlate—without academic inflation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often jobs—setting, metaphor, interior (“nexus hummed… like held breath… paths of knights”). No loops or synonym churn; figurative layers stay coherent (magnetic=chess=breath). Varied sentence rhythm mirrors pulse of field. Final line “game that had remembered how to breathe” lands clean without overwrite, recharging every prior gap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geomagnetism and chess stratagem feels fresh yet inevitable; premise commits fully without gimmick. Risk: lyric pause-structure could slump into abstraction, but stone-transfer grounds it. Echoes of “endgame” trope transformed through silence-translation task. Specificity—Opening of the Eclipsed Covenant scrubbed from history—anchors novelty in lived consequence.</comment>
