<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is consistent and embodied—his fear of “edges,” the trembling fingers, the decision to wave back—but the “conscience-for-hire” premise is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see a single client negotiation or price paid, so the sponge metaphor feels abstract. The decisive change (accepting uncertainty) is legible and earned, but the visible cost is diffuse—thread-dissolving is poetic rather than visceral. Interior contradiction is present yet muted; the final stance crystallizes but doesn’t quite sear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias reweights his lens from warning beam to invitation, accepting doubt with felt social cost—he waves to the smuggler, forfeiting moral purity. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each unraveled thread peels off borrowed guilt until only his voice remains. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—now a pulsing, questioning light—shapes the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse, shard, and wind chimes function as micro-setting: the chimes’ rising trill directly prompts Elias’s decision to step outside, and the mutable beam reconfigures meaning at the end. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—oil, wick, salt-foam—but broader maritime rules are assumed, not tested. Environment constrains choice: tide exposes the cloak; beam must be relit differently. No factual error, but occupational detail (lens polishing) is decorative, not choice-critical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep absorbing others’ guilt or risk owning his own uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens through each unraveled thread. One meaningful deepening: the shard whispers his own sins, not clients’, forcing a shift from external to internal stakes. Agency is visible in each unhooking; cost is conceptual—loss of moral clarity—rather than visceral, keeping escalation just shy of 8.8+ intensity. Coincidence is absent; pressure coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: certainty as a habit that must be unpicked thread by thread. Final image—dust settling on the lens—reweights the premise: clarity is not purity but allowance for obscurity. Subtext lives in gesture (the wave to the smuggler) and object state (hollow shard now silent). No moralizing; ambiguity is embraced. Thematic particulars (cloak becomes quilt) resist abstraction and linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “pink and gray—colors that refused to be named” is perceptually particular. Rhythm modulates—fragment bursts under chime-screams, then elongates with tea steam—without losing control. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon; wind-chime “language” is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal, but the woman’s cracked smile carries subtext. No register drift or template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and variegated: “he’d woven from borrowed doubts, each thread a confession he’d swallowed whole” does triple work (backstory, metaphor, motive). Occasional micro-loop—“the shard wasn’t for seeing. It was for listening”—reads as purposeful parallelism rather than churn. No mixed metaphors; sea and light imagery cohere. Final third avoids artifacts; dust-on-lens image is pristine. One paraphrase-loop near midpoint (−0.2) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: guilt as literal fiber that can be unpicked and dissolved into tide. The “conscience-for-hire” conceit is familiar, but its inversion—Elias discovering he’s been the true client—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in lyrical non-linear unraveling rather than confrontation, and it pays off in the pulsing beam. Specificity of lighthouse rituals and wind-chime “language” anchors universals. No close echoes; transformation is complete.</comment>
