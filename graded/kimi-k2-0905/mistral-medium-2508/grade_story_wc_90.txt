<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lien’s grief-hollowed perseverance is embodied in micro-choices—floating, stitching, re-threading the needle—each tied to her need to “push open a locked dimension.” The contradictory pull between surrender and stubborn mending is visible in-scene (“She had never been afraid of the dark, only of what waited in the light”). Final step-through costs her the ship and 300-year refuge; cost is scaled and felt. Voice stays singular; no status dynamics required.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each stitching attempt layers density until the photograph burns and the tear splits—one meaningful tightening. Closure is a Charged Poise: she crosses, ship dissolves, “she stayed” under green sky—options reconfigured, cost undeniable. Orientation is taught early via floating, bone-ship, console—no penalty. Causality of tears→photograph→stitch→breach holds; failure loops pay forward. Final image reweights sorrow into fertile ground.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting—the photograph’s shimmer of dried tears—functions as portal anchor and literally guides the stitching hand; it constrains every attempt and ignites at climax. Spatial choreography is clean: console, observation deck, gravity flickers track bodily. “Grass was green” final image recharges recurrent absence-of-color motif. Proper-noun economy: only *Eulogy*, Kwan Yin, Lien named—sufficient. Environment enables and forecloses tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: re-open locked dimension or accept eternal solitude—stated by 60-word mark. Escalation is accretive: each failed stitch narrows hope, thickens risk, until final thread holds and gravity rights itself. Cost is visible: 300 years, prior 46 terminated births, ship’s dissolution. No coincidence; all pressure born from her iterative agency. One meaningful deepening suffices; final “she stayed” crystallizes new stakes underfoot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated mending of absence: sorrow as raw material for genesis. Subtext lives in tactile verbs—“push,” “slide,” “unravel”—that quietly recast grief as creative force. Final green sky reprices prior monochrome despair without moralizing. No echoic thesis statement; meaning arises from concrete particulars. Emotional aftereffect is wonder rather than sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“ship of bones,” “gravity faltered just enough to let her float”) and paid off at exit. Syntax mirrors breathless weightlessness—fragments, em-dashes, iterative “She pushed.” No head-hopping; AI whisper remains external. Diction stays within Lien’s arcane-maker lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm accelerates with each stitching attempt, aligning to tension peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “The needle was a sliver of black glass, honed from the edge of a collapsed star” does world, tool, and myth in one stroke. Metaphors are coherent—bones/prayers, thread/breath, tear/absence—no mixed vehicles. Scaffolding minimal; one paraphrase loop (“stitch…stitch”) is motif-driven, waived. Final paragraph cadence slows to match grass-landing—ear test passes. Clean grammar, tense stable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise fuses cosmic bone-ship, maternal AI-ghost, and hand-stitched dimensional breach—fresh synthesis. Risk in lyric ellipsis is purposeful and repaid by legible closure. Transformation test fails if relocated: bone-hull, Kwan Yin tear, photo-shimmer are irreplicable. Sorrow-to-soil alchemy feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Bold structural compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
