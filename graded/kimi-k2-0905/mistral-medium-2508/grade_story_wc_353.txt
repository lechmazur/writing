<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—his need to hear vs. the world’s refusal to listen—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices (strumming, pressing the insulator). His renunciation of taking the insulator is earned and costly, visible in the final image. Interiority is embodied, not diagnostic. Cap imposed because the insulator’s weeping glaze is slightly too magical; the cost is felt but not fully grounded in his body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias leaves the insulator behind, crystallizing the grove as living instrument. Cost is legible in the salt-clouded ceramic and his numbed fingers. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through pattern and cadence until meaning is repriced. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting: its warming ceramic and weeping glaze constrain Elias’s grip and mark spent effort. Alder grove and cracked oak scaffold every sonic experiment; spatial choreography is clean. Final image—salt beads on the insulator—recharges the motif. Weather and light evolve with the musical cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove silence is not absence—tightens when the oak’s first true note startles birds and Elias realizes the grove can remember. Agency is accumulative: each strum deepens pattern until renunciation becomes the only non-betrayal. Cost is visible in the fever-hot insulator and his numbed fingers. No coincidence; pressure grows via sonic density.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy is not projection but letting the other speak in its own register. Final image reweights “music” from human artefact to ecological reciprocity—no moral stated. Subtext lives in the oak’s hollow chord answered by bird trill. Ambiguity is fruitful: is the weeping glaze mourning or sap? Reader left to re-price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: synesthetic, carpentered, sonic. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo of clauses, diminuendo into white space. Diction stays within his artisanal lexicon (“lute’s strings,” “grain still twisted”). No head-hopping; siskins remain other, their trill a genuine reply not ventriloquized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences (dawn light) to staccato fragments under sonic stress. Information density high: one sentence can place body, tool, acoustic finding, and memory. No loops or scaffold; “cracks” recurs with reweighted meaning, not repetition. Metaphors stay physical and consistent—no mixed vehicles. Minor hairline: “empathy in motion” is the closest to label-speak but saved by immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Tree-song sculptor is fresh, yet the silent-world trope is familiar; specificity of porcelain insulator as amplifier and the salt-weeps transform it. Risk in lyric cadence pays off—closure charged by sonic pattern rather than plot twist. Emotional truth of letting the world speak back feels non-obvious. Hedged 0.1 for faint echo of eco-pastoral mode, but execution is singular.</comment>
