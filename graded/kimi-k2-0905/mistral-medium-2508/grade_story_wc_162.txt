<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his breath hitching, fingers reading wood grain—but Liora remains a symbol (“featherly determined,” “sacred shake”) rather than a child whose contradictory wants we feel. The final climb-down is motivated, yet the prior beat where he simply “understood” her cryptic pronouncement is abstract, not embodied. Still, his flawed paternal need to control vs. surrender tracks cleanly to the earned stasis inside the sinkhole.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias descends the homemade ladder, surrendering authority to Liora’s realm; the firefly pulse reweights the maze from confinement to threshold. Causality holds: the logbook’s BFE-7 code and grain-reading steer him to the sinkhole ladder he would never have trusted earlier. Orientation is anchored by ~120 w; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible—he relinquished the designer’s center and stays below ground, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Terrace prism, cornstalk whip, kerosene logbook—each detail is filtered through Elias’s designer gaze and either steers choice (grain arrow) or reappears charged (sinkhole quilts). Spatial choreography is clean: porch → terrace → maze rows → ladder descent. Weather/threshold shimmer stays consistent, constraining perception. Micro-setting (folded corn-husk boat) guides discovery and constrains the note’s placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—father’s need to recover child—tightens when he realizes the maze’s true center is the grave-like sinkhole; that reversal forecloses the prize-bench exit and forces descent. Agency remains Elias’s: each clue (grain, husk, ladder) is a micro-choice under rising emotional cost. No coincidence resolves; the butterfly-effect code merely explains prior unease. Price is legible: he accepts indefinite underground exile to share Liora’s sacred threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through descent: control vs. reverence for unknowable thresholds. Firefly spiral/door imagery reweights the earlier “butterfly effect” from storm code to ontological shift, avoiding overt thesis. Final image offers quiet conceptual repricing: what was designed to confuse becomes a holy site, but this is shown, not stated. Some symbolic convenience in “sacred shake” and child-as-oracle keeps it from higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual lens: “cornstalks whispering in a fractured hush” mirrors his guilt. Syntax tightens under pressure—no filter-verb clusters; diction (“featherly,” “warped floorboard”) is character-specific. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids therapy-speak. Compression (“Took you enough”) is taught and paid off. Voice modulation from cerebral architect to humbled father is coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templates. A few overwritten figurations—“light like poorly aimed scissors,” “rows bent inward like a held sigh”—but they do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and motivation. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “like” similes could compress; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The corn-maze-as-ontological-door reframes a rural trope into mythic threshold without genre furniture. Logbook weather codes and furniture-grain forensics feel fresh, particular to a designer’s mindset. Transformation test passes: swap architect identity and the grain-reading clue collapses. Risk in lyrical child oracle is partially earned via sinkhole world-building, though Liora’s wisdom skirts twee. Specificity of chair-leg ladder and firefly semaphore keeps ingenuity alive.</comment>
