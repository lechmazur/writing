<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—penance vs. hunger for cosmic inscription—are alive in every beat; the micro-choice to grind and then press the moonstone dust into flesh makes exile feel like a door left ajar. Final renunciation (“the sea would rise and fall without her”) lands with cost visible in the charged poise of her inked skin. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: “memory was a kind of drowning” flirts with abstraction, but is instantly re-grounded by the heron vanishing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (moonstone, heron, Orion, ink) layers density until the final cadence reweights the stake—she becomes the gap. Closure is a Charged Poise: skin-map confesses exile as chosen door, cost legible in the sky “being drawn” into her. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive before 120 wds and serve the final image. Zero causality breaks; every metaphor obeys its own physics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Twilight garden is not backdrop but instrument: pond fractures Orion, lilies cut flesh, reeds swallow heron—each detail constrains the method (gaps) and charges the final inscription. Micro-setting (her own wrist) functions as altar and canvas, body-as-setting fused to stakes. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: tide dancer notices tide-less things—crushed nightshade, dust refusing scatter. No spatial drift; every object tracked across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she survive self-inscription without the sea’s rhythm?—tightens once: dust bites, forecloses retreat, inks “I was the shore…” onto flesh. Escalation is textural: each image adds weight until the sky leans in; cost is visible (blood-ink, skin no longer hers). Agency pure—every beat is her hand, her breath, her silence. No external coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: exile as self-authorship, silence as medium, body as map. Moonstone, heron, Orion, ink form a returning constellation whose final reprice—“they would call it heresy… she would call it home”—flips social cost into private triumph. No moralizing; the insight is etched, not stated. Reader left holding the contradiction between beauty and heresy without forced sympathy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is irreducible: syntactic tide—long liquid clauses that break into staccato fragments under pressure (“She watched. / A heron…”). Diction stays within tide-dancer’s ken—no academic bleed. Perceptual signature absolute: nostalgia ban, tide rhythms, star-drawn light filter every noticing. Rhythm accelerates with breath-hold, then exhales into final smile—pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence either advances image or tightens the weave. Figurative density is extreme yet never muddled—vehicles stay internally consistent (tide, star, blade, map). Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke. Minor hairline: “obsidian grace” risks purple, but the phrase is earned by the knife-sharp garden world already built.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic tattoo as tide replacement, exile-as-door, memory-as-drowning—each familiar metaphor twisted until it cuts. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot—pays off in closure legibility. No stock fantasy furniture; even moonstone dust is repurposed from jewelry to skin-anchor. Final smile reconfigures entire preceding ache, feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>
