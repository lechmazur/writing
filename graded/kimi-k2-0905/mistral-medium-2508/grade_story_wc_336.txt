<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger-to-shape is shown through tactile grafting and the knife-hum against his thigh; the final self-wonder (“what might grow him”) is a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—“juice thick, electric” rather than labels. One hairline slip: the girl’s “They fade here” leans toward exposition, not embodied perception, keeping this just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the silver sapling outside + the villagers’ iridescent eyes reweight the rule-set with undeniable social cost. Causal链路 holds: because Elias gives the seed and paints the girl, therefore the veil allows return and a new tree exists. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end. Cost is legible in the single line “Elias—finally let himself wonder what might grow him,” a path now foreclosed to rest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The parapet stones, mist, and waterfall breath are filtered through Elias’s pruner-eye: he notices branch angles, not tourist vistas. The silver-veined seed and twilight-hued apple act as micro-settings that constrain the only possible cuts. Final image of the lone silver-leafed saplet recharges the earlier “seed not meant for soil,” locking setting to closure. Missing gate for 9+: environment does not actively block or enable the final cut—Elias could have stepped through anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—tightens once: when Elias realizes the seed must cross, not bury. Protagonist agency drives every beat: the slice to give, not take, narrows his future to perpetual exile. Cost is visible in the sapling debt and the villagers’ dazed iridescence. Slight reserve: escalation is single-turn, not compounded; still sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges only through image and gesture: seed, sapling, apple, iridescent eyes—no statement. Final apple-moment reprises first seed-moment, reweighting “wonder is not kept but passed through.” Ambiguity is purposeful: orchard may be real, memory, or both. No sermonizing; even the girl’s whisper is concrete, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: calloused palms, knife-hum, branch-angle noticing. Syntax mirrors pruning rhythm—short cuts, then lyrical spillover. No head-hop; girl’s voice is external dialogue only. One hairline tic: “wonder was not something you kept…” edges toward aphorism, but cadence earns it.</comment>

<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates into the veil-crossing, then breathes at the sapling reveal. Information density high—“its colors too vivid for mortal eyes” does triple duty: world-rule, stake, foreshadow fade. Minor register lift in “iridescent shine” is justified by POV’s painterly hunger.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fantasy portal trope is inverted: the other world is not escape but raw pigment bank, pruner becomes pigment donor. Risky quiet ending—no battle, no return—paid off by conceptual reprice. Specificity of grafting craft and silver-veined seed makes the magic feel discovered, not imported. Synthesis feels inevitable: a man who shapes trees finally lets trees shape him.</comment>
