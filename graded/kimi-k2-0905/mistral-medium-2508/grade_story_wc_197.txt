<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lena’s “harmless archivist” label and her boot-concealed key give her a sharp, usable contradiction; the interior line “she wasn’t a hero” feels diagnostic but her later micro-choice to pocket-warm the key and step into the shallows embodies the cost of endurance. Yet her emotional spectrum stays narrow—no moment of fury, panic, or genuine doubt breaks through the calm register, so the renunciation feels efficient rather than torn. The ledger theft is referenced off-stage; because we don’t see her hands trembling while she lifts it, the beat leans summary and caps how high the arc can rise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The beats progress in accumulative cadence: key wait → booth reappear → names flicker → archive burns; causality is present but external (Council moves, Rook radios) and Lena’s final agency is reported, not dramatized. Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise—“the line held” reweights all prior cracks—and the cost is conceptual (she vanishes into myth), yet the ledger theft lacks on-screen enactment so the decisive change is slightly distanced. Orientation is clear by line 8; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon’s starlit water and ozone air constrain timing (“only when the sky bled violet”) and supply the map that steers her; the booth’s glass and static serve as micro-setting that alters tactics. Selective sensory focus—rusted key, dangling receiver—keeps imagery lean, though the lagoon never physically impedes or wounds her, muting its role as crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes—“save the last archive”—are declared late via Rook’s radio, so tension is more atmospheric than visceral until then. Escalation is textural: names accumulate, booth walls shift, dawn nears; the deepening pattern reweights meaning but the protagonist’s on-page risk is listening, not intervening. Because the fire happens off-stage, the visible price is conceptual rather than felt in a beat she owns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: memory as insurgency against indifference. The repeated callback to “the line held” crystallizes the idea that small refusals, not grand gestures, keep conscience alive. No moralizing paragraph intrudes; resonance arises from the ledger’s silence and the diner’s ordinariness, letting the reader complete the repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, starlit cadence with satisfying compression: “the receiver dangling like a broken promise.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Lena notices reflections, static, receipts. Micro-register slips (“tyranny of indifference”) flirt with thesis-speak but occur only once; overall texture stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, openings avoid algorithmic drums, and density is high: one line often marries image, memory, and stakes. Occasional poetic abstractions (“liquid memory,” “pretty lie under the sun”) verge on mixed metaphor yet remain legible; the final “the line held” lands crisply, no loop obscures closure. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The puddle-map, rusted-key pseudo-tech, and vanished-booth magic feel fresh because they serve an archivist’s quiet insurgency rather than pyrotechnic rebellion. The “Quiet Rebellion” coda reframes micro-acts as historically momentous, transforming trope into elegy. Specificity—boot, ledger, diner coffee—anchors novelty in concrete want.</comment>
