<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The loom spinner’s interior contradiction—grief vs. the compulsion to keep weaving—is dramatized in her body (trembling fingers, teeth cracking amber) and in the loom itself as surrogate heart. Each micro-choice—cracking the bead, weaving through the night, hanging the tapestry—tracks a hierarchy of values: reunion > self-preservation. The final endurance (her bones in the roots) is earned by the prior causality that the message can travel only if the sender stays; the cost is scaled and felt. No therapy-speak, no label drift; voice stays coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silver dust on the absent lover’s palm reweights the rule-set—communication across worlds is possible but only at the price of permanent separation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence is accreted into material, then into tapestry, then into dust; the final image crystallizes options with undeniable cost. Persistent constraint (sender must stay) shapes every tactic. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard-bamboo fusion is not backdrop but tool: the apple skeleton provides the branch from which the tapestry is hung, the bamboo’s whisper supplies the ambient hush that the amber drinks in. Spatial choreography is clean—bead half-buried in loam, loom under the branch, tapestry dissolving into distance. Weather (dawn wind) triggers the dissolution beat. Environment charges the final image: the loom spinner’s bones root in the same soil she threaded, sealing the micro-setting loop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—send message across impossible distance—tightens when the bead’s silence is converted to thread; the act forecloses reunion for the spinner and sets the price for the lover. Escalation is one decisive intensification: weaving the silence into the map. Cost is visceral: her lifetime, her body, her name. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, perfectly scaled to lyric scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the asymmetry of love and transmission: one must stay anchored in organic decay so the other can keep moving through glass echoes. The motif of weaving itself is not decorative but causal—every thread is a unit of sacrifice. Final silver dust reprises the first silver strand, repricing the premise that art can reconcile absence only by institutionalizing it. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic, non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the spinner’s perceptual signature: “stoically sparkling” is an oxymoron only she would coin; “raveling silence” is her native idiom. Syntax lengthens and contracts with loom rhythm—long clauses while weaving, abrupt fragments at the crack of amber. No head-hop; the distant lover’s POV is framed as external tableau, maintaining distance control. Patterned elision (“—not sound, but the shape of it”) is taught early and paid off in the dust image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear is excellent: cadence mirrors loom motion, with periodic short beats to mimic thread tension. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new sensory or conceptual layer. Figurative language is disciplined—only two metaphors per crisis beat, both internally coherent. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of weaving + astrophysical silence as transport medium is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure—lyric montage across decades—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of “jigsaw puzzle edges found in rummage sale boxes of the universe” reframes cosmology as domestic craft, transforming both tropes. Transformation test passes: story collapses if any proper noun or image is swapped.</comment>
