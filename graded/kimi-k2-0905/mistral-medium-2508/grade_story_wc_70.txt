<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s inherited compulsion to blurt truth is shown only in two label-lines (“the truth clawed up his throat,” “the truth rose in him”) rather than embodied contradiction mid-action; the lacquer box is handled repeatedly but its emotional charge is asserted, not demonstrated under pressure, so the ancestry weight feels summarised. His final micro-choice—planting the seed—carries visible cost (empty box, light chest), yet the interior contradiction that should make that act frightening for a truth-cursed man is skipped. Acceptable for length, but the core affliction never complicates a beat the way the premise promises.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the blackout silence intensifies sensory density and reweights the dominant stake (routine vs wonder) until the seed-image crystallises a new cadence. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—“the air tasted of rain and possibility”—with felt conceptual cost (tolls will return, engineers will disbelieve). Orientation is anchored by word 60; only one soft causal leap—storm → instantaneous beehive failure is accepted because the text later assigns agency to the seed act. No cap triggered; lite causal hiccup doesn’t touch the reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>Vertical-farm grid, copper-warm tower ribs, ozone wind, and lacquer-smooth edges supply tactile micro-setting that guides the planting choice. Drone choreography stays spatially coherent; the city’s vertical scale is sketched through dock-points and lattice wings rather than postcard skyline. Lightning tower doubles as body-proxy (cold rungs, warm ribs) and charges the final image—warm sunrise felt, not seen. Detail economy is tight; no exposition dump; environment is navigated, not catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring wonder inside a seamless city—surfaces early and tightens once: seed-in-node forces a public trade-off (wonder vs predictable grid). Cost is visible—Elias’s empty box, his impending disbelief by engineers—but the escalation is single-pulse; no secondary narrowing of options. Agency is present but not high-stakes peril; the tightening is lyrical, not tactical. Sufficient for length, yet a sharper physical risk or resource loss could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder-versus-efficiency emerges through drone choreography shift, not sermon. Final image reweights earlier toll-credit system without moral tag. Subtext in the matchbox riddle pays off conceptually; ambiguity lingers (will wonder survive dawn?). No thematic echo cliché; the child’s gap-toothed grin carries non-literal answer. Complex enough to invite re-read, avoids tidy maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—wind scent, lacquer edges, drone lights “like fireflies”—with rhythmic compression under stress. Free-indirect (“the words had itched under his skin”) is clean, no filter-verb bloat. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on syntax; occasional inversion (“raw as honey from a crushed comb”) reads purposeful and voice-consistent. No head-hop; distance stable; elision taught early (“no one crossed since the blackout”) and paid off in final crowd gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence stems avoid algorithmic drumbeat. Figurative layer (“hummed like a struck tuning fork,” “wings stuttering like a held breath”) is selective, not cluttered; metaphors stay physically coherent. One paraphrase pair—“lacquer box… passed down like the toll keeper’s duty” / “a job no one applied for but no one could refuse”—slips into restatement; mild −0.2. No scaffold loops in final third; information density high; opening and closing lines bracket voice cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-cyber-collapse pollinator-drones + inherited truth-curse + mythic seed fuses fresh angle on “re-enchant the city” trope. Riddle-act mechanises theme without feeling grafted; matchbox label’s burnt-sugar ink is idiosyncratic sensory twist. Could tip higher if Elias’s curse had forced a more painful ethical choice; as is, risk is aesthetic rather than moral. Still, specificity of detail keeps premise from feeling template.</comment>
