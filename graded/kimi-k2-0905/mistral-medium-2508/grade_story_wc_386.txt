<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is sensorily anchored and contradictory—she comforts yet withholds, grieves yet commodifies grief. The widow’s single scene still forces a micro-choice that alters both women’s stance. Micro gestures (thumb on jagged locket, palms to warped glass) externalize hierarchy of values without label-speak. Cost is visible: she trades her own unquiet memory to refract the widow’s, enduring the shrine’s fresh groan as payment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Lena lighting a candle beside the glacier’s “sigh” reweights salvaging—grief is not fixed but endlessly mined. Accumulative lens holds throughout: each object (globe, locket, altar ice) accrues spectral residue until the widow’s departure lets silence accumulate as earned stasis. Orientation is taught by line 4 (glacier shrine, post-wreck timeline). Causal micro-beats (widow touches globe → sees child) tighten once, then widen to Lena’s self-exposure; cost is felt when she admits she “kept the parts worth saving” while pressing rust to glass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glacier ice and candlelight constrain every beat—flames mirrored in melted glass, altar names legible only because ice is carved. The snow globe’s “teardrop of glass” functions as micro-setting: its curvature dictates what vision is possible, literally refracting the ghost. Spatial choreography is pristine: widow kneels, Lena crouches, palms meet globe, salt-diesel scent blooms. Final image of Lena’s hand on ice while glacier “sighs” makes environment an active participant in the cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage purity from wreckage—signaled in paragraph 1 and deepened when Lena risks her own traumatic relic. Single meaningful tightening occurs when the globe reveals the child instead of the fisherman, forcing widow and Lena to trade grief currencies. Visible price: Lena’s memory of mother’s silent reproach surges, glacier groans louder—pressure made audible. Coincidence absent; revelation stems from Lena’s deliberate “expose” action pressing globe to palms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: salvage is recursive—every rescued purity births new wreckage inside the salvager. Subtext resides in silence—the fisherman’s faced-away ghost, the mother’s wordless accusation—creating dramatic irony reader feels before Lena names it. Final image of another candle reconfigures meaning: consolation is just another crack letting borrowed starlight in. No moralizing; resonance arises from particularity of rusted locket versus fused snow globe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Lena’s perceptual signature—“blue veins pulsing,” “old silver” voices—diction marine yet glacial. Rhythm contracts under pressure: fragments (“She never did”) alternate with liquid long sentences mirroring tide. No head-hopping; widow’s interior accessed only through Lena’s reading of breath and tremor. Dialogue minimal but indirection perfect: widow’s “That’s not him” carries betrayal and relief in four words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose shows high density: one sentence fuses metaphor, backstory, and causality—“its hull splitting like a wishbone against the berg.” No loops or synonym churn; each sensory return (salt, diesel, ice) adds new informational layer. One mixed metaphor risk—“light pouring like tide”—but justified by coastal setting and paid off in closure. Minor scaffold: repetitive “Lena pressed” in adjoining clauses, but rhythm supports ritual motion rather than dullness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ghost-whisperer trope is inverted: medium traffics not in solace but in uncomfortable redirection, monetizing memory. Glacier shrine carved by widow’s own chisel reframes Arctic gothic into intimate workshop. Melted snow globe as revelation device feels inevitable, not whimsical, because physics of warped glass dictates vision. Risk of lyrical overload accepted and managed—pattern taught early (“blue veins pulsing”) and earns lushness by climax.</comment>
