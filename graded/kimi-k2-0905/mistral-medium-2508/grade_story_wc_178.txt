<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Qishti’s interiority—"measured steps," "frugal rhythm," "pulse quickened, not with greed, but with the empirically ironic thrill"—is concrete and idiosyncratic. His contradictory impulses (scientific skepticism vs. craving the unseen) coexist in-scene and drive the tile choice. The final kneel is a credibly earned renunciation of numerical certainty; the cost is felt when the lines tattoo themselves onto his skin, foreclosing a purely quantitative life. Minor deduction: the epiphany is slightly articulated ("some devotions are too vast for numbers") rather than purely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: placing the tile on the altar rewrites both palace walls and his skin, paying the visible cost of abandoning measurable certainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of "counting" vs. "feeling" intensifies until the schematic migrates onto his body. Causal chain holds: loose tile ➔ cipher ➔ altar ➔ cosmic rewrite; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by line 3 ("palace halls," "cracked mosaic floors") well below 120-word threshold. Persistent constraint: the vanished tile and etched hands make the new covenant irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The palace is rendered through tactile micro-details—warm tile, damp breath from the passage, torch flicker on etched angles—that constrain when and how Qishti acts. Body-as-setting functions when his ink-stained robe and later skin-trace serve as the final "walls" he must inhabit. Sensory hierarchy is astronomer-specific: light angles, temperature differentials, schematic lines优先 over tourist filler. The black tile as micro-object charges the ending by becoming part of his body; environment literally enters him. Gate cleared: recurring object constrains final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he settle for measurable stars or risk the immeasurable covenant—is signaled early ("empirically ironic thrill"). One meaningful tightening: pressing tile to pillar splits stone and forecloses retreat; cost is immediate (air thick with "older breath," lines etched into skin). Agency remains his throughout; coincidence is absent. Escalation is textural: each tracing of angles deepens pattern density until schematic jumps from stone to flesh, reweighting the stake irreversibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of measurement itself: devotion is encrypted not in numbers but in the unreadable lines that finally write themselves onto the devotee. No explicit thesis; the phrase "What is measured is never lost" is re-priced when its inverse is proven—what is felt is never lost—via the skin-trace. Final smile and lens-adjustment offer resonant, non-literal answer: the dialogue has begun, morality of vastness unresolved. Micro-motif of "counting" (sand, tiles, stars) shifts from survival to surrender without authorial commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly anchored to Qishti’s perceptual filter: "slow, indifferent arcs," "frugal rhythm," "empirically ironic thrill" are diction choices no other character would make. Syntax lengthens and contracts with his attention—short clauses when ciphering, rolling cadence when descending passage. No head-hopping; palace and stars are externalized only through his professional gaze. Register remains scholarly-ancient without anachronism; "starless sky," "cosmos where stars were...living eyes" maintain consistent metaphoric universe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally: "sandals whispering...where kings had once strode" balances sibilance against hard consonants. Information density high—single sentences layer palace decay, personal frugality, and astronomical vocation. Figurative language is selective: "stone groaned, then split like a fruit" is brief yet visceral; no metaphor pile-up in peak beat. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Final sentence lands on monosyllabic punch: "He smiled, adjusted his lens, and returned to work"—propulsive closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The encrypted-devotion premise is fresh: a love-letter written in schematics that eventually colonizes the lover’s body. Risk of abstract concept is fully accepted—no treasure, no antagonist, only epistemic surrender—and paid off. Transformation test fails if Qishti is swapped out; only an astronomer-countant would experience this exact inversion. Specific synthesis of frugality, schematic language, and palace-after-regime feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold quietude: cosmic covenant sealed by skin-trace rather than spectacle.</comment>
