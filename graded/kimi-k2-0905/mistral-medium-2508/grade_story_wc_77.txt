<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysander’s interior contradiction—dead but ambulatory, camera-shy yet selfie-haunted—drives every beat; the moment he claws out his own heartbeat-negative, the cost is literal and earned. Motivation stays legible: trick fear to reclaim agency after clinical resurrection. Emotional embodiment is vivid (“bleeding into the negative”), never diagnostic. The only drag: the advisor stays off-page, so relationship-as-crucible bullet is N/A; headcount stays coherent.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the raven-clasp snaps shut on the last ember, reweighting the rule-set—photos will still smear, but now on his terms. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: mirror-oil, burnt-sugar air, filmstrip ignition tighten the cadence toward the final image. Orientation is taught early (ticket-booth shards, mirror-lung) and pays off inside the spiral. Cost is unmistakable: “his reflection… winked” signals ownership of the curse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Funhouse is handled as body-scale tool: mirrors yield like tissue, spiral corridors trackable in single POV. Micro-setting objects—opera-clasp, film-strip—constrain tactics (clasp click = release mechanism). Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but justified by photographic curse. Spatial choreography stays clean through the lunge-through-mirror beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“unbosom the thing that wears your face”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when he extracts the heartbeat-negative, foreclosing return to pre-resuscitation anonymity. Escalation is textural: each mirror smear intensifies the stake until the clasp snaps. Agency is active; no coincidence resolves. Cost is the permanent photographic curse, now weaponized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the motif of reflection-as-theft: fear isn’t darkness but the frame that claims to light it. Subtext operates in the advisor’s whispered razor-glass voice and the lipstick-scrawled “Next,” implying cyclical predation. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Final wink reconfigures shame as power—earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is baroque-horror: “silvered surfaces warping the dark like a lung”—yet diction stays within a perceptive undead showman. Rhythm accelerates into staccato during the lunge, then exhales with the mirrors’ silver tears. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“You’re armed with a whisper”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or action; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent (lung-mirror, film-heartbeat). Register stable; no filter-verb clusters. Minor risk: “repulsive allure” is abstract, but immediately embodied in the puddle-wink. Final line propels outward—“the game… remembered how to play”—without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: photographic curse + funhouse mirrors + resuscitation-as-undeath feels inevitable in hindsight. The heartbeat-negative is a literalized metaphor never seen before. Risk—letting the antagonist be a mirror-self—pays off by making fear the bed, not the monster. No trope bingo; every device is re-cast through Lysander’s specific existential loophole.</comment>
