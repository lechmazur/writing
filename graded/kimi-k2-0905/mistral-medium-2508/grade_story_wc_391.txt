<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lior’s patient horizon-mapping credo is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—ear to metal, palm to basalt—so the final renunciation of fire-brand kin feels earned. Interior contradiction is present but thin; sister’s accusation is the only on-page counter-voice, so the “coward / revolutionary” tension never pressurizes choice in-scene. Still, the endurance costs him solidarity and warmth, visible in the frost on his cheek as he walks alone onto the bridge, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: moon-tracking data → anticipatory stillness → viaduct surrender. Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: “He walked forward… toward the patient, wild unknown” reconfigures revolution from noise to horizon-reveal, cost paid in exile and years of solitude. One micro-turn (ice groans, bridge lifts) is sufficient at this length; escalation is quiet but causally linked. Orientation is secure at word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen lake, basalt cliff, and moon-aligned iron viaduct are not backdrop but instruments: the ice must bear his weight and the viaduct must obey lunar torque for the climax to occur. Sensory selection is POV-tuned—magnetic hum through boot soles, glass-breath dawn—never touristic. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (viaduct strut under palm) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove that patience, not violence, unyokes the world—tightens once: ice shifts from prison to launchpad. Protagonist agency is continuous observation; the final lift is external yet causally seeded by his moon-path calculations, so cost remains legible. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under quiet causal lens. Visible price: ostracism and surrender of heroic drama.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</answer><comment>Theme emerges without statement: patience as insurrectionary force. Subtext resides in silence—no slogans, only breath-clouds and metal vibration. Final image of horizon “slowly revealing itself” reweights prior accusations of cowardice into quiet victory. No late moralizing; resonance is image-locked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within Lior’s lexicon—horizon mapper, moon drag, magnetic song. Rhythm escalates toward short declaratives at lift moment, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is carried by perceptual signature: “a single breath of glass,” “celestial unyoking.” Patterned repetition (“patience,” “waiting”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are integrated—“unyoking of weight from burden”—and do not collide. One scaffold risk: “the real work had never been in the breaking / it had been in the waiting” is a near-paraphrase loop, but the beat serves as thematic hinge and escapes penalty by tightening stakes. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moon-aligned viaduct as revolutionary agent is fresh; patience而非violence trope is inverted through geophysical specificity. Risk taken: quiet climax in a genre expecting thunder, yet coherence holds. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—every detail seeds the final lift. Not a recombinant template; removal of lunar mechanics collapses plot.</comment>
