<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—hunger for the stone vs. terror of his own sight—are alive in every tactile beat; the mercury residue he leaves on spines embodies the price. The final act of writing glyphs onto shelves is the earned, irreversible cost: he trades isolation for custodianship, foreclosing an ordinary life. Interiority stays concrete (“silver turning to storm”), never retreating into label-speak. Only the childhood suppression is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the earliest causal root.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ledger reconfigures identity (“Keeper of the Unsaid”) and the door seals, leaving him inside a womb of blank shelves whose emptiness is the visible cost. Causal linkage holds: the feather-texture → map → seed → ledger each because/therefore narrows his options to one. The mountain–bookstore conceit is taught by sentence 1 and paid off when the mountain exhahes at the touch of the stone. Early orientation is flawless; only the 12-year-old backstory is told in summary, not shown, a minor ellipsis that does not break lens or cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but pressure system: spiralling shelves force spiralling memory, cracked atlas pages literally prop the relic, and the circular empty room awaits his future words. Micro-setting objects—mercury streaks, folded blank page, glyph-etched lectern—constrain every choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: titles distort only when he blinks; dust tastes “like shattered stars.” Final image of empty shelves ready to be inscribed charges the closing beat with anticipatory weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice the unsaid or keep swallowing it—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the stone mirror forces full recall. The single reversal: stone-as-key becomes stone-as-mirror reweights the entire quest from external solution to internal graft. Price is visible: mercury storm in his eyes, door sealed forever, future erased into custodianship. No coincidence; every escalation is driven by his touch, blink, breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—language as living root, not relic—emerges through the seeding trope without once stating a maxim. Subtext flourishes in silence: the mountain’s exhale, the blank ledger, the unwritten shelves speak louder than any thesis. Final image of “home” redefined as an internal script offers resonant non-literal answer. Only faint risk of lyrical abstraction is kept grounded by tactile verbs (“he tore the page free, folded it into a seed”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is mercury-silver throughout: every noticed thing warps, reflects, or leaves metallic trace, aligning syntax with sight. Figurative language is disciplined—never more than one image per sentence in peak beats—so metaphor heightens rather than clogs. No dialogue, hence no register slippage; narration stays within a seer’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into short, unadorned clauses at the door-crossing, mirroring breathless stakes.</comment>

<comment>Prose is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, every sentence advances image or motion. Opening line anchors voice and conceit simultaneously; final line recharges “feather / key / him” triad with crystalline compression. Only microscopic hedge—“like shattered stars” skirts cliché—but the POV’s mercury gaze justifies the sparkle. Density high yet transparent: “He tore the page free, folded it into a seed” performs three actions in nine words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The bookstore-inside-mountain, language-as-seed, and memory-as-mirror synthesize into a singular mythic yet intimate architecture that feels inevitable in hindsight. Transforming the “dead language” trope into a living horticulture of glyphs is a fresh inflection executed with conceptual rigor. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot—pays off because the closure image still reweights stakes rather than escaping them. No derivative echo; even the feather becomes a tool, not symbol.</comment>
