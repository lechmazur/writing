<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to decode yet forced to unlearn—drives every beat; the jump is not a stunt but the earned release of gravity-as-assumption, paying the cost of her mentor’s creed in one crystallized gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the dish’s groan → shard’s hum → city’s song form a tightening crescendo that reweights silence from absence to presence; the final image of reversed gravity is a Conceptual Repricing that makes the cost of un-learning undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The rust-flake spiral, cracked parabola dish, and gorge acoustics are not backdrop but constraint-tools that shape how she tunes and how we hear the final note; the star fragment’s shift from prop to bone-hum is micro-setting at its finest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—hear the unheard—tightens through sensory escalation: static → single note → bone-hum; each intensification forecloses an old way of listening and makes the final jump the only remaining stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ironic inversion of signal/silence: the beginning is found only by accepting ending-as-weight; the moonlit gorge’s song offers a non-literal answer that reconfigures the reader’s own ear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”) teaches its pattern early and pays off in the reversed-gravity cadence; perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s noticing is always tuned to frequency over form.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “the dish groaned…silence—not absence, but a presence” packs causality and metaphor without muddle; final line’s “spat it back as light” lands sonic closure with imagistic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of Hollywood relic + radio ruins + lunar perigee feels inevitable, not quirky; the fake-star-as-cosmic-key transforms trope into fresh ontology, risking reversal-of-gravity yet earning it through prior sonic logic.</comment>
