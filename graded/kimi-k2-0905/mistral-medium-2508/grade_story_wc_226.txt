<comment>Liora’s interiority is concrete—charcoal dust under nails, ears tuned to vocal fractures—and her contradictory impulses (defiance vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously as she carves. The micro-choice to climb sideways, not toward the spire, crystallizes her value hierarchy at visible cost (bleeding fingers). The arc from sly poem-slipping to public sabotage is earned; only the final “heart lighter” feels slightly abstract, a hairline slip after such embodied cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spire’s shattering reweights the forgiveness rule-set with undeniable social cost (elders scream under the torrent of returned confessions). The causal chain—sigil tracing → poem carving → refracted echo weapon—holds without skips; each beat tightens options. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“The canyon breathed…”). Persistent constraint: the bone towers grown from sin literally vibrate under her palm, shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Recurring object—the Needle of Absolution—constrains every tactical move and is recharged at the end when its shards become the new writing surface. Sensory hierarchy follows POV bias: Liora notices condensation of “held breaths,” marrow thick with unspoken names. Micro-setting (the fissure in the third tower) is exploited for acoustic amplification, tying geography to climax. Spatial choreography is clean: sideways climb, claw-holds, echo trajectory track logically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who will bear the weight of sin—tightens once: when Liora realizes the spire scatters guilt to oblivion, she weaponizes that very scattering. Escalation is driven by her agency (carve faster, bleed, whisper) under Causal lens; the ritual’s falter is direct consequence of her refracted verses. Cost is visceral: blood on bone, screams swallowed by mist. Only one deepening, but it forecloses absolution forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific paradox: forgiveness that demands payment is mercy rebranded. Subtext lives in gesture—elders’ chant faltering, mist thickening—never thesis. Final image of carving into shards offers resonant non-literal answer: truth must be broken to be owned. No moralizing; complexity intact—Liora’s victory is also desecration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“walls of bone humming”) and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is tactile-acoustic: dust, vibration, echo. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within Liora’s artisan lexicon (sigil, chalk, carve). A few hyphenated compounds (“bone-dust,” “needle-drawn”) risk mannerism but read as consistent poetic license.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “condensation of a thousand held breaths” does three jobs—image, stakes, world rule. Rhythm accelerates with short paratactic clauses during climb; longer sentence collapses into scream-crescendo. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (spire as mirror, salt dissolution). Only micro-slip: “forged hush” is lovely but abstract; its meaning is felt, not defined, requiring reader leap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar religious-absolution trope is inverted via geology of guilt: towers grown from confessions, spire as prism not conduit. Specificity—sigil carved into living bone, echo as projectile—makes premise fresh. Risk taken: lyric compression over exposition; pays off. Transformation test fails if relocated out of canyon, confirming originality.</comment>
