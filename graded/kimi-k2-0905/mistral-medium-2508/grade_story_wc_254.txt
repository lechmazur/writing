<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is textured—her synesthetic merger with quartz, the kinesthetic “unspooling” of exile—but the turn from pilgrim to boundary-dissolver is declared more than dramatized; the final smile reads as authorial commentary rather than embodied cost. The elders’ fear is inferred, never personified, so her rebellion lacks a counter-force that would sharpen stakes. Still, her perceptual signature stays sharp and the micro-choice to kneel at the thawing lake is a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the lake’s mirror *answers*—a Conceptual Repricing that flips exile into authorship. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each spiral step thickens texture until the glyphs rewrite themselves. The “ban was never about keeping them out” reversal is earned by the humming quartz pattern taught from line 1. Orientation is swift; who-where-when anchored in first 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The quartz colonnade and thawing lake are not backdrop but interface: their vibration literally rewrites Elira’s nerve-map, and the final black mirror *answers*—setting as actor. Frost-kicked stone, lantern-moth hush, ink-in-water dissolution—each image is kinesthetic and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track her spiral touch and the lake’s radial cracks without drift. Micro-setting (quartz pillar) constrains the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the atrium re-contain her?—tightens when the quartz begins to paraphrase her back: the boundary dissolves *her* first. One meaningful deepening suffices: the lake’s fracture pattern mirrors her own edge-loss, visible price paid. No external antagonist needed; the colonnade’s aesthetic lure *is* the pressure. Coincidence absent; the thaw answers her poem, complicating nothing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the quiet insurgency of paraphrase itself—hymns rewritten by touch, certainty unmade by tremor. No moral stated; the final image of the lake *answering* reweights the sacred as collaborative, not inviolate. The elders’ fear lingers as plausible counter-reading, resisting tidy heresy. Specificity of “cloud-shadow poet” keeps the abstraction tethered to body and weather.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is irreplaceable: compressed lyric syntax, tactile verbs (“unspooling,” “thawed behind her”), and a perceptual signature that hears light *bleed*. Compression never loosens into purple; every figurative layer pays off in the final quartz glow. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. POV distance holds—third-person intimate with access only to Elira’s sensorium.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero scaffold loops, rhythmic variance between breath-long fragments and spiral clauses. Only hairline slip—“something fluid and flickering” drifts toward abstraction in a peak beat, costing the final decimal. Metaphors stay coherent (ice as mirror, hymn as editable text). Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: exile returns not to reclaim but to *become* the editing interface of the sacred. Cloud-shadow poetry, paraphrase-as-ritual, and aesthetic weaponization of quartz colonnade feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk—the lyric spiral could have collapsed into prettiness—pays off when the glyphs physically rewrite. Minor echo of “frozen lake as mirror” trope keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
