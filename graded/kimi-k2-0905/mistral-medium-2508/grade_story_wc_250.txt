<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The guardian’s absolute silence and ritualized weaving create a compelling, consistent interiority; her micro-choices (mirror tilts, shutter patterns) externalize contradictory impulses without spoken exposition. The boy’s trembling hands and delayed exhale embody shame under pressure; his decision to drop the note feels causally rooted in the star-pattern rite. No therapy-speak or stock labels; every gesture is character-specific. Relationship shift lands with visible cost: the father’s unclenched shoulders mirror the boy’s lighter stride—earned stasis for both.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mirror on the windowsill reframes silence into listening, repricing both father and son with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: shutter rhythms and light nets tighten the stake (need to be seen without words) until the final star wink reweights the premise. No orientation debt; dock, guardian, boy located by line 40. Persistent constraint—the mirror’s return—shapes future tactics off-page yet is legible in the father’s softened posture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, slick planks, fogged canal breath—sensory triad anchors immediacy and constrains movement (risk of slip, need for stillness). Dental mirror acts as micro-setting: its silver catch navigates light, dictates spatial positioning for both characters. Weather remains causal; unshed rain and lantern glow become materials the guardian weaves. Final image—mirror on windowsill—recharges every prior light pattern, proving environment can be compressed into one charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wordless forgiveness—signaled early; pressure escalates via guardian’s weaving cadence that narrows the boy’s options from avoidance to kneeling. One meaningful tightening: the mirror’s star reflection spills across his back, forcing participation. Cost is visible: boy leaves crumpled note behind; father later palms warm mirror—both pay in relinquished defenses. Agency remains accumulative rather than causal, but pattern break at end reweights silence into listening, meeting lens requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image braid: stars / mirrors / water each rewire silence into regard. Subtext resides in gesture—kneeling boy touches water skin, reading sky instead of apology. Final CR line reweights darkness from void to necessary aperture, giving conceptual afterglow without moralizing. No abstract thesis stated; wisdom earned through tactile particulars alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at coherent psychic distance; guardian’s perceptual signature is “spiralingly calm,” filtering every notice through light and reflection. Sentence rhythm mirrors weaving: long liquid clauses interrupted by click-sigh shutters, creating audible loom. No head-hopping; boy’s interior accessed only via embodied cues. Non-standard em-dashes and en-dashes are pattern-taught early, remain legible, serve breathy cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each noun is specific (calloused fingers, crumpled note, cobalt dock). Figurative language is sparse, pattern-driven: “stars trapped in water” appears once and pays off in mirror transfer. Opening and closing lines perform double duty—anchor voice and re-circulate motif. No register drift; diction stays within canal-side lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dental mirror with starlight weaving is fresh; reframes forgiveness as optics rather than speech. Guardian trope subverted—she gives no advice, only rearranges ambient light. Risky lyric structure taught by 25% mark and rewarded at closure. Transformation test: swap mirror for lantern and entire causal weave collapses—element is irreplaceable.</comment>
