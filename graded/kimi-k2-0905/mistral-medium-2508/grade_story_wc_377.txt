<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s muteness-as-season, her tactile obsession with vibration, and the final smile of continuance all read as concrete, embodied, and particular. Interior contradiction is present—she both hoards and releases wonder—yet the text leans on lyric summary more than in-scene micro-choice under pressure, muting the cost. The absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets inert; still, her solitary ritual earns a credible renunciation. The arc satisfies the 9+ quick test but not with the visceral punch needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the iceberg’s shatter-release seeds the sky and re-tunes the world, cost paid in the vanishing object and the bluff’s held breath. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chime-strike deepens density until the pattern breaks in the crystalline scatter. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causal breaks. A hairline slip: the “next sculpture” coda slightly dilutes the final image’s sting, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bluff’s wind-as-instrument, the iceberg’s light-veins, and the brass-silk spiral are rendered with sensory economy and POV-filtered attention. Micro-setting (the ice pressed to cheek) directly constrains the final sonic release. Spatial choreography is clean; no weather clichés. While environment could slightly more actively threaten (cold, height), it still charges the closure image enough to meet the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder via vibration—is signaled early and tightens through each chime strike that thins the ice. The irreversible shatter constitutes a visible price that forecloses possession, satisfying escalation under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist is needed; wind and material physics supply coherent pressure. The beat count is minimal, allowing only one decisive intensification, hence capped below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the conservation of wonder through deliberate loss. Subtext lives in the hush between strikes, the unspoken exchange between listener and land. Final scatter of light-seeds reweights earlier copper chimes without moralizing. A fractional deduction for the penultimate paragraph’s overt thesis statement “The world didn’t need more noise…” which slightly precedes the stronger closing image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Liora’s haptic cognition; diction of “wired bone,” “tensioned silk,” and “child’s gasp” is vivid yet precise. Rhythm modulates—long breaths versus clipped fragments—mirroring the sculpture’s acceleration. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues. Patterned elision (wind-speaks-in-sighs) is taught early and paid off at closure, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—sensorial texture + forward motion—with only two paraphrase loops (“the ice glistened…”) that do not recur in the closure beat. Metaphors stay coherent under physical logic; no mixed vehicles. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to lean, seemed to hear”) is voice-motivated and brief. A single scaffold phrase “This was her work” could be cut, but artifacts never touch the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The kinetic bell-sculpture that plays an iceberg’s dying chord feels wholly new, yet grounded in verifiable acoustics. Muting the protagonist each winter weaponizes silence as compositional method, turning constraint into art-making engine. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into preciousness, yet the piece commits fully, earning its poetic payoff. The synthesis of climate-loss, sound ecology, and private ritual is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
