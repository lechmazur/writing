<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s interior contradiction—obey the recovery edict vs hunt for stochastic answers—beats live on the page: she fingers her father’s textbook, lights the lantern, chooses the path he would reject. The micro-choice "let the contradictions hold her" crystallizes her hierarchy of values and forecloses the safe-daughter path with stinging palms as visible price. Voice stays idiosyncratic (probability-as-religion) and avoids diagnostic self-talk. Earned gamble: she steps into the blue fracture, paying uncertainty for authority over her own model of luck.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s dying light fuses blue/gold paths into a subway-constellation that re-weights her world-rule "luck = readable code." Cost is legible in the cracked mica and burning palms; the new rhythm is felt, not lectured. Causal chain—scrawl→library→lantern choice→fractured exit—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each shard intensifies texture rather than twists plot. Orientation anchored within 120 w; no teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rain-washed library = immediate olfactory hit ("wet paper and old glue") and micro-map of shelves-to-infinity; body + lantern function as portable setting that constrains sight-lines and choice—blue vs gold reflection. Clover-melancholy air returns to charge final exit image. Spatial choreography clean: subway seat scrawl → library table → lantern ignition; no floating rooms. Professional detail (cardiologist ban) stays minimal, stakes-relevant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the operable contradiction to widen perspective—signalled early. One tightening: lantern fracture splits path; choosing blue (renouncing father’s gold) narrows future identity and risks medical disobedience. Agency stays hers; no coincidence rescues. Cost visible in stinging palms and extinguished lantern. Pressure builds through textural accretion rather than successive reversals; sufficient for 700-word ambit but not quite the persistent constraint needed for 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: cracked mica, burnt clover smell, blue-vs-gold optics reframe "luck" from sin to syntax. No authorial thesis line; final subway-constellation image answers the core question "what if the responsible thing is to leap?" with earned ambiguity. Moral complexity intact—she abandons ailing father yet the text treats neither filial duty nor epistemic rebellion as fully virtuous. Emotional after-effect: reader left weighing data versus tenderness, as scent of wet paper lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong: mathematics metaphors ("shattered hypothesis") and synesthetic scent-logic ("smells like burnt clover") feel Lila-specific. Rhythmic compression under intensity: "The library dissolved. / For a breath…" teaches reader to accept fragmentary elision. No dialogue, so no register clash. Free indirect stays clean; filter verbs justified by cerebral POV. Consistent stance—ironically rational gambler—held to final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences pivot from lyric fragments to longer causal chains. No paraphrase loops; "lantern" repeats only when its state changes (lights, cracks, dies). One strained metaphor: "shelves stretched into infinity and the books whispered…numbers and wind" momentarily liquefies solid geometry, but fits dream-logic and closure. Information density high; few adverbial weeds. Clean mechanics, no typos.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of probability theory, bibliomancy, and subway graffiti feels non-obvious; stochastic textbook as grimoire is fresh. The "contradiction as traversable seam" concept deepens rather than merely ornaments plot. Specific image-set (mica fracture, clover smoke, dual light paths) could not swap into another story without collapse. Risk-taking—lyric montage, non-linear shelf-infinity—extends form without losing coherence. Minor echo of "choose your path" tropes, but color-coding with filial rebellion personalizes it.</comment>
