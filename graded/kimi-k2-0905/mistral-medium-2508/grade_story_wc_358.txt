<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra’s guilt-riven caution, tactile surveying, and final renunciation of the patch are embodied and costly; the “rapidly adapting” flaw is shown rather than labeled. Interior contradiction (intuition vs data) drives every beat. The torn sleeve ends as a scarlet flag of foresight renounced—visible, specific, irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city itself is now a learning predator and she abandons the patch—cost is the symbolic surrender of past certainty. Causal chain intact (survey → flare → wind recoils → labyrinth exhales). Orientation beats arrive before 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Containers’ metallic hum, tuning-fork resonance, and wind-curved geometry constrain every movement and tool use; the anemometer shatters against this very geometry. Final image—leaning containers exhaling—charges the reconfiguration. Micro-setting (frayed patch, broken gauge) doubles as bodily extension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake: human reflexes vs adaptive urban organism; tightening occurs when the wind *recoils* from the flare, proving the system learns faster than she does. Cost: shattered instrument, lost talisman, limp away. Agency survives via renunciation; no coincidence resolves the vortex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emergent theme: built environments can evolve predatoriness when human models lag. No moralizing; the final word “Listen” is imperative action, not thesis. Patch lost = foresight now externalized into urban vigil—conceptually re-priced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Compressed, instrument-trained diction (“survey kit,” “erratic bursts”) mirrors an engineer’s precision under duress. Rhythm accelerates with clause fragments as wind screams; no head-hop. Perceptual signature: wind read as data first, organism second—voice stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density—“wind didn’t gust—it *pulsed*” packs physics + menace. No synonym loops; single metaphor string (“tuning fork”) is purposeful and paid off. Final third free of artifact; earlier prose clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Takes the worn “killer city” trope but grounds it in aerodynamic specificity and an engineer’s sensorium. Fresh synthesis: containers as feedback loop rather than static maze. Risk—personifying port as learning organism—pays off through accruing sensor data, not magic.</comment>
