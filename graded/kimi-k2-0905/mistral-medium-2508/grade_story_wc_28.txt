<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his fingers “tracing the chipped patterns,” the stone “warming beneath his touch”—and his contradiction (surgeon’s precision vs heretic compassion) is active in the moment of naming. The micro-choice to keep speaking Aisha’s name while the sword hovers is a charged, embodied risk. The commander’s instant conversion feels slightly under-motivated; a single preparatory beat (his hand already hovering near a tessera, or a visible tremor) would have locked the stakes. Still, Elias’s refusal to stop renaming earns the plaza’s answering glow, so the cost is visible and the path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: each name spoken → tessera answers → plaza rewrites itself; the commander’s surrender is the decisive change, paid for by the shared kneeling and the dropped sword. Orientation is secure by line 4 (“Beneath the shattered sky… Elias knelt”). The lens is causal throughout; no coincidence resolves the stand-off. Cost is legible in the final image: “the cracks filled with gold” — a permanent, irreversible memorial that will draw reprisal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mosaic tesserae function as micro-setting: their fractures literally guide Elias’s path and later warm under touch, constraining how he moves and where the commander kneels. Smoke, charred cedar, and the skeletal minaret are selective, pressure-filtered details, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → trace → stand-off → shared kneel, all within the single plaza patch. The final golden filling of cracks is an environment-state change that charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—can the dead be rescued from erasure—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the commander arrives with naked steel. Elias’s agency is continuous: each naming narrows his options until refusal becomes the only move left. The dropped sword is the visible price that alters future tactics for both men. Coincidence is absent; the conflict resolves through stance crystallization, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of naming rather than pronouncement: “mercy isn’t what you burn. It’s what you carry.” The final image of gold filling cracks reweights the earlier fire-damage without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the commander’s sword clatters, not explained—creating ironic gap between official narrative and lived truth. The refusal to state a moral lets the reader feel the cost of remembering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>The lyric third-person voice is consistent, with controlled compression (“the stones began to glow”). Perceptual signature is particular: Elias notices temperature of stone, scent of cedar, spiral of green and gold—never generic. Syntax tightens under pressure—short imperative “Go ahead” against the longer meditation that precedes it. No dialogue contamination; the two spoken lines are distinct in diction and carry subtext of threat and invitation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings shift from participial to subject-verb to fragment (“You,” he murmured). Density is high—each sentence advances image or stake. One mixed metaphor (“steel lived in his bones now, forged in the fire’s aftermath”) is allowed because it is character-locked and brief. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the closing paragraph’s repetition of “cracks filled with gold” is purposeful resonance, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The premise—renaming the dead via tessera—feels fresh, marrying memorial practice with magical realism without exposition dumps. Risk is taken in letting the antagonist convert in a single beat; the gamble almost succeeds because the shared kneel is charged, but it edges toward convenience. Specificity of cobalt-blue eye-tessera and lightning-veined fragment anchors the concept in particulars. Overall, a memorable inflection rather than wholesale novelty, but still distinctive.</comment>
