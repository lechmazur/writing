<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his laugh is “raw and disbelieving,” his touch on the sundial “wondering if faith could be dug up.” The contradictions between skepticism and longing are held in scene, not alternated in summary. The micro-choice to plant the seed in the hollow stone makes the final rupture of that stone feel earned. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets idle; the score caps just under the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sapling splitting the sundial reweights “faith” from relic to living rupture. The cost is the cracked stone itself—an irreversible fracture of the past. Causal linkage holds: each root Elias follows is a because/therefore toward the moment the seed he planted repays him with breakage. Lens (Causal) is stable from first warm stone to final green fracture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is never dumped; temperature and taste (“overripe figs”) arrive through Elias’s attention. The sundial’s hollow is a micro-setting that literally holds the seed and later fails under vegetal pressure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean—lantern shadows, skeletal fingers, sapling splitting stone track without drift. One minor slack: “valley” remains a placeholder name, but the locale is felt through touch and breath, not map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the seed, not a relic, becomes the last hope. The single meaningful turn is the sundial cracking: it forecloses the option of keeping the past intact and forces Elias to accept a living future. Cost is the stone itself, paid on the page. No secondary reversals, but one is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of buried saints → buried seed: resurrection is vegetal, not doctrinal. The final image reconfigures “faith” without moralizing—no sentence articulates the thesis. Warmly curious mural figures echo Elias’s own stance, inviting reader complicity. The aftereffect is the scent of green pushing through bone, a conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—“roots pulsed faintly, as if breathing” is his projection, not exposition. Rhythm mirrors breath: long sentences for descent, staccato fragments for crack and laugh. No head-hop; Liora’s voice is reported, not interiorized. Near-hairline slip: “they say” is slightly generic, but it is anchored in Elias’s memory of village talk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative layering (“stone … hollowed like a wound”) is controlled to one per high-pressure beat, avoiding purple drift. No synonym loops; “roots” recurs but each time with new action (snake, guide, tremble). Opening and final lines are image-anchors that bracket the arc cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The graft of catacomb + orchard + sundial is fresh, avoiding familiar post-war nostalgia templates. The vegetal resurrection of faith through a seed inside a prayer-timekeeper feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—letting a sapling literally break the central relic—pays off visually and thematically without gimmickry. Specificity of “fruit that tasted of memory” locks the concept to this valley only.</comment>
