<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory hunger/love drives every beat; the bead-burn in the final gesture shows cost. Vesper’s half-sapling form externalizes her flaw. Keeper’s bark-hands and sigh supply status tension without head-count clutter. Micro-choice hierarchy (bead > veil > breath) legible throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each image-layer (frost, nightshade, bead-pulse) tightens the resonance debt until the tree-split delivers Charged Poise with felt cost—Liora’s dissolution. Pattern taught by 25 %: “cameos” repeated with escalating soil-tremor. Closure image (Vesper tracing carved names) reweights the rule-set: orchard now feeds on ghost-love. No orientation debt; anchors (who/when) surface ≤120 w.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass-and-venom greenhouse acts as micro-setting: frost weep, blackened vines, glowing heart-veins constrain every move. Bead-as-soil-object and Keeper’s bark-hands supply sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography clean: veil threads keyhole, fingers brush buried bead, moonlight splits knife-wise. Final image (names carved over decades) charges closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: repay love-debt via resonant awakening. Escalation = accumulative density: each cameo costs veil-thread; bead-pulse intensifies until tree-split forecloses return. Price visible—Liora’s threads dissolve into steam; orchard now louder. Agency = endurance/renunciation rather than combat, fitting lyric frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from poisoned love-as-agriculture: orchard feeds on ghost-debt. Nightshade bloom, bead thirst, “lovingly venomous” tag refrain reweight meaning at split-tree. No moralizing; final image (Vesper tracing names) offers mournful elation without thesis. Resonance carried by concrete vegetal imagery, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct texture: frost-weep, silver-throated, winter-cracked—neither purple nor generic. Rhythm modulates: long vowel elegy vs. clipped “Again?” keeper line. Perceptual signature = alchemical botanic lens; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal, indirection strong: “Almost.” = compressed hunger.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: “ashen-veil trailing over blackened vines” does three jobs (visual, motion, poison). No loops; each metaphor extends plant logic. Sentence variety opens with participle, noun phrase, em-dash break. Final line cadence echoes opening wound-image, sealing circle. Zero scaffold or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of ghost-bride & botanical alchemy feels fresh; nightshade fruit pulsing heartbeat transforms trope. Risky accumulative mosaic pays off: cameos as shards taught early. Debt across lifetimes avoids cliché by soil/botanic specificity. Transformation test: story collapses without venom-orchard rules.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setup: “ashen-veil” in open sentence. Development: each cameo costs veil-thread. Closure: veil fully unravels into steam, paying debt. Irreplaceable; no synonym for ghost-bride-orchard hybrid.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bead buried by oldest tree pulses at 25 % mark, tremors soil, burns star-like at climax. Crumbles to dust, reweights orchard rules. Three beats + closure linkage + conceptual cost. Story engine dies if bead removed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonant awakening = core mechanic: bead’s song, tree-split, Vesper rise. Each beat escalates cost; final image reconfigures orchard as resonant tomb. Concept shapes tactics, not theme label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Keeper labels Liora “lovingly venomous”; nightshade blooms where she touches, proving trait. Venom feeds orchard, enables Vesper rise. Trait enables tactics with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ghost action = cameo method; each smoke-through-keyhole appearance thins veil, accumulates debt. Final ghost-dissolution triggers Vesper return. Every major turn traces to ghosting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cameo mechanics taught in line 3: “moved... like smoke through a keyhole.” Reappears with soil tremor, moon split, veil loss. Method shapes escalation; not late reveal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse rules constrain all: frost weep limits warmth, poison loam enables resurrection, glass seals at end. Setting supplies resources for debt-payment; without it, no half-sapling Vesper.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Winter-cracked fields anchor era; 73 winters quantify Liora’s dead-time. Hush season heightens silence for bead-pulse audibility. Timeframe tightens choice: only winter night allows glass-seal closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.5</question><comment>Debt across lifetimes motivates every cameo; bead=contract, veil=interest, dissolution=final payment. Friction: love vs. self-erasure. Closure forecloses future returns yet keeper knows cycle will repeat—earned stasis with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Mournful elation coherent throughout: frost-weep, blackened vines, crumbling bead carry grief; nightshade bloom, pulsing fruit, dawn-slash offer twisted joy. Final tone modulates to resigned hush—keeper’s sigh, Vesper tracing names—cementing mournful elation in closing image.</comment>
