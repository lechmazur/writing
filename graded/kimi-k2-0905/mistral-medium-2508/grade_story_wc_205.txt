<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory hunger for “revision not vengeance” is dramatized in the shard’s grip and his refusal to rise when Taelis confronts him—micro-choices that cost him the relic itself. The interiority is embodied, not labeled (warm pulse against wrist, weight lifted). The final renunciation—pressing palm to empty altar—earns its poise because every prior beat has tied his self-forgiveness to the shard’s destruction. Only the off-stage comrades feel generic, blunting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the shard’s dissolution reconfigures the dispute from data-points to memory, with the conceptual cost of “uneasy knowledge” landing on the archaeologists. Causality holds: shard → storm → vision → dust → silence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (asteroid cathedral, failed revolt, Elias alone). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of glowing strands increases until the mosaic reassembly—held without ambiguity. Minor loop: “time-strands” is repeated four times in 50 words, dulling the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The black-stone cathedral, irradiated-silk mirror covers, and charged-particle storm are not backdrop but tactical instruments: the storm powers the shard, the silk prevents splintered reflections, the altar’s emptiness forces Elias’s final stance. Micro-setting—the shard itself—constrains choice twice: it cuts his palm and later dissolves to dust, foreclosing resurrection of the past. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (poet notices color bleeding, architects notice lattice). Only the off-world ship remains a floating prop, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—control of cultural memory—tightens once: the shard’s activation forces the archaeologists to confront lived memory instead of data. The price is the shard itself; its loss is visible, felt, and irreversible. Agency is Elias’s decision to let it shatter rather than hoard it. Under Accumulative lens, the glowing density peaks at the mosaic reassembly; the reversal is earned, not coincidental. Secondary stakes (personal absolution) stay internal and do not escalate further, capping the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—“memory as poetry not artifact”—emerges through the shard’s refractive property and the final image of Elias palm-to-altar, never stated. Subtext in Taelis’s dropped datapad shows epistemic fracture without exposition. The burnished sorrow modulates: early heavy grief lightens into quiet awe, reweighting sorrow as beauty. No moralizing line crowds the final paragraph; the reader carries the unease. Missing only a sharper counter-reading for the archaeologists, which keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s poet-perceiver: syntax lengthens during reverie, fragments under shard-fracture. Diction—“baroque spires,” “burnished sorrow”—is writerly yet consistent with a poet-architect. Taelis’s single line is sharp, academic, distinct. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from panoramic asteroid shot to wrist-pulse. Filter verbs appear only when motivated (“Elias felt the shard warm”), never excessive. Rhythm mirrors emotional swell: long sentences pre-vision, staccato at dust-release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—time as rope, shard as pulse—without self-contradiction. Information density is high: one sentence places the asteroid, revolt, and Elias’s vocation. Minor scaffold: “the shard… the shard… the shard” triplet in paragraph 4 could prune. No mixed metaphors, no register drift. Final line “it was beautiful, after all. And it was his.” lands clean, recharging earlier “poetry” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms the trope of “relic proves civilization matters” by making the relic’s destruction the proof. Time-as-visible-threads is familiar, yet binding it to a poet-revolutionary who needs the vase *shattered* to win the argument is non-obvious. Specificity—irradiated silk stolen from priestesses, lachrymae naming—anchors freshness. Risk taken: lyric accretion over causal turns; coherence holds. Derivative-premise guardrail waived because lived detail reweights the trope.</comment>
