<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motives—freedom vs. stewardship—are legible and intensify; the prick-of-thorn gift is shown, not told. The violin-touch micro-choice crystallises her hierarchy of values. Final renunciation carries visible cost (thorn-blood, dirt under nails). Interiority stays lush but never explanatory; one “she understood” tag is the lone cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure: she smashes the violin—Decisive Change with conceptual cost (forfeits payment, invites outlaw status). Lens: Accumulative/Textural—image-density reweights stakes until the garden sings. Causality: coffee vision → violin whisper → propagation act; no off-stage cheats. Orientation locked by 40 words; moon-clock tightens to midnight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet dome, violet scent, brass telescope, moonlit shards—details are filtered through Elara’s curator gaze and constrain her reach. The ice fragments become micro-setting that charges the ending when they root into soil. Spatial choreography clean: case → table → ground. No sensory checklist; each sense earns its line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: sell artifact vs. free its song. Pressure tightens once: collector’s midnight arrival forecloses delay. Propagation act narrows options to outlaw-gardener identity. Cost visible: loss of fortune, thorn-torn palms. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates only (vine reaction).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—art versus empire—emerges from act, not sermon. Final image of empire as compost re-prices prior motifs. Subtext lives in wisteria’s silk-voice and coffee dregs; no character states the thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is the singing garden hope or weapon?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lush, cadenced lyricism taught in line 1; pattern holds to final violet bloom. Diction stays within Elara’s scholarly lexicon—“provenance,” “Glissando Tundra”—without showboating. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Compression (“mulberry ache”) is earned, not purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths breathe with tension. High density: “ice exploded into a thousand prismatic needles” does three jobs—sound, sight, stakes. One mixed metaphor cluster (“spectrum of grief and something sharper: defiance”) barely muddies peak. No loops, no filler; pronouns clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fusion of probate researcher + ice violin + plant telepathy is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. “Perforated destiny” concept materialises as literal shatter-propagation. Risk—lyric mosaic—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Transformation total: swap any detail and the engine collapses.</comment>
