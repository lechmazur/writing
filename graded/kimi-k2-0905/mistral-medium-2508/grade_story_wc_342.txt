<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The artist’s compulsion to capture what can’t be held is lived-in: her fingers “twitching with the muscle memory of a thousand failed portraits,” the blank final page, the refusal to carve again. Contradictory impulses—obsessive detail vs. acceptance of blur—coexist in every beat; the renunciation is foreshadowed by the failed coin-mirror and paid in her emptied palms. No stock therapy-speak; even “fractally precise” is delivered as guild mockery, not self-diagnosis. The smile she never catches becomes the invisible portrait she finally paints—an earned stasis whose cost is the hush she now inhabits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each beat layers density—failed portraits, coin indentations, glass cuts—until the collapsing beam refracts the sky, a cadence shift that reweights the whole quest. Causal linkage is present but subordinate: the coin’s spiral dictates the sun channels; the oak’s death schedules her finish. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sky inside walls shatters, proving the limit, and she “lets the limits hold her.” Cost is legible in the warped, indentation-less coin and the sap on her pillow—proof the tree’s death has entered her body.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The oak-library is tactile and constraining: sap scent, mildew, shelves carved into living wood that groans its final hours. Micro-setting—the coin’s worn spiral and the leather lock—functions as environment, guiding her finger-paths when sight is useless. Spatial choreography is clean: coin → lock → glass panes → collapsing beams, all tracked without drift. The final image of light “the color of a sky that had finally learned to stay” fuses setting and theme, charging the resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the infinite be held/ mirrored inside finite walls? Pressure tightens as dawn and demolition approach; each glass slice raises the material cost of failure. The final collapse is not bad luck but the inevitable test of her wager; the ceiling’s fracture narrows options to renunciation. Price is visible—splintered glass, sap-stained pillow, the blank vellum she chooses not to cut—confirming the limit she must inhabit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive failure of representation: every portrait blurs, every text burns, yet the attempt itself becomes the only honest likeness. The instruction “Mirror the sky inside walls” is never moralized; it crystallizes as shattered constellations that reprice her lifelong premise. Final image—ink-colored hush on untouched paper—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the true portrait is the space where striving stops. Complexity lingers: the same limit that destroys also frees, leaving plausible counter-readings intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is fractally compressed, each sentence a shard of sensory exactitude: “sap and mildew,” “breaths pressed into metal.” Rhythmic control heightens under pressure—short clauses during collapse, then the long release of “the color of a sky that had finally learned to stay.” Perceptual signature is painterly-tactile, never visual-first: she “scores the wood with channels to guide the beams.” No head-hopping; the tight third-person stays inside her finger-seeing skin until the final wide shot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is spare and precise—“like trying to catch smoke in a net”—never clustering into purple haze. Information density is high: one sentence slips the guild joke, the memory of failures, the metaphor of smoke. Opening line anchors voice and paradox; final line resolves by image that recharges the smoke-and-net motif into sky-ink.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist meets arboreal library demolition via tactile coin-cipher—an angle that feels inevitable only after it lands. Risk-taking (second-person “you” only in instruction, lyric compression, sky-mirror as climax) heightens meaning without obscuring causality. Transformation test fails if names change: the coin’s spiral, the sap scent, the blank page are inseparable from this exact voice. No close echoes of famous scenes; the shattering ceiling-light reconfigures Borges-style infinity but through craftsman’s embodied failure.</comment>
