<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—collector of borrowed grief who refuses to be altered—drives every beat; the final surrender (“let them change him”) is visible, costly, foreshadowed. Micro-choices (pressing halo as die, releasing voices, crossing out his name) track the shift. The widow-silk voice and blacksmith-anger are embodied, not labelled. Only cap keeps it from 9: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is waived, not missing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught by line-1 sensory density, held to final “stars speak in feelings.” Closure is Charged Poise: the sky rewritten by every borrowed heart, Elias reconfigured as listener—cost is the irreversible dissolution of his emotional anonymity. Pattern of star vanish → return tracks the reweighting. No orientation debt; anchors clear within 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Topaz dust, lead-type walls, ink-stained apron compress workshop into tactile crucible; every tool (press, halo fragment, constellation type) constrains or enables Elias’s choices. Environmental degradation—dust raining during climax—mirrors internal surrender without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean: body, press, fragment positions track shot-to-shot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias extract emotion’s equation without being consumed? Tightening occurs when the press prints his own face—first irreversible intrusion of borrowed grief into self. Cost legible: he forfeits emotional distance, ends “unborrowed” laugh. Escalation is density/pattern under Accumulative lens; no causal reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via recurrent image-set: printing = empathy transposed into artifact. Final reweighting—stars return as felt constellations, not mapped ones—answers the widow’s question without moralizing. Subtext in silence: the absent stars are invitation, not erasure. No thematic echo; resonance arises from material particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“cadence of a grieving widow...wet silk”) is character-specific, not writerly. Syntax mirrors press rhythm: longer accumulative sentences build, then fragment at climax. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as halo burns cold. Voice modulation under pressure is exact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level density high—most sentences do two jobs (advance + texture). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare, patterned, paid off (“halo broken and whole all at once”). Rhythm varies with scene tempo; short beats during needle-drop climax. Only micro-slip: “lucid turbulence” approaches label-speak, but context earns it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses celestial apocalypse with artisanal letterpress, a synthesis not seen before. Transformation of star disappearance into emotional invitation reverses genre expectation. Risky second-person address (“You were the page”) lands because causal pattern supports it. Specificity of constellation-collapse typeface prevents trope recycling.</comment>
