<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The poet’s contradictory engines—300-year wakefulness yet shyness that splits stone—are dramatized in embodied beats: palm-to-ghost-sternum, eating the manual, casting the sun-borrowing net. Each micro-choice costs her immediacy (no sleep, no anonymity) and forecloses retreat, earning the final cocooned stasis. Interiority pulses with calcium-veined ink instead of labels. Minor slip: “reef-shadow joy” is named once without embodiment; still, contradiction lives in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shell seals, the manual’s title is supplied by wind, and the sun’s borrowed light is already lent to children—felt cost is the poet’s vanishing. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lullaby-layer, postcard-fray, and eaten page intensifies the density until the final cadence reweights what “staying” means. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“gargantuan shell”) and paid off when the shell becomes coffin-cocoon. No causal breaks; ellipsis is motivated by centuries-long scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shell, postcard, and poet’s ink-veined body function as micro-setting that constrains every tactic—sound bends inside the spiral, light is borrowed through the postcard’s nebula. Sensory selection is urgent: salt-tanged gunpowder pollen, off-key wind carrying lullabies. Spatial choreography tracks ghost-helmet → seawater → coral buds without drift. Setting never stalls momentum; crushed-violet breath charges the final image. Missing 9+ gate only because environment does not physically block the new war drums—merely refracts them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute war into fertile memory—tightens when each lullaby seed lands in children’s chests, narrowing her option to retreat. Visible prices: centuries of insomnia, eaten paper tasting of hope, final disappearance inside shell. Accumulative pressure escalates via postcard glow, ghost bloom, coral helmet; each intensifies the cost of continuing. Agency is renunciation rather than victory—she yields her name but not her song. Slight undercut: new war is announced off-stage; drums felt, not chosen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversals: swords → surrendered constellations; gunpowder → pollen; ghosts → coral. No moral spoken—final image of shell-sealed poet handing sun-light to children reweights “stay” as transitive gift. Subtext pulses in silence where “blossom armistice” is never defined yet enacted. Emotional aftereffect is sweet ache, not slogan. Pseudo-profundity avoided; wisdom is pressed battlefield flowers, not maxims.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is sinuous, salt-rusted, hypnotic—syntax elongates then snaps like kelp: “She licked her lips, tasting salt and the metallic tang of verses not yet bled.” Perceptual signature is poet-as-instrument: wind is “ever her accomplice,” sound bends in calcium veins. Compression taught early (“shyly unstoppable, the way roots split stone”) and paid off in reef-shadow joy. No head-hopping; ghost voice is filtered through her palm. Rhythm modulates with tidal breath, never monotonous.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is lush yet controlled; no paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Metaphors interlock: nebula petals, coral helmet, poppies from rifles—each vehicle extends prior physics without contradiction. Information density high: one sentence nets the sun, borrows light, seeds children. Only hairline slip: “reef-shadow joy” is coined without tactile anchor, but cadence absorbs it. Read-aloud ear test passes; varied sentence openings, no drumbeat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of centuries-old insomniac poet inside a spiral war-memorial shell that sings wars into flora is non-obvious synthesis. Risk of lyric excess is embraced yet disciplined by tactile因果: eaten manual becomes manual of peace. Trope of anti-war elegy is transmuted through biological alchemy rather than moral plea. Fresh inflection: the manual without a title is titled by wind—conceptual repricing that feels inevitable. No derivative aftertaste; singular artistic stance.</comment>
