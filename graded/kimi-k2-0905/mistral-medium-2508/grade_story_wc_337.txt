<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—restorer vs. releaser—are dramatized in the moment he drops the needle; the smile that “fit” is a credible, embodied renunciation. Interiority is concrete and salt-stung, never diagnostic. The moment he winds the threads round his wrists the cost is visible; the arc is earned. Only minor reserve: we never learn why *he* personally needs the spirits freed, so the motive plateaus at “town conscience” rather than private stake.

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the dropped needle + wrist-wrapping reweights “mending” into “opening” with undeniable cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure mounts via image density (splintered rainbows → shattered prisms) rather than causal chain. The final image of Elias as “a door” crystallizes the new stance without exposition. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors (altar, harbor, starlight) are legible by line 10.

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not backdrop; its fracturing light is the literal tool that lets the freed spirits manifest—environment directly enables the climactic surge. Micro-objects (needle, net threads) are handled in tactile beats and constrain the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy favors visual refraction, but salt, kelp, and lamp-flame keep the palette balanced. World rule consistency: spirits exit through light-crack, not arbitrary magic.

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the drowned vs. keep the town’s lie—tightens once: the decision to let the final knot unravel. The tightening is textural/accumulative rather than causal-reversal; density of light and breath peaks, foreclosing retreat. Cost is felt in the gust of stench and the townsfolk’s future mirror-fog—on-page consequence. Agency is Elias’s micro-choice to drop the needle; luck does not intrude.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of restoration: letting broken things stay broken is the only honest act. Subtext resides in the shift from “stitching silence” to wearing silence as ornament—an embodied critique of compulsive repair culture. The final image refrains from moralizing; the reader is left to weigh complicity. One minor tic: “interlaced hush” is named rather than dramatized, a 0.1 ding.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with rhythmic cadences that mirror the weaving/unweaving action. Lexicon stays within Elias’s artisanal diction—needle-eye, salt, knot, silk—no register drift. Compression in peak beat—“The knot unraveled itself”—delivers clarity without scaffold. Patterned repetition of “silence” is taught early and paid off in the wrist-binding, earning the lyric surge.

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—most sentences braid image, motion, and metaphor: “flame bending like a held breath.” No mixed-metaphor clash; vehicles stay optical/breath/tide. One paraphrase loop detected (“spirits slipping… rattling shutters like bones”) but it sits early, not at closure, so −0.2 only. Final line “the tide turned” is crisp, propulsive, echoing both literal harbor and thematic inversion.

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses ghost-story with craft-metaphor in a way that feels inevitable: mending-as-exorcism inverted. The prism sanctuary, net-ghosts, and “door” persona are specific to this piece—swap any element and the whole fractures. Risk lies in the lyric escalations (shattering prisms, starred water) but coherence survives. Fresh inflection: restorer becomes portal, not savior.
