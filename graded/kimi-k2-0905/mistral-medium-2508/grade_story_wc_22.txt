<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coachman’s solitary, obsessive vocation is rendered through concrete micro-choices—splitting pods, mimicking terns, mapping weeping soil—each action exposing his need to atone for witnessed slaughter. Contradictory impulses (ritual piety vs. refusal to pray) live inside single beats, and the final renunciation of recognition (“no markers”) is earned by the prior night’s emptying of pockets. Emotional cost is palpable yet unspoken; bones quiet as pods perfectly mirrors his future silence. Voice remains carved by wind and salt, never generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each scattering widens the pattern until the closing image of sweeter water re-weights the whole. Orientation anchor (“the jetty stretched…”) arrives by line 3; causal chain (pod dust → tide uptake → future bloom) is legible even off-stage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the jetty’s taste-change makes the cost of decades-long ritual undeniable without exposition. No loops or scaffold; final line “the garden would remember” crystallizes Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Twilight-slick stones, silt of drowned things, and bruised sky are filtered through the coachman’s professional attention to currents and bird cries; every detail guides where pods will lodge. The reef’s bleached graveyard and the jetty’s broken-rib metaphor constrain his nightly path and seed selection. Final image of poppies leaning toward the sea is environment charging closure: the land itself re-angles toward life. Spatial track is immaculate—knee-deep tide, kelp uncurling from cracks—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will salt-death allow green reclamation—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened each dusk. Agency is accumulative: every emptied pocket narrows possibility of failure until the last light bleeds; cost is the lifetime spent listening, boots leaving no prints. No external antagonist needed; salt, memory, and silence apply coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices for lyric mode; the “taste sweeter” moment reweights the entire battlefield.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of post-traumatic ecological atonement emerges solely through image—roots in rifle barrels, petals from helmets—never abstract assertion. Subtextual tension between erasure (make them forget) and remembrance (the garden remembers) is left unresolved, inviting reflection. Final taste-shift re-prices the premise: mercy is impersonal, vegetal, indifferent to human naming. No moralizing; birds as omens and pods as scripture operate as lived particulars, not symbols bolted on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to the coachman’s weathered diction: “fine silt of drowned things,” “syllables curling…like smoke from damp kindling.” Perceptual signature—sea-taste, bird-angle, soil hum—never slips into tourist catalog. Rhythm mirrors tidal pulse: long swells of description break into fragmentary whispers (“Grow…”) under pressure. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk waived; when he mimics tern cries the syntax itself keens. Pattern-taught elision (absent verbs in dream list) is paid off in final sapling lean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new sensorium or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and internally coherent—“broken rib,” “green vengeance”—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one line anchors jetty, battlefield era, and reef death. Final paragraph rhythm contracts to single-sentence beats, accelerating toward closure without drum-beat monotony. No filler, no filter stacks, no register drift; even “concord” fits the coachman’s arcane lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “poppies on WWI field” trope and re-angles it through vegetal atonement driven by a nameless coachman who speaks extinct bird-tongues. Risk of lyric accumulative structure pays off: closure reconfigures meaning without cathartic showdown. Specificity—blackened husks that hum, tide lapping fingers—prevents abstract eco-allegory. Transformation test fails: this exact coastal battlefield, reef corpse, and salt-tongue ritual could not transplant elsewhere. Narrow vastness tone feels fresh, not gimmicky.</comment>
