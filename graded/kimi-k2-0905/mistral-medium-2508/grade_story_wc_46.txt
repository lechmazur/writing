<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is textured through tactile ritual (thumb-polishing, weighing glass) and embodied memory; the “pearl of stillness” ethic is dramatized, not declared. The arrival of the girl forces a micro-choice—handing over the sea-glass—that crystallizes her lifetime stance with visible cost: she relinquishes the talisman that anchors her identity. Contradictory impulses (grief for Elias vs. need to transmit non-consuming light) coexist in the same beats, satisfying the 9+ test. Only the grandmother’s voice edges toward aphorism, a hairline slip keeping it from 9.2.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sea-glass changes keepers, reweighting the entire ethic from private practice to living lineage. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each lyrical return to mist, glass, and pulse thickens the stakes until the transfer reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: Liora’s empty palm and the girl’s white knuckles. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“grotto’s mouth”), well under the 120-word window; no causal or spatial breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine mist, quartz veins, and tidal breath constrain movement and supply the only “tools” (salt, friction, echo) that polish glass and memory. Environment doubles as body: the mist “curling around her ankles” externalizes grief and later retreats as peace. The sea-glass itself functions as micro-setting, its temperature and weight tracking emotional voltage. One hairline slip: “reflectively vibrant” is used twice with identical phrasing, a micro-loop that dulls specificity a notch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmit non-consuming light—surfaces early and tightens once: the girl’s request forces Liora to surrender her private anchor. The beat narrows options (keep the glass = hoard the ethic; give it = risk dilution) and carries visible price. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is the transfer moment; no further reversals are needed at 750 words. The cost is palpable, but because the girl arrives as an innocent supplicant rather than an antagonistic force, pressure feels gentle, not piercing—hence 8.4, not 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via pattern: every luminous object (sea-glass, amber, pearl) is shaped by patience, not flame. The final image—two silent figures holding smooth stones—answers the thematic question (“how to share light without fire”) without stating it. Subtext lives in gesture: Liora’s refusal to touch the girl’s hand signals the first lesson is loss, not comfort. The ethic is complex, not moralistic: light is surrendered, not taught.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Liora’s perceptual filter: temperature of glass, taste of salt mist, auditory memory of Elias’s scoff. Syntax lengthens and softens under grief, then tightens at the transfer (“Then you’ll have to learn stillness first”). No head-hopping; the girl’s tremor is seen from outside, as Liora would. The rhythmic control of repetition (“mist…mist”; “light…light”) teaches the lyric pattern early and pays off in the final exhalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: participle phrases evoke tide-like cadence without simultaneity errors. Metaphors (sleeping serpent, cat-curl mist) stay coherent within marine physics. One scaffold loop—“reflectively vibrant” repeated verbatim—costs −0.3; otherwise no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Strong verbs (“exhaled,” “carved,” “ignited”) carry motion; nominalizations are minimal. Final line lands on monosyllabic pulse—“quiet places where light learned to stay”—a cadence shift that recharges prior motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “non-consuming light” ethic feels fresh because it inverts the usual fire-as-knowledge trope; here brilliance is subtraction, not addition. Specificity of gem-polishing by thumb-friction grounds the metaphor in lived female lineage. The grotto-as-serpent image is memorable yet inevitable given tidal erosion. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist—but the closure reconfigures meaning without gimmick, earning the high band.</comment>
