<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The poet’s “ethically playful” streak is shown only once (leaving a poem for bread) and never collides with the rope choice; the final ladder carving is asserted, not pressured. Interior contradiction is missing: he never weighs cutting the rope vs. walking away, so the pull feels abstract. Burned-smooth hands supply late cost, but the causal path from playful thief to pattern-climber is inferred, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ladder reweights every prior thread into “climb to see,” with burned palms as visible cost. Accumulative lens holds: rope texture, star pattern, and being-light layer until the snap reframes the stake. Orientation is lyrical but coherent; time and place are legible by 120 words. One causal micro-gap: the beings’ thread-add never clearly alters the poet’s options, yet the final image still reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta walls, clay scent, and sage compress into a micro-setting that funnels attention to rope texture; star-sieve revision signals world-change without exposition. The rope itself becomes environment: its fibers, stain, and hum guide every micro-choice. Final ladder-shadow at dawn is a charged spatial echo. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what to do with the measured thread”—is signaled early and tightens through tactile beats: fray, hum, snap, carve. One visible price: palm burn alters final gesture. Escalation is textural (density of pattern) rather than causal; under Accumulative lens this suffices. Energy beings complicate but do not resolve, keeping pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “time is texture you must climb”; no moral is stated. Rope, stars, and ladder recur with shifting weight, culminating in the dawn shadow that reconfigures prior images. Ambiguity is purposeful: prisons erased, beings silent, poet gone. Final image avoids sermon while delivering felt after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric first-person maintains perceptual signature: “breath hitched when he thought too hard about the future.” Syntax stretches and compresses with pendulum beats; fragmental elision is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Diction stays within drifting poet’s lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “rope hummed… not with sound but with pattern” fuses object and concept in one line. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to knife-short cuts. Two near-adjacent “pattern” repeats are purposeful, not loops. No mixed metaphors; closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-prison world where beings re-braid star-maps is fresh; rope-as-clock is specific inversion of escape-tool. Ladder carved from destroyed measure-device reweights entire metaphor without gimmick. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Story could not swap objects without collapse.</comment>
