<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is concrete—fingers stilling at the moon-dust, cheek-hiding reflex, climbing toward the crown—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values (order vs. oracle). The final transformation is earned: she pays with her human skin, feels bark dapple her, and accepts thorn-tipped fingers; cost is visible, irreversible, and scaled to the piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor dissolves into a grove of humming saplings and Liora becomes their new sorter—an inhale that re-weights the entire premise. Causal chain holds: moon-dust prod → leaf runes → root-ladder → body-price → new grove; no step relies on coincidence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of seed-sorting, monument-building, and leaf-reading intensifies until the cadence shift of “begin” reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating arbor’s ashen bark, dangling roots, and monuments of pebble, salt, and hair are tactile, lived-in, and filtered through Liora’s ritual priorities. Environment constrains the final choice: only the crown’s apex offers the leaf-language she must decode, forcing the climb that costs her humanity. Micro-setting (hollow cheek, palm-embedded star) charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode or ignore the prophecy—tightens when the moon-dust shudders and the leaves spell a command. One meaningful deepening: the monuments liquefy/ghost, proving the message is live and she must pay a body-price to proceed. Escalation is textural: each fallen leaf increases density until the root-ladder appears; cost is the loss of human skin, felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the seed-sorting metaphor: order is not stasis but selection for future becoming. Subtext whispers through monuments—every forgotten thing demands remembrance—until Liora becomes the next medium. Final image of her bark-dappled skin and humming grove reweights “sorting” as self-sacrifice, no moral stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“leaves began to fall in earnest now, not drifting but *spelling*”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices texture, weight, and song of seeds; her diction never drifts into academic or corporate register. Compression (“She jumped.”) accelerates the climax without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—each metaphor (sky like parchment, moonstone like dragonfly wing) appears once and serves immediacy. Information density is high: one sentence often advances atmosphere, character, and world-rule simultaneously. No scaffold or artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses agrarian ritual with post-apocalyptic sky-arbor; seed-sorting as prophecy-decoding feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking—eating a leaf to become the next arbor—pays off emotionally and conceptually. No close echoes of famous scenes; specificity (pebble for drowned nymphs, thimble of salt for shadow-trader) anchors the mythic frame in lived detail.</comment>
