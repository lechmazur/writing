<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—copyist caution vs. piratical daring—are dramatized in the midnight broadcast and in his trembling hand on the dial. The interiority is concrete: “he let himself believe” collides with the visible risk of the girl’s arrival. Micro-choices (dimming the dial, pressing the paper to his chest) embody values under pressure. Final renunciation—leaving the quill—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the phrase blanketing the city in ash re-weights the premise—stories now move without authors. Causal chain holds: pirate broadcast → girl arrival → ghost phrase propagation; each “because” tightens options. Cost is legible in the empty alcove and dry inkwell. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The radio dial’s glow functions as micro-setting: it dims under speech, dictates the blackout beat, and charges the final blank-page image. Mist and damp paper constrain acoustics and risk detection. Spatial choreography is clean—door knock → dial dim → paper transfer. Environment mirrors internal flicker without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city’s voice vs. execution—signals early. One meaningful tightening: girl’s arrival forces Elias to choose visibility over safety. Cost is visible: blank scores left behind, his exile implied. Escalation causal under broadcast-to-reprisal lens; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: forbidden lyric → dust learns speech. No explicit thesis; resonance in final ash-graffiti image. Subtext in girl’s salt-stiff coat and Elias’s dry inkwell—art outruns artist. Ambiguity lingers: who wrote the walls? Complexity preserved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—music metaphors, copyist diction (“final measures,” “quill”). Rhythm compresses under knock: short clauses mimic pulse. Voice modulation clear: lyrical openings tighten to staccato beats at intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density: every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is patterned—ember, ash, salt—paid off in final graffiti. Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” is earned by prior metaphor web. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: copyist piracy + dust literacy. Banned-lyric contagion reverses usual rebel archetype. Specificity—yellowed sheet music, salt-rot docks—anchors universals. Risk in blank-sheet ending pays off by reweighting premise rather than neat triumph.</comment>
