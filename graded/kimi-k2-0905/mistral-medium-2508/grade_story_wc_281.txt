<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s affectionate skepticism is vivid—she kisses the cat yet scoffs at horoscopes—driving her to press the geode to her temple despite risk; the interior contradiction is active, not labelled. The micro-choice to paint rather than step through the door crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she accepts belief because it matters, renouncing immediate transcendence to leave a light for Mira. Only minor slack: “gravity but not gravity’s intentions” is slightly aphoristic, and the cat’s presence never alters tactics. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static shock → geode arrival → somatic sequence → wall-breathing → painting a door, each beat thickens texture and reweights stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the door pulsing “like a heartbeat” reconfigures options—she could still step through, but the painted light and cat in her arms manifest the cost of choosing to stay and remember. The final image (“the light remembered”) lands with undeniable conceptual cost under the inferred lens. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ozone/burnt-sugar air, fiber-optic tangle, and the geode’s fractal layers are selective, POV-filtered details that braid into the light-painting motif; the studio-as-node is revealed through action, not exposition. The micro-setting of the geode against temple constrains the somatic sequence that unlocks the lattice; environment literally guides the climax. Only hairline slip: “walls breathed” risks cliché, but the follow-up “veins of light…made her teeth ache” re-anchors it in sensory specificity. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—see the pathways Mira walked—tightens when the geode’s warmth forces a choice: follow or paint. Agency drives escalation: pressing geode→walls breathe→paint door; each step increases conceptual cost, foreclosing ego-dissolution in favor of stewardship. The painted door is the visible price that alters later options. Coincidence is absent; tension is sentence-level (“the sliver grew heavier”). </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: belief as an act of love, not truth. The final reconfiguration—painting a door instead of entering—re-weights “belief” from epistemology to ethics. Subtext lives in gesture: cat kiss, temple press, leaving the light on. No moralizing; the ultraviolet spiral Mira left is a concrete particular that keeps ambiguity alive. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly—colors have names, light behaves as pigment—anchored in Lena’s synesthetic bias. Syntax tightens under stress: “The sliver grew heavier. She understood.” No head-hopping; Mira’s laughter is external texture, not interior intrusion. Register stays within an artist’s lexicon; only micro-slip: “willowglass hope” is coined but justified by prior light-palette logic. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with beats: long sensory sentences early, fragment bursts at climax. High information density—each sentence advances image or causality; zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent within light-logic (“brushstroke of longing”); no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “remembered” motif. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy recall + fractal geode + light-painting studio = non-obvious portal mechanics. Risk-taking in somatic “non-gesture” sequence pays off when walls breathe; no genre retreat. Specific detail (muscovite lattice, UV-gold spiral) prevents template drift. Conceptual integrity maintained: belief repurposed as ethical art-praxis. Transformation test passes—swap any element and the emotional arc collapses. </comment>
