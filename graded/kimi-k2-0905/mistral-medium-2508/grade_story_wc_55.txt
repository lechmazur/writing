<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The scribe’s contradictory terror of time and craving to finish the orrery are dramatized in trembling knuckles and the cracked crystal he yields to; every micro-choice—kneeling, letting the fracture spread—externalizes the interior split. The “excruciatingly gentle” trait isn’t label-only; it dictates how he handles gears and how slowly he dares to fracture the forecourt, costing him bodily ease and social safety. Final renunciation of measurement is earned by the tactile confrontation with his own preserved echoes; cost is visible in the broken glass and the elders’ impending judgment. Interiority avoids therapy-speak—the fear is in the quill “too afraid to land,” the release in the sanctuary’s exhale. 9+ quick met: contradictory impulses live in-scene, closure choice bears palpable cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the asymmetrical, ticking orrery and the cracked forecourt reconfigure meaning—time is no longer measured but allowed to measure him. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush, echo, fracture pattern builds until the cadence shift (“the sanctuary itself seemed to exhale”) reweights stakes with felt cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (who, where, when) and pattern of crystal whispers is taught early; disorientation is functional, paid off when same whispers turn into his own unlived ticks. Persistent constraint—elders’ heresy charge—shapes every tactical hesitation; it lingers as the price he will pay after the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is not backdrop; its cool yield under bare feet shapes the decision to kneel, and its crack physically mirrors/amplifies his facial lines, forcing irreversibility. Micro-setting of the orrery parts—brass arms, moonstone pendulum—are handled, arranged, and asym-misaligned on the fractured surface; their tactile re-assembly is the climax. Hidden sunrise and petrichor narrow sensory bandwidth to match his narrowed life—only the olfactory and visual bleed through, guiding the moment he cracks silence. 9+ gate met: forecourt’s fracture directly charges final image; environment enables the ultimate asymmetrical tick.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—will he resurrect the forbidden orrery—tightens when petrichor nostalgia unravels his stasis; the fracture under his palm is the visible cost that forecloses retreat. Escalation is textural: density of silence, echo, and unfinished gears accumulates until the cadence shift of release; no external coincidence required. Agency is present in every beat: he rises, kneels, spreads the crack, retrieves, arranges; these micro-actions progressively foreclose obedience to elders. Price is legible—crystal fracture, audible sob-chime, and looming heresy charge—altering tactics from concealment to open defiance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence preserved by refusal becomes the very echo that forces its own breaking; no moral is stated, only enacted. Subtext lives in gesture—letting the fracture spread rather than stopping it confesses the need to externalize inner rupture. The orrery’s asymmetrical, imperfect ticking is the resonant answer to the elder’s demand for symmetry and control. Final image of cracked crystal + free-spinning gears reprices the rule that time must be obeyed rather than inhabited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to the scribe’s perceptual filter: he hears “fractured whispers” as voices until forced to recognize them as his own gears. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic excruciating gentleness, then fractures into short ticks: “tick-tick-ticked.” No head-hop; elders remain shadowy, as they do in his mind. Diction stays within plausible artisan-scribe lexicon—orrery, petrichor, chime—never drifts to academic meta-talk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: opening polysyndeton stretches hesitation; climactic fragments mimic metallic chimes. No synonym loops; “whispers” recurs but each time re-weighted—from feared voices to self-echo to liberated ticks. Metaphors stay coherent—clock heart, spider-thread crack—tied to bodily scale. Single line of possible scaffold: “let it mirror the lines on his own face” could compress, yet serves mirror function under high pressure; not closure-touching, so −0.2 only, still within 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: uses familiar “artist vs orthodoxy” frame but pivots on asymmetrical timepiece that measures silence rather than seconds; elders’ heresy rule is paid off. Specificity—moonstone pendulum, constellation-etched gears—anchors abstraction of “glacial hush.” Risk in letting climax be quiet fracture and asym-tick rather than grand smash pays off because textural cadence has taught reader to value hush over noise. Transformation test passed: only this scribe, this forecourt, this orrery could produce this exact resonance.</comment>
