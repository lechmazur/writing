<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific, but the “waiting for the unknown” stance keeps him reactive; the note is the first proactive beat, so the cost of solitude is asserted more than dramatized until the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the recorder starts, silence accepted as temporary, cost legible in “wasn’t sure he wanted to be found.” Causal chain is thin—note arrives by pigeon, not earned maneuver—but lens holds under accumulative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Courtyard, fountain, pigeon-band, brass recorder—each object is handled and re-handled, constraining attention and supplying the final image; lavender scent and damp flagstones tether every beat without static cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single tightening: zone’s shift from dormant to “breathing” narrows Elias’s options to listen rather than act; cost is conceptual (integrity vs. intervention) but not yet visceral, keeping pressure cerebral rather than urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Integrity-in-solitude theme emerges through recorder-as-witness and refusal to turn around; final image of recording silence reweights premise without moralizing, though subtext stays modest within word count.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Meteorologist’s perceptual signature—barometric quivers, ozone taste, lateral knot-work—governs syntax and diction; no head-hop, distance steady, rhythmic control exact, final sentence a blade-cut cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative layer is disciplined—every metaphor (pages in rain, blade through silk) is brief, apt, and paid off; no register drift, no scaffold, momentum breathes with dusk timing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Storm-recorder as confidant, pigeon-courier in a quarantine zone—specific synthesis feels inevitable; quiet courtyard at twilight is familiar frame but recharged by atmospheric science lens and sentient-weather concept.</comment>
