<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The two leads are sharply individuated—Elias’s brass arm whirs with tactile specificity, Liora’s needle-card flick signals her calculating edge. Internal contradictions surface in micro-choices: Elias lunges with the flat of a prosthetic hand, not the blade, showing thinker forced into fighter stance. Their joined grip on the warm council key is a credible, earned renunciation of prior antagonism, trading duel for alliance with visible cost—partnership now forecloses lone victory. Status and occupational detail (professor vs magistrate) shape tactics; dialogue snaps with subtext, though one “diplomatic mask” line flirts with label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: each parry narrows the intellectual contest toward the sundial’s hidden notch; the needle-up card embeds in VII/VIII split, forcing Elias to read Liora’s twelve-year-old code. Closure is a Decisive Change—key revealed, paths merged—paid with the metallic scorch on Elias’s forearm and the partners’ forfeiture of Council verdict. One small lens wobble: “philosophical debate” stakes stay abstract until the key’s physical appearance converts argument to action. Orientation is clean within 120 words; mosaic shards (sundial, brook, heron) are legible under a single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass atrium refracts light onto the half-painted dial’s wet pigment, constraining sword angles and sight-lines; the brook’s bend physically echoes the city’s first moral compass, guiding Elias’s final thrust to the gnomon’s hidden notch. Brass-geared arm and tin needle card act as micro-settings that limit grip and parry options. Haptic specificity—“crushed mint,” “sparks on brass”—is selective under crisis-narrowed attention. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; bodies circle the dial without impossible positions. Weather/light evolve with afternoon angle, directly enabling the code-casting shadow that unlocks the compartment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whose epistemology rules, answers or destinations—gets physicalized when the key’s iron heft replaces verbal sparring. Escalation is a single, meaningful tightening: every blade touch forces closer attention to the sundial’s cipher until the needle card’s shadow splits numerals and only joint interpretation can unlock the compartment. Cost is legible: brass sparks, diplomatic masks dropped, alliance forged at the price of solo vindication. No convenient luck; coincidence is absent, pressure is coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: knowledge-as-map vs knowledge-as-weapon refracts through fencing geometry, culminating in the partners’ unspoken pact to remake the city’s “unfinished argument.” The brook’s indifference and overlapping clock chimes reweight prior motifs into a conceptual repricing—time and water keep flowing past human codes. Ambiguity is purposeful; no moral is declared, only the shared grin that invites chaos. Final image of silhouettes—one whole, one augmented—crystallizes inclusive future rather than binary answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice carries perceptual signature: Elias’s narration filters through mechanical clicks and refracted light angles, never venturing beyond his sensory reach. Syntax is crisp, rhythmic, and varied—“lunged...not with blade but with flat of palm”—mirroring fencer’s feint-and-recover cadence. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored in Elias even during Liora’s revelations, her interiority surfaced only through his reading of her smirk and grip. Diction stays within plausible academic-inventor lexicon; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, symbolic, kinetic jobs—“the card landed needle-up, its delicate filigree glinting—a challenge.” Metaphors are coherent (light like shattered diamonds) and physically sustained through refraction choreography. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; action order is sequential and unambiguous. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action-image that recharges “unfinished argument” motif. Minor elevated flourish “brooked doesn’t stall, it waits” stays within philosopher-poet register and is earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fencing-as-philosophy duel feels fresh yet inevitable; transforming a Danish sewing kit into cryptographic call-back weaponizes domestic artifact. Sundial cipher keyed to council chambers and brook curvature syntheses city-planning, ethics, and personal history into one tangible lock. Risk—steampunk limb, academic duel, code buried in wet paint—pays off without gimmickry; emotional truth lies in rivalry flipped to coalition. Specificity (brass hinges, Roman numeral split) prevents template drift; story would collapse if replaced with generic objects.</comment>
