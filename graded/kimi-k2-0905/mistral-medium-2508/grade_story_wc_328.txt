<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s bitterness-to-joke arc is legible; the arrowhead-seed choice crystallizes his renunciation. Yet interiority drifts into lyric commentary (“bitterness had become his religion”) rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure. Emotional states are announced more than dramatized until the final laugh. Motive coherence survives, but micro-choice granularity is thinned by the poetic overlay.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden absorbs Elias and reconfigures the stake from rescue to participation in the joke. Causal chain holds: arrowhead → phone → seed → garden claim; each step because/therefore. Cost is felt—“the garden swallowed him whole” with visible forfeiture of human form. Minor causal fuzz: phone’s prior existence in loam is revealed only at ring moment, but this does not break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Underground garden is evoked with fungal glow, root warmth, and thyme tangle rooting every action. Micro-setting objects—arrowhead, cordless phone—function as terrain that constrains choice and later reconfigure into the closure image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: crushed sage and “something older, something hungry” set tone without catalog excess. Spatial choreography holds as vines coil from soil to ankle to swallowing, anchoring the metamorphose beat.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sister-loss vs cosmic joke—tightens when the phone delivers his younger self’s taunt; this deepens rather than widens pressure. One meaningful escalation: arrowhead shifting to seed forces the final either/or. Cost is visible: human body forfeited, static voice assumed. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 600-word window; could wish for a second pressure notch to reach top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of laughing back at an indifferent universe. The joke motif accrues through phone taunt, Elias’s final laugh, and the garden’s yearly punchline-flower—never abstractly sermonized. Ambiguity is preserved: the garden may be predator or partner. Resonance lands in the frostbitten-hope image of roots singing with static, reweighting earlier loss without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice sustains a lush, synesthetic cadence—“gravitationally playful,” “harmony untamed”—that teaches its pattern early and pays off in the blooming flower’s impossible tune. Diction stays within Elias’s researcher-observer lexicon while bending toward incantation. No head-hopping; herbalist’s voice stays external. Minor register drift: “cosmic joke” verges on thesis-statement but is saved by being spoken by the antagonistic phone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; metaphor density is high yet purposeful, pattern-taught. A few near-paraphrase clusters (“the joke” repeated in close succession) slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or impossible physics. Opening and final lines are image-driven and ear-tested. Overall propulsion survives the lyric load, but trimming 2–3 adjectives would sharpen peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cryptid grief, gravitational arrowhead, and sentient garden feels singular. The phone-as-confessor twist reframes cosmic-horror trope into dark humor without ironic detachment. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when flower hums an unhuman tune—an inevitable yet unforeseeable reconfiguration. Static+roots+sister-smile combo is specific enough to resist synonym swap, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
