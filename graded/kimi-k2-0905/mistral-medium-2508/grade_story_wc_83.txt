<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid—geode as map, the memory of her veil floating—and her refusal to remain “subject” is dramatized through micro-choices (keying the console, smile in the alarms). Interior contradiction (grief vs exhilaration) is sustained in scene, not told. Final renunciation—she hunts memory, not repair—earns its cost: she accepts permanent loss of the original day. Voice never slips into therapeutic gloss; “hunting” becomes her new identity without label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (geode warm → thread bright → finger hovers) is a because/therefore chain that collapses options. Closure is Charged Poise: observatory dark, geode cold again, storm still raging—felt cost is the irreversibility of mere memory. No orientation debt; dome groan and console cue anchor space/time by line 4. The final image reweights the premise: she pays with eternal incompleteness for a single instant of pre-choice sensation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Observatory steel ribs, storm lattice on screen, and geode facets are returned to at every beat; each constrains action—she can’t flee the dome, can’t ignore the crystal’s warmth. Micro-setting (body) tracks: palm on cold glass, pulse in throat, exhaled breath in blackout—environmental stress narrows perception believably. Spatial choreography is clean: console → screen → finger hover → dark exit, no impossible positions. Final image charges theme: dome’s dying lights mirror the “unmade past” she now carries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to the unmade moment—spikes visibly when the thread brightens; agency is her finger over ENTER. Escalation is one tightening: from observing pattern to risking collapse of reality for one uncaptured choice. Cost is legible: permanent exile from any repaired future—she steps into blackout with only memory. No coincidence; all pressure is self-inflicted by her console choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: potential resides not in what happens but in what almost did; geode’s “unused time” reweights from joke to existential currency. Subtext in her smile amid alarms: joy is the right to touch impossibility, not fix it. Final image—hunting in storm—offers no moral, only stance: remembrance as perpetual pursuit. Ambiguity lingers: is she sated or condemned? Both readings credible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays inside Lena’s perceptual filter: “smelling of burnt sugar,” “geode warm as if storm had seeped.” Syntax compresses under pressure—fragments (“Not her wedding. Not her survival.”) echo cardiac rhythm. No head-hopping; scientist voice is static-filter only. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; “perturbation” is repeated only after she’s heard techs say it. Rhythm escalates: longer sentences pre-choice, staccato pre-whiteout, single exhalation in dark.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “veil floated upward…intangibly tangible” does triple work (image, concept, emotional sting). Zero loops; no sentence restates prior content. Metaphors stay coherent—storm threads, crystal map, knife of theory—each reappears to sharpen, not decorate. Final clause “hunting” stands alone paragraph for punch; no scaffold needed. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” but fits the science frame already invoked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—time-crystal, observatory, drone-strike trauma—are re-wired through sensory specificity: veil’s lift, geode warmth, storm lattice. Risk taken: no repaired timeline, only memory access; this anti-redemption feels fresh. Synthesis of quantum lingo with grief is seamless, not grafted. “Unused time” as pocketed mineral is an original metaphor that carries full thematic load. Could not swap geode for any MacGuffin—its fracture planes literally refract the emergency lights onto her face.</comment>
