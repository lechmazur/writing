<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—letter clutched yet withheld, shard pressed but not bled—are dramatized in tactile beats; the final release is earned by prior micro-choices and carries a felt cost (loss of the letter’s literal weight). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values: silence < apology < surrender. The change is credible but the sister remains off-page, so relationship crucible pressure is implied not staged; this caps the score beneath 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: letter released + shard healed = Charged Poise that reconfigures silence into song. Causal chain (letter → condensation test → release) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each repetition of “evoke” tightens the cadence and reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 3. Cost is visible—“the paper brushed her fingers—a touch as light as forgiveness”—so 9+ gate is met. A 0.1 deduction because the sister’s absence makes the decisive change one-sided, trimming the fullest resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove dome, black-water mirrors, and salt-mist are filtered through Liora’s synesthetic bias; every sensory note pressures her toward either secrecy or exposure. The shard functions as micro-setting: its changing texture (jagged → smooth) tracks her internal arc and literally charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—root, current, moonlight paths track cleanly. Environment constrains the choice (only here can condensation letters form), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she surrender silence?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each condensation inscription grows sharper, the shard’s healing mirrors her own, pressure peaks when she bleeds/not bleeds. Agency is present—she lets the letter go—but because the external world offers no fresh obstacle, the tightening is incremental rather than a reversal that forecloses a live option; hence just shy of 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: unsent words → materialized breath → released paper, culminating in the non-literal answer that some letters must be drowned to be heard. No moral is stated; the final image re-prices silence as a luxury she can no longer afford. Subtext hums in the spirits’ question—“What are you waiting for?”—answered only by gesture. Minor sentimentality in “fierce tenderness” phrase is safely absorbed by imagistic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is lush yet precise—“gnarled roots cradling the black water like a secret.” Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses build texture, then shorten at release. No head-hopping; diction stays within Liora’s mystic lexicon. Patterned elision (“the spirits always knew”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Voice is distinct enough to edge into 9-band territory, but a single overt lyric flourish (“fierce tenderness”) keeps it at 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is assured; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high—one line often layers sensory data, metaphor, and interior cue. Two micro-loops: “the shard healed… her skin do the same” and “the mangroves sighed… Liora hummed along” are intentional parallelism, not artifact. No mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure. A minor scaffold phrase “the spirits’ song” appears thrice with identical noun phrase could tighten, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Caribbean gothic mangroves + gargothic cathedral shard + evanescent condensation script feels fresh and specific; removal would break the piece. Spirits-as-choir trope is familiar but re-weighted via Liora’s participatory humming. Unsent-letter premise is common, yet the dissolve-into-black-water exit is non-obvious. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk is present but moderate; the synthesis is memorable rather than revolutionary, settling at solid 8.0.</comment>
