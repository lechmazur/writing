<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Veyra’s hunger for knowledge feels lived-in via her ritual of retreating to the bathroom to "think" and her seventeen-year cataloguing obsession, but the climactic shift to renunciation ("she would do neither") is stated rather than dramatized with a tangible choice beat, so the cost is conceptually legible yet not embodied on the page—right beneath the 9-band gate that demands causal proof of change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The mosaic pattern is taught early (spiral cameo → orchard → mirror lag) and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the note resets to “the next one,” turning the entire journey into a loop whose cost is the curator’s erased individuality (her face inside the shell). Causality holds under an Accumulative lens; each shard reweights knowledge until the final image makes the price—the self become artifact—undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Micro-settings—the bathroom acoustics, the hollow cameo, the single dissolving petal—continuously constrain tactics (where she thinks, how she carries memory, what she swallows). The final pistachio shell with her etched face literalizes the body-as-setting, charging the closing image with irreversible cost and satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Nonlinear inheritance as dominant stake escalates by density: each blossom forecloses documentary or destructive paths until only self-sacrifice remains. The tightening is legible but abstract—no concrete resource lost—so while the orchard reweights options, the felt price is conceptual, not visceral, keeping the score just inside the high band.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge survives only by consuming its seekers. The pistachio shell’s return as her own face reprises the motif with a chilling CR—she becomes the artifact she once catalogued—delivering resonance without moralizing, exactly the demanded non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Veyra’s perceptual signature—cataloguer’s taxonomy, synaesthetic scent of violet sap, preference for bathroom acoustics—remains consistent and distinct. Controlled psychic distance and rhythmic fragments ("Danger was the point.") heighten pressure without head-hop; the experimental slippage (mirror speaks) is pattern-taught and pays off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences perform double duty ("The orchard shivered. A door appeared.") and metaphor stays precise ("trees grew in the shape of questions"). The final line’s quiet diction—"She ate it."—delivers propulsive closure without figurative muddle, meeting the high-band quick test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—museum as recursive knowledge-trap orchard—feels freshly synthesized; no extant trope maps cleanly. Risk is maximized (curator eaten by her own archive) yet coherence holds, earning the +0.3 risk bonus. The pistachio-cameo logic is so specific that swapping any element would collapse the闭合 image.</comment>
