<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s stubborn devotion to the orchard is palpable through her tactile micro-choices: wrapping copper, tracing grooves, refusing the elders’ corner. The diary and wire act as extensions of her will, giving every gesture a cost that scales to her fading body. Her final stillness, hand on warm wire, crystallizes a life-long stance; the sapling’s turn toward stone is the earned external proof. One hairline slip: “brazen” is declared not dramatized—yet the diary line pays the bill.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s new pulse reweights the temple’s rule-set while Elira’s death is felt in Tomas’s cool copper bracelet. Causal chain holds—every copper loop she installs foretells the living merger that will outlast her. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of breath, wire, blossom density tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt applied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Ribcage” curve and warm copper in grooves tether body, tool, and stone; the orchard actively narrows Elira’s dwindling moves and charges Tomas’s mimicry at the end. Sensory economy favors touch and temperature—exactly what a dying gardener would trust. No visual glut; limestone, oak, wire stay recycled and handled. Final image of sapling leaf brushing stone is micro-setting at its most causally alive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—leave a living refutation of temple purity doctrine—tightens when elders demand uproot and Elira instead braids copper, trading her last strength for a post-mortem alliance between tree and pillar. One clear tightening beat: her cracked knees versus sapling’s pliant trunk forecloses rest and forces the marriage. Cost is visible: breath thins, hand stays warm on wire. No reversal needed; the pressure is accumulative, the price cumulative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrent copper marriages—tree to stone, woman to earth, novice to legacy—never sermonized. Final diary line reframes mortality as stewardship, not conquest, reweighting all prior “heresy.” Ambiguity lingers: the temple may still call it corruption, but the orchard’s pulse has already rebutted. No tidy moral; the rebuttal is vegetal and silent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at Elira’s shoulder, filtering world through gardener’s tactile lexicon: “lovers,” “ribs,” “breath.” Syntax grows shorter as her breath thins, rhythm echoing exertion. No head-hop; Tomas’s skepticism arrives as observed gesture, not internal ventriloquism. Copper’s chime and leaf tremor are perceptual signatures distinct to this voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances wire, wire, wire toward mortal crescendo. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“copper oxidized just enough to feed”—no mixed vehicles. Opening line drop-forges mythic authority without purple clutter. Final paragraph’s “orchard whispered” risks cliché but is earned by thirty years of prior breath imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing botanical science with sacred architecture through illicit metallurgy feels inevitable yet fresh; no extant template owns this orchard. Copper-as-nutrient and stone-as-root-host rewire both garden and temple tropes from the inside out. Risk of quiet ending pays off: the last image is vegetal, not heroic, yet conceptually explosive. Transformation test fails if names change—this orchard could not breathe anywhere else.</comment>
