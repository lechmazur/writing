<comment>Lysara’s grief for her brother, her “prism-mind,” and her refusal to confess to the elders create a credible interior contradiction that drives every beat; the moment she presses the smudge to flame and chooses to plant the seed, she crosses a visible threshold with cost. Interiority stays concrete—“the seed glowed between her ribs”—never sliding into label-speak. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the single-POV default is met. Motive is rooted early (“Find where the combinations hide”) and escalates to the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test; a hair-slip of sentiment in “She hadn’t come for power” keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed in ash reweights the entire quest, making her future return inevitable with felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light, seed, and inversion culminates in the final reconfiguration. Causality holds: doodle → grotto → chamber → seed, each step triggered by her active choice. The inversion hour rule is taught early and governs tactics; no orientation penalty applies.</comment>

<comment>The grotto’s quartz teeth, floating pebbles, and bioluminescent mushroom ring are tactile, lived-in, and directly constrain her placement of the manuscript. The lantern’s “clandestinely luminous” flame and the moon-sickle refraction are selective sensory detail filtered through her perceptual urgency. Spatial choreography remains coherent as she kneels, presses, and crashes back. Environment charges the final image: the seed must be planted in that same mist-fed dark, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve a seed that might reenter her brother’s lost moment—is signaled early and tightens when the threshold collapses and only one seed is seized. The inversion clock narrows options; her lunge to brush a single jar is visible agency under pressure. Cost is legible: blank manuscript, sealed chamber, seed glowing inside her body. Escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than a chain, keeping it just below the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge that hides inside absence itself—emerges through the seeds of silence and the necessity of surrendering the written word for a living seed. Subtext operates in gesture: pressing thumb-print to flame enacts a burial of archival certainty. The final image reweights the stakes without moralizing; “some doors only open when you stopped looking” is oblique, earned. No thematic echo or sermon appears; resonance is built from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught early—“prism-mind,” “clandestinely luminous”—with perceptual signature sustained: she notices refractions, margins, hidden light. Syntax modulates under pressure: fragments like “An hour.” accelerate the beat. No head-hopping; POV distance holds. The elevated diction remains within an archivist’s plausible lexicon and is paid off at closure, satisfying the 9+ quick test; microscopic over-alliteration in “sickle into jagged rainbows” is the lone hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—“the page drank the light” does three jobs in five words. Figurative language is selective and patterned; only one mixed metaphor risk (“air ripped like a held note”) but it remains legible. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; momentum breathes with the beats. Proofing clean; no typos or homophones.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of alchemical seed-vault with inverted-gravity cave feels freshly synthesized; no close genre echo. The notion that knowledge must be grown, not read, reframes archival longing into living risk. Specificity—“combinations of sound and silence”—anchors the concept in sensory rather than abstract ground. Risk in collapsing the chamber after a single touch is bold yet causally grounded, earning the +0.3 within-band bonus.</comment>
