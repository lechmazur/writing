<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for wholeness while courting self-annihilation—are rendered through embodied, lyric interiority and micro-choices like the thumb-trace of the rune. The final merger carries felt cost: the tablet disintegrates, his lineage’s burden turns to dust on his skin, and gravity finally claims him. The “labyrinth of self” motivation stays abstract, never crystallizing into a specific, testable flaw or memory, which blunts the arc’s specificity. Still, the earned endurance of weight is a credible renunciation that forecloses return.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mosaic loop is taught early—“the viaduct rebuilt itself every time he faltered”—and closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone holds, dawn arrives, the bridge vanishes, leaving Elias irrevocably changed. Causality is situational-pressure: each sideways rewind is triggered by his rune-touch, narrowing options until the final merger costs the tablet and the eternal return. Orientation is clear by word 30; no lens ambiguity. The abstract lineage motive is the only softened causal anchor, but it does not break the loop’s logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The viaduct’s wet neon arches, the living warmth of the clay, and the barefoot chill function as micro-setting that constrains every step; when the stone finally holds, the environmental shift signals closure. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold skin, pulsing rune, reverse-shattering sound—mirrors Elias’s oscillation between weightlessness and final weight. Spatial choreography is clean across fracturing timelines; no floating rooms. The glowing viaduct charges the last image—its vanishing is the visible price of conquest—meeting the 9+ gate, but slight over-reliance on atmospheric lyric keeps it just below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conquer the self-loop or be peeled apart—tightens when each sideways rewind costs another version of Elias, culminating in the merger that incinerates the tablet. Agency is continuous: every rune-trace is his choice, forcing escalation from hesitation to collision. The final price (tablet gone, gravity restored, bridge erased) is visible and felt. Because the labyrinth remains metaphorical, the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of self-conquest emerges through the iterative shedding of alternate selves rather than exposition; the vanishing viaduct reweights the premise—identity is not escaped but endured. Subtext lives in gesture: the broken-hourglass rune, the barefoot chill, the dust on his palms. No final moral is stated; the dawn image offers quiet Conceptual Repricing. The abstraction “labyrinth of self” is the only soft echo, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric-compressed voice owns a perceptual signature—gravity “hesitated around him,” rain clings “like a second skin,” time moves “sideways”—taught in the first paragraph and sustained to the last line. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentation at the merger beat (“collapse, a merging, the fractured timelines knitting…”) then exhales into longer cadences as weight arrives. No head-hopping; narrative certainty stays within Elias’s plausible knowledge. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty—each image advances atmosphere, choice, or body-state: “the rain’s afterglow bleeding into something thicker, something hungry.” No scaffold loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (glass shatters in reverse, stone holds). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Two near-adjacent “something” clauses are the only micro-repetition, not severe enough to dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The procedural-generation viaduct as self-labyrinth is a fresh synthesis of glitch-era and mythic tropes; the sideways rewind and the cost of gravity’s first embrace avoid familiar time-loop beats. Specificity—the clay tablet’s broken hourglass rune, the barefoot chill—grounds the concept in sensory memory. The final vanishing bridge reconfigures prior material without gimmick. Risk is high but clarity survives, meriting the upper band.</comment>
