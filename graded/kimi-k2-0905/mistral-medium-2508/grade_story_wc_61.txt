<comment>Veyra’s interiority is lyrical but thin; “otherworldly sentimentalist” is asserted rather than dramatized. The gear-as-memory-currency is a sharp micro-choice, yet her relinquishment of “first bloom” feels abstract because the memory itself is never concretely rendered. Contradictory impulses (cling vs. share) are named but not simultaneously staged; we are told she hesitates rather than seeing her body enact hesitation. Still, the notion that memory itself is the price gives the arc a visible, character-scaled cost that lifts it above mid-band.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s rule-set is rewritten when Veyra pays a memory to open a non-thermal transit. Causality holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens—each sonar ping adds density until the path materializes. Orientation is complete by line 5; no anchors drift. The only causal fuzz is how the gear “demands” memory—no prior rule teaches this, so the price feels author-inserted rather than world-inevitable, but the final image reweights the premise cleanly.</comment>

<comment>The nebula garden is evoked through kinetic, synesthetic detail—“petals of ionized gas,” “hum of frequencies” felt in bone—so setting is both atmosphere and tool. Spatial choreography is minimal (no distances or body positions shift), but the micro-setting of the gear pressed to temple serves as the pivot object that constrains the final choice. Consistency is flawless; no world rule contradicts. While the environment never actively impedes Veyra (no thorns, no gravity shear), its luminous “cradle-cage” metaphor charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for charging the final image.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—“share light without burning”—is signaled early and tightens when the gear demands a memory as toll, forcing a trade-between-equally-precious-goods (nostalgia vs. future). Escalation is textural: each sonar ping layers luminous threads until the path coheres, reweighting the cost of transit. Agency is interior but genuine: she actively relinquishes the memory rather than having it stolen. However, the external garden remains passive; no environmental pushback raises the physical danger, so the pressure is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as an inverse Prometheus: not stealing fire but renouncing it, privileging resonance over consumption. The refrain “we do not own the light; we only borrow it” is the single line that flirts with Thematic Echo, yet it is ancestral dialogue embedded as credo, so the articulation feels earned rather than tacked on. The final image—hands cupping “possibility of a new garden, one that did not fear the dark”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she savior or exile? That unresolved charge gives the piece honest aftertaste.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative: long vowel cadences mimic the slow exhalation of gas petals, while brass-and-frequency diction keeps the diction otherworldly yet precise. Perceptual signature is strong—Veyra notices “the same frequency as her heartbeat,” a synesthetic bias that recurs when the gear thrums through bone. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Filter verbs (“she thought,” “she realized”) are absent; instead, perception is rendered as immediate sensory fact, keeping psychic distance shallow and consistent.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from breath-long fragments to rolling clauses that mirror nebular drift; no template cadence. Figurative density is high—“petals of ionized gas,” “slow gravity of forgotten stars”—yet each metaphor is internally coherent and pays off in the final “bridge of resonating light.” One paraphrase loop appears: “the same patterns repeat, the same mistakes, the same slow surrender” could be compressed, but it is purposeful anaphora that teaches the cycle she will break. No mixed metaphors or clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of eco-parable + steampunk memory-currency + sonar-as-star-mapping feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The premise subverts the Prometheus trope by refusing fire outright, making “light without heat” a conceptual stakes inversion rather than a cosmetic skin. Risk is taken: a quiet, lyric beat substitutes for set-piece action, yet coherence is maintained. Specificity of gear-worn brass edges and sonar-ping geometry anchors the novelty in tactile detail, preventing abstraction drift.</comment>
