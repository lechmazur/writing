<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—collecting fragments to barter yet insisting she isn’t trying to return—play out in embodied micro-choices (pressing wheel to temple, advancing film, final jump). The interior contradiction is dramatized, not labeled, and the earned renunciation costs her the possibility of escape, visible in the empty final frame and her surrender to the lagoon-hands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—images accrue like film frames—and closure lands via Charged Poise: the blank frame + weightless jump reweight all prior fragments with undeniable cost. Causality is interior but legible: fragment-hoarding → ghost confrontation → renunciation. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) surface by line 4 and payoff at jump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is no backdrop: its viscous memory-surface dimples to reveal younger selves, physically catches Lira differently each time, and delivers the final reconfiguration. Brass horses, rusted platform, and camera wheel act as micro-setting that constrains tactics—every scavenged object is handled, advanced, or surrendered in beat-level action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—whether Lira will surrender to or outrun her accumulated past—tightens when the lagoon churns out every failed self. The blank frame is the visible price that forecloses the fantasy of reconstruction; her jump is agency choosing immersion. Escalation is textural: each resurfaced ghost increases density until renunciation is the only option left.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of salvage: collecting fragments doesn’t rebuild identity, it compounds regret until surrender is the only cost left to pay. The blank final frame reprices the whole metaphor—absence, not accumulation, ends the arc. No explaining, no moral; the image alone reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught (“wind that never ceased,” “lagoon remembered”) and modulates under pressure—short, breathless clauses at the jump. Perceptual signature is Lira’s: she reads surfaces, counts frames, smells ozone. No head-hopping; ghost dialogue is externalized memory, not independent interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers job—image + momentum + interiority. Syntax accelerates into the jump, then fractures to match impact. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: “chipped by wind,” “gears groaned,” “static of a future” all reappear in charged final image. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The memory-lagoon that physically remembers and consumes is a fresh synthesis of ghost-story and ghost-image; the disposable camera wheel as time-currency feels inevitable yet new. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal plot—heightens coherence and pays off in the blank-frame reconfiguration. No template echo, no hedged middle.</comment>
