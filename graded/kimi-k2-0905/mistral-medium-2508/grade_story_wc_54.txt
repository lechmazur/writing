<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s “functional-creative” trait is dramatized three times—scavenging the kiosk, calibrating water pressure, sketching the pedestrian bridge—each choice visibly costing her daylight, social compliance, and the town’s last illusion of escape. Interiority stays concrete (“ink-stained fingers,” “rusted gears”) and avoids label-speak; contradictions (rule-following vs. trespass) play out in micro-choices rather than monologue. Flaws drive escalation: ignoring safety regs literally re-opens the terminal, and the final refusal to “fix” it lands as Earned Stasis with civic cost. The foreman coda is brief, but she withholds explanation, foreclosing easy validation.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal is not restored but re-purposed, water re-routed, bridge sketched—cost is the irreversible admission that “the town won’t get its spaceport back.” Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore—blueprints buried → she digs; sextant hum → she traces dead travelers’ arrows; water flows → doors open; bridge sketched → horizon replaces stars. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line three. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: belief is redirected, not returned. Persistent constraint—the corroded, structurally-unsound shell—shapes every tactic and the final Charged Poise image of the weather-vane pointing horizon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The terminal’s “arched ribs of corroded steel” and “circuit-board floor plan” are not backdrop but obstacle: layout dictates path-finding, water pressure re-opens doors, scavenged carnival scaffolding becomes bridge supports. Sensory triage matches crisis—burnt-sugar scent, bruise-colored sky, algae-thick water—each detail either signals hazard or usable resource. Micro-setting (the sextant fragment) charges the final image when pocket warmth syncs with horizon turn. Spatial choreography is exact: collapsed kiosk to hydroponics bay to second-story exit track cleanly across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the town regain a viable route out—tightens once: from impossible spaceport to imperfect pedestrian bypass. Agency is continuous: she excavates, maps, redirects water, sketches detour; each micro-act forecloses the fantasy of flights and incurs civic-material cost. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal (her compulsion) vs. structural (rusted maze). Price is legible on-page: the terminal’s resurrection is partial, belief permanently downgraded from cosmic to terrestrial, paid for with her career risk and the town’s scaled-down hope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “hope is a redirection, not a destination,” shown via hydraulics, bridge geometry, and weather-vane spin—never asserted until the marginal equation, which reads as engineer’s private cipher, not sermon. The carnival’s departure and terminal’s partial resurrection reweight “escape” from star-ward to horizon-ward, a Conceptual Repricing charged by concrete particulars (water runs clear, kids chase hoop). Subtext sits in silence: no townsfolk thank her, no flights resume—stoic acceptance externalized through rust and wind. Complexity remains: the bypass is both victory and concession, inviting plural readings without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Lena’s perceptual filter—notations of angles, pressure, metal fatigue—syntax tightening into stub clauses as pressure peaks (“She calculated.”). Carnival-to-terminal diction avoids lyric purple, stays within engineer lexicon; metaphor is engineered (“circuit board,” “redirection”) not ornamental. No head-hop; foreman’s single line is reported speech, not interior access. Rhythm scales with tempo—long opening sentence breathes atmosphere, later fragments mirror maze turns—demonstrating deliberate voice control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line density is high: one sentence often jobs setting, symbolism, and causality—“the terminal shuddered, not collapsing, but resurrecting.” No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors (sextant “hummed with intent”) stay consistent with engineer worldview. Minor scaffold: “not with energy, but with intent” could trim to “hummed with intent,” but brevity remains within tolerance for 750-word count. Cadence varies by paragraph length and sentence shape; opening long sentence vs. final terse exchange (“I’m recalibrating”) supplies closure punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-carnival/post-apocalypse trope is inverted: no cosmic salvation, only civil-engineer retrofit of decay into modest thru-way. Sextant repurposed as hydraulic key is fresh physical logic; maze as “failed equation” fuses math and emotion. Risk taken with stoic tone pays off: wonder restrained inside rust, grease, and datapad lines—avoids sentimental uplift. Specificity of carnival-scaffold bridge and bruise-sky palette makes salvage particular, not generic. Transformation test fails if generic seeker swapped in—only an engineer could decrypt flow-rates and reuse scrap for bypass—so vision feels singular.</comment>
