<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger to “understand” the brownstone is concrete from the first beat; the inherited-house grief and the way he palms bricks give interior contradiction. The final takeover moment—Elias knocking with sugar he doesn’t need—shows a visible, earned flip from seeker to keeper, paying the lie-cost. Veyra remains atmospheric more than internally conflicted, slightly capping the relationship-as-crucible potential, but Elias alone satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias assumes the tutor role, the loop sealed by the identical sugar-knock image, undeniable conceptual cost that “some agreements are tombs.” Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each meteor-lesson adds density until the pattern crystallizes in the hand-off. Orientation anchors (third-floor, rooftop, Tuesday stairs) are taught early and payoff at the end, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bricks, seal-warmth, meteor-sky, and wisteria question-marks are filtered through Elias’s tactile obsession; every descriptor later re-weights during the interrogation beat. The rooftop garden supplies the micro-setting that literally provides the meteor “text” he reads, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across rooftop/apartment transitions; only the basement stair anomaly is mentioned, not enacted, so minor reserve.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“make the building speak”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the blood contract forecloses retreat. The interrogation beat is the single meaningful escalation: protagonist forces the wall to confess, price is the ghost-silhouette and his tutor-vacancy. Under Accumulative lens the meteor-cadence shift reweights cost; no reversal overload, just one decisive intensification, cleanly landed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “knowledge as burial” emerges through the repeating sugar/tea lie and the seal that turns owner into caretaker-corpse. Subtext lives in gesture: Veyra’s earth-smell, the seal’s temperature, the wallpaper silhouette—never explained, only shown. Final image reconfigures the opening lie into an inherited curse, offering resonant ambiguity rather than moral, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter—ink-stains, lintel sighs, meteor syllables—syntax grows clipped under the seal-burn moment, mirroring stress. Veyra’s diction is more arch but stays within mentor-trope bounds; no head-hopping. Compression like “patiently nimble” is taught early and paid off when Elias mirrors that patience in the coda, keeping rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: “wisteria vines curled like question marks” does double duty for setting and theme. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated note (“conceptual repricing”) is contained within Veyra’s dialogue, justified by his arch persona, so minimal register drift. Read-aloud rhythm peaks with the meteor shower single-line paragraphs, then settles into the quiet hand-off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “language of old buildings” and the hereditary-tutorial loop feel fresh, synthesizing urban gothic with linguistic fantasy. The sugar/tea bookend turns a polite cliché into viral transmission, a risk that pays off in the final image. Specificity—bricks remembering, Tuesday stair count—prevents swap-out; the concept could not survive a name-change pass. Bold yet coherent, meriting the upper band.</comment>
