<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, the deliberate press of quill to pulse—yet the arc pivots on an epiphanic beat (“runes bloom”) whose emotional cost is asserted more than dramatized. The contradiction between fear and exhilaration is present but blurs in the final paragraph’s celebrative rush, muting the scar-tissue payoff. Micro-choices (carving into stone, anointing skin) are specific and stake-shaping, earning the high-8 band; a hair more friction in the final self-forgiveness would have tipped 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the platform descends, scars “sing,” and the storm’s held breath becomes her new language—felt cost is undeniable. Causality holds: each micro-shed (quill tip, frost lattice, feather) forecloses retreat and reweights the stake under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) crystallize within 50 words. The final image reconfigures meaning without exposition—publish-now caliber.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating rock platform is never a postcard; its creak, altitude, and damp breath constrain every tactical choice—she writes on the stone because parchment would fly away. Micro-setting rule: the quill, her wrist, and the cup of cooling tea function as immediate terrain, charging the final anointing. Weather is not backdrop but countdown timer. Missing only a 9+ gate squeak: the valley’s geography stays abstract; a single tactile landmark could have nailed 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into stories—tightens through each shedding beat; the storm’s second breath is the live clock narrowing options. Escalation is textural: frost lattice, feather drop, rain welcome—each image reweights the same stake rather than pivoting plot, satisfying Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening (quill tip surrender → scar thread of light) forecloses the old self. Cost is legible but lightly felt—hence 8.7, not 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: scar as bridge, not wound, is enacted in frost and feather, never named aloud. Final image—rain as punctuation she no longer needs to speak—reweights all prior superstition via Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing; the crow’s returned feather is subtextual benediction. Complexity lingers: the storm still coming, the stories still unwritten.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Perceptual signature is steady—needle-sharp quill, onion-skin memory, ozone scent—filtered through Lian’s scholar-poet diction. Rhythm breathes with pressure: long, mist-laden sentences contract to fragmentary realizations (“They bloomed”). No head-hopping; single POV remains tethered to her pulse. Voice borders on lyric lushness but earns it through consistent metaphoric economy; one clause (“the world exhaled around her”) skirts excess yet fits the final release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence layers image and causality (“The quill shed its tip into her palm, a deliberate surrender”). Metaphors stay internally coherent—storm’s breath, onion heart, ink in water—no mixed vehicles. High information density: frost lattice forms and fractures in one breath. Final line (“She began to run”) releases rhythm exactly when exposition could have crept in—exemplary line-level control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Familiar premise—scar-as-story—is re-inflected through runic materiality and meteorological countdown; the floating tea platform is fresh micro-setting. Synthesis feels inevitable: grandmother’s onion lesson returns as crystalline quill tip, not nostalgic callback but tactical tool. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes. Could ascend to 9+ if the storm’s mythology were given one unexpected rule, but within-band originality is strong.</comment>
