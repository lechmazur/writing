<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fisher’s cool-headedness is shown through embodied micro-choices—pressing silence into dirt, driving the spike without flinch—so the trait actively shapes the climax. Interior contradiction is kept off-page; the “lifetime learning which echoes to drown” is asserted rather than dramatized, capping depth. Daughter-memory is filtered through sensory triggers (river-reed scent) rather than label, keeping emotion earned. Final renunciation carries visible cost: he lets the last echo go, foreclosing reunion, so endurance is credibly paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the fisher commands silence, reseals the sky, but forfeits the voice forever—cost is legible in blackened stems and the pocketed spike that “burned cold.” Causal chain holds: because he voices silence twice, the mouth obeys and the constellations snap back. Orientation is taught lyrically—garden, dock, forge—never breaking the accumulative lens. One micro-turn suffices; no beat is redundant; pattern taught early (soil hums → final hush) pays off in the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden, rail spike, and dock are handled tactilely: spike warm from forge, stems blacken under cursed sound, water swallows stars. Each object constrains choice—spike as hook, divining rod, then grave marker—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys the fisher’s profession: he notices hertz in soil, scent of reeds, not visual panoramas. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible jumps between shore, garden, and dock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep or release daughter’s echo—is signaled by the third paragraph and tightens when the mouth impersonates her. One meaningful deepening: soil refuses to hum, forcing him to dig toward void rather than tree, trading hope of recovery for duty of silence. Cost is visible (garden screams, stems die) and forecloses future retrieval. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: pattern break → density of sound → final hush; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief’s echo must be silenced by the bereaved—emerges through action, not thesis: fisher’s twice-voiced silence reweights “feral lullaby” into a lullaby that kills. Subtext coils in objects: spike forged for catch becomes tool for burial; constellations that once mapped a child’s sky are forced back into rigid lines, implying cosmic cost of parental order. Final smile in darkness offers resonant, non-moral answer: mastery of echoes is indistinguishable from complicity with void. No late articulation of meaning; image carries it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly latched to the fisher’s perceptual filter: he senses frequencies, smells reeds, counts seconds by water rhythm. Syntax compresses under stress—“garden screamed—a sound only he could hear”—then lengthens in the coda, mirroring emotional exhaust. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Diction remains within a working fisher’s lexicon; metaphor is sensory, not literary-academic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“sleepwalking constellations” returns as healed wound), so density never stalls momentum. Information dual-loads: “rail spike…still warm from the forge” reveals recent craft and paternal urgency. One mixed metaphor risk—“stars snapped like a healed wound”—but physical logic holds within the fantasy frame and lands cleanly at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Mythic premise—goddess of echoes devours voices through a garden that sings grief—is rendered through concrete labor: forge, net, spike, soil. Fusion of cosmic and parental stakes feels inevitable; no trope checklist. Risk taken in voicing silence as literal tool pays off structurally and thematically. Specificity of “teeth smooth as river stones” prevents generic fantasy ornament; the image could not swap into another tale without collapse.</comment>
