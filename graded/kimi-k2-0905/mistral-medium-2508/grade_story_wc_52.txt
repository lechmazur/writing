<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The widow’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the knife’s compulsion—are dramatized in every cut; the final refusal to sell the last carving embodies earned stasis with visible hand-ache and cold coffee as cost. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; instead, “the alternative—stopping—was a kind of death too” crystallizes the stakes. Micro-choices (climbing the ladder, turning the wood to catch light) reveal a hierarchy that puts memory above money. The character reads as an individual, not a type, and her flaw (inability to release the lions or the husband) drives the closing renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the uncarved blank remains upstairs, the completed lion stays on the sill, and the widow sits with cooled water—three silent objects that reconfigure her life-path with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; each carving session layers density until the final refusal to sell breaks the pattern. Causality is internal but legible: because each sale funded survival, refusing the next cup of coins forecloses future comfort. The last paragraph’s image of “steam curling into the shape of things she would never name” makes the conceptual price undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting: light fractures across the lion’s flank and literally determines where the widow places the final carving, charging the closure image. Cedar scent and worn ladder rungs are handled, not catalogued; they anchor body-in-space and mark time passing. Spatial choreography is flawless—ladder, kettle, window-sill track cleanly. Weather affects choice: the tapering rain parallels the tapering of grief’s urgency, letting the lion “stay” in sunlight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to keep the husband present without being consumed by absence—tightens when the first carving is kept instead of sold, foreclosing income. Escalation is accretive: each finished lion increases the widow’s emotional debt until the final refusal to sell crystallizes the cost (coins jingling like “hollow promises” is the audible price). No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is between release and retention, resolved by the micro-choice to leave the last lion in the light. Coincidence is absent; pressure is purely internal yet legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the repeating image of half-emerged lions that are “here and gone,” re-weighted when the widow allows one to stay rather than leave. No editorial thesis is stated; insight arrives through the concrete act of not selling. The final image of steam forming unnameable shapes offers resonant, non-literal answer: some absences must be inhabited, not filled. Subtext lives in silences—the absence of tears, the unnamed steam—inviting reader reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style is clean and consistent: “she called it the cost of standing too close to wild things” stays within the widow’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for carving, short beats for the kettle’s whistle—mirroring emotional intensity. Figurative language is sparse, never purple: “light fractured like old glass” is the single simile and it earns its place. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (“calloused palms,” “second skin” of sawdust) is character-bound and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Information density is high—“coins that jingled like hollow promises” does three jobs: sound, metaphor, thematic comment. Opening line anchors voice and metaphor; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier steam motif. No mixed metaphors or register drift; every verb is strong (“knife biting,” “lions dissolving into smoke”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “lion tamer’s widow who carves half-present lions” premise feels fresh, yet the emotional engine—grief converted into art that must be released—is timeless. Specificity of ash wood grain, rain-beaded skylight, and “rust-hued peace” prevents generic allegory. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative structure, but it pays off in the final refusal, proving boldness without gimmickry. Could edge higher if one more sensory particular unique to circus life had been woven in.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.3</grade>
</comment>The widow’s every climb, cut, and refusal is on-page; keeping the final carving is the decisive turn that could not occur without her specific history of selling the others. Her choice to endure absence rather than commodify it finalizes the lesson-harvest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The blank is handled in at least four beats: cradled up the ladder, bitten by the knife, shaped into haunch/mane, and finally left untouched upstairs—its potential preserved. The last lion’s glow on the sill reweights the blank’s earlier promise of “wholeness violated.”</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Here and gone” shapes every carving action—lions stepping out of wood—and drives the final refusal to complete the cycle of departure. The concept is not thematic label but operational rule: the widow’s keeping of one lion suspends the pattern, making absence livable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Hauntingly practical” manifests as cold kettle water re-boiled, coins accepted, and next blank reached for—grief converted to routine. The trait costs her warmth, time, and ultimately the comfort of continuous sales, visible in aching hands and cooling cup.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Contain” is the physical act of carving lions into wood to trap memory, culminating in the final containment on the windowsill where the lion stays instead of leaving. Without this motive, the story’s arc of release collapses.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Crystallized time” is taught early—minutes slowing during carving—and returns in the steam shapes she will “never name,” reweighting the present moment as infinite. The method makes the final stasis feel earned rather than static.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rain-beaded skylight fractures light that determines where the lion is placed; without that specific glow the final image of ember-like grain vanishes. Loft scent and ladder geography pressure her daily ritual—climb, carve, descend—forming the story’s heartbeat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“While the kettle boils” is the clock that brackets each carving session; the whistle’s drop to silence marks session’s end and prompts next ascent. Time is tracked but not tight enough to alter tactical choices—more mood than countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>“Harvest lessons from loss” is dramatized in every sale refused or accepted and finalized when she keeps the last lion—learning that some losses must be inhabited, not marketed. The motive conflicts with financial need, visible in cold coffee and aching hands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Rust-hued peace” arrives in the final paragraph—rain gone, light scattered across floor—delivering the promised tone after tension of sawdust and unpaid bills. Tone modulates from damp musk to warm ember, charging the closure image.</comment>
