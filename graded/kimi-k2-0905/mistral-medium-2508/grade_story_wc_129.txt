<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reed’s interiority is textured through bodily memory of reeds and the visceral act of carving; the contradiction between her outsider status and her hunger to graft onto the village is kept alive in every micro-choice. The final renunciation—she does not chase Syl—pays off prior causality: the same hands that once carved isolation now press palm-to-arbor, accepting the cost of slow-braided kinship. One slip: “her sympathy bold as the arbor’s edges” drifts into label-speak at a peak beat (−0.3). Still, the earned stasis lands with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each tag, handprint, and shard of refracted light thickens the pattern until the final palm-print reconfigures “belonging” from place to current. Orientation anchors by line 3; transitions inside the crater maze are legible.Closure—Charged Poise at dawn arbor—carries undeniable conceptual cost: kinship is no longer found but electrically ongoing. No breaks in causality; persistent constraint (the arbor’s razor edge) shapes who can touch and who hangs back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and violet-spray crater are never backdrop: the orchard’s tuned-fork hum decides when Reed walks at dusk; the arbor’s skin-slicing edge literally limits who adds a hand. The crater’s lost-language murmur supplies the story’s sound-track and forbids easy translation—pressure felt in every tag. Final image recharges the same refracting light, now carrying communal fingerprints. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains the final ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Reed achieve living kinship—tightens when the arbor’s unfinished surface demands a dedication that risks blood (literal cut) and social exposure. One meaningful deepening: the moment she traces still-warm paint and decides to search; options narrow from solitary sculptor to village-wide wager. Cost is legible: her palms could be sliced, her outsider status exposed in front of the very village she wants to graft onto. Escalation is textural (density of tags/handprints) yet each added mark forecloses the possibility of remaining invisible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Kinship as electrical current rather than territory emerges solely through image and action—no thesis statements. The arbor’s glimmer shifts from solitary artwork to collective constellation without abstract sermon. Final line “invitation” reprices earlier lost languages from threat to welcome, reweighting achieved by the dawn hand-print ritual. Subtext in Syl’s parting tag keeps ambiguity alive while still enacting closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Reed; perceptual signature—hollow-stem whisper, razor-sharp obsidian—remains reed-carver specific. Syntax ripples like carved grain: “how they bent but never broke” teaches cadence early and pays off in final palm-press. No dialogue until Syl’s two-line exchange; indirection carries weight. Minor filter verb cluster “she decided then to find Syl” could be tighter (−0.2), but voice holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: long clause for orchard shimmer, staccato for crater descent. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per beat—avoiding density penalty. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Opening and closing lines perform mirror-work with “whisper / invitation,” giving structural echo without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of reed-botany memory with volcanic-glass sculpture feels inevitable and fresh; tag-graffiti as kin-breadcrumb reverses usual outsider-art trope. Conceptual shift from “I was here” to “We are here” is simple yet non-obvious, grown from material specifics. Risk in lyrical accumulation pays off: final constellation of handprints could have slid into sentiment but retains edge through obsidian cut-risk. Could dock for faint echo of “stay, we’ll find you” trope (−0.2), yet local detail transcends familiarity.</comment>
