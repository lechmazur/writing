<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—“calloused fingers twitch not from fatigue but from the weight of the question”—and the micro-choice to carve absence rather than letters crystallizes a credible shift. Yet the father’s spectral instruction arrives as declared wisdom (“Grief isn’t a line…”) without prior dramatized flaw or resistance, softening the cost. Daughter’s trembling uptake is the first visible consequence, so the carver’s change is slightly front-run by exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone becomes vessel, butterfly becomes gift, poem becomes inheritance—each a charged re-pricing of grief. Causality is accumulative/textural: butterfly migration, ribbon roll, and cracked granite pattern toward the final crystallized stance. One shard (greenhouse) + one transition (walk to house) keeps within two-shard allowance; orientation anchored by word 60. Cost is felt in the cracked granite and the daughter’s tremor, though spectral rule-set is told more than tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse glass, wet soil, bruised-violet dusk, and chisel in hand form a micro-setting that constrains every decision. The cracked granite’s physical state directly enables the “hollow” carving tactic and charges the final image. Butterfly projections on glass evolve with scene beats; spatial choreography (kneeling, standing, walking to house) stays clean. Sensory selection—jasmine scent, calloused skin, raindrops as chisel—mirrors interior without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can grief be given shape?—is signaled in the opening paragraph. Pressure tightens when the granite cracks, foreclosing the name-carving path and forcing the hollow-space tactic; this is the single meaningful deepening required at this length. Cost is visible: ruined stone, butterfly relinquished, daughter’s tremor. Agency remains internal/artistic rather than external-oppositional, fitting Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through hollowing vs. marking, absence vs. presence, rather than statement. Final image—“the shape of collective grief didn’t feel like a wound, but a door”—offers resonant conceptual re-pricing without moralizing. Subtext lives in chisel grip, ribbon hand-off, butterfly gift: silence carries lineage. Poems traded at dinner embed theme in ritual; no abstract thesis is asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to the carver’s sensory filter: “his fingers… twitched,” “he retraced… Liora.” Perceptual signature—stone dust as breath, butterflies as stained glass—remains consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, staccato for cracked-granite beat. No dialogue beyond the father’s spectral lines; those lines carry subtext of mentorship rather than exposition. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and imagistic yet propulsive: “Dusk bled through cracked glass… air thick with wet soil and fading jasmine” performs three jobs in twelve words. One mixed metaphor—“thunder arrived… as a vibration in his ribs” beside “echo of a hundred voices”—is a hairline slip but does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; each advances knowledge or emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Butterfly migration as ancestral post, granite carving as negative space, and poem-trading dinner weave a fresh synthesis of familiar grief tropes. Specificity—ribbon roll’s frayed edge, salted plums on table—anchors vision. Risk of spectral mentorship is grounded in tactile workshop detail; no gimmick. Conceptual integrity: the story commits fully to hollowing as craft and metaphor, culminating in the door image.</comment>
