<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The child’s interiority is rendered through sensorial metaphors (taste of silence, lungs shrinking) that stay concrete and character-specific. Motive progression—fear → curiosity → filial betrayal—tracks cleanly; the final door-image is earned because the doll-tasting method was dramatized twice before. Father remains a functional pressure source rather than a full secondary interiority, acceptable for this length. No diagnostic self-talk; every emotional label is translated into bodily perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: the bunker unfolds and the child exits with gilded palm—physical cost (father swallowed) is visible. Accumulative lens holds: each inversion adds a new silence-flavor layer that reweights “safety” until the bunker becomes coffin. Pattern taught by 25% mark (gravity inversion + trellis image) so the later mosaic shards read legible. Orientation anchors (who=child; where=bunker; when=intermittent inversions) land inside 120 words; deliberate disorientation (ceiling as pit) is later paid off when the ceiling literally peels open.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bunker’s rust-exhaling walls, doll’s frost-burn silence, and trellis veins carrying “honey-lightning hush” are selective, pressure-driven details that double as tactical resources. Micro-setting (porcelain doll ≤ thumbnail) constrains every sprout attempt and charges the final palm-brand. Spatial choreography is immaculate: reader can trace child’s cot → grate → trellis knot → bloom → back to cot with hair-vines. No static cataloguing; every sensory hit either foreshadows a rule (taste = key) or marks a cost (gold threads writhing).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the child keep consuming silences or break free?”—tightens through three inversion beats, each forcing a larger taste/theft. Third inversion ups the ante: the bloom offers “mother’s-name silence,” linking filial loss to escape cost. Child’s agency drives every turn; father’s off-stage collapse is consequence, not coincidence. Visible price: father’s scream + bunker implosion satisfies felt-cost requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as an acoustic question—what does safety sound like?—answered by the final image of a mouth tasting “beginning.” Subtext carried in object handling: doll handed over “for the quiet you carry” reframes from gift to ignition key without exposition. No moral pronouncement; the inversion of “lock → door” is performed, not stated. Emotional aftereffect lingers as reader realizes the child sacrificed the only parent for an un-sounded future.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric-compressed diction (“taste of beginning”) stays within a cloistered child’s plausible lexicon while maintaining elevated poetic license. Rhythm clusters tight enjambment during climbs versus caesura-breaths inside bunker, mirroring lung constriction. Perceptual signature isolates sound-as-taste, a memorable filter not borrowed from stock lyric SF. No dialogue to contaminate voice; narration never leaks adult omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often performs world-rule, sensory hit, and emotional tilt (“The silence inside the bloom was the flavor of a held note…”). Figurative layering is purposeful—each metaphor extends the acoustic taste motif—so density cap waived. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “they returned” used twice in adjacent lines could compress, but artifact does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of silence-as-substance + inverse-gravity + bone-trellis feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight due to acoustic-taste rule seeded early. Risk taken with lyric mosaic pays off: child’s betrayal lands harder because reader has tasted each silence alongside them. Conceptual integrity never retreats to metaphor; every image is tactile (gold threads writhing). Not a derivative template; inversion of lock/door trope is re-earned through sensory mechanics.</comment>
