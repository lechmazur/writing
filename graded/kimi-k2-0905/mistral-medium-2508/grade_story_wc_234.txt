<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“his palm against the warm railing… the pulse… beneath”), and the shell’s revaluation from souvenir to key lands as a micro-choice that costs him his previous identity. The mentor-memory and cliff-memory are cleanly anchored to present tactile cues, so the 30 %-plus reflection stays within the allowed ceiling. What keeps the score sub-8 is that the final renunciation (“giving back—differently”) is stated more than dramatized; we see the laugh and the drop, but not the moment he pays the concrete price of letting the bottled suns go. Liora’s status shift from shadow-watcher to hand-clasp partner is legible, yet her interior remains opaque, muting the relationship-as-crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece teaches its lyrical pattern early (“suspended bridges glowing like veins”) and deepens by accretion until the shell’s glow is woven into clothes and ribs, reweighting the stake. Orientation is clean—who/where/when locked inside 50 words—so no penalty applies. Closure is a Charged Poise: the jump-through-the-moment is a crystallized image whose cost is the forfeiture of the extraction paradigm; the conceptual price is legible in the city’s recognition-exhale. One causality wobble: the furnace-roar that roars “somewhere below” right after they jump feels like coincidence rather than consequence, blunting the tightening that would lift this to 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Ember nexus at twilight” is never wallpaper; the copper-veined bridges, steam-ghost vents, and cooling amber after-glow continuously constrain movement and supply the final color palette. The shell functions as micro-setting—its spiral whorls are tactile territory where the climax is negotiated. Spatial choreography is flawless: hand-over-hand moves track without drift. For 9+, the city would need to push back harder—e.g., a gear that actually blocks or burns them—but here it mostly observes, so the gate holds at 8.1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture presence” vs “become presence”—is signaled in the third paragraph and sharpened by Liora’s line “you’ve been measuring the wrong thing.” The meaningful tightening is the revaluation beat: Elias trades extraction for offering, narrowing his options from alchemist to anchor. The price is conceptual (he abandons the vial-craft that defined him), but because the story never stages an external obstacle that physically threatens the couple or the shell, the cost, while felt, is not viscerally paid on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the density of imagery substitutes for rising external pressure, satisfying the single-deepening rule, but the absence of a tangible loss keeps the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “presence is weight you volunteer to carry, not mass you hoard.” The motif set—light-bottles, furnace breath, shell glow—returns reweighted without overt statement; the final image of glow in the rib-space is the non-literal answer. No moralizing paragraph intrudes. A hairline slip: the phrase “palette of resolve” is used twice in identical phrasing, nudging toward echo rather than resonance; still, the reconfiguration charges the prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is dense, heated, and alchemical—verbs like “hummed,” “thickened,” “rooted” keep the syntax sinuous. Compression is purposeful: elided articles (“the breath curling into the chill like a question”) are taught early and hold to the end. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays locked to Elias’s tactile synesthesia. Only a few template cadences (“It wasn’t… It was…”) prevent the final 0.2 lift to 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is strong; sentence lengths wax and wane with the ember pulse. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed-metaphor risk is flirted but controlled (“moment splitting open like a fruit, its juice the density…”) because “juice=density” is conceptually deliberate. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is an academic phrase leaking into an otherwise sensory lexicon, minor but noticeable. Closure image remains crystal, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap stops at −0.2, yielding 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist who quits bottling light to become ballast is a fresh synthesis of steampunk mystic and introspective lyric. The shell-as-key twist feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious on first read. Risk is taken—lyric accretion instead of plot reversals—and coherence holds. Minor proximity echo: “city’s hidden furnaces” recalls Tolkien’s “secret fire,” but the image is immediately re-personalized, so transformation is sufficient.</comment>
