<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The saxophonist’s motivation—silencing a prophecy by playing silence itself—remains lucid and intensifies: each note is a deliberate erasure that costs him breath, time, and finally self-knowledge. Interiority stays concrete (“he feared the day he’d stop hearing its call”) and drives the return trip, a credible renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final phrase “the prophecy hummed… waiting” reweights silence from victory to suspended threat, undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each played silence thickens the mist density—without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism atrium, saxophone, and dewdrops are handled each beat—light refracts, keys unmake sound, drops burst—constraining tactics and charging the final image of a held breath about to break. Spatial choreography stays exact; sensory economy favors damp stone, crushed mint, negative sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—keep prophecy unsung—tightens via each quieter note; the “vested hush” accumulates until the only option is perpetual return. Cost is visible: train ticket bought, audience silenced, self-volunteered exile into mist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme emerges unstated: art as compulsive exorcism that can’t exorcise itself. The final image of mist listening reframes earlier silences as temporary paroles, not absolution—resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Voice is a smoky, nocturnal saxophone of syntax: long breathy clauses that taper into ellipses, mirroring held notes. Perceptual signature is consistent—sound as negative space, light as syllable—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control mirrors musical phrasing; sentences shorten as “hush” tightens. Only minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed, appeared”) in mid-section; no loops or mixed metaphors, imagery stays coherent under closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing saxophone silence with prophecy-erasure offers a fresh angle on artist-as-Sisyphus; the prism-mist setting is particular, not decorative. Risk—entire plot is anti-sound—heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
