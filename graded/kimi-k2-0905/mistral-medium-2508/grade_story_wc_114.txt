<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—professional duty to warn vs. private need to vanish—are alive in every beat; the trembling hand on the barometer, the deliberate silence into the radio, the final step into the storm all embody the fault-tolerant mask cracking. Her interiority is sensorily anchored (“taste of copper,” “paper soft as a pulse”) and avoids label-speak. The earned renunciation costs her life and reputation, foreclosed on-page. Minor slip: the phrase “oracle could be wrong” is slightly external-diagnostic; still, the embodied cost dominates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the instant Liora opens the door the station’s survival is forfeited and her myth of invulnerability is repriced under the aurora. The causal chain—fever → blurred illustration → recognition that truth must be swallowed → silent exit—tightens once and is irreversible. Cost is legible in the vanishing footprints and the radio still humming with unanswered static. Lens (Situational) holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><comment>The station itself acts as micro-setting: the groaning iron ribs, the stuttering hygrometer, the lantern-lit table all constrain her choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is tight—cot → table → door → ridge—no floating anchors. Weather is not backdrop but the arriving antagonist that will tear the roof. Sensory hierarchy matches meteorologist POV (barometer, ozone, wet stone).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to speak the storm’s true timing or let it erase the lie—tightens once when the barometer dips “decisively” and she chooses silence. The price is planetary: the station and her own life. No coincidence; the storm is natural law she refuses to warn against. Agency is renunciation, not combat, yet it forecloses every live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the blurred illustration: margins are where certainties breathe, and swallowing truth is a form of poisoned flight. Final aurora over black wings reweights earlier image without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide if her silence is cowardice or fatal integrity. No thematic echo sentences; meaning arises from the choice to step outside.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“iron ribs groaning”) and paid off in the final wind-filled lungs. Syntax mirrors fever-clear exhaustion: clauses stack like pressure fronts, then fracture into single-line breaths at the exit. Perceptual signature is meteorologist-poetic: ravens, barometer, ozone read as omens. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside Liora’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm accelerates from languid reflection to staccato exit; sentence variety supports breath vs. gale. Figurative language is selective—“storm unspool itself,” “paper soft as a pulse”—and never muddies causality. No scaffold loops; each image advances state or stakes. Minor overgrowth: “weight of what she didn’t say could never capsize the world” is slightly abstract; still, the line is isolated and quickly grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing fault-tolerant systems lore with mountain-gothic meteorologist myth feels fresh; the oracle as margin-dweller rather than prophet is non-obvious. Blurred *Aconitum* sketch becomes wing-image at exit—an organic metaphoric turn not harvested for checklist points. Risk-taking (silent protagonist, no rescue) heightens coherence. Derivative traces of gothic station tropes are subverted by her refusal to play savior.</comment>
