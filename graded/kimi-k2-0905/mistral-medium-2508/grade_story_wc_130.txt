<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conjurer’s contradictory drives—inventive problem-solver vs. grief-stricken husband—bleed through every micro-choice (pressing palm to withered earth, fitting the eyes into fractures). Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak; his refusal to resurrect but only “ask” crystallizes an Earned Stasis whose cost is the mist dissolving when he reaches for her face. The glass-eye weight in his pocket and the hollow in his chest form a tactile, embodied tension that scales to the length. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible exempt; single-POV voice remains idiosyncratic and internally conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of ink bleeding while he lets it reweights the entire premise—equations don’t balance, loss can’t be preserved, only remembered “as they might have been.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each droplet, prism, and eye-refracted light incrementally reconfigures meaning until the mosaic glows an unsolved proof. Cost is legible in the moment he pockets the now-clouded eyes and steps out “lighter,” having relinquished the need to solve. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“cavern orchard”) and never wavers; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Cavern orchard, stalactite drips, and mosaic stepping stone are not backdrop but interactive instruments: the droplets spell Morse, the fractures accept the glass eyes, the lichen dissolves under a tear. Micro-setting (eyes as twin moons) constrains the final gesture—when he reaches, the mist dissolves, proving the environment cannot be held. Sensory hierarchy skews to tactile and visual filtered through grief-biased perception—silver pulses, phosphorescent mist, damp earth under palm. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ambiguous loss—tightens through pattern break: orchard silence → prism of almost-green → mist that almost forms her face, each iteration raising the cost of unattainability. Agency remains internal (renunciation of resurrection, acceptance of unbalanced equations) yet forecloses the path; the harmonic fruit-split sound is the audible price. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the mist-crystallization moment delivers visible price on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: ambiguity as the only solvable equation. Subtext lives in gesture—fitting the clouded/clear eyes into fractures enacts his need to slot irreconcilable grief into pattern. Final image of ink bleeding while he lets it offers non-literal answer: preservation is surrender, not solution. No moralizing, no echoic thesis line; resonance arises from the orchard’s remembered green that never truly returns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet pattern-taught early (“slow, silver pulse”) and paid off at closure (“quiet mathematics of the possible”). Perceptual signature is conjurer-mathematician: variables, coefficients, prisms, Morse code—grief filtered through equation-vision. Syntax modulates from long liquid cadences to fragmentary beats (“He listened until the note dissolved”). No dialogue to contaminate voice; unreliability is absent, so distance control is tight. Elision (“some things can’t be preserved”) is purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. Figurative language is selective, never dense in peak beats—only two metaphors in the mist-reach moment, both physically coherent. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (“The glass eyes dovetailed… locking like puzzle pieces”). Zero paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, no scaffold. Minor simultaneity in “pressing his forehead… the glass eyes digging” is physically plausible. Opening and final lines serve as anchor and resonant cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-as-algebra via orchard-cavern bioluminescence is not a trope catalog but a singular stance. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—only this mosaic-fracture variable set yields the unsolved proof. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is high yet coherence maintained. No close echoes of famous scenes; “algebra of almost” is coinage that feels inevitable. Conceptual integrity commits fully to ambiguity without safety net.</comment>
