<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s guilt-driven interiority stays concrete—“her name scrawled in the margin of a treaty she’d never seen” fuses biographical and ethical pressure. The “carefully reckless” trait is dramatized twice (ink dip, palm-to-paper-sing) and is not label-only. There is no second character, so relationship bullets are waived. Cost is felt (shattering glass, bleeding palm implied) but the final stance crystallizes rather than changes—powerful yet technically Earned Stasis; the lack of a live contradiction in-scene keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: the restored Chorus reweights every promise and the shard warming in her coat supplies Conceptual Repricing with lasting cost. Causality is intact—“indigo mist…sealing cracks” follows logically from inkwell shatter. Orientation is anchored by word 30 and the mosaic of flashbacks is taught early, so no orientation debt. Minor momentum dip during the lyric roll-call of city/lover/king; still the final cadence rescues it, satisfying the 9+ quick test except for one hairline scaffold echo (“the point was…”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The archive body-and-tool micro-setting constrains every beat—shelves dictate reachable scrolls, inkwell glass physically shatters to enable restoration. Sensory hierarchy (violet scent, silver stopper, iron-taste breath) filters through Elara’s linguist priorities. Spatial choreography is flawless across “pressed her palm / parchment / mist coiling through shelves.” The shard-as-final-talisman charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate, just held back by one purple phrase (“sky split like a promise finally kept”) that momentarily over-leans into overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing arson of truth—fires on page 1 and tightens when torches literally appear. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elara realizes the archive is a loom she can re-knot, shifting goal from rescue to re-weave. Cost is visible (inkwell destroyed, her voice absorbed) and forever limits future translations. Agency drives every phase; no convenient luck, but escalation is single-arc rather than multi-turn, keeping it below 9-band ceiling for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges—promises as living music—without any thesis statement; final image of “chorus of the newly unbroken” reweights earlier silence trope. Subtext lives in gesture (shard pocketed, not explained). There is no moralizing; instead the shard’s warmth offers conceptual repricing. The ambiguity—will the world keep listening?—lingers legitimately. Only lack of a prior counter-theme in-scene prevents full 9+; complexity is present but slightly mono-directional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person folds perceptual signature into syntax—long vowel-rich sentences mirror song, then fracture into shard-short clauses at climax. No dialogue, so voice must carry all; it does. Diction (“sylph-touched indigo”, “harmonic gaps”) remains within Elara’s scholar lexicon. Pattern of elided connectives (“She dipped… the nib trembling—”) is taught early and sustains. Filter verbs kept for rhythm not slack; rhythm control under pressure is exemplary, missing only the final squeak of a 9+ is the slight repetition of “promise” as noun/verb five times.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear registers purposeful cadence—three-stress anaphora (“Here is what was lost… Here is what we reclaim”) without monotony because of interleaved sentence length. Information density high: “the archive wasn’t a tomb—it was a loom” performs three jobs (metaphor, stake-shift, world-rule). No mixed metaphors; violet scent recurs but never clots. One near-loop: “The point was…” refrain appears three times; it pays off thematically so allowed, but keeps score sub-9. Line clarity remains intact at closure; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of extinct language, magical ink, and promissory music is conceptually fresh yet executed through tangible props and body-risk. Transformation test fails if relocated—indigo only answers to Veythari grammar. Risk in lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple but stays tethered to glass cut and torchlight. No close echoes of familiar fantasy set-pieces. Bold structural choice—accumulative lyric rather than duel—heightens rather than sugar-coats stakes. Feels inevitable in hindsight; earns the +0.3 risk bonus within band.</comment>
