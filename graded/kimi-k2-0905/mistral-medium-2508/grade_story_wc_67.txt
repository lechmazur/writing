<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her fingers stained black, the mask biting her temples—and her refusal to preserve the portrait is a credible renunciation that costs her the comfort of certainty. Yet the micro-choice chain is thin: we see her scatter ashes and dust powder, but the interior contradiction between “understanding” and “mirage” is asserted more than dramatized in a single beat. The mask’s origin (mother’s teacup) is vivid, but its emotional payoff is compressed into one retrospective line, so the porcelain shard motif feels ornamental rather than compounding pressure. Still, the final stance—endurance of perpetual itinerant dissolution—earns its stasis with visible cost: she will keep breaking/revealing, and the mask will keep fitting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece teaches its pattern of repeated dissolution early (“ashes swirled…each fleck settling”) and deepens through density shifts until the final powder lift/resettle reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last image of Liora walking away while the mirage “holds for now” crystallizes options—she chooses endless unraveling over possession. The cost is legible in the mask’s cutting edges and the foreclosed option of ever finishing a portrait. One minor drag: the “vanishing point gallery” orientation is atmospheric but could anchor spatially 30 words sooner; waived because the withheld depth serves the closure illusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gallery-as-setting is evoked through selective sensory detail—damp plaster, creaking rocker, draft scattering ashes—rather than tourist catalog. The vanishing-point conceit is taught early and constrains choice: Liora kneels “in the center” because perspective never resolves, so her art must dissolve rather than arrive. Micro-setting objects (mask, powder, rocker) evolve: shards bite deeper, powder re-settles in new patterns, rocker ceases—each state-change alters her next move. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and dust motes track across the single room without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the cost of sustaining the “mirage of safety” through deliberate incompleteness. Escalation is textural: each scattering tightens the paradox—understanding is the enemy, so she must destroy what she nearly understood. The powder resettle is the decisive intensifier that narrows her path to perpetual itinerancy. Price is visible—blood at temples, sleepless draft, ashes lost by morning—but the tightening could be sharper if one patron almost recognized the face before it dissolved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterated image of dissolving portraits: truth is not possessed but circled. Subtext lives in gesture—the ash pattern “not quite random” implies authorship without ownership. The final reconfiguration reweights “mirage” from deceit to survival technique, yet avoids moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she liberated or trapped? The refusal to declare is the earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, rhythmically controlled—“You keep breaking things / No, I reveal what they already were.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices light catches, draft timing, shard refractions—artist’s eye filtered through fatalism. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Elision (“the chair stopped”) is taught early and paid off at closure; non-standard fragmentation (“thread by thread, through what you left unsaid”) is legible and motive-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for scattering, clipped fragments for mask clicks. Metaphors are spare and coherent—ashes as snow, mask as clock—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “the trick” and “that was the trick” within 40 words; minor, does not touch closure. High density: ashes/powder/mask each carry plot, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Risk choice: conceptual frame that art must dissolve to survive is non-obvious and sustained without retreat. Specific detail—lapis dust from an unsent letter—freshly conflates pigment with regret. Transformation test fails: rename city/gallery and the arc still functions, but the vanishing-point conceit is inseparable from execution. Inflection: final “for now” converts perpetual travel from pathology to method, recharging prior repetitions.</comment>
