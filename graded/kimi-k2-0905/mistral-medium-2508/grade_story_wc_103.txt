<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulse—destroying the maze to escape its temporal snare—drives every beat; the embodied ache in her palm as she clenches the halo fragment makes the cost visceral. The final laugh while feeling the “grain of time” crystallizes her earned shift from solver to edge-designer, foreclosing the old path with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: hurling the halo reweaves air and photographs, reweighting the rule-set so the past re-sharpens and the future path becomes lateral design. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the texture itself becomes the surviving stake—with the garden’s groan and the bridge’s tremor paying the felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The living bridge’s vine-pulse and ozone-lavender scent are filtered through Liora’s designer eye, constraining her choice to climb the spiral that wasn’t there a breath before. The final palm-to-wood grain anchors the closing image, charging the reconfigured future with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens when photographs scream and the maze stitches her into an inherited pattern; the decisive sideways run along the hyperbolic curve physically narrows options and forces the renunciation of the halo. Cost is legible in the garden’s groan and the collapse onto the bridge, but the escalation is single-curve rather than compounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular: the texture of time is not a puzzle to solve but a fabric one must endure and later re-weave. The final lateral step beside the maze reconfigures the central question without moralizing, leaving the reader with the charged afterimage of “grain” under skin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lyric-compressed diction—“sky the color of old silver,” “time wasn’t a line but a texture”—remains stable under third-person intimate, never drifting into explanatory prose. Rhythmic control heightens at pressure peaks (three-sentence run of “She…”) without breaking the taught pattern, paying off in the final breathy laugh.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances causality (“vines…surged forward, weaving themselves into a spiral staircase”)—with zero paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“hyperbolic geometry”) is justified by the POV’s professional lexicon and never muddies the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of botanical architecture, retrocognitive entrapment, and tactile time-texture feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist is visible. Risky lyric compression and sideways escape rather than conquest enlarge stakes without obscuring clarity, rewarded under the within-band bonus.</comment>
