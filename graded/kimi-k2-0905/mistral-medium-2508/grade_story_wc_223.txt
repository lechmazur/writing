<comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—“pain was the only thing the penumbra couldn’t digest” bodies her motive; her steps-as-letters micro-choices under rising dark visibly escalate stakes. The shift from grief-performer to silence-archivist is dramatized, not declared, and the final refusal to narrate costs her the shelter of story itself—felt cost on the page. Contradictory impulse—clutching bishop vs. releasing wings—peaks in one compressed beat, satisfying the 9+ test. Missing 0.3 to reach 9.0 because no secondary character pressure tests her; all status forces are abstract.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dust-steps, object re-weights, whisper cadence tightens until “silence” becomes the decisive anti-story that reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the dark could never digest silence”—conceptual cost legible, no causal cheating. Orientation taught immediately—“whispering gallery…hollowed-out cathedral”—anchors hold. Persistent constraint (penumbra hunger) shapes every tactic; final image of static board crystallizes new rules without verbal exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Gallery, chessboard, and bishop function as micro-setting that constrains choice: bishop carved into palm, board warped into wings—physical state changes tactical options. Whisper acoustics and dust patterns are not backdrop but tools Liora weaponizes. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, grit, and after-echo, staying inside her historian bias. 0.1 off because spatial distance to penumbra edge is only implied, not pinpointed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep witness vs. be devoured—signaled in first paragraph; tightens when she chooses “release” over preservation, trading narrative for silence. Agency visible: each word-step is an on-page tactic that forecloses prior goal (telling stories). Cost scales: final absence of wings/board stasis shows path foreclosed. One micro-turn—pawns ascended, not taken—sufficient for this length; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image cluster—chess, echo, dust, wing—rather than thesis lines; final silence re-prices value of untold gestures. Subtext in pauses: “luminous absence” reweights earlier “whispering gallery” as archive of gaps. No moral statement closes; resonance lingers in unmoved pieces. Complexity preserved: penumbra both preserves longing and devours—no forced symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature—architectural acoustics filtered through grief-archivist senses—remains distinct; diction (“drifting shadow that swallowed cities whole”) shows rhythmic control without register drift. Compression taught early (“remember, unbind, tell”) and paid off in final “home”. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Ellipsis and fragment use (“They *ascended*.”) voice-motivated, taught by cadence of whispers. Under peak stress syntax shortens, mirroring breath—no mechanical template detected.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often conflates world-rule, emotion, motion—“She pressed the bishop into her palm until it bit.” Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths pulse with tension. Figurative layer sustained but never muddled; metaphor vehicles (penumbra as silk/teeth) stay within physics of swallowing light. Only minor scaffold: whisper list “child’s laugh, door slam, click” borders on sensory checklist but serves pattern. No artifacts in closure beat—final line clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: crisis-actor-turned-historian vs. memory-eating shadow via typographic walking is non-obvious. Chess iconography flipped—pawns escape by self-erasure, not promotion—grows from premise rather than gimmick. Silence-as-weapon reconfigures standard “story defeats dark” trope. Specificity anchors risk: dust alphabet, splinter-wings smelled of rain. Transformation test fails if generic survivor substituted—details are inseparable. Slight 0.1 reserve because penumbra concept nods to Borges/Lightman; still, execution here is singular.</comment>
