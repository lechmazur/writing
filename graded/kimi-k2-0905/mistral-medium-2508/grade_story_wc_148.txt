<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger to “change the beginning” is vivid, but his interiority leans on abstract labels—“hush,” “echoes,” “story”—rather than concrete contradictory impulse. The lattice burn in his sleeve embodies cost, yet the decision to pluck his father’s name feels slightly convenient; no prior beat shows him doubting the act. Still, the final smile and walk back to the reef show a credible endurance that forecloses innocence. The father-son tension is implied, not staged, so relationship-as-crucible is absent, acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blue flicker reweights the lighthouse’s rule-set and Elias’s claim “Just the light” carries undeniable social cost—no one will believe him. The lattice’s unfolding is the Decisive Change beat, visible and felt. Causal chain holds: lattice stick → name theft → blue beam → exile from truth. Orientation is taught by sentence one—“the lighthouse stood like a rusted needle”—so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison and reef act as a single micro-setting that dictates every move: bars dictate whisper acoustics, spiral glass frames the final choice, reef teeth literalize consequence. Copperlight vs. blue beam is a recharging image that constrains Elias’s tactics—he can only exit once the beam shifts hue. Sensory hierarchy is POV-slanted: salt-thick voices, mortar that smokes, tide that hisses through iron. Spatial choreography is clean—door scuffs, gearworks, cracked spiral—no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“change the beginning” via stolen names—signals early and tightens when the lattice unfolds: one sheet = one life, father’s name = key. The narrowing is singular but sufficient: once Elias takes the name, he cannot unread the lighthouse’s ledger. Cost is visible—the lattice re-knits brown, the beam flickers blue, villagers will never believe him—meeting 8-band guardrail. Agency is pure: every escalation stems from his climb and choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: lies as inherited architecture, stories as prison-blueprints. No thesis states “truth is subjective”; instead, the final image—Elias telling the literal truth for the first time and being disbelieved—reweights the entire fable. Subtext hums in the warden’s “madness” accusation and the villagers’ “curse,” exposing communal investment in false narrative. The copper→blue light motif reprises without overt symbolic caption, letting resonance feel discovered, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic-gothic: rusted needle, throat of the sea, copperlight repose—yet every metaphor is filtered through Elias’s sensory hunger. Rhythm accelerates up the stairs, then breathes at the cracked glass, mirroring physical ascent and moral precipice. Compression like “chasing hush” teaches the pattern early and is paid off when hush arrives “real and absolute.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays salted, metallic, confessional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “the lattice stuck—not by nail or glue, but by some hungrier affinity” simultaneously advances plot, deepens setting, and characterizes Elias’s fatalism. No loops or synonym churn; “scuffs worn smooth by decades of hesitant fingers” is specific, irreplaceable. One mixed-metaphor risk—“lighthouse stood like a rusted needle in the throat of the sea”—but the image is taught early, repeated in reef-teeth, so coherence survives. Closure line “Just the light” is taut, propulsive, ear-perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Folklore inversion—boy who cried wolf’s son steals lies back from authority—feels inevitable yet unwritten. Lighthouse-as-prison that inscribes names into its very stone literalizes communal memory as architecture. Copper-to-blue beam shift is a fresh inflection on the “final reveal” trope, tying color to credibility. Risk is high—lyric escalation, abstract stakes—but coherence under the Accumulative/Textural lens keeps the gamble from tipping into gimmick.</comment>
