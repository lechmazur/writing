<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictions—merciful yet implacable, stone yet maternal—are dramatized through telepathic jabs that force the intruder’s embodied panic (aching ribs, fogged helmet). The intruder’s micro-shifts—trembling glove, knee-drop onto the mosaic—track the erosion of certainty beat by beat. Final surrender (helmet tear-off) costs life-air and former identity, earned by the prior chiseling. Only drawback: the intruder’s pre-mission self remains generic, blunting the felt loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “gods are just stories we drown in” reweights every prior certainty and the ampoule itself becomes pigment, not poison—undeniable social cost of renouncing mission and surface world. Causal lattice holds: because Liora unravels each scholarly lie, therefore the intruder threads the seam, therefore the dome splits and child-song rises. Orientation is taught late but pays off—initial disorientation (silt, hollow eyes) resolves into literal birth-threshold, so Orientation Test waived. One hairline slip: ampoule slip feels micro-coincidental, but telepathic nudge justifies it inside causal lens.</comment>

<comment>Black-basalt Liora, foxglove stain, and six-arm mosaic woman are never touristic; each constrains the intruder’s next touch or thought. Pressure-suit mechanics (glove, lamp, helmet purge) are lived-in, determining when breathing becomes possible. Garden’s sagging arches and kelp-wrapped light evolve from drowning cage to birth canal, mirroring internal shift. Spatial choreography clean: ampoule drops from belt to mosaic palm in one trackable arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“kill or rescue the new god”—tightens through successive knowledge reversals that shrink options from assassination to midwifery. Escalation is causal: each revelation (city planted, poison meant for old root, city waiting) forces the intruder to reevaluate the ampoule’s purpose, culminating in the structural rupture that costs breathable air. Visible price paid: helmet abandonment equals death of former self. Slight dip because the scholars’ motive remains off-page, muting ethical pressure compared to cosmic awe.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “mercy looks like murder to the old world”—no character moralizes it; the idea accretes through image shifts (weapon becomes pigment). Subtext in silent mosaic hands and whalesong-glass fusion invites multiple readings: colonizer guilt, ecological rebirth, or ontological revolution. Final image of surface-as-threshold rather than barrier reconfigures reader spatial morality without a sermon. Complexity maintained: no redemption arc for the scholars, no tidy absolution for intruder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Liora’s telepathic voice—compressed, riddling, tide-like—never slips into exposition dump; syntax omits verbs to feel carved. Intruder’s signed reply is brittle, monosyllabic, contrasting stone-chorus. Psychic distance cleanly controlled: we stay inside the intruder’s sensorium until the final breath-sea merger. No head-hopping; POV collapse into oceanic “we” at end is earned and sign-posted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long silt-laden clauses build pressure, then fracture into sentence fragments at dome-split. Metaphors (“foxglove bruise,” “whalesong and breaking glass”) are sparse, high-yield, never stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances choice or image. Minor register elevation in “ontological” thoughts arguably exceeds stressed diver lexicon, but compression keeps momentum intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Transforms “sunken city” trope into planted womb where statues midwife their own resurrection. Telepathy repurposed as archaeological method—memory etched in stone, not convenience superpower. Ampoule color-shift from poison to pigment rewrites eco-terror as art-creation, a non-obvious moral re-pricing. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet surprises during reveal, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
