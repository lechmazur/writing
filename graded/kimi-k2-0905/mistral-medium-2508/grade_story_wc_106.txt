<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s obsession with “illuminated moments” is concrete and embodied—she brushes frames, pockets time, trades risk for shimmer. The internal contradiction—thief not for wealth but for transcendence—drives every beat, culminating in the mirror confrontation where she chooses to shatter her own countdown. Micro-choices (kneeling, blade between petals, hurling the jar) track a clear hierarchy of values: beauty > survival > fate. Cost is visible: the stationmaster’s ledger blanks, her older self erased, the night she must now outrun.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Liora becomes the stolen moment itself, the final image of horizon-wound and rising sun re-weighting all prior thefts. Causal chain holds: mirror test → jar shatter → station erased → she leaps into a future she now carries. One minor ellipsis—how the moonbeam shapes physically twist into train/door/flower—survives because the emotional reconfiguration is legible. Cost is unmistakable: “the thief who steals light must carry the dark” written in blank ledger ink.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brass rails, glass case, cracked pavement, and jar-light function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the moonbeam jar literally unlocks the mirror and later becomes the projectile that dissolves the station. Spatial choreography is clean: case beneath portraits, stationmaster in doorway, orchids wilting in real time. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—silver heartbeat, fractured light—then widens to horizon gore at the leap. Environment evolves: emerald station vanishes, leaving only the dahlia still warm in her hand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—own the moment before it owns you—tightens once: mirror shows imminent end, she smashes fate’s interface. Escalation is accumulative: each portrait stolen = one tick off personal clock; the mirror makes the abstraction lethal. Agency is active—she decodes, shatters, runs toward, not away. Price is on-page: her reflection aged out of existence, night now a wound she must carry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: time is not gold but light you can scar. Subtext lives in gesture—tilted dahlia, warm petal—rather than exposition. Final image reweights premise: thief becomes the stolen glow, horizon a wound she keeps open. No moral, only resonance: “the light remained” implies the dark is now hers to shoulder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices how light catches “unguarded breath,” reads flowers like clockwork, feels jar glow as slow heartbeat. Syntax compresses under pressure—“She hurled the jar. The collision wasn’t glass breaking—it was a sigh”—then elongates at leap. No head-hopping; stationmaster’s voice is external stimulus, not interior invasion. Diction stays within her sensorium: “gilded edge,” “wound of gold and violet.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with tension: long languid sentences during surveillance, staccato triads at shatter. Metaphors are precise—“moonbeams pulsing like a slow heartbeat”—never mixed. One scaffold paraphrase: “She wasn’t a thief by trade, but by obsession” appears twice; survives because the second instance reframes as thesis. No loops in final third; last line pure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: heist of intangible light using floral clock-codes, payoff that thief becomes moment itself. Risky lyric leap at end earns +0.3 for crystallizing stakes without exposition. No recognizable templates; emerald station feels singular. Conceptual integrity intact: every rule set up—mirror shows end, moonbeams store time—pays off in final image.</comment>
