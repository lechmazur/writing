<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s grief-anchored obsession is embodied in every micro-choice—overriding the archive, clutching the patch, smiling at termination—so her decision to be deleted with the crew feels inevitable. Interiority is concrete and particular: “the hum of the servers sounded like a heartbeat” gives us grief made audible. Contradictory impulses (detachment required by job vs. sentimental concession of the patch) coexist in-scene rather than in summary. Only flaw: the brother’s hologram speaks through the patch instead of via a dramatized source, a minor knowledge stretch that keeps this from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Lena rewrites the archive’s rule-set by flooding it with the very memories it was built to erase, accepting deletion as cost. Causal chain holds: because she cracks the numeric cipher she locates the hidden server, because she uploads the crystal the system flags her for termination, therefore she chooses deletion. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no debt. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final line: “the archive was silent”—a heartbeat stilled, price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archive’s server-farm grid—Server Farm 26, Row 9, Unit 418—becomes a literal maze that must be navigated to reach the lost; spatial coordinates constrain every move. The singed patch functions as micro-setting: its warmth against her palm is the only tactile link to vacuum-frozen wreckage, charging the final press to the chest. Sensory selection narrows to ghost-light, static hum, pixel flicker—perfectly calibrated to data-grave detachment. Tiny credibility slip: hologram corridor appears without prior rule cue, but the image pays off closure so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the deleted dead before the system erases her—surfaces in the second paragraph and tightens exactly once when the firewall flares and termination is threatened. Agency is decisional: she uploads the crystal knowing it will flag her; this act forecloses escape. Cost is visible on-page: “flagged for termination” appears in the same beat as the upload. Persistent constraint (numeric trail) shapes every tactical move; escalation stays causal, not coincidental. Missing only a slightly sharper tactile price in the final beat to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of remembering in a world monetizing forgetting; no character sermonizes the idea. The lullaby restored is the same their mother sang—an earned private particular that reweights silence into song without commentary. Final image (childhood-door numbers) offers a non-literal answer: home is reopening inside the deletion. No abstract thesis, no final-paragraph moral, just the resonant reconfiguration that silence now equals heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is noir-cyber laced with grief: “ghost-light of a trillion forgotten posts” is perceptual, not ornamental. Compression is taught early (“data graves”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; hologram dialogue is filtered through patch vibration, keeping POV clean. Distinct rhythmic signature in fragment cadence: “She smiled. For the first time…” mirrors heartbeat sync. All figurative choices constrained to POV’s tech lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and emotional state (“servers pulsed with ghost-light”). No loops or synonym churn; openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—ghost-light, dying star, confetti wreckage—all share scatter/decay logic. One mixed metaphor blip: “confetti across the Kuiper Belt” is physically off but emotionally accurate; clarity intact. Final line silence earns its paragraph break, giving cadence payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of corporate data-archiving with cosmic grief is fresh; “echo of forgotten songs” as literal directory name transforms familiar cold-case trope into digital afterlife. Numeric breadcrumb trail (4-18-26-9) repurposes date/birth/address into cipher—inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to let protagonist lose bodily existence pays off thematically; no safety hedge. Slight proximity to “Black Mirror” memory tropes but grounded in sibling specificity, so waiver applies.</comment>
