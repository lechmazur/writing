<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dye master’s interior contradiction—yearning to understand the storyteller-heart’s pull while fearing its foreign rhythm—drives every beat; his embodied tremor at the wing and the ache in his chest are never abstract. Micro-choices (pinning the wing, stirring indigo, unfolding it in the square) all trace to this need, culminating in the earned renunciation of telling his own tales. The only minor slack: the “watchful” trait is declared rather than dramatized before the traveler speaks it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the tea-house silence becomes invitation, the heart’s rhythm is finally his own, and the cost is the dissolved wing—irreversible, felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each dyed image adds density until the final moment reweights silence as freedom. Causality is intact: because he gives the stories away, he loses the wing and inherits the beat. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house, mist, and colored-glass lanterns are not backdrop but tools: the groaning beams echo the ribcage, the lanterns fracture light like the wing’s veins. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting, constraining every染色 choice and dissolving at the end. Sensory selection skews visual, but the single auditory cue—“groaning softly”—is perfectly POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is flawless across the suspension-bridge exit.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—“learn why stories magnetize people”—is signaled early and tightens when the dye master realizes the heart aches at the blind poet. One meaningful deepening: the cobblestone illumination turns spectators toward each other, foreclosing his option to keep the power. Agency remains his; coincidence never rescues. Cost is visible: the wing dissolves, arms burn, silence now carries weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges iridescently: stories are not owned but released, filling communal cracks. The wing’s color-shift and the dyed river-to-hand images reprice “illumination” without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—villagers touching pulses after images fade. Final image (steam question-mark) offers resonant non-literal answer: inquiry survives artifact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to dye master; perceptual signature is dye-metaphoric (“color deepening toward black”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under burn: “The ink moved.” No head-hopping; diction stays within artisan lexicon. The single spoken line (“You’re looking for the why”) carries crushed-petal texture, distinct from narrative register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long breath-like sentences for dawn, staccato for midnight arrival. High density—“tea house clung to a floating rock” does three jobs. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid density penalty. Only hairline slip: “quiet explosion of being seen” borders oxymoron cliché, but saved by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: donor heart as story-magnet, dye as communal confession, wing as consumable medium. Risk of lyrical diffusion is disciplined by concrete trades (wing for silence). Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—wing color physics and dye craft are inseparable. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
