<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is embodied and atmospheric—grief is “thick as kelp,” rage “sharp as a misplaced chisel”—but her contradictory impulses are stated more than dramatized during the crucial calcifying beats. The loom realization is foreshadowed yet lands as a label rather than a visible cost. Still, the refusal to keep the final weight (child’s fear) is a micro-choice that reconfigures her stance and earns the quiet exit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the grotto’s hush layers like sediment, each calcified burden adding density until the final flame dissolve reweights the whole. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 60 words and never drifts. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grotto exhales, Elira’s shadow walks beside her—cost is felt, no path is restored. One minor causality tremor: the grotto’s sudden “give-back” is not pre-seeded in rules, but the lyric pattern absorbs it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as both environment and instrument: its plates shingle sound into silence, constrain her breath, and finally accept the dissolved weights. The lamp burner’s brass throat, the starlit cracks, and the spiraled grooves are tactile, selective, and charged. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every tilt of the lamp tracks. The grotto’s material memory supplies the final pressure; without it, the ending’s reconfiguration collapses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elira divest the accumulated burdens before they dissolve her. Escalation is textured: each calcified grief adds density to the hush until the grotto itself demands restitution. Agency is present—she tilts the lamp, sings, refuses the child’s fear—but the final grotto push is externally triggered rather than driven by her prior choice. Cost is legible: she loses her shadow-self, gains a “light as held breath” companion—an earned trade-off under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of weaver/loom: the system uses her, not vice versa. The shingled hush and whalebone reverie recycle as tonal constants that reweight at the end—silence becomes cradle, not trap. No moral is stated; the final image of shadow-as-companion reframes solitude as acceptance. Subtext resides in gesture (tilting lamp, pressing forehead to bronze) rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-limited lyric voice owns a fractal poet’s perceptual signature: “spiral grooves,” “kelp-thick grief,” “moth-wing fear.” Syntax stretches and contracts with the whalebone cadence; compression is taught early (“shingled hush”) and paid off in the final sigh. No head-hopping, no register drift. Dialogue is absent by design; the silence is the dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic: long sentences swell, then fracture like ice—“calcified with a sound like ice fracturing.” No loops or filler stacks; every clause adds sensory or causal texture. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent (kelp, rust, moth, whalebone). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new equilibrium without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver who is actually the loom is a fresh synthesis of mythic trope and cognitive metaphor; the inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. The shingled hush as both acoustic and emotional texture is a risk that heightens atmosphere without obscuring causality. Specificity—kerosene burner throat, whalebone harp—prevents abstraction. The quiet dissolution of weights into starlight reprises the pattern without recycling familiar fantasy templates.</comment>
