<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lina’s interior contradiction—survivor cynic yet curiosity-driven risk-taker—drives every beat; her mischievous grin at the final text and bleeding-palm grip show embodied cost. Micro-choices (pry, twist, pocket, walk) steadily escalate from curiosity to ownership to renunciation. Mother backstory is anchored to present stimuli (bolt, desert wind) and tilts her stance. Flaw (reflexive mistrust) compounds rather than heals, earning the empty-hand / warm-diamond switch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: find bolt → text lure → twist → hull re-knits → conceptual unthreading → diamond. Orientation secure at word 60. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the bolt’s heart “unthreads” from pressure=diamond, leaving Lina empty-handed but value-reweighted; cost is the conceptual forfeiture of the old equation and the farm’s extinguished fungi. Persistent constraint: the phone’s final buzz is ignored, proving the loop can be refused.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Farm corner, damp glow, mushroom spacing, and pitted brass anchor immediacy; body-as-setting (palm bleed, thigh pulse) constrains final choice. Bolt object evolution (tarnished → warm → absent → diamond) charges closure. Sensory triage narrows to tactile heat and ozone scent under pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from corner → palm → pocket → desert edge without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: break or become the “quantum promise” loop. Escalation: each text raises cost—knowledge, bodily risk, cosmic rewrite—until twist act forces the hull vision. Agency is active (twist, ignore buzz) with visible price (bleed, farm blackout). No coincidence; pressure tightens causally under Causal lens. Final ignore forecloses loop, reweighting options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from bolt-diamond alchemy: value forged by pressure can be refused. Subtext in ignored buzz: silence > answer. Recurrent glow/dim mirrors internal shift without overt symbol. Final image reconfigures promise=equation as escapable rather than moral. No thesis stated; complexity held in empty palm / warm diamond contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric-cinematic compression taught by first sentence; maintained through fragmented yet coherent syntax. Perceptual signature is tactile-heat, metallic taste, ozone scent—Lina-specific, not generic. No dialogue, so voice purity rides rhythm: clause-fragment build-ups mirror rising glow. Register stays within survivor-street smart lexicon; no academic drift. Final “door” image earns its metaphoric leap via prior portal imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: single sentences weld sensory, symbolic, causal jobs (“bolt grew warm. In her pocket…”). Varied rhythm; no template cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent (pressure peels like skin). One micro-loop: “mushrooms dimmed, then flared” is purposeful escalation, not churn. No filter-verb stacks. Final line varietal sentence length lands cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: submarine salvage + quantum ontology + pyramid-scheme trauma. Risky conceptual unthreading succeeds because bolt→diamond re-pricing is dramatized, not lectured. Specific 1987 vessel and IOU suitcase anchor to real time, preventing abstraction drift. Transformation test fails if relocated: bolt insignia, farm bioluminescence, and scam-PTSD are inseparable. Shadowseam wonder subverts noir fatalism into exit-door optimism without safety hedging.</comment>
