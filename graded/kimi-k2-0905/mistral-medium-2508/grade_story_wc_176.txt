<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elira’s guilt-driven need to atone is palpable and embodied in her tactile handling of card and rope; the moment she presses palm to glowing strands crystallizes her interior arc. Yet her “technically gentle” trait is invoked rather than dramatized—no beat shows her gentleness costing her anything—so the flaw-to-cost pipeline feels asserted, not lived. Still, the renunciation of silence lands as earned stasis with visible warmth under ice. Voice remains coherent, but the absence of contradictory impulse under pressure keeps her just shy of 9-band complexity.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rope’s re-luminous braid reconfigures meaning while the aurora accepts the names, cost felt in the meltwater ache. Causal lattice holds—because she unravels, therefore the names rise; because she yields, the glacier weeps. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and steady. One hairline slip: the punched card dissolves off-stage, not shown, a micro lost beat that prevents perfect 9+.</comment>

<comment>Glacier-heart sanctum is no postcard; its ice walls breathe, its rope serpent sleeps, its aurora veins thread marrow—all constrain Elira’s gesture and charge the final image. Micro-setting (card scrap, rope strands) doubles as crucible, each perforation a syllable she must choose to re-weave. Spatial choreography is pristine—kneel, trace, exhale, press—no impossible positions. The environment’s cold glow literally warms under the rising names, a causal flip that fuses setting to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the lost names survive her silence?”—tightens once, decisively, when the card’s perforations are woven into the rope; this single turn reweights everything. Pressure is Accumulative: density of light, warmth, and sound escalates until the glacier itself cries. No false reversals, no coincidence; the only cost is her lifelong regret, now melted. Could wish for one intermediate tactical loss, but at this length the cadence shift suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without a single thesis statement: preservation is letting go, memory must change to live. The reconfigured rope becomes a living metaphor that re-prices the concept of archive—no moralizing required. Final image of “forgiveness woven into the dark like a second heartbeat” offers resonant non-literal answer. Every return of light, hair, and aurora tightens the same question: what does it mean to keep something alive?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, filleting glacier, aurora, and artery in the same breath. Syntax glides from long meltwater clauses to urgent fragments—“The sanctum trembled.”—mirroring pressure. No head-hop, no filter-fatigue; perceptual signature is Elira’s wax-and-flame history. Minor over-troping in “snowmelt ardor” is earned by pattern, not purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: clauses lengthen during kneading, shorten at tremor. Information density high—one sentence can braid time, tool, and myth. No loops, no scaffold; metaphors stay physically coherent (ice weeps, rope glows). One register spike—“transcribed…into the sanctum’s bones”—leans academic, but the voice justifies the arcane lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Frozen-memory-archive is familiar SF territory, yet the punched card scrap as phoneme-rope is a fresh splice; same for aurora-as-reader. Transformation test fails if relocated to desert, confirming specificity. Risk taken: lyric accumulation over causal duel, and it pays. Slight deduction for near-epigraphic final whisper that flirts with trope.</comment>
