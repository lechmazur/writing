<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is specific—her fingers twitch on controls, she recognizes the pilgrim’s hunger because she carries it—and her micro-choice (drone snatch) forces the decisive turn. The cost is visible: she forfeits anonymity and allies with a stranger. The “perpetually surprised” trait, however, is asserted not embodied; we never see her startle or recalibrate. Secondary pressure is minimal—pilgrim is present but passive—so relationship crucible is light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the chip-slot marriage projects a new constellation, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights “missing pieces” from personal lack to shared map. Causal chain holds: dusk angle → star trails → chip → slot → sky-pattern, each step tightening options. Orientation is anchored by sentence three; no debt. Cost is felt: Lena’s anonymity lost, pilgrim’s custody forfeited, both now linked under an impossible sky.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Observatory stones, drone wings, and ceiling oculus all constrain movement and camera angle; the foundry chip’s worn edges charge the final image. Dusk light is filtered through Lena’s technician eye—she times magnification to solstice angle—so setting guides choice. Spatial choreography is clean: drone descends, claw extends, slot opens, bodies shift. No extra geographical clutter; every stone and star is used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tested when Lena steals the chip, narrowing her option to either keep solitude or share the sky. One meaningful tightening suffices: slot opens, alliance forms, cost paid. Escalation is situational: pressure crystallizes stance rather than multiplying reversals. The price—exposure to another human—feels scaled to 740 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: missing pieces become a shared constellation, loneliness reframed as communal map. No moralizing; the stars “do the talking.” Subtext pulses in the pilgrim’s trembling hands and Lena’s silent acceptance of his palm—belonging rendered as physical geometry. Final image reweights prior solitude without declaring a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Lena’s technician perception: “sharp eyes,” “servos whirring like a held breath.” Syntax mirrors her clipped precision; no head-hop. Register remains within her plausible lexicon; no academic drift. Drone-as-POV-tool extends her body cleanly, maintaining psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic: “stone domes into silhouettes against a sky threaded with the first stars.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are spare and coherent; “brilliant dimness” is oxymoron with thematic payoff. One mixed image—“brilliant dimness”—is intentional and paid off, not muddled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Premise recombines ancient observatory, drone tech, and typographic relic into a fresh constellation key. The “frequency of belonging” reframed as shape, not sound, offers non-obvious synthesis. Risk—quiet lyric closure rather than set-piece—heightens resonance without gimmickry. Familiar lonely-quest trope is personalized through Lena’s technician gaze and the shared sky map.</comment>
