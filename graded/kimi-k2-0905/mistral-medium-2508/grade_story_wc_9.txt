<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s grief-hoarding flaw is embodied in trembling fingers, ink-stained parchment, the slow-motion unfastening of satchel and chest-knot; the final release is micro-acted, not declared. Interiority stays concrete—“ink spreading like roots,” “word tasted like copper”—avoiding label-speak. The brother-as-mist conceit prevents true relationship-as-crucible pressure, capping depth at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she renounces the hoarded grief, forecloses the rescue-fantasy, and the cost is the shattered saucer + acorn token—felt on-page. Accumulative lens holds: ink-into-crack → ledger → reservoir image reweights “lost time” with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; orientation anchors by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cloud-top glade, spongy moss, starless ink, and the porcelain saucer form a micro-setting that literally absorbs time; every descriptive beat is filtered through Liora’s cartomancer gaze and finally constrains her choice to let go. Selective sensory hierarchy (smell of regret, laughter at ankles) tightens the uncanny without clutter. One clause drift—“suspended above the clouds like a forgotten breath”—slightly overwrites, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where lost time accumulates”—tightens when the saucer-map reveals each crack is a stolen year, forcing her to repay with repentance. Single meaningful deepening suffices; option set narrows from rescue to release. Cost is legible in the shatter and the pocketed acorn. No reversal, but accumulative design doesn’t require one.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of hoarding grief: time doesn’t vanish, it pools and demands interest. The saucer-ledger image and acorn reprise reweight the premise without moralizing. Final benediction is felt, not stated, giving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Liora’s perceptual signature—constellation stitching only she can read, ink like starless sky. Rhythm swells then exhales with the glade, mirroring her unfastening. One line of unattributed dialogue (“You found me”) is justified by the ghost-mist logic; no head-hop.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “Moonlight bled… slow unraveling of regret” does triple sensory work. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; varied sentence openings create natural cadence. One mixed metaphor—“laughter curled around her ankles”—is momentarily visual-ambiguous, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Time-debt as porcelain crack” and “cloudbound repentance” synthesize divination, grief-physics, and inverted resurrection in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final acorn reprise. Not quite a 9 because the brother’s mist-form premise is hinted, not fully earned in early texture.</comment>
