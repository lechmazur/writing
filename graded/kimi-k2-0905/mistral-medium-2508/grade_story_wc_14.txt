<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stationer’s texture-collecting obsession is vivid, embodied in the trembling finger on gilded leaf and the pocket-worn notepad; his micro-choice to transcribe the lamp’s new hum launches the Elara dig. Interiority stays concrete, but the “wished for a different kind of time” line drifts toward diagnostic paraphrase, blunting the final contradiction needed for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lamp’s silence leaves the stationer poised to invent the next bonsai, the cost being the unpayable debt of carrying Elara’s resurrected afternoons. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory fragment layers until the name surfaces—yet the causal leap from lamp buzz to full biography is slightly under-motivated, keeping it shy of 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass dome, ink-ledgers, and fluorescent hum are tactile filters for the POV; the weeping cherry and gnarled pine physically manifest the invented histories, constraining his next sketch. Selective sensory hierarchy (pine scent, gilded paper breath-fog) mirrors his narrowing attention, and the final sunlit gilding of leaves recharges the opening image with earned cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture vanished textures before silence ends—tightens when the lamp’s alien hum forces a new transcription that can’t be postponed. One meaningful deepening: the hum becomes a name, foreclosing the option that tonight would yield only another anonymous fragment. Cost is felt (pulse quicken, wet ink), but external pressure stays internalized; no tangible consequence yet alters his future tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory is not retrieved but fabricated, and every resurrection commits a gentle theft from the dead. Subtext lives in the bonsai shadows “leaning in to read,” implying complicity between maker and made. Final image refrains from moralizing; the laughter-in-branches suggestion keeps ambiguity alive, though the concept is stated once too often in mid-story reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains a hushed, lapidary cadence that matches “incandescent restraint”; diction (“refracting the past through the present”) stays within the stationer’s artisanal lexicon. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—he “records textures” rather than feelings—until the final birdsong, where syntax loosens to mirror release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short breath-fog fragments to longer, lamp-buzz clauses, propelling the quiet beat. Figurative layering is dense but patterned: every metaphor is rooted in stationery or botany (gilded leaf, brass pendulum), avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. One paraphrase loop—“another fragment, another texture, another life”—is stylistically purposeful, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—miniature bonsai as monuments to unlived micro-histories discovered via fluorescent hum—is a fresh synthesis of steampunk antiquarianism and quiet fabulism. Risk lies in the lyric stillness where nothing explodes yet everything changes; the concept commits fully without hedging. The Elara episode feels inevitable in hindsight because the lamp’s mechanical ghost was seeded early.</comment>
