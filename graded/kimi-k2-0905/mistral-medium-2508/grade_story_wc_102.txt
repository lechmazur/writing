<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with half-seen images and the jade’s pull feel lived-in; the physician memory arrives as a full-force revelation that re-codes his guilt. Micro-choice—pressing the stone to his sternum—marries need and risk in one motion. The laugh at the end is credible release after visible cost: the jade vanishes, his ribcage now literally carries her weight. Interiority stays concrete (“breath formed shapes…then dissolved”) without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fog bridge becomes a live threshold and Elias its keeper; cost is the irreversible loss of the jade and permanent internal lodging of the “unused love.” Causal chain holds—memory surfaces because he handles the jade, jade dissolves because he accepts memory. Orientation is clean by 80 words. One minor scaffold: “he understood then that…” could be trimmed, but does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct is more than postcard: the blooming jasmine narrows scent memory, wet-iron air signals past blood, and the fog literally curls around wrists to invite the next breath. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting—its brass warmth anchors touch and projects the past onto present stone. Environment guides every beat: arches frame silhouette splits, river embers literalize “sparks.” Final reconfiguration is charged by this exact place turning from relic to living threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where does unused love go?”—is voiced early and tightened when the jade burns against bone; option to remain mere seeker is foreclosed. Escalation is textural/accumulative: fog thickens, breath shapes solidify, embers rise, each reweighting the emotional cost rather than forcing external twists. Agency remains internal yet decisive: inhaling the spark commits him to eternal porterage. Cost is felt—jade lost, ribs permanently occupied, keeper role accepted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not lecture: repeated breath imagery ties life, memory, and love-transference; viaduct and jade embody compassionate refusal to let tenderness vanish. Subtext in gesture—camera lens turned skyward projects her into his eyelids—offers resonance beyond plot. Final line “until it is ready to be found” reprises opener without moralizing. Avoids sentimental uplift; tension between forgetting and carrying remains alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: compound clauses mirror twilight layering while tactile nouns (“brass lens,” “wet earth,” “iron left too long”) ground abstraction. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for memory swells, single-sentence exhalations for beats of recognition. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays in Elias’s sinew and sightline. Lyric diction never drifts into purple excess because each image earns causal place.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can set scent, temperature, myth, and emotional history (“arches wreathed…jasmine…iron left too long”). Figurative logic stays coherent—fog as invitation, breath as filament, river embers as love-sparks. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb clutter. Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing line releases with cadence lift. Microscopic nit: “he exhaled, and the breath…shimmered” could trim second “breath,” but propulsion remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Camera-obscura + plague-physician + Kwan Yin tear fuses science, history, and myth into fresh angle on spectral guilt. “Unused love” as combustible ember is non-obvious metaphor that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric escalation could have collapsed into perfume-ad but retains causal backbone. Specificity of jasmine/iron scent differentiates from generic misty ruin tropes.</comment>
