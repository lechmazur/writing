<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hollow’s passivity—guarding, then merely cradling the spark—keeps the arc from tightening; the decisive act (winding the clock backward) is announced, not dramatized, so cost is felt but not earned in scene. Interiority is vivid, yet the contradiction between “never dreamed” and instant acceptance of timeline magic remains asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: the green sand and ticking clock reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of blooming dunes / sparks / clock chimes accumulates until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early by insistent lyric disorientation that later pays off, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glowing dune-train-crate triad functions as micro-setting: the crate’s lock ices, the dunes sigh open, the train’s whistle fractures—all constrain Hollow’s next gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (“Hollow felt something like a dream”), and the final green sand charges the closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—“carry the spark or the board resets”—is clear early. Escalation is poetic density rather than causal tightening: each bloom of light raises the price of failure. Agency is present but diffuse; Hollow’s final winding is the first visible tactic, so cost is conceptual, not tactile—sufficient for lyric mode, yet shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of cultivation/bloom imagery: archive as greenhouse for impossible futures. Final green sand re-prices the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—empty crate, unheard child-laugh—inviting reflection. Ambiguity is meaningful, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-epic, compressed syntax (“iron veins of the dead earth”), rhythmic anaphora taught by line-initial repetitions. Perceptual signature is Hollow’s cargo-biased attention: he notices locks, rust, weight. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. POV distance stays steady—mythic close-third—held through the crystalline final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, stakes, and metaphor. Occasional stacked qualifiers (“skeletal ribbon of steel cutting through the glowing dunes in bloom”) flirt with overwriting but serve cadence, never obscure causality. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with white-space staccato of single-line stanzas.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes post-apocalyptic train, quantum-archive, and eco-rebirth tropes into one compressed lyric. The “chess clock frozen at midnight” is a fresh temporal key; “occasionally everywhere” reframes quantum superposition as emotional memory. Risk-taking (mosaic shards, mythic POV) heightens coherence without gimmickry. Transformation test fails—arc is too interior to swap settings—indicating genuine specificity.</comment>
