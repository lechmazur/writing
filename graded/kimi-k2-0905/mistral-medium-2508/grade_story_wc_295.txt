<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, the taste of petals and salt—but the “healing with words” gift is asserted, not dramatized; no scene shows him mending anyone. His micro-choice to release the ledger is earned, yet the sister remains a cipher, so the relational crucible is one-sided. Contradictory impulses (record vs. release) surface, but only in summary. Still, the final renunciation carries a felt cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mosaic of four shards (domes, desk, lens, dawn) is taught by the first 25 % and coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard adds density to the “shared burden” pattern. The decisive Charged Poise lands when the thread spools through Elias and the ledger vanishes—visible cost is the dissolution of his hoarded words. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored in first 60 words). One causal micro-turn: pressing palm to telegram → ink warms → glyphs shift, narrowing his path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Observatory gears, brass, and telescope create tactile micro-setting; the telegram and ledger act as mobile “setting” that constrains his hand movements. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: astronomer notices star rhythms, ink warmth, petal brittleness. Final image—daylily blooming where ledger sat—mirrors internal release without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean across dome, desk, lens, and horizon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode inscriptions to find sister/burden”—is signaled early. Pressure deepens accretively: each star pulse, telegram crumble, and glyph glow adds density rather than new reversals. The tightening is the thread spooling through his chest, forcing release; cost is the ledger’s disappearance. Agency is present—he reaches for the cup glyph—but escalation is more Textural than Causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared grief emerges through iterative imagery: stars as wounds, telegram as brittle petal, lattice of light as communal sorrow. Subtext operates in silence—absence of sister’s voice, empty cup glyph. Final image reweights premise: ledger gone, flower remains—burden transmuted, not erased. Avoids explicit moral; the chorus metaphor is implicit but not overstated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-distance stays stable. Perceptual signature is astronomer-poet: star-pulse as Morse, ink that “sighs,” clock that resonates “through the hollows of his ribs.” Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for telescope ascent, staccato fragments at dawn. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Patterned repetition (“each star a wound, each story a balm”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary; no scaffold loops. Occasional purple tinge—“lattice of light,” “thread that spooled”—but imagery stays legible and thematically tied. One mixed metaphor: stars dim “in relief” (personification borderline). High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (action, image, theme). No typos or tense drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of lucid-dream chronicler, variable-star Morse, and grief-temple is fresh; not a trope checklist. Telegram/daylily reprises elegantly, not as quirky ornament. Conceptual risk—lyric mosaic over causal plot—pays off in Charged Poise. Specific detail (“brass gears whispering”) prevents generic anywhere setting. Could swap desert observatory for mountain, so freshness is moderate-high, not radical.</comment>
