<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid: the lantern maker both clings to and yields her daughter’s memory; the gem’s bite rewrites her skin into dream-stuff, a literal cost that fuses motive to final renunciation—Earned Stasis achieved on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: basilica’s paradoxical descent/ascent is driven by the gem insertion, tightening until the cranes lift the isle into the dream-realm; closure reconfigures gravity itself with the mother’s dissolution as visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Basilica and tea garden evolve from static monuments to agents: glass thins to invite entry, cranes transmute from paper to light; these micro-settings physically constrain every tactical move and charge the final ascension image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake—recover/resign the daughter’s voice—tightens when the gem bites and forecloses retreat; the ascent is irreversible, cost paid in corporeal erasure under causal logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-architecture emerges without statement: recording dreams becomes self-entombment; final image re-prices the basilica from monument to vessel, resonance earned through concrete particulars rather than thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at poetic distance yet stays anchored to sensory extremity (“luminous and white-hot”); patterned elision (“*pulled*,” “*sighed*”) is taught early and paid off in the breathing-glass closure, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence layers job triplets (image, motion, emotion); metaphors obey internal physics of sinking-through-sea gravity; final paragraph accelerates into breath-cadence that mirrors isle’s rise—line-level craft charges the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-recording basilica that descends while ascending, origami cranes as grief-currency, and island inversion into dream-archive feel inevitable yet unwritten; risk-taking with lyric physics heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
