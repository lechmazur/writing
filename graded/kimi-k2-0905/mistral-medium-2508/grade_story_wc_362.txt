<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for proof yet fearing the cost—drives every beat; the prism throw is earned because earlier beats show him cradling, then flinching from, the glass. Embodied emotion is vivid: knees hit earth, palm bleeds, shoulders unknot. Micro-choices (touch frost, pocket prism, hurl it) trace a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Only minor slip: “awful clarity of understanding” skirts diagnostic label-speak, but the next line cuts it with physical pain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prism shatters, frost melts, and Elias walks away lighter yet exiled from proof—cost is legible in the empty pocket and the arbor’s “settling of old debts.” Causal chain holds: prism warms → vision → recognition → throw → silence. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“quartz arbor… dawn”), well under the 120-word cap. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quartz branches, frost patterns, and mist are not backdrop—they refract choice: the arbor’s crystalline ribs literally splinter the prism beam that ends the story. Micro-setting (car window frost) doubles as language Elias must parse; failure means possession. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and temperature, matching Elias’s vocation. Spatial choreography is clean: palm to glass, knees to earth, throw into heart of arbor—every object’s position tracks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove objects absorb emotion”—tightens when absorption reverses: the prism starts returning. One decisive turn at the frost-face suffices; options narrow to hold or hurl. Cost is physical (cut palm) and epistemic (forfeits proof). Agency is continuous; coincidence merely reveals, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: knowledge pursued as legacy becomes curse; inheritance is not answers but the burden of what was hidden. Subtext lives in frost-face’s silent accusation and the arbor’s post-shatter “laughter”—truth speaks only when relinquished. No moralizing; final line refuses proof, reweighting the premise. Ambiguity is purposeful: did the hush transfer or dissolve? Reader left with after-echo, not lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter: “measured silence in degrees,” “scent of a struck match.” Syntax lengthens under vision, then fractures into staccato beats (“He hurled…”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses exactly as stress spikes. Diction remains within mystic’s lexicon—“refracting,” “liminal,” “shifted hush”—without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crystalline branches refracting the dawn into fractured rainbows that bled into the mist” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent (light → bones → debt). One near-miss: “needle-thin beams” edges toward purple, but the prior soundlessness justifies the image. Final paragraph breathes, giving cadence release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise flips paranormal trope: haunted object is not cursed by place but by owner’s abandonment. Synthesis feels inevitable—prism as emotional capacitor—yet not obvious at outset. Risk taken: lyric mysticism in under 800 words without exposition dump, paid off by tangible closure. Specificity of frost-script and quartz arbor prevents generic “haunted heirloom” feel.</comment>
