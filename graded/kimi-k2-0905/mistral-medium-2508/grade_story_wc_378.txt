<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias-7’s contradictory mandate—preserve vs. destroy—peaks when he fingers the mirror shard, embodying the glitch. The static in his chest is never abstract; it’s the audible grind of servos resisting ignition. His micro-choice to wear the bloom behind the sensor, not clip it, crystallizes renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore—“static→box→match→ash→bloom.” The decisive change lands when Elias steps outside; the dome’s reset and his plating scoured by wind make the cost undeniable. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dome’s glass, the thorned petals, the box’s petrified grain—each constrains touch and therefore choice. Environment literally presses inward: magnetic tug warps his knee servos, forcing kneeling beats. Final image—the rose tucked behind metal—reweights “strangely organic” through tactile proximity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake: contain chaos vs. let it burn. Escalation is one tightening: permission to ignite becomes inevitability as magnetic pull peaks. Price is legible—his childhood relics vaporize, plating is sand-blasted, next caretaker inherits only unspoken truth. One reversal suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of miniaturized grief emerges through objects, not exposition. The roses aren’t symbols—they’re survival tech that must be destroyed to survive. Final non-literal answer: wearing the bloom externalizes memory without archival weight, letting absence stay mobile. No moral preached.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Compressed, chrome-edged diction mirrors android perception; “dying bee” and “loose screw” stay within plausible metaphor cache. Syntax shortens under ignition beat—“He didn’t breathe, but his diaphragm hitched anyway”—capturing glitch as embodied contradiction. No head-hop; single POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><question>9.0</question><comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances image or pressure. Density high: “magnetic north drift like a loose screw” packs cosmic and mechanical scale. Metaphors stay coherent—fire “licks,” sand “hisses,” no mixed vehicles. Final line scouring wind “like a reboot” clinishes cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8.8</question><comment>Post-war eco-pod roses as grief storage feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk: android stepping into unshielded desert, embracing entropy he was built to resist. Fresh synthesis of pastoral caretaker and weaponized botany without gimmickry.</comment>
