<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"quiet in her own ribs," "hush...predated sound"—and the childhood memory beat anchors motive. Yet the final turn ("of course it had never been about bringing the past back") is asserted rather than dramatized inside the present moment; the cost is named but not felt through a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative. Still, the contradiction between nostalgic ache and pragmatic loneliness is embodied throughout, keeping her above the 8.3 cap.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the beacon flares, the prism mends, and the pattern of coincidences crystallizes with conceptual cost—she now carries the weight of meaning she cannot share. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each echo (prism fracture / star map / mother’s laugh) layers until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—salt-worn glass, spiral stairs, dying sun—well inside 120 words. No lens ambiguity; the song fades but the reconfiguration is undeniable.</comment>

<comment>The pavilion’s glass walls function as micro-setting: their hum constrains her pacing, their star-path grooves guide her fingertips and literally enable the rekindling. Salt wind, skeletal ruins, and first-rain scent are filtered through her retrocognitive bias—she notices what once was, not what is. Spatial choreography is clean: boots on stairs, palm on fracture, kneeling to trace floor spirals. Environment never stalls momentum; every detail either mirrors her internal hush or supplies the tactile cue that triggers the beacon.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove coincidences carry meaning—is signaled early and tightens through sensory patterning: prism break ↔ transmission death ↔ mother’s birth sky. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the star paths ignite under her palm, forcing her stance to crystallize from nostalgic grasp to acceptance of pattern. Cost is conceptual but legible: she gains meaning at the price of continued solitude. No false escalation; the pressure is accumulative density rather than external opposition, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of fracture-and-mending: personal loss, civilizational collapse, crystal repair. The final image—mended prism tucked like an extra rib—reweights "meaning" from restoration to recognition of pattern, avoiding moralizing. Subtext resides in silence: the hush inside glass and her own chest imply that significance is felt, not broadcast. Ambiguity is purposeful—she leaves unsure anyone remains to see the beacon—yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete: wonder tinged with loneliness.</comment>

<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical yet precise register—"thistle-blown moment," "salt wind worn thin"—that feels idiosyncratic to the custodian’s retrocognitive gaze. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for ascent, staccato fragments at flare ("it *mended*—not perfectly, but enough"). No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. Perceptual signature is consistent—she senses echoes, not futures—and the final line relinquishes the pavilion’s song without sentimental linger, proving control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: metaphorical stacks ("glass worn thin by centuries of salt wind") advance atmosphere without clogging beats. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence adds tactile or temporal layer. Filter verbs are minimal; when used ("she heard it: the thread") they serve rhythmic pause, not distancing. One clause borders purple ("quiet so old it predated sound") yet fits the heightened moment; it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse beacon-tender is familiar terrain, but the fusion of retrocognition with astrolabe-style star-path math feels fresh; the prism-as-hush-container literalizes emotional silence in a way not seen in standard dystopias. The mother-memory beat could slide toward trope, yet it is framed as one missed past among countless shards, resisting sentimental monopoly. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure—no antagonist, no dialogue—but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final cadence, justifying the gamble.</comment>
