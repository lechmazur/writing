<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysan’s interiority is concrete and sensory, grounded in bodily contact with the parapet and the half-mask; her contradictory impulses—reverence for quiet wisdom vs. the need to act against the prophet’s noise—are dramatized in the consecration beat. The micro-choice of tracing seams and pressing forehead to metal reveals a hierarchy of values without label-speak. Yet the “strangely honest” trait is asserted rather than shown through behavioral violation; the cost of her endurance is felt but not foregrounded in a visible forfeiture, capping the arc just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Lysan refuses to let the clearing collapse, pays with ongoing exposure to the prophet’s echoes, and the final image—“the desert would remember”—makes the cost conceptual but undeniable. Causality is lyric/accumulative: each sensory beat thickens the texture of silence until the parapet’s song re-stitches the fraying border. The lens holds without ambiguity; the only minor drag is a slightly late geographic anchor for the pavilion’s interior, but the disorientation is taught early and waived at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dunes, pavilion silk, and parapet metal are not backdrop but instruments: the parapet’s vibration literally reseals the clearing, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—crushed mint, warm metal, bone mask—each detail filtered through Lysan’s tactile urgency. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or floating rooms. The micro-setting (the parapet curve beneath her palm) functions as the story’s surgical table, constraining every tactical motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—the survival of nuanced silence against fiery oversimplification—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the clearing’s borders actually fray. The consecration beat is the meaningful turn: her bodily contact re-activates the parapet, foreclosing the option to remain passive. Cost is visible—she leaves with the second heartbeat still in her ribs, a persistent kinetic echo that will keep her exposed. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening of sensory density is sufficient escalation; no additional reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: wisdom survives in peripheral, unspoken interstices, not in prophetic fire. The shift of the parapet from inert metal to singing relic reweights “silence” from absence to active force. No final-paragraph moralizing; the closing image of the desert’s memory invites counter-readings (will the dunes really keep faith?) without forcing a thesis. Subtext resides in gesture—tracing seams, sighing silk—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: every noun is chosen for tactile resonance (“silk walls rippled though no wind stirred”). Syntax lengthens and compresses with the parapet’s pulse, creating a rhythmic thrum that mirrors the kinetics. Free indirect style is immaculate; no filter-verb stacks. The single line of dialogue is voice-appropriate—terse, desert-dry—and carries subtext about time, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds either new sensory data or causal pressure. Metaphors are coherent—“breath through reeds” extends to the parapet’s later song without contradiction. Information density is high: “the first word ever spoken” compresses cosmology into one sniff. No artifact appears in the final third; the final line’s monosyllabic drumbeat is intentional and pays off the opening whisper.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of kinetic archaeology and silence preservation feels fresh; the half-mask as honesty device reverses the usual concealment trope. The prophet remains offstage, avoiding fire-and-brimstone clichés. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off because the final image reconfigures the meaning of “whisper” from passive to defiant. The concept could not survive relocation out of this exact dunes-and-pavilion cosmos.</comment>
