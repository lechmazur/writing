<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is sensuous—thumb on glass, bow on river—but his want (“amnesty from never”) stays abstract; no contradictory micro-choice shows how the shard physically alters his risk calculus before he steps through. The climactic renunciation (“the bridge had nothing to do with it”) lands as label-only epiphany rather than embodied cost. Still, his perceptual signature—sound as topology—keeps the voice particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pixel-road rewrites the rule-set and the fiddle becomes song-body. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each left-behind artifact layers density until the glass flake tips scale. The “threshold not rest-stop” reconfig meaning is legible and final. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—“the song was hungry.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mountain pullout anchors early; weathered wood, guardrail, slant of dusk are selective and steer attention to the shard. Micro-setting success: the glass flake itself functions as environment—its grid-of-light constrains the final path choice. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Meets 9+ gate: tool (flake) charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“sidestep your own story”—is signaled in second paragraph. One meaningful tightening: the lattice-of-threads image narrows infinite options to one glowing road. Escalation is Accumulative: each leftover object raises mythic density until refusal of old identity is the only release. Cost is conceptual but legible; persistent constraint (song must now feed on him) shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from motif of abandoned artifacts as keys to self-erasure; no explicit thesis stated. Final image reweights “never” as sculptable material—resonant without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the hunger liberation or new servitude? Specificity of clockwork birds, spoon-that-isn’t avoids abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s sensorium; perceptual signature—sound as spatial geometry—is distinctive and consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences for wonder, staccato fragments for decision. No head-hopping; diction stays within rural-musician lexicon. Filter verbs rare and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and world-rule. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (twilight-shard, river-stutter). One register drift—“pixel by pixel”—is justified by concept. Final line crisp, propulsive. Read-aloud rhythm varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise freshens familiar “mystical hitchhiker” by making abandonment itself the currency of escape; pixelated amnesty is non-obvious synthesis. Risky second-person invitation (“you could too”) pays off by flipping to first-person sculptor. Specificity of wet-plate collodion tech roots the impossible in photographic history. Ending hunger feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
