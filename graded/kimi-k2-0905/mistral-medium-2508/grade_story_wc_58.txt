<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is dense, poetic, and idiosyncratic—his profession of “writing obituaries for the living” is shown through tactile micro-choices (pressing thread to lips, pocketing locket) rather than label. His contradictory impulse—to map grief yet keep the prince alive in story—drives every beat. The only drag is the late, slightly abstract declaration “he wasn’t writing an obituary; he was mapping the geography of healing,” which momentarily slips into diagnostic-speak and softens the earned contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the thread and locket crystallize into a compass for “cartographer of the spaces between departure and return.” Cost is felt—the prince stays absent, Elias accepts perpetual search—without sentimental payoff. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (thread, garden, tide) layers density until the final sentence reweights the absence as prayer, not loss. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no causal breaks, though the prince’s prior motives remain elliptical by design.</comment>

<comment>The shadowed autumn garden is not backdrop but micro-setting that constrains: damp earth hides the locket, willow fingers trace wounds, bench becomes archive. Sensory triage follows Elias’s obituary gaze—smell of salt on absent cloak, skeletal vines rattling like unwritten names. Spatial choreography is flawless: every object Elias touches (thread, soil, locket) stays pocketed and carried forward. Final image of wind moving through trees after ship has sailed recharges the garden’s “breath” as ongoing, living absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can absence be narrated into bearable shape?—tightens once: finding the locket converts abstract commission into concrete quest. No antagonist; pressure is accumulative density of images that force Elias to shift from chronicler to caretaker of possibility. Cost is legible: he forfeits closure for the princess, choosing perpetual story-travel. Coincidence (locket half-buried) complicates without resolving; agency remains his decision to carry both thread and locket into next ship-cycle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from repeated images of threads, tides, and unwritten names: absence is not vacancy but active, story-bearing space. Subtext operates in gesture—pressing thread to lips is veneration, not mourning. Final line “the wind still moved through the trees, long after the last ship had sailed” offers non-literal answer: memory is meteorological, not monumental. No moralizing; complexity held in the oxymoron “lonesome splendor.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed, lyric, oceanic—syntax swells and ebbs like tide. Perceptual signature sharp: Elias notices unravelled weft before garden’s beauty, catalogues silence as “weight of things unsaid.” Rhythm escalates toward short declaratives at closure (“He would listen. He would write.”) without breaking pattern. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; free-indirect glides seamlessly into poetic assertion without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is virtuosic—participle openers, em-dash breathers, fragment punches—creating tidal cadence. Metaphors are mixed but coherent: sails “swallowing the horizon like a sigh” blends ingestion and exhalation yet tracks Elias’s oral act of storytelling. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances knowledge or pressure. Only micro-slip: “the way the wind still moved through the trees” repeats prior “wind” motif, but serves as deliberate echo, not churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: obituary writer who refuses death, scripting living absence instead of posthumous tribute. Thread-as-compass and locket-as-portable-shrine transform familiar memento trope into cartographic tool. Risk of lyric abstraction is high but justified by coherent pattern taught from first sentence. Conceptual integrity intact: every metaphor of tide/thread/garden serves the contested space between departure and return.</comment>
