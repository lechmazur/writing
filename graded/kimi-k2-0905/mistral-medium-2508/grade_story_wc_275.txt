<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is concrete—“thorns against her palm until the pain grounded her”—and her endurance carries a visible cost when she knots the sandbag strip round the sapling, renouncing flight. The father/backstory is cleanly cued by the canvas scrap and “Quiet, like the wind before dawn,” then paid off in her refusal to leave. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the renunciation is earned and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she stays, the dome holds, the sandbag scrap becomes living suture—“a patch against the storm”—with conceptual cost (she forfeits escape). Causal lens holds: tower fall → airship wreck → ballast in dome → Liora’s choice to mend glass with cloth. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, cracked pane, and sandbag scrap function as micro-setting that directly constrain her choice to stitch the fissure. Sensory selection stays tight—taste of salt/rust on canvas, vibration through glass—filtered through her gardener-bounty-hunter hybrid gaze. Spatial tracking is clean: knelt soil → dome edge → pressed palm to fissure. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stay and mend versus flee—is signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: the cracked pane becomes her moment of commitment; stitching it forecloses escape. Cost is visible (she sacrifices dawn departure) and shapes tactics under causal lens. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word frame; no reversal, yet the choice reweights options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-fragility emerges from image chain: weapon→knife→whittled bark; sandbag→suture; roses→listeners. No overt thesis; final image of “thorn at a time” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in silence of roses versus outside scream invites reflection. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: awe at stubborn tenderness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“Quiet, like the wind before dawn” repeated in canvas stitching). Syntax mirrors desert patience: long vowel clusters, comma-rolled clauses. No dialogue to judge; POV stays tight third, no head-hop. Perceptual signature distinct—“roses breathing”—and holds under pressure. Psychic distance stable; no filter-verb glut.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; no template runs. Figurative density high but patterned (“tower… sandcastle under a boot”) and pays off at closure. One scaffold spot: “they stretched toward the light, unaware… that was the point” veers toward exposition, but momentum recovers. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information dense: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, symbolic work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Pacifist bounty-hunter’s daughter gardening roses in a cracked dome after airship wreck is fresh synthesis; trope inversion feels earned. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, because roses-listen mechanic is specific to this desert horticulture. Risk-taking in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous lines.</comment>
