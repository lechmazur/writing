<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The painter’s contradictory impulses—writing on living leaves, clinging to 43 sleepless nights while craving sleep—stay embodied throughout, but interiority drifts into decorative label-speak (“methodically hopeful,” “quiet insistence of someone who recognized a fellow insomniac”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The final choice begins sleeping again is narrated more than embodied; we lose bodily cost in the transition to lyric summary. Still, irritant details (crushed lapis, jasmine, moon-tipped bristles) ground his biases and his hand stays legible. The child’s laughter and the missing leaf are enough micro-turns to earn a qualified renunciation, but cost is gestured rather than inhabited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the leaf vanishes, the brush tip wears, the moon clarifies—three concrete signs that the kindness experiment has re-priced the city’s air. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern of nightly inscription→absorption→renewal tightens into the final charged poise without needing causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words and never drift. The only soft spot is the off-stage removal of the leaf; because the poet can’t witness the transfer, the “cost” is felt more than dramatized, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s oxygen-starved pocket, moon-lit glass slats, and the fig leaf as living parchment literally constrain every stroke he makes; remove any of these and the script cannot exist. Smog taste, impossible rain, and the child’s rooftop voice evolve the city across beats, making atmosphere a causal agent that thins just enough to reveal the moon. Sensory hierarchy stays painter-vision: color particles (lapis, silver, saffron) trump sound, aligning with an artist who reads hue before language. The final “air smelled of rain” reweights the prior impossibility into earned environmental reversal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can kindness left on a leaf be remembered by the city?—is legible from the gift of the brush and accumulates through each glyph that may vanish with daylight. Escalation is textural rather than causal: every added character (laughing child, absent calligrapher) widens the circle of unknowable receivers, tightening the emotional cost of failure rather than the physical risk. The missing-leaf/clarified-moon dyad supplies the single meaningful tightening that reweights options; the price is conceptual (ephemeral art) rather than visceral. For 700 words, one deepening is sufficient, but the lack of an on-page obstacle that could destroy the leaf keeps this shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of remembered kindness emerges solely through image and elimination: ink absorbed, leaf gone, brush worn, smog thinned—no character ever names the moral. The child’s laughter encoded into a dead language literalizes subtext without commentary, letting the reader decode whether forgiveness or awakening has been offered. Earlier jasmine scent returned as phantom draft shows motif re-pricing rather than ornamental echo. The refusal to state meaning is the meaning, achieving non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close keeps painter-vision steady: synesthetic color perception, insomnia-dilated time sense, and a diction tuned to pigment and moonlight. Filter verbs are sparse; perceptual signature is vivid (“calligrapher’s moon-tipped brush,” “waxing moon slip through the haze like a coin”) without purple bloat. No head-hopping; the calligrapher and child appear only as sensory ghosts, maintaining POV modesty. Rhythm modulates from long hypnotic sentences to the staccato final “The greenhouse held its breath. Somewhere, a window opened.”—a controlled breath-mimic that matches content.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“moon-tipped,” “wishing-well,” “saffron quiet”) and paid off in the final clarifying image; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided by staying inside the painter’s chromatic lexicon. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence adds either new sensory data or conceptual pressure. Line breaks and paragraphing follow breath units that accelerate toward the sleep-release. The only micro-slip is the vague “static of a thousand sleepless souls,” an abstract intensifier that briefly blurs specificity, but it is isolated and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of calligraphy + botany + insomnia + extinct language is a fresh synthesis; the living leaf as palimpsest feels inevitable yet un-seen before. Risk is taken by making the climax the disappearance of the art object rather than its triumph, a quiet inversion that trusts accumulation over spectacle. City-smog-as-canvas and kindness-as-pollination rewire familiar eco-metaphors without moralizing. Specificity of materials—lapis pigment, moon-tipped sable, jasmine scent—anchors the conceit in tactile memory.</comment>
