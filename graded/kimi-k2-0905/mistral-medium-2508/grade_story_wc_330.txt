<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lior’s muteness is embodied through tactile work and listening; the final “song” of gesture earns the shift. Interiority stays concrete—wood grain, halo warmth—yet the scar-woman functions more as oracle than crucible, muting relationship pressure. Micro-choices (pulling fragment, shaping air) visibly trace value hierarchy. Cost is felt: silence becomes door, but woman’s vanish skips concrete consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: silence re-priced as generative, halo pulsing in palm = visible cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of echo, dust, chime—tightening through sensory repeats until final cadence shift. Orientation waived: disorientation taught early by “shouldn’t exist” car and repaid in mirror expansion. No causal break; only mild late-rule wobble when woman fades without foreshadow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert-train micro-world is lived-in: tools scrape, nets sag, halo’s weight alters grip. Sensory economy favors touch & sound; visual stripes appear only when moonlight hits. Oasis car’s oranges & velvet contras the rust, mirroring internal expansion without overt symbol. Spatial track clean—fragment handed, chime outside rings, mirror ripple—each prop state remembered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: interpret silence vs. remain mute. Pressure escalates through textured accumulation: mist, song, mirrors—each layer thickens same question. No reversal, but deepening forces stance crystallization in final gesture-song. Cost legible: silence ceases to be refuge, becomes active tool; persistent halo keeps price present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-creation emerges via sawdust, rust, wind-chime—never thesis-stated. Final image of “door” reweights prior muteness without moral. Subtext in woman’s scar & matching fragment hints shared history, left ambiguous. Resists tidy profundity; resonance lingers in tactile specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Lior’s perceptual bias—sound as texture, light as weight. Syntax mirrors his patience: long clauses when smoothing wood, fragment-short when halo found. No head-hopping; woman’s interior withheld appropriately. Diction stays within carpenter’s lexicon; “jagged like broken promise” is earned metaphor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary rhythm; opening spondee “abandoned circus train” sets dirge tempo, final line “Then he began” cuts to trochee release. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances image or choice. Figurative density peaks only in oasis car where mirrors demand it. Filter verbs minimal; “he felt” appears once and motivates touch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Circus-train ghost-recovery trope is refreshed via muteness-as-instrument and halo fragment that fuses scar to sky. Risk taken: non-causal lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals, paid off in audible star-naming. Specificity of carpenter’s handling of “gold leaf like captured sunlight” keeps image from cliché. Conceptual repricing of silence feels non-obvious yet inevitable.</comment>
