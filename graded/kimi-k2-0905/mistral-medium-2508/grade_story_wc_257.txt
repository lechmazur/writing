<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s grief-hardened inertia and the slow pivot from sealing memory in metal to releasing it via hollow cranes are rendered with embodied, tool-specific interiority. The contradictory pull to hoard vs. let go acts inside single beats (twisting wire / folding paper) and culminates in a credibly costly renunciation: she cedes control of the cranes to strangers, foreclosing her reliquary habit. Mentor memories are anchored to present tactile cues (vellum, copper petals) and tilt her choices on the page. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status pressures are N/A; headcount default waived cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the open curtain, candle-bearing crane, and stranger-to-strand diffusion of grief visibly reprice her prior silenced stance. Causality is accumulative/textural: each folded crane thickens the pattern until the final image crystallizes options (she can now teach/teach others). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 4; no penalty. The persistent cost—her relinquished monopoly on mourning—charges the final lens and satisfies the 9+ quick test, yet a hairline slip: the first black-feather return arrives off-stage, slightly diluting the on-page causality chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass telescopes, cracked dome-gap, and slanted moonlight double as emotional barometer and craft resource (Lena uses the gap to discover the coordinate crane). Micro-setting objects—silver wire, copper petals, vellum stencil—constrain technique and evolve: wire yields to paper, stencil migrates to skin. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene; no impossible props. Environment charges the closure image: opened curtains literally let starlight fall on the candle-crane, mirroring her opened stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake = transform grief from sealed stasis to shareable flight. One meaningful tightening: the mentor’s “genuinely artificial” flower forces her shift from metal lily to hollow crane; the price is visibility/exposure of her sorrow. Agency remains internal—folding, gifting, opening curtains—but each act forecloses the safety of private reliquary. Escalation is textural: each crane left increases social exposure until winter steps are lined with communal grief; cost legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges via concrete craft metaphors: permanence vs. transience, sealed vs. shared mourning. Subtext resides in gestures (folding, leaving, opening) rather than dictums; the final image of snow-covered cranes reweights “genuinely artificial” into communal authenticity. No final-paragraph moralizing; mentor’s aphorisms are dramatized through objects that Lena reinterprets. Ambiguity lingers: who finds the cranes remains unknown, keeping theme porous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Lena; perceptual signature is metalsmith-sensory: weight of silver, tremble of copper foil, ink-needle prick. Diction is precise yet lyrical—“constellations long dead,” “grief coiled tight as wire”—without register drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk nil. Psychic distance tightens under stress: short clauses at “She smiled, just slightly.” Patterned repetition of “genuinely artificial” is taught early and paid off, satisfying experimental allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and clipped beats that match folding/inking actions. No synonym loops; “crane” repeats with accreting meaning. Metaphors (wilted lily, curtains of intention) stay physically coherent. Information density high: single sentences fuse craft detail, memory, and emotional tilt. Minor scaffold: two near-identical “she left the first…second…third” lines could compress, but they serve cadence of ritual and do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of origami, astronomy, and jewelry-craft feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable; cranes as star-messages literalize “light from dead constellations.” Mentor’s oxymoron “genuinely artificial” is freshly re-inflected into communal endurance. Risk taken: grief resolved via dispersal rather than cathartic scene, but coherence holds. Not quite 9+ because the black-feather motif (while pretty) is the one image that feels mildly derivative of magical-realist trope; still, it is grounded in observatory bird lore.</comment>
