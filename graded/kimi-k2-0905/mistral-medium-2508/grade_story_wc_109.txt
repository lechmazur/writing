<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eldrin’s obsession with silence is embodied in the tactile handling of the booklet and his decision to let it scatter; the moment he “smiled and let the booklet slip” crystallizes a credible renunciation. Interiority is concrete—his fingers tracing gold leaf, the way night “pools”—but the contradiction between mapping and surrendering could be sharper in-scene. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A. The final stance is earned, yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral because his body/thoughts stay calm throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the booklet’s release reweights the premise—maps are erased, not drawn. Accumulative lens holds: each silence layers density until the last star blink charges the hush with cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“crumbling watchtower”), waiver applies. No causality break; the final image of “gold leaf…glinted once” is the visible price. Could nudge 9-land if the cost registered on Eldrin’s body or voice as well as concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm-scoured ridge fort is lived-in: wet-stone scent, salt-pocked walls, flaking gold caught in stone ridges—details constrain the final glint. Body-as-setting is strong: palm-on-stone transfers vigil echo to reader. Micro-setting (booklet) evolves from tool to relic to scattered leaves, charging the closure. No spatial drift; weather affects choice—storm’s passage permits the ultimate quiet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence be mapped without destroying it? Pressure tightens once—booklet hoarded → booklet released—narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (loss of map, loss of self) rather than visceral; visible but not felt on the body. Sufficient for this length, yet a tactile forfeiture (cut palm, breath frozen) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular silences—sword unsheathing, knees on stone—never abstractly named. Final image of night “already knowing its shape” offers non-literal answer to mapping obsession. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—was surrender victory or erasure? Resonant reconfiguration reweights earlier motifs without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: flaking gold as “gilded snow,” breath “curling into frigid air,” hush “amber and unbroken.” Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences mimic pooling quiet; final fragments mirror booklet scatter. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to Eldrin. Experimental compression (“his voice…was not a sound but a shape”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—gold leaf as snow, silence as wound/cradle—without mixed logic. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, body, and concept. Minor scaffold: “the way” repeats three times in mid-section; does not touch closure. Closure image crisp: “gold leaf…glinted once in the memory of light.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence as cartography, oracle as cartographer of absence. Booklet-of-silences is new artifact; star extinction as clock is familiar but reweighted through mapping lens. Risk-taking—lyric accumulation rather than causal plot—pays off in resonant closure. Could be more singular if Eldrin’s personal history leaked into the silences he collects.</comment>
