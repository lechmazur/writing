<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s face-blindness and methodical nature are embodied through tactile memory and the silver lance; the final beat—tucking the ribbon beside the sketched curve of her shoulder—shows a contradictory tenderness that costs him the comfort of forgetting. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The only slip: “learning to carry the weight” is slightly abstract; a more embodied cost would clinch 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quarry keeps its secrets, but Elias now carries an undeniable witness-cost signaled by the ribbon brushing his fingertips. Causal chain holds—ribbon arrival → descent → lance resonance → echo confrontation → sealed memory → forward motion. Orientation is swift; the mist-mouth image anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity; accumulative density tightens once when the lance brands the memory into metal, reweighting the stake from “unsolvable” to “silently carried.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quarry-as-wound, the lance-as-question, and the mist that thickens into struggling hands all constrain Elias’s tactile method and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys his blindness: cold seeping like guilt, metal humming in teeth. Spatial choreography is clean—steps down, crack between stones, ascent at dawn. One hairline slip: “town’s chimneys exhaling smoke like sighs” edges toward postcard, but the next line re-anchors through his scarf’s rough wool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he bear witness or erase again?—is signaled by the ribbon’s arrival. Mid-scene tightening: the lance brands the memory, foreclosing denial; the price is the burn in his palm and the irreversible internalization of her echo. Escalation is accumulative: mist → echo → vision → sealed brand. No reversal, but the single deepening satisfies the lens. Cost is visible and persistent; it shapes his next step toward the coughing child.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile witnessing: the unseen acquires weight only when the living consent to carry it. Subtext resides in the ribbon’s shift from anonymous scrap to portrait-sketch companion. Final image—ribbon brushing fingertips as he walks toward a new cough—reweights the premise: cold cases are not solved but inhabited. No moralizing; the cost is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, yet textured: “the quarry had been a ballroom once, before the flood that drowned the town’s joy along with its secrets.” Syntax mirrors Elias’s methodical mind—controlled caesuras, tactile verbs. No head-hopping; perception stays strictly within his sensorium. The slight elevation in “conceptual repricing” diction is licensed because the phrase arrives after the physical burn, aligning abstract insight with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or memory. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—metal hums, mist coils, quarry remembers—without spillage into mixed metaphor. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by forward motion that recharges the ribbon. One near-repeat: “the quarry wasn’t empty / the quarry kept its secrets” is acceptable echoic closure, not redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist who “paints” by lance and echo is a fresh synthesis; the lance-as-question-hook transforms standard investigator trope. Quarry-as-wound ballroom reconfigures Gothic ruin into social scar. Risk is high—lyric, tactile, almost mythic—but coherence holds. Slight deduction for familiar “unreachable mayor’s son” power structure; still, the story’s sensorial logic makes the trope feel specific rather than borrowed.</comment>
