<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Liora’s sensory-map interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between her compulsion to chase seams and her fear of erasure is dramatized in micro-choices (pocketing the shard, stepping through). The final renunciation—choosing to become the map—pays off earlier causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test. Minor slip: “the weight in her chest wasn’t fear” tells what the prior image already showed.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora’s choice to step through the seam reconfigures both her identity and the story’s rule-set (“she was the map now”) with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: shard triggers recognition → seam redirection → choice to stop looking → shard bifurcates → passage. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt; no artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<comment>Repair-bay micro-setting is tactile and selective—rusted girders, ozone grease, collapsed lift—each detail filtered through Liora’s sensory map. The shard and seam function as portable setting-objects that constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discover the weight of a withheld truth—tightens when the shard’s color flip proves the rewrite is real, forcing her final choice. Escalation is one meaningful turn under Causal lens; cost is legible (she forfeits fixed reality to become map). Could edge higher if an earlier concrete loss (tool, stamina) had altered tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as lived weave, not static object. Final image—“the universe bent to meet her”—reweights all prior shard/seam imagery without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue (“You left this behind” / “I left it for you”) carries implication, not declaration. Minor abstraction in “the weaving” phrase keeps it from 9+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthetic lattice, cyclical spontaneity, sensory-map diction. Rhythm modulates—compressed fragments under pressure (“The shard burned cold”), longer cadence at resonance. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels academic for Liora’s lexicon, but occurs in closing beat where thought may elevate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do world-building, interiority, and propulsion (“She pocketed the shard. The weight of it was wrong—not in grams, but in meaning.”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the final step without sacrificing clarity. Opening and closing lines both anchor and recharge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sensory cartographer + multiverse seam-ripping + shard as narrative knot. The “map that is endless” reconfigures familiar portal fantasy into epistemic choice rather than escape. Risk in lyric compression pays off—closure image is memorable, inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes; concept commits fully without retreat.</comment>
