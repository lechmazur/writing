<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is lyrically sketched but never crystallizes into a contradictory impulse under pressure; her “yes” to the orchard arrives pre-approved, so the final “We stay” feels like confirmation, not costly renunciation. Kael’s ghost edges toward stereotype of benevolent guide; his flicker is poetic but doesn’t force Liora into a choice that hurts. The collective turn from strangers to family is summarized across weeks, so the relational crucible stays off-stage and the personal cost stays abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the nebula becomes communal labor, not escape, and the warm bell + chalked “We stay” make the reweighting legible. Causality is soft-lyric (Accumulative/Textural): each chalk message and bell-ring adds density rather than narrows options, but the final image crystallizes the accrued pattern cleanly. Orientation is swift—arches, orchard, ghost arrive by line 6—so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating stone ribs, starlight fruit, and the brass bell supply tactile anchors that double as metaphors without stalling motion; the butterfly garden micro-setting hosts the pivotal bell-beat. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the curved shadows and warm brass at closure constrain the final gesture. The arches never physically impede or enable action, so environment hovers at mood rather than tactical constraint, capping entry to the 9 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can this place become respite?—is signaled early and deepens as more arrivals plant and ring. Escalation is accretive: each chalk line and repaired channel thickens texture rather than forecloses an option, but the final bell-ring reweights the stake from personal refuge to collective cradle. No visible price is exacted from Liora (no lost alternative, no bodily cost), so the tightening is felt conceptually, not viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—respite is built, not found—emerges through orchard labor rather than sermon. The nebula’s redefinition from escape to cooperative cradle is earned by communal gardening beats. Subtext stays implicit: chalked cracks = healed war trauma, bell warmth = earned belonging. Final “We stay” avoids moralizing; it’s a pledge whose cost is left as charged poise rather than dramatized loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cosmic-orchard register: “fruit pulsed with starlight,” “wings shimmered like shattered moons.” Syntax modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato final chalk line, mirroring the shift from wonder to commitment. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; the ghost’s reported speech stays stylized, fitting his mythic role. Perceptual signature remains Liora’s throughout, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional stacked similes (“wings… shattered moons”) risk purple tint yet stay within lyric contract taught by opening “ribs of a god.” Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths vary, final single-sentence paragraph lands as punch. No scaffolding, no filter-verb clutter; each image advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Altruistic-ghost-tends-post-war-orchard is fresh enough, and the nebula re-imagined as collective exhale avoids escapist cliché. Risk lies in the lyric-mythic mode itself; the piece commits fully, never retreating to ironic distance. Specificity of starlight fruit and brass bell etched with prior gardeners keeps the concept grounded. Could edge higher if the ghost’s backstory carried a sharper ethical thorn.</comment>
