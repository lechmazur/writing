<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The balladeer’s interior contradiction—translator of silence who now must choose to *absorb* or *release* the ghost-code—peaks when the bolt-plate sears his palm. His micro-choice to encode the “rest” symbol and slam the plate down is the earned pivot: it costs the ghost its exit and costs him the weight of unspoken songs. Emotion is embodied (heat, raw throat) without label-speak. The final image of boot-prints that *aren’t* there shows the sustained price under an Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the broken-line “rest” literally rewrites the courtyard’s graffiti OS, turning the entire premise—code as haunting—into a visible, felt shutdown. Causal lens holds: because he answers the ghost’s spiral-question with a rest-symbol, therefore the code unravels and the mist inverts. Persistent constraint: the radio crackles on, implying the next child-cycle has already begun. Cost is legible in the empty chalk and the print-less stone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard-as-server-room metaphor recurs and finally *crashes*, reweighting the setting from ethereal to systemic. Mist, ozone, and the bolt-plate’s pulse act as micro-setting that guides the encoding hand. Spatial choreography stays clean: ledge → graffiti → rip → plate-slam. The inversion of mist *upward* at closure reconfigures the vertical geography, tethering atmosphere to consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“silence vs. articulation of need”—tightens when the ghost demands *into*-him egress. One meaningful turn: the spiral-question forces him to choose between becoming vessel or silencer. Cost is visceral: palm-burn, raw throat, and the print-less stone that proves the path is now closed to *him* too. Agency drives escalation; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges as *translation is never neutral*: pressing flowers / pressing code both flatten living need into artifact. The bolt-plate’s cooling re-prices grandmother’s preservation ethic as possible complicity. Final image of child-reaching-for-chalk refuses moral comfort—next cycle looms. No tidy thesis; ambiguity is the point.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—sound as haptic (“wet silk between lightning and thunder”) and code as tactile flora—stays unique and biased to the seldom-heard ear. Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences build to the staccato of “He encoded. / With a stub of chalk.” Compression teaches itself early and pays off in the final “no echo at all.” No head-hopping; single POV remains locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative density spikes only at the climax (“chorus of screams wrapped in lullaby”) yet remains coherent under pattern already taught. Information density is high: one sentence can do setting-work *and* foreshadow closure (“ghost *in code*”). Final line’s monosyllabic thump (“no echo at all”) gives cadence-release without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” marries folk-ballad past (flower-press) to cyber-ghost present, a synthesis not seen in slush. Risk: turning graffiti into executable code and the lightning-thunder gap into literal compiler clock could feel gimmick, yet every metaphor is grounded in sensory action (chalk grooves, ozone). The tinkersong wonder tone commits fully; no retreat to safer realism. Child-circle reboot at end makes the concept recursive rather than consumable.</comment>
