<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s shift from passive archivist to active medium is embodied and earned: the diary-burn at the end carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete—“salt-stung air,” “pulse hammered in his throat”—and contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) act simultaneously in-scene. The final renunciation is foreshadowed by every micro-choice with the shells and locket, satisfying causality. Flaws: “thirty years as a civil-rights archivist” is told-only, never tested under pressure; no secondary character pressure on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: diary pages dissolve into the black lagoon, reweighting “truth” from archive to release with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: diary → visions → shell pattern → officers retreat → release. Orientation anchors by line 3; disorientation is taught early (retroactive visions) and paid off at closure. One lens—Causal—dominates; no ambiguity at end. Minor slip: the officers’ retreat is slightly too easy, but the lagoon’s reflection of “a hundred hands” keeps the cost legible.</comment>

<comment>The obsidian lagoon constrains the final choice—its thick, story-heavy water literally swallows the archive, charging the closure image. Zeppelin library provides altitude-as-resource, letting Elias choose aerial neutrality vs. ground risk; the skiff descent is a tactical use of setting. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—brass groans, ozone scent—never tourist catalog. Micro-objects (locket, shell spiral) evolve from prop to code to offering, mirroring theme. Gate met: lagoon reweights meaning at end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“bury or release truth”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when Revision Board appears. One meaningful escalation: shell pattern parley that forecloses capture and forces Elias to burn the diary, paying visible cost. Agency is continuous: arrange debris, wade, release pages. Coincidence (officers’ retreat) is complicating, not resolving; lagoon’s rippling hands keep pressure supernatural-not-lucky. Cost is legible: loss of future evidence, irreversible act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—“some truths must be dissolved, not filed”—emerges through image chain: ink bleeding → salt-stung visions → black mirror swallowing text. No moralizing; final smile is earned by prior embodied struggle. Subtext in shell code: archival method turned anti-archive weapon. Ambiguity lingers: was retreat tactical or supernatural? Resonant reconfiguration: lagoon becomes living archive, Elias becomes current not curator.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, POV-bound: “brass hull groaning like an old man’s bones,” “ink bleeding into the shape of screams.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress—short clauses during officers’ approach. Register stays within Elias’s lexicon; no academic drift. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: officer’s “trespassing on restricted memory” vs. Elias’s silent shell answer. Pattern of marine/salt imagery taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences do triple duty (“The water was warm, thick with the weight of stories never told”). Metaphors are consistent—liquidity, salt, mirrors—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for drift, staccato for skiff descent. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold: “pulse hammered in his throat” is familiar, but occurs pre-closure and doesn’t dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: civil-rights archive + retro-cognitive coastal noir + aerial steampunk, welded by shell-cipher code. Risk—burning the evidentiary text—pays off conceptually. Lagoon as living archive feels inevitable in hindsight; no late rule change. Specificity: obsidian water that swallows light, brass zeppelin groan—details not transferable to generic settings. Avoids safety middle: chooses dissolution over preservation, loss over victory.</comment>
