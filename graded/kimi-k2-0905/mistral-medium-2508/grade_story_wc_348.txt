<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority—engineering brain meeting grief—stays particular (“symphonically minded brain finally hearing the music”). The micro-choice to wade in and release the chrysalis crystallizes a decade of survivor-guilt and is paid for by the cold bite through boots: embodied cost on the page. Contradictory impulses (engineer’s urge to build vs. need to let go) act simultaneously inside one continuous beat. The girl’s arrival tests his new stance and he passes, proving the renunciation is real.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens: every beat flows “because/therefore” from the found chrysalis to the riverbank release. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (water’s edge, present-tense kneeling). The Decisive Change—he relinquishes the last relic and steps into the current—carries unmistakable cost: the cold bite, the pocket now empty, the sister’s scar finally un-housed. No prop teleport; chrysalis, boots, notebook trace cleanly. Closure image (“where the ravine’s paths became one”) reweights the opening premise that separation is failure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The braided ravine is not backdrop; its converging channels supply the final metaphor that reconfigures Elias’s grief. Selective sensory detail—foam like “forgotten sheet music,” stone “brittle as the last letter”—filters through an engineer-poet’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → pocket → wade → place → sit → girl appears upstream. The empty chrysalis functions as movable micro-setting whose final exposure to light and water charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform survivor-guilt into permission to keep living. Pressure tightens once: from static atonement (building bridges) to active dissolution (releasing chrysalis). The renunciation forecloses the last tangible link to his sister, paid immediately by the shock of cold water and the girl’s witness. Cost is visible, but the escalation is a single crest; no secondary reversal, so tension plateaus rather than peaks again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete return: “The strongest connections are the ones that know how to come undone.” No abstract sermon; the insight is handwritten after Elias feels the water undo his grief knot. Subtext lives in gesture—placing the chrysalis on the convergence stone rather than keeping or destroying it. Final image (“the ravine’s paths became one”) answers the opening fear of divergence without stating a moral, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style stays inside an engineer-poet’s idiom: “Fibonacci unfurling,” “lattice of a polymer chain.” Rhythm modulates—long sentence for river-braiding, clipped fragments at “A pause.” No head-hop; girl’s voice is reported, not interiorized. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a polymer chemist who sees music in foam. Final line cadence mimics water convergence, earning stylistic payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one line can paint grief, material science, and motion (“papery walls brittle as the last letter”). Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “composer writing in haste” is sustained through “missed note,” “sheet music,” “sustained note.” One minor scaffold: “He’d spent years...” paragraph opens with near-repeat of earlier “decade” summary, but propels to new insight. No artifacts in the closing beat; final sentence is clean, rhythmic, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: biodegradable polymer scaffolds + butterfly chrysalis + braided river as shared metaphor for engineered ephemerality. Risk: lyric engineering grief-portrait rather than plot, but coherence holds. Specific detail—“carbon weaves strong enough to span fractured cities”—grounds the concept. Not quite 9+ because the emotional arc, while piercing, follows a recognizable template of “release object, release grief.”</comment>
