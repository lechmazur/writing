<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from profit calculator to quiet benefactor is legible; the locket hand-off crystallizes a value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“pieces clicking into place” vs. abstract guilt). Yet the librarian’s contradictory impulses are only asserted (“You’re a broker, not a saint”) rather than dramatized in-scene, keeping the relationship crucible one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: mis-delivered locket → recognition → partnership offer → shared covert charity. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias accepts a slimmer ledger as cost, shown in the final cigarette beat. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. The tightening turn (midnight meeting) is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Salt-kissed breeze, lantern on silver hair, oleander shadow—details are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final smoke-under-stars image. Library courtyard geography stays coherent; no white-room risk. The setting does not actively constrain tactics, so the 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere supports the soft pivot from commerce to compassion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to repay unnoticed kindness—surfaces early and escalates through the locket reveal and the clinic rerouting plan. One meaningful tightening at the midnight meeting narrows his profit path. Cost is conceptual (ledger imbalance) rather than viscerally felt, keeping the score just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “quiet reciprocity” emerges through oranges, mended spines, and mis-routed gifts rather than exposition. Final image of smoke curling into stars reweights the opening symphony silence, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue (“You’re the one who repairs…”) carries the history. No motif feels grafted; all grow from the broker’s perceptual lens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s shrewd, sensory noticing; no head-hop. Syntax modulates—long cadence for crowd scan, clipped fragments at midnight reveal. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext; voices remain distinct (his wry vs. her guarded). No register drift or filter-verb clusters under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean: “ledger balanced a little less neatly” does double duty—financial and moral. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional lyrical lift (“music in the spaces between the notes”) is earned by prior acoustic motif. Rhythm breathes with scene shifts; final sentence lands on stressed monosyllable for hush effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Compassion-through-logistics feels fresh; the cargo broker’s professional toolkit repurposed for covert charity is a specific synthesis. The locket coincidence is allowed because it complicates rather than resolves. Risk is moderate—quiet pivot, not twist—but specificity of dockworker clinic, oranges, mended books keeps it from template territory.</comment>
