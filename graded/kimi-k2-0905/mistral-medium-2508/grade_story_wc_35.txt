<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—needing to ingest grief yet fearing dissolution—drives every beat; the final “clean” tongue is embodied cost. Micro-choices (pouring the vial, lingering palm) reveal hierarchy: caretaker duty > self-preservation. One slip: “unburdened silhouette” is told, not embodied, keeping this just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each sensory memory adds weight until the single act of pouring reverses the tide; the final “couldn’t taste a thing” is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; causal chain (ingest→refine→return→release) never breaks. No plot amnesia; vial, knife, pavilion track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert-fortress rain, coral veins, and briny condensation are filtered through Elias’s palate-biased perception; the tidal pool literally guides the climactic hand. Environment constrains the choice—only the pavilion’s ice can accept the distilled regret—charging the final image. Micro-setting (warm knife, amber vial) doubles as tactile crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Elias drown in ingested remorse or transmute it? Pressure intensifies via accretion of tasted grief; the pour is the single tightening that forecloses the “keep carrying” option. Cost is visceral: metallic aftertaste vanishes, replaced by hollow “clean,” a loss of identity trace. No coincidence; all escalation is metabolically earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of vicarious atonement emerges from the palate metaphor; no abstract statement required. Subtext in “knife no longer warm” whispers relinquished violence. Final image reweights the premise: absolution tastes like nothing, a chilling conceptual repricing. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “someone had to tend the grief.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s synesthetic perception; syntax grows salt-crusted and elliptical under pressure. “Memory served rare, still bleeding” is character-specific idiom, not writerly flourish. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses to breath-level in the pavilion. Voice modulates from gustatory lushness to stark “clean” without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors gustatory intake—long, mouth-filling clauses early, short palate-cleansers at exit. No loops; each image ingests then yields place. Figurative density is high but patterned (taste→temperature→texture) and pays off in final tastelessness. One near-miss: “sandstone walls glistening under a moon that hung too low” edges purple yet survives as POV-true.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Memory-chef who cures regret by literally tasting then refining it is a fresh synthesis of culinary and penitential tropes. Pavilion as glacial confessional under dunes feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk: magic system could collapse into whimsy, but metabolic logic (ingest→distill→submerge) grounds it. Specificity of “coral veined with fossilized grief” prevents generic fantasy drift.</comment>
