<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is razor-specific: the scale-patch on her wrist, the compulsive thumb on the emerald swatch, the moment she tears the ledger page and watches the ink vanish. Twin-loss grief is rendered as corporeal ritual, not label-speak. The final choice—to stay and become gate-keeper—grows straight from her established obsession with “narrative threads” and costs her the escape she could have taken. Her flaws (guilt, compulsive story-weaving) drive every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each mirror-touch, ink-transfer, and name-erasure tightens options until the sister steps through. Closure is a Charged Poise—the garden door opens, but Liora renounces exit to pull others home; cost is the ship sinking under her feet. One soft spot: first 110 words delay spatial anchor in favour of lyric catalogue; fog-groan and rust-stripe teach the surrealism early enough to waive penalty, but clarity still wobbles briefly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Every descriptor is sensory and utilitarian: carnival lights reflect in mirror shards that later cut the portal, salt-rust smell clings to the ledger Liora steals. The ship’s decayed geography (carousel, hall of mirrors, captain’s cabin) is mapped through her body—stairs groan under her weight, mirrors ripple when touched. Environment is literally the antagonist; its collapse forces the final renunciation. Micro-setting (emerald card, ink-less paper) constrains the magic rules and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve erased twin—signals in paragraph two and escalates via irreversible acts: page torn, ink drunk, ship sacrificed. One meaningful tightening: when the blanked ledger page becomes portal fuel, the only path is to anchor her sister’s name in living narrative; escape window closes as hull floods. Cost is visible—Liora forfeits her own exit, stays to tend garden of names. Luck never rescues; fog-faces scream complication, not solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation-through-story emerges from concrete magic: ink must be re-narrated, not merely mourned. Subtext carries in gesture—pressing colour to hollow chest restitches identity without declaring “this is memory.” Final image of emerald threads weaving new names reframes earlier cotton-candy rot as seedbed rather than loss. No moralising; resonance hangs on the unsaid roster of twins still waiting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, mythic, yet idiosyncratic: “rusted heart finally still, lights flickering out like forgotten stars.” Patterned elision (no articles, stacked noun phrases) taught in opening sentence and sustained, paid off in final cadence. Perceptual signature—Liora clocks colour saturation, scale-sheen, ink smell—remains consistent under stress. No head-hop; single POV holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High-density lyricism without filler: one sentence shifts setting, stakes, and tactile detail (“The card drank the ink like a thirsty ghost, the name bleeding into its fibres until the paper was blank”). Rhythm accelerates into fragment bursts as ship sinks, then widens for garden coda. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Register stays inside fairy-tale diction, never drifts into academic gloss. Closure line—“It was a door”—earns its monosyllabic punch by contrast.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Takes the over-familiar “ghost ship” and “erased twin” tropes and fuses them through ink-as-narrative biochemistry: the ledger page is literally digested by colour. Garden of forgotten names is fresh afterlife topology. Risk of lyric overload is embraced but controlled by rigid object logic (swatch, card, mirror, page). Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no element could swap out without collapsing spell mechanics.</comment>
