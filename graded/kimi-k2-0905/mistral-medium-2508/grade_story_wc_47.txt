<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—yearning for hush yet handing the pendant away—are dramatized in embodied beats (kneeling, pressing moss, unclasping). Micro-choices under pressure reveal her hierarchy of values: silence > reputation > symbol. Cost is visible when she relinquishes the talisman, accepting perpetual exposure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; thought stays concrete and image-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the cathedral-of-moss setting accretes meaning until the final pendant transfer reweights the premise. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no drift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s loss and moss’s gain reprice “wound” as soil. Cost is legible—“I’ve got the moss” concedes lifelong vulnerability in exchange for shared growth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Environment-body-tool triad: server-rack grave, pendant burn, moss scent each constrain choice. Micro-setting (pendant at throat → Javier’s neck) drives the transfer beat. Sensory economy favors green bitterness and damp concrete; no filler visuals. Final image charges setting: pendant on new skin, moss in old rack—wound becomes vessel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake established early: can silence be rebuilt after viral exposure? Tightening occurs when Lena cedes the pendant—she surrenders her last acoustic shield, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural: each moss transplant thickens the garden’s hush and her public nakedness. Cost is felt; no reversal, but option foreclosure satisfies accumulative drive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vegetal reclamation metaphor: confession as compost, shame as loam. No explicit sermon; meaning accrued via fern-filled racks and pendant circulation. Final image answers the thematic question—silence is not kept but shared through vulnerable cultivation. Complexity intact: growth requires staying exposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Lena’s perceptual bias—drip rhythm, moss scent, pendant warmth. Compression taught early (“cathedral of moss”) and maintained; no template cadence. Dialogue minimal, natural—“What do I do with it?” carries subtext of consent to vulnerability. Voice modulation under pressure: shorter, breath-cut sentences at pendant hand-off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work (“amber depths holding something ancient and unbroken”). No paraphrase loops; each line advances stance or image. Metaphor vehicles stay vegetal and coherent. Minor register lift in “cathedral” is earned by sustained consecration imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Post-digital ruin garden is fresh lens on cancel-culture aftermath; viral confession transmuted into soil chemistry. Pendant-as-acoustic-shield is non-obvious tech. Risk: quiet ending without revenge or redemption—stakes stay internal but legitimate. Specificity of icicle-drip language and server-rack planters prevents swap test failure.</comment>
