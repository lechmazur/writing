<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lydia’s contradictory pulls—guilt, filial loyalty, investigative drive—are palpable in every micro-choice: cuff-link twist, ledger stroke, breath-fog on the dome. The embodied tremor when she reads “V. Estate” crystallizes internal conflict without label-speak. Her final decision to run the exposé costs her the last illusion of paternal integrity; the pen-nib’s warmth in her palm is the tangible price. Minor dock: the caretaker’s “new beginnings” toast is too generic, muting the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: because the journalist doubts → Lydia audits → plates arrive → she rewrites tomorrow’s front page. Orientation locked by word 80; observatory acoustics anchor who-where-when. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the *Chronicle*’s integrity reborn, her father’s myth burned. One hairline slip: the tin box arrives via off-stage stranger, a micro-convenience that keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brass telescopes, dome glass, and echoing acoustics are not backdrop but forensic tools: every creak and clink is data for the devotedly observant heir. The rosewood nib becomes micro-setting—handled, warmed, dipped—its changing state tracking Lydia’s rising resolve. Final image of steam curling like comet trails re-weights the observatory itself as a place of terrestrial rather than celestial discovery. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—does the *Chronicle* live or lie?—tightens twice: ledger reveals father’s betrayal; plates prove arson. Escalation is causal and knowledge-driven; each new document forecloses the “bury the story” option. Visible price: filial myth sacrificed. Could use one earlier obstacle (legal threat, deadline clock) to push into 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—“orbits of regret can be broken”—emerges through concrete pattern: circular ledger vs. linear nib-stroke that ends the orbit. Subtext lives in silence: the caretaker’s clink, the flinch of the mayor’s secretary. Final line offers resonant re-pricing without sermon. Minor echo of “orbit” verges on thematic label but is saved by tactile callback.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, telescopic, ink-scented: “the ghost of the moon,” “regret was an orbit.” Syntax mirrors Lydia’s calibration—controlled subordinate clauses, sudden fragment (“Her stomach twisted.”). No head-hop; psychic distance tightens from panoramic to nib-point. Meets 9+ gate: perceptual signature distinct under pressure, pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances ledger, atmosphere, or stake. Metaphors are coherent (orbit, steam-comet) and physically rooted. Minor scaffold: “the way…” anaphora twice in paragraph 2; paraphrase loop on “proof by contradiction” explanation. Does not touch closure; stays above artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: investigative noir staged in an astronomical observatory, using stargazer tools for forensic accounting. “Orbits of regret” as literal orbit-mechanic conceit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—solemn playfulness tone—mostly earns its keep; the tea-clink toast is the one safe note. Not quite a 9 because the journalist/plates arrivals lean on familiar investigative beats.</comment>
