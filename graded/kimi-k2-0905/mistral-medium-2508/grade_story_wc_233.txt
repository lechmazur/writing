<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The queen’s interior contradiction—sovereign duty versus childhood pact—is dramatized in the grotto; the final surrender is foreshadowed by her refusal to answer the priest’s scroll, so the cost feels earned. Embodied emotion (“bones hummed with the weight of stars”) keeps the epiphany physical, not therapeutic. No second character on the page, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV interiority stays coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she ignored the warning ∴ the grotto collects its debt, and because she kneels ∴ she is transfigured. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—her shadow on the wall is literally rewritten in crimson—so the price is on the page. Orientation is anchored by word 43 (“the ridge a jagged spine above the clouds”) and the pattern of returning dreams is taught early; no penalty. The final image reconfigures the throne’s meaning without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt stone, violet fireflies, and copper-tasting air are tactile and bias-filtered through the queen’s fatigue and wonder. The ridge’s thin air and breathing rock constrain her pace and force the final kneel; environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting (starlight pooled in palm) functions as the tool that rewrites her body, satisfying the 9+ gate. No geographic drift; spatial choreography is clean from mist to fissure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal survival versus cosmic claim—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the priest’s scroll is burned. One meaningful tightening: the violet fireflies’ shift from guides to teeth narrows escape options under her feet. Cost is legible—she forfeits flesh for constellation status—and is shown, not declared. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her own childhood bargain drives the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from the image of bleeding starlight rather than thesis: memory as a deferred wound that must finally be paid. Subtext operates in the nurse’s lullaby returning as the fireflies’ silver-edged song—an unspoken comment that home comfort was always complicit. No final-paragraph moralizing; the closing sentence reweights “warning” as something the priests misdirected at the wrong target. Ambiguity lingers: was she claimed or remembering herself?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lush yet compressed, with rhythmic control (“pulse of crimson light seeping… staining the sky like a wound”) that escalates to the short, gutted final whisper. Diction stays within a monarch’s poetic register without drifting into purple; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (light/needle/wound). No dialogue, so those bullets waived. Perceptual signature is specific to her authority—she “commands the mist to part”—and degrades under star-fire.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Almost every sentence carries double duty (image + causality): “her breath measured, her will softly commanding the mist to part” advances climb and character. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor logic stays coherent (starlight as honey, then as needle). One hairline slip—“the dreams would not let her rest” is a cliché seed—but it is buried early and does not touch closure. Density is high yet lucid; final line is crisp and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>The bargain-with-memory star-cave is familiar, but the inversion that the grotto is not taking but remembering feels fresh and is grounded in the childhood whisper. Fireflies-as-violet-teeth transforms a pastoral motif into threat without gimmick. Specific detail—“cobalt stone,” “copper and old magic”—anchors the concept in sensory rather than generic fantasy. Risk in lyric compression heightens coherence; the premise commits fully to metamorphosis.</comment>
