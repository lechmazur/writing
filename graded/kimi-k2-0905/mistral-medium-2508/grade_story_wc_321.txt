<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lira’s wry, practiced calm under multi-dimensional pressure feels lived-in; the hourglass-as-vacuum neatly externalizes her vocation. Micro-choices (flipping the glass, kneeling to press it to deck) show hierarchy of values—ferry first, self second. “Next stop, the one after this one” crystallizes her earned stasis with smiling cost. No interior contradiction in scene keeps her from 9.0, but resilience never wobbles, so struggle reads slight.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: rising sand and sealed grotto reweight the rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern repetition (starlight, hourglass, radio) tightens until the cadence snap. Causality intact: hourglass fed over years pays off in the merge; no late rule changes. Cost is legible—“I remember both lives”—and persistent constraint (ferry still transient) shapes future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Grotto ceiling, bioluminescent algae, liquid-silver water—selective sensory hits that guide alignment steering. Starflower plucked from air in closing image acts as micro-setting that charges final beat. Spatial choreography clean: rail, deck, wheel, hourglass tracked without drift. Tool/hourglass constrains choice twice, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—get everyone “threaded” before grotto collapse—broadcast early and tightened by radio countdown. Escalation is density-driven: ghost passenger materializes, ceiling patterns snap, water turns silver; each layer raises felt cost. Agency remains Lira’s; she feeds hourglass and merges lanes under pressure. Price legible: grotto seals, passengers carry dual memories, ferry stays unmoored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: transience as resilience, not loss. Hourglass filling upward re-prices time as buoyant, not depleting. Dual-memory passenger embodies non-binary identity motif—memory can hold multitudes. Final grinning line resists moral, offers Charged Poise that invites reflection on perpetual motion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is salted-mariner lyrical: “blade through silk,” “starlight pulsed like schools of fish.” Compresses without scaffold—every coil of rope or crackle of radio does double duty. Perceptual signature steady: Lira notices time, patterns, passenger edges. No head-hop; diction stays within her weathered lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: long languid clauses in calm, staccato quotes under deadline. Figurative language kept to ~30% and always purposeful—“constellations rewriting themselves” teaches pattern logic. No mixed metaphors; “vacuum hungry for loose threads” tracks physically. Minor filter verbs (“she knew”) accepted as interior seam; no loops or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—phantom ferry between worlds—made fresh via upward-filling hourglass and starlight-as-fabric image. Transient- as-strength stance feels non-obvious synthesis. Risk in lyric non-linear structure pays off with coherent closure. Not quite 9.0 because core device (time-slipped boat) is recognizable despite inventive mechanics.</comment>
