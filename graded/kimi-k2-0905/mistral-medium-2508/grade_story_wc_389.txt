<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory hunger for prophecy and terror of being devoured by it is embodied in every beat; the soldering-iron seal and the smile that follows show a micro-choice that costs him his remaining doubt. Interiority stays concrete—radio static “slithered… wet and warm”—never abstract. The final image of the taller, doubt-free reflection crystallizes the earned split: he has become the prophet by excising the listener. No other characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV depth is exemplary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every transmission tightens the vice (“You are the hinge…”) therefore Elias reinforces the portico therefore the reflection steps through. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the receiver swallowed, silence purchased, city rising—so the before/after is legible. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“observatory,” “mountain,” “storm”). No causal breaks; even the portico-as-door rule is seeded early and paid off when the glass drinks the receiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt portico is not backdrop; its temperature, pulse, and final ingestion constrain every tactical choice. Storm above clouds supplies ozone taste and lightning countdown, narrowing perception to the glass surface. Observatory’s altitude justifies the radio array and the city-shadows rising below. Micro-setting—the crack widening “like a scream”—directly forces the sealing action that triggers climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—become prophet or stay listener—tightens with each transmission until the crack forces a choice. Escalation is causal: louder voices therefore reinforced portico therefore sacrificed receiver. Cost is visible: the silence he buys is “worse than the static,” and the city’s spires are “bones of old gods.” One meaningful turn suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—prophecy as self-surgery—emerges from the soldering iron and the scalpel-dawn image, never stated. Subtext whispers in the portico’s pulse and the silhouette’s extra fingers. Final reconfiguration: dawn is not knife but scalpel, reweighting earlier dread into surgical triumph. Ambiguity lingers—whose city is rising?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed, lyric, yet precise: “storm didn’t howl—it whispered” teaches the pattern and holds. Diction—“jury-rigged from salvaged war tech”—is POV-bound, never generic. Rhythm accelerates under pressure: single-word sentence “And doors could be locked. / Or opened.” No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean. Final laugh is unhinged yet credible under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, causal, metaphoric without clog. No paraphrase loops; “cobalt” recurs only when its meaning mutates. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors across climax, each distinct. One mixed moment—“storm became a crown”—is earned by prior storm-personification. Proofing clean; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Radio-prophet trope is retooled: the future is not received but soldered shut. Portico as both lens and door fuses tech and mysticism without exposition. Risk—prophet self-assembles from scrap myth—pays off in the taller reflection. Specificity of “cobalt veins pulsing” prevents generic fantasy. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
