<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Chen’s contradiction—disbelief in fate yet scripting destinies—peaks when he palms the microdot to the girl: a micro-choice that costs him his lighthouse and twenty-year identity. Interiority stays concrete (“trembled…ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce”) and bodily (“pressed his forehead to the glass”). The final renunciation is earned: the ticket stub he himself once wrote becomes the prophecy he now obeys, visible cost in the darkened tower. Slight loss: we never see the specific moment he decides to trust the girl; the leap feels slightly outline-sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Chen boards the train, lighthouse dark for the first time—an undeniable social/identity cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: fortunes, film, and beacon form a density pattern that reweights at the final “one way. No refunds.” Causality holds because every beat (film hand-off, ticket authorship, incense smoke) is a prior textured loop that re-prices the exit. The cost is visible in the last fortune tucked in the doorframe: the island will keep speaking, but his voice is now elsewhere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse tower, brass-lined study, and Fresnel lens are not backdrop—they constrain every move: the beam’s blade-like sweep limits how long Chen can safely copy specs; the spiral stairs enforce the single exit that lets the girl arrive unobserved. Inkwell, joss paper, and salt-soaked oilskin coat create a tactile micro-setting that charges the final incense curl. Spatial choreography is clean: fisherman → pocket slip → study desk → doorframe fortune. Only the mainland lab remains abstract, but that off-stage vagueness serves the “open secret” concept rather than breaks it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep the sonic-weapon specs circulating while staying deniable. Escalation is textural: each fortune slip adds density until the ticket he once authored becomes the tightening noose—his own aphorism forecloses escape. Agency is crystallized when he chooses to hand the film to the girl rather than destroy it; that single trade-off (“Give it to the man at the third stall”) costs him exile. Cost is visible on-page: the lighthouse goes dark, his exile ticket stamped “No refunds.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fortune-cookie paradox: knowledge that pretends to be random yet shapes fate. Subtext resides in ink viscosity, incense smoke, and train rhythm—each a “hum you ignore” that later sings your name. Final image reweights the premise: the open secret was never concealment but recognition that the echo *is* the voice. No moral is stated; the ticket stub’s blunt economy is the thematic answer.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is a hushed, oracle-like free indirect stream—syntax elongates then snaps (“Chen didn’t believe in fate. He believed in open secrets.”) Rhythm mirrors lighthouse rotation: long sentences build, then blade-cut fragments. Perceptual signature is Chen’s synesthetic ink (“heavier than soy sauce”) and salt-slick auditory backdrop (“creak of the lighthouse stairs”). No dialogue, hence no convergence; interior diction stays within an aging scribe’s plausible lexicon. Compression under stress is flawless: “One way. No refunds.” reads like a metallic click.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative load is high but patterned early—“beam sliced through the dark like a blade” teaches the cutting motif, later reprised in sonic shattering. No mixed metaphors; each image extends the lighthouse/optic axis. Scaffolding is minimal: one paraphrase loop (“the way you…”) is purposeful anaphora, not artifact. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward the final metallic stub. Copy-error clean: tense stable, pronouns anchored, no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing Chinese fortune-craft with Cold-War microdot espionage is fresh synthesis; neither trope dominates. The “accidentally prophetic” trait is flipped into engineered ambiguity.Transformation test fails if Chen is swapped with any generic spy—his ink-stained Taoist contradiction is irreplaceable. Risk: lyric elliptical structure could have obscured stakes, yet closure keeps resonance legible.</comment>
