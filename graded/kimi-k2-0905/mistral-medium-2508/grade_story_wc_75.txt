<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s fear of erasure and her grandmother’s lens-handling muscle memory give her a crisp internal engine; the moment she smashes the lens is a credible, trait-driven rupture. The baker’s ash-dusted wrinkles and the boy’s spider-web voice supply quick, embodied secondary pressure. No contradiction drags on the final choice, though the beekeeper’s absorption is told not dramatized, keeping her arc a notch below full complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shattered emerald shards pulsing in the case reweight the rules—art survives only by re-incorporation into living hands, not by preservation behind glass. Causal chain holds: lens reveals loss → bread re-taught → lens destroyed → recipes reclaimed, each step tightening options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the irreversible destruction of the city’s single “archive” and in Liora’s sliced palms carving dough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The waterfall’s spray-painted lichen, oven heat warping air, and honey-coloured comb return as micro-settings that physically constrain tactics: steam teaches dough, spray erodes stone, colour guides rescue. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Liora notices sound, damp, and light in curator’s order. Final image of emerald splinters glowing “like stars” inside the museum wood charges the closure with an environmental echo that cannot be swapped out.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue of dissolving cultural memory—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the clumsy “K” loaf foreshadows total loss. One meaningful turn: lens-to-oven transfer rewrites the bread alphabet, foreclosing the safe path of mere guardianship. Cost is visible—irreplaceable lens sacrificed, fingertips bloodied—meeting the 8+ band requirement, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without abstraction: cultural memory survives not as relic but as ritual reinscription in dough and water-steam. Subtext hums in gesture—the boy’s dry loaf as funeral offering, the baker’s “tombstone” letters—never named as “heritage.” Final repricing reframes the museum from mausoleum to hearth, delivering a resonant answer that avoids moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Curator-perceptual signature steady: synaesthetic slide of emerald into taste, precise lexicon of ovens and archives. Rhythm modulates—long, mist-laden cadences in grotto, staccato runs as Liora sprints. No head-hop; free-indirect stays inside Liora’s sensory filter. Dialogue minimal, idiomatic, class-true (“tombstones”), no convergence at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length varies, paragraph cuts carry new knowledge or charge. No scaffold loops; only two near-metaphors per beat, each paid off (“lichen glowed like old regret” mirrored in shard-stars). Information density high—one sentence often does description + interior tilt + foreshadowing. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not on-page, so spared penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The beekeeper-opera-lens / waterfall-grotto / initial-bread triad is a fresh synthesis; no extant template carries this exact cultural-erasure engine. Risk in smashing the sole sci-fi artifact succeeds because the re-pricing reframes the museum itself as living tissue. Specificity—“twisting dough into the initials of the dead”—anchors originality in tactile ritual. Concept holds unity: every element feeds the steam-to-memory metabolism.</comment>
