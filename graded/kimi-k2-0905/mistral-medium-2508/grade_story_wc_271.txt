<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—grief’s pull to freeze versus the arboretum’s invitation to grow—are dramatized through the photograph release and leaf-pluck, each micro-choice priced with bodily pain; the interiority stays concrete, eschewing labels. Her quiet talent is shown via tactile gardening savvy, not told. The Earned Stasis closure (letting the photo go, pocketing the leaf) is fully motivated by prior somatic beats and carries visible cost—she forecloses nostalgia’s loop and accepts an unguarded future. No stock therapy-speak intrudes; every emotional label is earned through sensory action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: salt wind, crumpled photo, cypress leaf accrue density until the final image reweights survival itself. Orientation anchors (Lena, cliff-side arboretum, present afternoon) appear by line 3; no ambiguity. Closure is a classic Charged Poise: photo suspended between earth and sea, leaf’s oil scent crystallizing the new stance—felt cost is the permanent loss of the static past. Causality is interior but coherent; each freeze/press ritual tightens the next, culminating in the release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arboretum is not backdrop but tool: stone wall for palm-press, cypress branch as photo-hook, fig trees demanding pruning—each element constrains Lena’s somatic choices and charges the final leaf-in-pocket image. Salt wind and tide integrate into the freeze ritual, grounding the trauma pause in bodily reality. Spatial choreography is spotless: tour group below, photo caught above, Lena’s path back to fig trees tracks cleanly. Sensory economy is lean yet vivid—olive-leaf rustle, citrus resin—never a tourist catalogue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Lena will remain frozen in grief or re-enter time—signals early and tightens through two somatic beats: palm-press overrides screams, photo release overrides clutch. Cost is visceral: the photograph’s departure is an irreversible forfeiture; leaf’s scent is a new, vulnerable aperture. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure escalates via texture accrual. The final pruning decision narrows her future to active caretaking, foreclosing perpetual stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: persistence of life amid irrevocable loss is argued through cypress older than drones, fig sap still willing to run. Subtext resides in silent gestures—photo left on branch, leaf rolled between fingers—never moralized. Final image reframes optimism not as denial but as realism rooted in continuing biomass. The resonant reconfiguration is the empty pocket beside the new leaf: space made, life admitted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers at sensory intimacy; perceptual signature is gardener’s—noticing resin veins, pruning scars, tide as irrigation clock. Syntax breathes with the freeze ritual: elongated sentences for held breath, staccato clause after release. No head-hopping; tour-group voices stay external, distorted by Lena’s ear. Diction stays inside her dermal lexicon: “fibrous with creases,” “oils perfumed the air”—no academic float.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is scaffold-free; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“ghost of foghorns,” “pearl of stillness”—each taught early and paid off in closure cadence. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on micro-turns (photo release, leaf pocketing). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes with sensory specificity, no boilerplate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Familiar trauma-recovery arc is retooled through gardener’s somatic lexicon and arboretum temporality drone-proofed by deep time. The photograph-as-bird misreading by tourist child turns cliché into fresh social sting. Cypress leaf replacing photo in pocket is a quiet but irreversible inversion of memory vs. biomass. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, yet coherence holds; the piece stakes its originality on sensorial precision rather than twist.</comment>
