<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lior’s interior contradiction—whimsical label vs. hunger for forbidden memory—drives every micro-choice; the moment he pockets the burning flake we see motive crystallize. Social perceptiveness is shown (baker’s shake, blacksmith’s cracked laugh) not told, and it later lets him read the village’s buried doubts as they spill out. The final refusal to finish the mural path is Earned Stasis: he pays with ongoing outsider risk, foreclosing the elders’ clean slate. Flaw: we never feel the flake actually scorch flesh; “burned” stays metaphor, softening cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: flake whisper → mandala test → void hand-dive → village chorus released; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unfinished square-mural re-weights meaning for the whole village, cost visible in the child’s first illicit line. Orientation clean by word 80; mist, grotto acoustics, present-tense chalk place us immediately. One micro-soft spot: the elders’ fear is asserted, not dramatized, so the societal stakes feel slightly grafted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics, mist viscosity, and chalk grit are returned to whenever Lior acts; environment literally guides his next mark. The flake’s glaze veins image the same branching that later appears in the mandala—an object-as-setting that charges closure. Lavender taste in the mist at the end reprises opening pigment, now re-scented as possibility, fulfilling the micro-setting gate. Spatial track never falters: knee, pocket, wall, square all remain legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to suppressed communal memory—surfaces early and escalates once: the mandala void forces a now-or-never plunge. That single beat meaningfully narrows Lior’s options (silence vs. revelation) and visibly costs him social insulation. Pressure coherence survives the lyric montage of village voices; the chorus is the off-page elders’ counter-pressure made audible. Could wish for one palpable consequence (threat, exhaustion) post-plunge, but the reconfigured square mural carries enough conceptual price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—meaning resides in un-scrubbed mess—emerges through image sequence: blurred wings → unfinished path → child’s stray line; no editorial thesis states it. Subtext operates in silence: Lior never lectures, only leaves gaps for others to violate. Final image of mist curling through his open window re-prices the premise: memory now leaks nightly, an irreversible social cost. Avoids 9-band only because village chorus risks symbolic overload, slightly diluting particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at lyrical distance yet keeps perceptual signature: Lior notices finger-smears, glaze veins, taste of lavender—artist’s sensory hierarchy. Syntax glides from short breathy fragments under flare-pressure to longer, open-window cadence at close, mirroring threat → acceptance. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Occasional elevated diction—“conceptual repricing,” “emergent hush”—fits a man who thinks in color and myth; register stays internally coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: one-word paragraph “Again?” snaps like chalk line; previous flowing sentences mirror mandala spirals. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; every sentence either advances image or stakes. Figurative layer is dense (almost every sentence metaphoric) but pattern-taught early (“mist coiled like a held breath”) and paid off at close, so density reads as design, not clutter. Minor hedge: “the kind of silence that wasn’t absence, but presence” is abstract; tightening to sensory pulse would sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of memory-erasure fantasy with chalk-art procedural feels fresh; the mandala as hacking device for civic amnesia is not a trope I’ve seen. Risk—lyric, near-allegorical tone—heightens rather than sugar-coats stakes. Specificity anchors originality: lavender pigment scraping under fingernails, glaze flake lighting like a strike-anywhere match. Hindsight test passes: only this artist, this grotto, this village could produce this arc.</comment>
