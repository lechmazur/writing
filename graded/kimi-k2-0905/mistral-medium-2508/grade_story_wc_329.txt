<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, body-anchored (“her bow trembling against the strings,” “bare feet sinking”); the locust shell pressed to her chest turns heartbeat into tactic, showing contradictory impulses (memories of old wonder vs mechanical present). Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: she risks statue detection to play, then chooses to plant the shell—cost is felt when statues dissolve and bridge cables fray. Final renunciation (leaving violin, walking into grove) earns its stasis through prior causal build; flaw is slight over-reliance on lyric summary in two lines that could be dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: statues melt into rooted soil, bridge cables give way to locust wings—conceptual repricing of mechanical world into living one, cost legible in the vanished sentinels and her aching arms. Accumulative lens holds: each image (brass gears, petal, shell) layers until pattern breaks with green shoot. Orientation anchored by line 4 (“rusted cables,” “enchanted orchard below”). No telegraphing; final hush is earned. Minor waiver: “she whispered” line edges toward overt thematic echo but is saved by locust shell’s prior weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is micro-setting-as-crucible: sky-bridge cables, oldest tree’s brass roots, and locust-shell-as-tool physically constrain her posture and sound transmission. Sensory hierarchy obeys wind-vs-strings urgency; scent of rain arrives only after rebirth, timed to emotional release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from bridge to soil without drift. One detail over-ornate (“shattered stained glass” wings) nudges toward purple but fits accumulative texture; still, environment directly shapes final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs mechanical order—signaled in first paragraph. Tightening occurs when ground cracks and green shoot appears: her music now risks statue retaliation, foreclosing silence/safety. Cost is visible: statues melt, bridge frays, her arms ache. Agency is attention and endurance rather than external victory; sufficient for lyric frame. Could use one earlier micro-loss (a string snaps?) to sharpen price, keeping it just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reversal of mechanical pastoral: gears into petals, oil into sap, statues into soil. No explicit thesis; final “you won’t have to ask” reweights shell and song as new covenant. Ambiguity lingers—will child or man truly change?—but orchard’s exhale provides concrete emotional aftertaste. Avoids sermon; only faint echo risk is “world had forgotten how to be beautiful” line, instantly redeemed by her choice to listen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric POV stays tight to violinist’s perceptual lens; no head-hop. Diction skews to tactile verbs (clung, trembling, sinking) matching bodily crisis. Rhythm accelerates with enjambed fragments during ground-split, then exhales into longer sentences—mirrors her heartbeat cadence. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she watched them rise, then turned”) but justified by need to reset gaze; voice remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer wind-howling, petal-brass, statue-hum. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new mechanical/living tension. Metaphors stay coherent (gears as dead skin, statues as soil). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“future was already blooming”). Minor rhythm echo in “she played… she played” could vary syntax, but propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cyber-orchid and violin insurgency feels fresh; no precedent for sky-bridge fiddler using locust-shell ECG to hack stone sentinels. Conceptual integrity commits full-tilt to biomechanical reversal without retreat. Risk—lyric overloading—pays off by making closure legible. Specific detail (brass roots weeping sap) prevents template feel; could not swap with generic forest. Transformation test passed: story collapses if setting de-mechanized.</comment>
