<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory translator/healer reflexes—simultaneous decryption and empathy—surface in every tactile micro-choice (coral pressed, cast traced, silence offered). The “shrewdly innocent” label becomes lived: her instant re-weighting of crayon smudges as dialect, her refusal to look up at the boy until she has re-coded his loss. Interiority stays embodied—no diagnostic speak—only ribs humming, breath fog, finger ridges on plaster. Final act of handing over the coral is a renunciation with visible cost: she forecloses her own talisman to stitch his shore, earned by every prior decryption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: coral transferred, cast smudges faintly glowing—“embers cupped” re-prices grief as portable luminescence rather than erasure. Causal lattice holds: each translation (radio static = sea echo, marker = embrace) tightens the single dominant stake—can grief be re-coded without falsifying loss? Accumulated pattern of tactile decrypting lands here; no late rule change. Cost is legible on-page: she relinquishes her last physical anchor from Mindanao, walks into mist unarmed. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; density, not reversal, reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: glass ceiling bruise, ivy like barbed wire, cool coils round ankles—environment mirrored inside her ribs. Coral fragment and plaster cast act as portable set-pieces; their grooves dictate finger choreography and constrain whether she keeps or gives. Spatial choreography is spotless—bench, shadow, pocket—no drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys medic-translator attention: radio static, saline odor, shrapnel ache. Final image of ember-glow smudges is charged by setting’s twilight fade—specificity indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can translation transmute grief without betrayal—tightens through two decrypting beats: cast, photo negative-space. No external antagonist; pressure is epistemic and moral. Each micro-turn raises cost: first she risks emotional overrun, then forfeits coral. Escalation is Accumulative: density of re-readings, not causal reversals. Final tightening is the boy’s white knuckles—proof that new meaning has grafted, stakes paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as translation-as-survival: every smudge, marker, static hiss re-priced from damage to dwelling. Subtext in gesture—handing coral = passing lexicon of endurance. No moralizing; final image of glowing embers offers non-literal answer: grief keeps its shape but becomes portable light. Ambiguity preserved—reader must decide whether “radio = sea” is consolation or sleight—complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-close POV stays locked; perceptual signature precise—translator ear hears silence as “held breath,” medic eye sees spiral as throat-constriction. Rhythm modulates: long clause for memory mortar-stutter, fragment when coral bites. No head-hop; boy’s interior inferred only through Lena’s decrypting gaze. Diction stays within war-zone medic lexicon—“shrapnel nested,” “phantom rifles.” Compression in final line “embers cupped” taught by earlier fog-breath; payoff clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors interlock: bruise-glass → violet/gold, ivy-barbed wire, coral-sea memory—no mixed vehicle. High density: “fingers tracing jagged edge of brain coral fragment—salvaged from wreckage off Mindanao” performs three jobs (tactile, backstory, occupation) in nineteen words. Closure line “embers cupped in careful hands” is precise, unclichéd, rhythmically cadenced. No scaffolding; even twilight colors earn their keep by charging final glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: war-zone translator retooled as grief-cryptographer, coral as Rosetta stone of loss. No prior story fuses medic-linguist craft with tactile decryption of children’s scrawls. Risk in quiet, lyric closure paid off—glow embers rewire entire palette. Specificity of Mindanao, mortar, radio static roots novelty in lived detail; transferable only with heavy loss of charge.</comment>
