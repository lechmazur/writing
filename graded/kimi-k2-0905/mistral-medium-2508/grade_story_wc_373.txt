<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory mix of filial loyalty and calculated vengeance is embodied in the trembling fob and the soft, almost kind laugh; the micro-choice to withhold trust from Veyne crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—salt-bleached planks, anise breath—never drifting into label-speak. The ending’s Earned Stasis (letting the harbor take Veyne while she walks away) forecloses revenge as identity with visible cost: she’ll carry silence like the fob. One hairline slip: “curiously steadfast gaze” is told once rather than shown through a distinct beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens is rock-solid: each beat tightens because/therefore—fob → routes offered → false ledger → betrayal moment → market justice. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “some debts weren’t meant to be paid in coin” reweights the entire truce-of-hush rule-set with undeniable social cost. The missing-bodies mystery is solved and paid for in the same beat the harbor claims Veyne; persistent constraint (market law of silence) shapes every tactic. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rotting pier and pirate market are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the slick planks force Lena’s crouch, the lanterns give her the light to flash the fob, the tide becomes executioner. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound—salt, tar, anise—never tourist catalog. The fob functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: tucking it back in pocket = acceptance of inherited silence. Weather/environment literally executes Veyne, charging the ending image.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Veyne realizes he’s outplayed. Cost is legible on-page: his slack face and the market’s held breath foreclose any future deals for Lena. Agency is decision, not violence; the harbor’s tide, not her knife, enforces the price. Persistent constraint (truce-of-hush law) shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ledger of silence: inherited debts, voiced only in gesture (fob flash, soft laugh). The final cigarette smoke is a conceptual reprise that reweights “sound of trust breaking” as something now internalized, not external. No tidy moral—Lena’s peace is with complicity, not absolution. Subtext in dialogue (“Time’s up”) carries double meaning that pays off without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Lena’s perceptual signature—salt-bleached planks, rosary-bead fingers, syrup-thick murmur—diction never leaks above her plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic buildup before the laugh, then staccato whispers. No head-hopping; Veyne’s interior accessed only through observable slack face. Voice remains coherent under peak pressure without syntactic gimmicks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—“ledger of fake debts, a map to a cache that didn’t exist” compresses weeks of prep into one clause. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Final line anchors closure image without overwriting: “smoke curling into the pale morning like a question no one needed to answer.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar revenge frame is inverted: protagonist’s victory is letting the market’s own code devour the antagonist, not personal violence. “Sound of trust breaking” as audible object is a fresh inflection that charges the fob and the cigarette smoke. Risk-taking in quiet ending pays off—no gunfire, only tidal justice. Slight deduction for pirate-market trope that remains fairly stock; specificity comes from Lena’s voice, not world mechanics.</comment>
