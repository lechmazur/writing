<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—“fingers tracing the doorknocker ring,” “stones in his pockets”—but the final renunciation relies on a whispered epiphany (“he understood then”) rather than a micro-choice visibly costing him. The contradiction between lifelong avoidance and instant surrender feels slightly under-cooked, keeping the change just shy of fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: charcoal dust, starlight, scarred wood tighten atmosphere until the threshold dissolves; the final step-through is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—“Some bridges… smoke taught you how to breathe.” One causality wobble: why the sudden volte-face after decades of avoidance is explained only by abstract realization, not an on-page trigger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the doorknocker ring, dome cracks, and charcoal dust are handled, re-handled, and finally constrain the exit. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—incense clings to skin, bronze warms under palm—anchoring orientation within the first 100 words. Only the sanctuary’s spatial edges blur intentionally as the threshold fades, so the choreography stays clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—let the dead go or be swallowed—tightens once: the shadow’s hand over his wrist forces the choice. Cost is legible in the final breath of rain air, but the escalation is single-cycle; no secondary reversal or resource lost, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern—bridges, smoke, breathing—without sermon. The closing image reweights “burning bridges” into a life-giving inhalation, achieving conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers: is release noble or merely another form of abandonment? Counter-reading is plausible and productive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, compressed, taught early (“shadows didn’t just gather, they breathed”) and paid off. Rhythm escalates toward staccato fragments under pressure. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature remains stable. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density—every sentence layers scent, texture, metaphor—yet no mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop (“bridges weren’t meant to be crossed… burned so thoroughly”) is forgiven because it coils back as thematic echo. Closure line is uncluttered, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: after-life sanctuary as rehab clinic for the avoidant, release as inhalation of smoke. Risk—the lyric collapse of setting into metaphor—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Slight deduction for recognizable “ghosts of past” trope; the breathing twist salvages distinctiveness.</comment>
