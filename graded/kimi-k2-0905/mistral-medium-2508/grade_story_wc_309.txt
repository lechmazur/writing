<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marlin’s “stubbornly glowing candle” gives him a concrete, quirky signature; interiority is rich and embodied (“fingers numb, robes stiff with frost”). Internal conflict—yearning for the sacred vs. institutional failure—stays active in scene. Final refusal to explain flicks the deans’ authority away, an earned renunciation whose cost is the keystone he leaves behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the candle won’t quit, therefore Marlin climbs; because he touches the keystone, therefore the spire flips into summer; because he hears the keeper, therefore he chooses un-mastery. One clear transition (summit mist) is legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the candle & keystone merge into living shadows that re-price “explanation” itself—felt cost is the chuck of authority he walks away from.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ice-spire anchors early (“jagged tooth… storm-wracked sky”) and keeps pressuring choice via frostbite, altitude, sudden summer pocket. Micro-setting tool is the candle whose flame literally warms the final image. Sensory picks are urgent (numb fingers, howling wind) and selective; no filler weather catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across the dissolve from ice to garden folly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove the sacred exists in stubborn flaws, not factory hymns. Escalation tightens once: summit confrontation forces him to choose—cling to institutional praise or keep the candle’s imperfect glow. Agency is renunciation; option foreclosure is literal (keystone left on floor). Cost is social credit and the certainty the deans covet—visible when they “gasp” and he walks out.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogans: automation sterilizes, imperfection sanctifies. Candle/keystone double-image reframes “defect” as hierophany. Final whispered “Louder” is Conceptual Repricing—he re-orients cultural volume toward flawed liveness. No moralizing paragraph; ambiguity stays (will city listen?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Marlin’s idiosyncratic filter: “lingering luminance,” “choir of disapproving mentors.” Syntax tightens under frost stress—short clauses mimic panting climb. Unfinished woman’s diction (“everyone else took the stairs”) contrasts without voice bleed. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates: long, icy sentences climb; punchy fragments at summit (“Mist walking. Of course.”). Metaphors are lean and concrete (“hollow as a polished stone”). One paraphrase loop (“the sacred isn’t in the spectacle… in the stub of wax…”) is purposeful echo, not artifact. No mixed metaphors; closure image stays sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar “flawed apprentice” trope is twisted via automation-vs-imperfection angle. Candle that won’t extinguish reframed as theological insurgency feels fresh. Mist-walking inversion (“spire was never about the climb”) rewards the reader’s spatial assumption. Risky refusal to explain mechanism tightens rather than cheapens the mystery.</comment>
