<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lydia’s contradictory pull toward the stage while dead is embodied in synesthetic hallucinations; her choice to hand Elias the coin costs her visibility and anchors the timeline repair. The micro-choice to “intertwine fingers with branches” physically enacts her stake and forecloses her lingering. Missing a hairline 9: Elias’s turn is slightly more observed than driven by on-page causality from his interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Lydia’s fade-out and Elias’s forward step reconfigure possibilities with felt cost to her. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; repetition of orchard echoes and coin reprises tightens meaning until the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when is signaled by line 3 and paid off by the garden’s rule-set at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting—the tarot coin—functions as portable environment that constrains both characters’ choices and charges the final hand-off. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: burnt-caramel taste, indigo dusk-color, applause-petals all serve synesthetic world-rule. Only hairline slip: “shimmered like bruised silver” is a touch generic amid otherwise fresh descriptors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: lure possibility from despair; pressure tightens once when Lydia materializes the mural/child visions that foreclose Elias’s suicide option. Cost is visible—Lydia’s erasure—but the escalation is more imagistic than tactical; Elias’s agency is reactive rather than initiating a second beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through echo-metaphor: performance afterlife, repeat curtains, garden as backstage. Final image “music tasted like hope” offers non-literal repricing without moralizing. Subtext in coin-hand-off carries unspoken suicide refusal; ambiguity lingers about whether orchard recycles this encore infinitely.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric synesthetic diction is pattern-taught early and paid off in final taste-image; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates from long hypnotic sentences to staccato “The maze shifted.” Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“the contact sang”). Voice stays within ghost-narrator plausible lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences do triple duty (setting, synesthesia, backstory). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and justified. Minor overwrite in “sound that wasn’t sound but the color of dusk” slightly strains logic, but it clears before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-stage-manager of timelines inside synesthetic orchard-theater. Risky lyric compression succeeds; premise commits fully without late rule changes. Transformation test passes: swap orchard or coin and the emotional mechanics collapse.</comment>
