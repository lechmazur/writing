<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete—thumb pressing the lens, pen hovering—but her contradictory impulses (mistrust vs. urge to help) are summarized rather than enacted in a single visible beat. The micro-choice to slide the ticket is motivated, yet the cost to her own guardedness is declared (“her heart lighter”) rather than embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, and the Earned Stasis—she keeps drawing, now without camouflage—lands as a believable renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the rain-afterglow, ticket doodles, and lens-light fragments build density until the final image reweights honesty from camouflage to gift. Orientation is clean by line 4; the couple arrives as the first causal perturbation. Closure is a Charged Poise: Lena’s fresh ticket stack crystallizes her new stance with undeniable opportunity-cost—she forfeits anonymity. No loops or teleporting props; the cracked lens recurs with escalating optical logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is more than postcard: its acoustics force Lena to hear, its light fragments become the lens’s refracting echo, and the wet pavers literally release whispers underfoot. These micro-details constrain her eavesdropping and later let her “scatter” tickets like light splinters. Environment thus charges the final image without over-description. Slight over-reliance on visual; a tactile sniff of rain-metal or shoe-squeak could have sealed 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can honesty exist without words—tightens when the ticket/doodle becomes the only negotiable currency between the couple. One meaningful deepening: Lena shifts from ciphering her own fears to ciphering for strangers, narrowing her safe anonymity. Cost is felt: she gives away her covert “language,” leaving the desk luminous with exposure. Agency is present but gentle; a hair more visible risk (manager glare? security cam?) could have pushed 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: cracked glass still bends light = broken people still transmit truth. Subtext lives in silence—ticket passed “like an accusation” becomes ticket passed “like a map.” Final image of tickets as “confession no one had to speak” reweights earlier stubs she once defaced for herself. Avoids moralizing; resonance is imagistic, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the “resonant hush” mandate; diction stays inside a night-shift registrar’s ken—“storage closet,” “box office”—never drifts into MFA loftiness. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences during eavesdrop, staccato fragments when she draws. No dialogue to distort; silence is the point. Perceptual signature is Lena-specific: she notices light-splitter edges and ticket paper the way a projectionist would.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Ear-test strong: sentence lengths swell and contract with emotional tide. Information density high—one line can plant lens, backstory, and metaphor simultaneously. One paraphrase loop: “not secrets. Not lies.” is purposeful refrain, not scaffold. Occasional soft modifiers (“something luminous”) slightly dilute peak beat; keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: uses projection-tech optics as emotional grammar—lens = truth-bending prosthesis. Concert-ticket cipher turns mundane stub into origami of intimacy; not seen before at this length. Risk is quietness rather than pyrotechnics, but coherence remains. Could be transplanted to another venue only with loss of optic metaphor, so specificity is earned.</comment>
