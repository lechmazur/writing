<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s profession and grief are vividly anchored; the negative-in-hand tremble embodies contradiction between detachment and need. The moment he aligns the film strip to the blank mural patch, motive crystallizes into visible cost—he forfeits the safety of forgetting. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the father’s “maybe” voice lacks full prior seeding, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: Elias completes the mural, foreclosing his exile from memory; the open threshold image carries undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—each artifact (negative, diaries, sealed door) returns with escalating weight, no teleports. The “corridor sings” cadence shift reweights the whole pattern. One of the few 600-word pieces where lyric repetition tightens instead of pads.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy, damp stone, and lantern flicker act as tactile gatekeepers, constraining every step and lighting the film negative reveal. Micro-settings—rocking chair mid-sway, rusted toy—mirror Elias’s suspended grief. Sensory hierarchy tightens to smell of wet earth when air thickens, guiding him deeper. Environment literally charges the final glowing mural; without it the epiphany would deflate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can he bear to remember? Pressure heightens through each returned artifact; the sealed door’s groan is the decisive narrowing. Cost is felt—negative brittle between fingers, varnish blackening—yet the tightening would benefit from one overt tactical loss (tool, time, or light failing) to push him from 8.5 to 9+ band. Still, escalation under Accumulative lens is legible and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “memory is a corridor you must walk backward”; no sentence moralizes. The singing corridor reconfigures the premise: echoes are not hauntings but invitations to live. Particulars—half-burned diaries, ivy rustle—carry the abstraction. Final image offers charged poise rather than tidy moral, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains a hush-filmic rhythm; perceptual signature favors auditory and tactile detail over visual gloss, fitting an echo-cartographer. Syntax grows clipped when he strikes the match—pressure without drumbeat. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. Voice modulates but never breaks frame.</comment>

<comment>Prose is near-flawless: high density, no scaffold loops, metaphors coherent (“film curled like a dead thing” marries fragility + death). Sentence length breathes—long breath for atmosphere, staccato for strike-light ignition. Only one tiny paraphrase loop: “weight of legacy pressed down… heavier than the stone” could compress, but it does not touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes with rhythm variation intact.</comment>

<comment>“Corridor echo cartographer” is a fresh occupational lens; climate-drowned ruins + memory-veined architecture feels inevitable yet new. Family negatives aligning with half-erased mural freshens the ‘return to ancestral ruin’ trope. Risky lyric escalation pays off—pattern taught by 25% and closure sings rather than explains. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat into generic sentiment.</comment>
