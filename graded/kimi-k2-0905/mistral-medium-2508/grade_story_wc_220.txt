<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rook’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; “old bloodhound heart” gestures emotion without concrete contradiction under pressure. His final acquiescence to the vines is legible as renunciation, yet the cost is asserted rather than embodied—no aching joints, no last scent-memory of the woman. Because the choice is singular and not complicated by competing impulses, characterization trends archetypal rather than individuated. Still, the steady link between cylinder→leaf→dome gives him a functional through-line within the short span.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the dome rewrites distance as intimacy, paying with Rook’s literal disappearance. Causality is symbolic—wax leaf melts, dome admits him—but the symbolic chain is legible and foreshadowed. Orientation is clear by line 6; no anchors drift. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern repetition (cylinder voice, script, leaf, “wound-bridge”) intensifies until meaning, not event, shifts. Cost is visible in the sealing glass and the surrender of his body to roots; no contradiction under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scrapyard, fissure, and glass dome are sketched with economical, sensory strokes (“rusted beast,” “wind carved spirals”). Each locale is filtered through Rook’s scent-oriented perception, keeping detail selective. The dome garden recharges the earlier leaf image, qualifying for micro-setting use that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment> Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—is announced early and reiterated by the cylinder. Pressure escalates texturally: each repetition of the “wound-bridge” motif tightens the emotional screw until the dome offers literal fusion. Rook’s agency is largely receptive—he follows grooves and vines—so the tightening is atmospheric rather than tactical. Cost is legible when the dome seals, foreclosing return; one meaningful intensification satisfies the 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the recurring metaphor: physical separation as spiritual passage. The cylinder’s pronouncements risk echo-speak, but they are grounded in Rook’s remembered wound and the leaf artifact, avoiding abstract sermon. Final image of “first garden war” reweights the premise from scavenging to cultivation without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the dome paradise or trap?—inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Rook’s sensory palette; no head-hop. Diction is lyrical yet canine-true (“sniffing out the dead,” “muzzle brushing”). Rhythm modulates: longer, clause-rich sentences for prophecy, clipped fragments for physical immediacy. The patterned repetition of grooved script / grooved wax / grooved glass teaches the reader to read by texture, paid off when grooves literally pull him inside. Voice remains distinct under pressure; zero dialogue prevents register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is densely imagistic yet propulsive; nearly every sentence couples observation to motion. Occasional poetic overlap—“distance is a wound… the wound can be a bridge”—is purposeful parallelism, not synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent (no mixed vehicles). Minor filter-verb clusters (“Rook’s ears twitched,” “Rook’s claws flexed”) are brief and cadence-driven, not momentum-killing. Final lines achieve Charged Poise without syntactic muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “retired scent-hound decoding apocalyptic vinyl” conceit is fresh, yet the piece’s real ingenuity lies in collapsing media (wax leaf, wax cylinder, wax dome) into a single transmission pathway. Post-war garden domes aren’t new, but using analog audio grooves as map, memory, and eventual corporeal portal reconfigures the trope. Specificity of the loop-script and amber veins makes the concept inseparable from this story. Risk—the symbolic rather than plotted resolution—pays off because the pattern is taught early and closure is legible.</comment>
