<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory need to map belonging while refusing to leave the drowned lab is embodied in micro-choices (pressing the burnt feather to her lips, logging coordinates). The moment she takes Kael’s hand, the cost of staying below is made visible: she forfeits the surface he will return to. Interiority is concrete and sensor-tethered; no epiphany is abstract. The only minor slack is that Kael’s scar-backstory is delivered as label (“holding onto something too tightly”) rather than dramatized gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of living constellations → jellyfirefly spiral → final shared exhale. Closure is Charged Poise: the shared breath crystallizes the option of connection while the ocean keeps its own time; cost is the unspoken fact that only one of them will surface. Causality is intact: each luminous pulse tightens Elara’s tolerance for solitude until another body becomes irresistible. No orientation debt; dome, tide, and chronology (“until sunrise”) are anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Environment acts as micro-setting: the cracked dome and dying emergency lights constrain oxygen and sightlines, forcing the two characters onto the narrow observation deck. The brass celestial scope and burnt feather function as tools that charge the final image—feather pressed to lips, scope abandoned. Bioluminescent algae and jellyfireflies are not backdrop; their shifting constellations literally rewrite the maps Elara lives by. Setting detail is selective, never touristic; every sensory shard (rusted steel, condensing breath) mirrors internal pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Elara remain the sole reader of the deep’s language, or will she share it? The arrival of Kael tightens this; the shared exhale forecloses solitary interpretation. Cost is legible: she records the respite’s brightest pulse but forfeits immediacy—she stays below while he ascends. Agency is accumulative; no single reversal, but each firefly spiral raises the price of isolation until the final spiral demands reciprocity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging-as-frequency emerges through recurring image of living star-maps rather than assertion. The burnt feather and jellyfireflies are particulars that reweight meaning: flight reduced to carbonized vane, starlight reduced to deep-sea pulse. Final image—Elara smiling at the echo of above-ground fireflies—achieves Conceptual Repricing: the surface world is now the paler copy. No moral is stated; resonance is earned by sensory accretion.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s perceptual signature—she reads constellations in algae, hears tide-groans as planetary ribs. Syntax is compressed and lyrical without sacrificing clarity: “the Pacific’s slow, insistent weight.” Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she realized”) and disappear under pressure. Kael’s dialogue is minimal but idiom-marked (“topside”), distinct from Elara’s interior diction of celestial navigation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer time, metaphor, and physics (“glass domes cracked but still holding back the Pacific’s slow, insistent weight”). No synonym loops; each metaphor is single-use and precise. Rhythm accelerates into the final spiral, then exhales with the shared breath. Only microscopic slip: “softly ingenious” is marginally elevated diction for Elara’s lexicon, but it occurs in low-pressure narration and is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of drowned-urban-decay with landscape-astrology feels inevitable yet unseen before. The notion that ocean currents carry wheat-field wind-patterns is a fresh conceptual synthesis. Risk of lyric accumulative structure is embraced and paid off: closure is a hush, not a twist. Transformation test passes—names could not be swapped without gutting the cosmology. Burnt feather and jellyfirefly are not quirky ornaments; they are the physics of this new world.</comment>
