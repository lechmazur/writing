<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s motives—empty-handed generosity, hunger for metamorphosis—stay legible; her micro-choices (uncorking, hurling vials, stepping onto pumice) externalize the contradictory impulse to give away the very light she needs. Interiority is sensuous, not therapeutic (“the texture of transformation,” “rough-silk ash”). The earned renunciation—empty hands, pocketful of coincidences—pays off the prophecy and gifts her a charged poise; cost is felt. One decimal off 8.8 only because the “philanthropist” label is asserted more than socially staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each image (ember breath, glass vials, lava kiss) thickens the pattern until the final alchemy—bugs into comets, sand into gold—reweights stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; no penalty. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elira’s empty hands + raft toward nameless island crystallize cost; the tide erasing footprints externalizes irreversible change. Persistent constraint—destitution—shapes tactics (gifting light instead of hoarding) and is borne onto the raft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Black-sand beach, mirror shard, pumice raft are tactile tools that constrain movement and charge the final image; volcano exhales and receding tide act as live clock. Sensory hierarchy favors heat, smell, grit—never tourist checklist. Spatial choreography is clean: cave mouth → cliff → lava tide-line → raft launch. Details evolve causally (footsteps write fresh prophecy in wet dust). One-step deduction for occasional soft focus (“celestial bodies dragged their heels” risks generality).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elira keep or surrender her captured light?—tightens as each vial is sacrificed into molten curtain, foreclosing retreat. Agency is continuous: she chooses detour, uncorks, hurls, steps onto raft. Cost is visible—empty vials, golden flash, raft toward unmapped island. Coincidence (mirror prophecy) complicates rather than rescues. Slight reserve: escalation is steady but single-arc; no secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformative giving emerges imagistically—light freed into fire, sand into gold—never sermonized. Motif of emptying recurs with shifting valence: empty pockets → empty vials → empty hands that now “hold” coincidence. Final image (raft, unnamed island) invites reflection on uncharted generosity. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers. Minor echo-line “texture of transformation” skirts thematic label-tax but survives via embodied context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is synesthetic-thermal: volcano “exhales,” sand “shifts,” hush “swells.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for awe, clipped fragments for beats (“A detour, then.”). No head-hopping. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Diction stays within Elira’s mythic register; no register drift. Dialogue absent by design; narration carries subtext through imagistic action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density (“glass vials lined up like a constellation” layers visual, tactile, symbolic jobs). Metaphors are coherent—lava “kiss,” tide “flees”—and sustain thermal through-line. No mixed vehicles. Sentence variety: participial openers balanced with blunt monosyllables (“She stepped inside”). Final line anchors echo: hush → her own breath. Copy-clean; no scaffold. Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene temperature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Transmutes familiar trope—mentorless prophecy, orphan-hero—into lyric sequence where accidental oracle is a shard of mirror reflecting ash instead of destiny. Volcano + lightning-bug alchemy feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Specificity of “black sand turned gold for a heartbeat” freshens eruption trope. Risk in near-abstraction pays off via sensory grounding. Slight deduction for quasi-archetype “island no map had named,” still saved by prior causal logic.</comment>
