<comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—hunger to understand “alive” houses vs. quiet acceptance of unknowing—peaks when she relinquishes the shard; the embodied cost (softer step, altered breath) is visible. Micro-choices spiral outward from pocket-touch to dock-press to leaving the shard, each tightening her stance. The final renunciation is earned because every prior beat trains us that she collects and guards fragments; letting go reframes her hierarchy of value. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-labeling; perception stays salt-specific, grandmother-curtain specific, credibly individual.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “displaced things” builds density until the spiral placement catalyzes Charged Poise reconfiguration—houses’ silence reweighted from puzzle to partner. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no debt applied. Closure cost is legible in the final breath-image: “the air tasted different,” a sensory forfeiture that forecloses collector-identity. No causal break; ellipsis between voice-hearing and key-pressing is motivated by Liora’s practiced non-reaction to the uncanny.</comment>

<comment>Bay-as-micro-setting constrains the ritual: tide scatter dictates object choice, wet dock wood accepts the key’s imprint, briny air carries orris. Weathered dock, amber streetlights, and chipped teacup recur with shifting charge, culminating in the “hushed blaze” glow that mirrors interior reconfiguration. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel-place-press-exit tracked without drift. Environment is not backdrop but collaborator—salt stiffness on ribbon, tide limits on placement—guiding the spiral geometry that precipitates insight.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—why some houses breathe—tightens once: relinquishing the shard transforms the question from solvable puzzle to lived practice. Pressure accumulates through object density rather than antagonist; each salvaged item ups the bay’s silent testimony until the spiral act forces stance crystallization. Cost is present but gentle: loss of talisman, gain of perceptual shift—adequate for vignette length yet short of visceral punch. Agency remains with Liora; coincidence (voice) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as animate presence—emerges through tactile spiral, never thesis. Subtext resides in gesture: leaving the shard = consent to dwell inside unanswered questions. Final image reweights “hollow” houses as potentially receptive if one learns listening, a resonant reconfiguration without moral tag. Insight is earned through sensory apprenticeship rather than articulated epiphany, dodging pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—“salt-stiff ribbon,” “color of dried lavender”—is character-peculiar, not catalog. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for tide exhale, clipped fragments for voice intrusion. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Register stays within coastal, apothecary-adjacent lexicon; no academic drift. Free indirect blends cleanly: “She didn’t mean to sanctify…” carries Liora’s self-mocking tone inside narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “wood softened by decades of salt and silence” performs three jobs—tactile, temporal, metaphoric. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Figurative layer is restrained to one metaphor per beat, avoiding purple clutter. Final line cadence—“Some houses felt alive because they had learned to listen. And so, at last, had she.”—delivers echoing closure without template thud. Minor filter verbs (“she felt like”) are rare and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar motif—mystic object teaches lesson—gains freshness through specificity of perfumer’s shard, dock-spiral ritual, and bay-salt sensorium. Synthesis of “displaced things” with “animate silence” feels non-obvious in combination. Risk is quiet but present: refusal of antagonist or high-stakes loss in favor of perceptual shift. Could transpose to another coast but would lose scent-chemistry detail that charges closure; thus partially anchored.</comment>
