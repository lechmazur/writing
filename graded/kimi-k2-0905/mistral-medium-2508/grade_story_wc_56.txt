<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—hunger for truth vs. urge to jettison the past—stays alive in every beat; the ledger-drop is a visible renunciation with cost. Micro-choices (steering into marshes, pocketing then keeping the sundial) track a credible hierarchy of values. Flaw is present (obsessive chasing) and complicates the final quiet; no tidy emotional arithmetic. The father’s absence as on-page pressure keeps relationship crucible from fully firing—cap modest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory repetitions (water, light, reflection) tighten toward the ledger-drop/sundial-keep binary that reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: “a key that didn’t fit any lock” crystallizes options with felt opportunity-cost. Anchors clear by line 5; orientation test waived. One causal micro-turn—shadow pointing inward—escalates knowledge; luck used only as complication (radio crackle), never resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Canal, barge hull, algae-slick piling form a micro-setting that constrains steering and mooring choices. Mist, wake, and heron wing supply cadence shifts that mirror internal letting-go; no static postcard. Brass sundial operates as handled tool-as-setting, its bent gnomon charging the final “squint” image. Sensory economy favors tactile and visual filtered through Liora’s salvage-trained eye—no filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—parse father’s map vs. abandon it—signalled early; tightening occurs when shadow refuses north, forcing inward reorientation. Protagonist agency drives every plot inch: salvage, steer, drop ledger, keep sundial. Cost is visible (ledger sinks, future gold foregone) and conceptual (identity recast as “unsteady, not lost”). No antagonist needed; pressure coheres through environmental quiet and radio void.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—lies as scaffolding, not architecture—emerges through concrete images (sundial inscription, ledger pages as lily pads) rather than thesis statement. Subtext in silence: radio absence and water’s swallowing of past speak louder than exposition. Final “learning to squint” offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior obsession without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is clarity a destination or a stance?—invites re-read.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—metallic light, salvage-trained appraisals—remains character-specific. Prose rhythm modulates: long clause for twilight glide, staccato for radio shard. No head-hop; knowledge bounded to Liora. Filter verbs minimal and earned (“she felt like”). Voice grows slightly lyric under mist but stays anchored in bodily action; no committee voice.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths swell and contract with canal breathing. Metaphors are spare, non-contradictory (“blade through old parchment” opens with clear physical logic). No synonym churn or template cadence detected. High information density: single sentences layer salvage ethic, paternal doubt, and setting cue. Minor scaffold: two “like” similes close together could be pruned, but none sit in final third—9+ still reachable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-collapse daughter decoding dead father’s treasure map—risks template, but salvage-world canal and bent sundial re-inscribe it with lived texture. Fresh inflection: shadow pointing inward spatializes hindsight as physical direction. Risk is taken in quiet rather than set-piece, trusting image over twist. Could edge higher if marshes offered one more idiosyncratic rule; as is, specificity suffices for publish-now tier.</comment>
