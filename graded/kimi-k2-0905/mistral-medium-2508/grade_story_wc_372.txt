<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elias’s quietly obsessive interiority is consistent and embodied (“hands trembled” at the woman’s face). The ledger and slide anchor his micro-choices under pressure, and the final step onto the bridge is a credible renunciation of his lifelong measuring stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets don’t apply. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling—“knew the library’s time was running out”—that momentarily abstracts the crisis.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sampled vow adds density until the bridge appears as a pattern break. Closure is a Charged Poise: the kept vow reconfigures meaning with felt cost—the library’s erasure. Orientation is secure by line 3; spatial anchors hold. The slight causal hiccup is that the woman’s prior ledger cameos are never explained, but the final image overrides the need for literal linkage.</comment>

<comment>The lantern slide functions as micro-setting: its glass warmth against Elias’s thigh signals the turn from ice to spring. Ice-shelf collapses and ozone scent are selective, pressure-driven details. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible moves. The frozen library dissolving into stardust recharges the bridge image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—extract meaning before vows vanish—tightens when the slide’s wild frequency invites him to abandon extraction for participation. Each shelf-drop raises the cost of hesitation. Agency is interior but decisive: stepping onto the bridge forecloses the measuring life. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the shift in vow function: from data to invitation, from archive to after-life. The luminous-vow motif reweights at the bridge, offering a non-literal answer to “can meaning be measured?” No moralizing; the final image of spring air carries conceptual repricing. The woman remains an intentional enigma, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—gloved fingers, hum of glass, ozone hush. Syntax shortens under peak tension—“He pressed the slide harder”—without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. The lyric cadence is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final line, “the light bent,” satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “shelves carved from ice and its books bound in frostbitten leather” does three jobs—visual, tactile, and stakes. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay within light/sound spectrum. Minor scaffold: “the air smelled of ozone and old paper” echoes earlier “ozone and old paper” but the second hit deepens tone rather than loops. No artifact touches the closing line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “luminous vow” concept freshens the tired spectral-library trope by making emotion physically measurable. The slide-as-scientific-instrument turned love-token is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk: lyric opacity is high, yet coherence holds through sensory specificity. The final image of spring is earned, not sentimental, because winter’s cost is felt.</comment>
