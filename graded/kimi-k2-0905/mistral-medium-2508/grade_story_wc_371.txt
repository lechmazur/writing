<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s “heuristically gentle” lens is dramatized via tactile micro-choices—planting mint under guard boots, pressing crumbs into soil—each revealing a hierarchy of values with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and contradiction-rich: she both craves answers and fears the price of seeing. The final hand-in-wheat gesture earns renunciation status because every prior beat linked observation to on-page risk. One hairline slip: “the sacred had always been here” flirts with label-speak, but the embodied image (crumbs, soil, weeping prince) immediately pays it off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught by sentence-level patterning: repeated “uncloaking” images (bread steam, wheat riot, weeping guards) tighten the stake—how quickly the city stops adjusting. Closure lands via Charged Poise: wheat swaying where fountain stood reconfigures meaning with undeniable social cost. Persistent constraint visible: once wheat roots, no return to prior denial possible. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no teleporting props; causality held by sensory cue chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tea-house copper kettle and overgrown palace courtyard function as micro-setting: their dereliction enables secret baking and concealment from guards. Wheat replacing fountain is environmental causality that alters civic movement. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—yeast scent, crust scored with unremembered patterns—filtering through Liora’s bias toward hidden life. One minor spatial elision: “city windowsills” blur geography, but bread distribution network remains legible under accumulative design.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the city keep adjusting to erasure?—signals in paragraph two. Tightening occurs when first loaf provokes public weeping: option to ignore vanishes. Protagonist agency: Liora’s guerrilla-gardening decision thrusts bread into circulation, forcing collective confrontation. Cost legible in palace guards’ kneeling foreheads—social order visibly forfeited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete return: bread as host, soil as altar, wheat as congregation. No moral stated; final image of coins feeling “enough” reprices consumer ritual into sacred sufficiency. Subtext carries in silence—prince eats, weeps, walks; meaning made by prior pattern, not commentary. Ambiguity preserved: no explanation for bakery’s return, keeping absolution tenuous yet earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric compression: “flour once dusted the air like snow” and “yeast and wild honey unspooling like a memory” teach rhythmic pattern early and pay off in final wheat sway. Perceptual signature consistent—Liora notices curled vines, sharpened laughs, bread temperature. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from roof-top watching to hand-in-wheat touch. Filter verbs (“she noticed”) serve voice rather than dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer time-settling frost, vanished bakery, and character gift. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—steam/memory spool, wheat/fountain swap—no mixed logic. Rhythm accelerates across paragraph breaks mirroring bread diffusion; final sentence slows into cadence of enoughness. One paraphrase echo: “for the first time in years” repeated, but functions as accumulative refrain rather than scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mundane sourdough starter becomes civic eucharist. Vanished bakery reappears not as mystery solution but as sacred re-enchantment, transforming trope of magical realism into communal penance. Risk taken in skipping exposition for lyric montage; pattern coherence holds. Specificity irreplicable—Maple Lane, reversed river Tuesdays, bread scoring unremembered patterns—roots concept in this city only.</comment>
