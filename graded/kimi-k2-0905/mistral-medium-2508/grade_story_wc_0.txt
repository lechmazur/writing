<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist of cosmic collapse who now studies terrestrial decay—is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to sprinkle dust rather than “save” the orchids crystallizes his shift. Emotional layering is credible: the vial becomes both relic and instrument, never reduced to label-speak. The final renunciation (sabbatical email) carries visible cost: he forfeits institutional identity for listening. Still, the arc is lightly sketched; one more pressured beat that forced him to defend the dust-method against a live skeptic would have deepened the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty vial and soft equation mark an irreversible pivot from measurement to witness, cost felt in the quiet pulse against his ribs. Accumulative lens holds: each dust sprinkling adds density until the pattern of absence eclipses the lost blooms. The greenhouse-to-email span is two shards with a single legible transition; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and never drift. One hairline slip: the sentence “He understood now…” edges toward encapsulated epiphany, but it is immediately grounded in the physical act of capping the vial.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shattered greenhouse functions as micro-setting and psychic mirror; broken glass “catches the dawn like broken teeth” is selective, sensory, and stakes the mood. Spatial choreography is immaculate—we kneel, brush, palm the soil—bodies and debris stay tracked. Weather residue (evaporating floodwater) affects choice by exposing the soil for dust application. The butterfly dust itself becomes the portable “tool” that charges the final image; its iridescence reframes the wreckage as observatory, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the scientist trade control for witness—signals early and tightens once: the dust does not resurrect, it reveals, foreclosing the grant-performance path. Escalation is accumulative: each return to the greenhouse adds pattern density until the option to “fix” anything is gone. Visible price: the emptied vial and the departmental confusion certify the forfeit. A sharper external obstacle (a single line of funding-threat or colleague confrontation) would have nudged this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: decay is not failure but legible poetry; no abstract statement until the soft equation titles it, and even that is a private scribble, not a manifesto. Subtext operates in gesture—sprinkling dust onto blackened stems is a silent communion. The ending’s “Theory of Kindled Humility” crystallizes meaning without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what listening will cost. One avoidable echo: “the slow, iridescent unraveling of things” flirts with thematic slogan, but the next sentence re-grounds in butterfly wings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is neutron-star precise: “measuring the slow, inevitable collapse of massive things” compresses vocation and worldview in one stroke. Syntax mirrors content—long periodic sentences for orbital reflection, fragment bursts for dust settling. Perceptual signature is consistent: light fractures, spiral arms, veins in crust—every image filtered through an astrophysicist’s calibration. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk; internal diction never leaks into committee voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold sentences, each image advances character or atmosphere. Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass as teeth, roots as veins—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from stately opening clause to the breath-caught finale “Like the beginning of something he didn’t need to name.” Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, mood, theme). A single tiny filter verb cluster (“he felt something shift”) is voice-motivated and forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The neutron-star / butterfly-dust synthesis is genuinely fresh; no template plot matches this observatory-of-decay structure. Risk is taken by making the climax an act of listening rather than saving, and it pays off. Specificity anchors originality—Morpho rhetenor scales, levee date, iridescent dust—details that could not swap into another story without collapse. The “cathedral of glass and steam” opening nods to Gothic ruin but immediately fractures the trope into personal science; transformation is evident.</comment>
