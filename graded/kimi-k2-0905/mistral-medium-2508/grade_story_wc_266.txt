<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—lifetime guide who never stayed—lands early and governs the final renunciation. The embodied micro-choice to punch her own palm crystallizes the arc, though the chorus of unnamed “others” diffuses relational pressure and slightly dilutes crucible effect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star-stamped ticket adds density until the un-stamped dusk itself becomes the final “ticket.” The punch’s release into the shallows is a decisive Charged Poise that reweights every prior crossing with the cost of choosing not to cross.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ticket punch operates as micro-setting: cold brass → palm imprint → wind-lost artifact, constraining her final stance. Ridge, mist, and vigil fires are sketched with salt-specific economy; spatial choreography stays clean as she moves from sand to embers to shallows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“courage to stay versus cross”—tightens once: the self-stamp forecloses future ferryings. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the cadence shift when the punch sinks reconfigures options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from deferred tickets and unstamped dusk: the unmade crossing is itself the passage. No moralizing; the shoreline lullaby reconfigures meaning without statement, letting the silence after the plink resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter—metronome lantern, held-breath ridge. Patterned elision (“the ridgeway seemed to breathe”) is taught early and legitimates the final twilight-held note without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with tide-onset cadence; no loops or filler. Occasional poetic lift (“the water lapped…like a gently persistent question”) stops just short of overwriting and serves the textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ferry-afterlife trope is refreshed by foregrounding the bureaucratic artifact—the punch—and valuing the unstamped over the completed journey. Risk is moderate; inversion of heroic departure into heroic pause feels specific to this voice.</comment>
