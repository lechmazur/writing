<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete, pressure-grounded, and gains micro-choice traction (pocketing/keeping the glass, adding a stone). Flaws operate silently: his reticence is both shield and prison, compounding isolation. The final smile is earned—visible cost is the rotting skiff he lets go. Yet contradiction in-scene is more implied than dramatized; we glimpse, not feel, the internal split that makes the silence unbearable. Hairline slip keeps him just off 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every return of glass, stone, letter tightens the same dominant stake—can safety be bottled/shared? Closure is Charged Poise: candle in spiral, tower breathes, skiff abandoned—cost (no exit) made legible in final image. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (skiff, lantern room, dock) track cleanly. Causality intact: each artifact re-weights options until staying becomes inevitable. Earned, visible, irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sea glass and stone ring function as micro-setting; they constrain every major choice (return/not return, add stone, light candle). Sensory selection stays urgent—salt, rust, dawn green—filtered through Elias’s keeper bias. Lighthouse exterior is sketched only as needed (mist thickness = isolation), no tourist catalog. Final image integrates body/tool/environment: warm stone + glowing glass = tower-as-heart. Meets 9-gate for constraining choice; slight reserve for off-page keepers who never embody space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bottling safety—signaled in first paragraph and escalates via each new artifact: letter → sketch → blue glass. Protagonist agency: burn letters → climb stairs → add stone → write back → stay; each act forecloses silence/exit. Cost is tangible: forsaking the skiff, accepting endless upkeep. One meaningful tightening suffices; luck complicates (bottles arrive) but never solves. Slight cap because escalation is steady rather than sharply irreversible before final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: safety is co-constructed, transitive, never possessed. Sea-glass/letter/stone trio re-weights from solitary talisman to communal lattice. Final “door” line offers Conceptual Repricing—maintenance itself becomes portal. No sermonizing; resonance pulses through image, not assertion. Complexity preserved: tower still dark, keepers remain ghosts, cost unpaid yet felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical-elliptical voice taught early (“tracing a scar—silent, precise”) and sustained: rhythmic dip of oars, breath-held green. Diction stays inside Elias’s laconic, salt-stripped lexicon; no register drift. Perceptual signature—objects glow, hum, pulse—mirrors his sensory starvation. Compression (“skiff would rot”) reads as purposeful elision, paid off at closure. Minor template cadence in stone-stacking repetitions prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence delivers time-jump, geography, character state. Metaphors are spare, coherent, grounded in keeper world (glass as breath, stones as ladder). No filler, no loops, no scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with scene temperature—short pulse for ascent, lengthened hum for settling stones. Clause order stays clear; no simultaneity errors. Micro-clip for overworking “held breath/breath-held” twice; otherwise exemplary line control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse-after-dark is familiar turf, but synthesis is fresh: supply-runner abandons exit to become message-keeper; stone-stacking as asynchronous conversation. Anonymous epistolary haunt sidesteps wailing-ghost cliché. Risk—letting skiff decay—heightens stakes without gimmick. Specificity of green/blue glass palette and 1892 keepers keeps concept anchored. Transformation test passed: story fails if Elias is anywhere but this dead tower.</comment>
