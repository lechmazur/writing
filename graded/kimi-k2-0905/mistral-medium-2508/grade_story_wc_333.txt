<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“crookedest pick forged from a meteorite’s splinter”), but the locksmith’s contradictory impulses stay largely off-stage until the final quiet renunciation; embodied emotion is strong yet the decisive change costs are more atmospheric than corporeal, keeping her just shy of the 8-band where a visible price would bite on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with conceptual repricing: “the greatest secrets…enveloped you” re-weights the premise under an accumulative/textural lens; the lens is taught early and the ribbon-map beat crystallizes options with felt cost. One causal micro-gap: the man’s vanish is accepted rather than caused, but it occurs post-closure and doesn’t rupture the because/therefore chain that drives the stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The shop-as-body, meteorite pick, and bruised-twilight ribbon constrain choices and resurface in the final image; starlight and ozone supply sensory hierarchy that mirrors interior shift. Spatial choreography is tight; “walls dissolved into starlight” is an allowed reality slip under experimental add-on because pattern is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>The dominant stake—whether to open the prison-idea—tightens when the map blooms and forecloses her old rule; the cost is the surrender of control, legible as she “pressed her thumb to the map’s center.” Escalation is textural/accumulative: density of hair-ink-star motif re-weights stakes rather than causal reversals, satisfying the single-deepening requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: locks that keep the world out, not people in. The final image of soft secrets waiting for the right hand offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, achieving conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers—whose hair, whose fear—inviting reflection while staying coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to the locksmith; perceptual signature is distinct (“lamplight beneath the first stars,” “color of bruised twilight”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short imperative “Go” after languid reflective cadence. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; only one scaffold pair (“the locksmith…locksmith” in adjacent lines) costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent—hair as map, star as needle—without crowding peak beat. High density; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Minor typo “unplaned wood” accepted as idiosyncratic diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The fusion of cosmic hair-map with locksmith metaphysics feels fresh and inevitable; the inversion that locks protect the world from the self is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in reality dissolve pays off via taught pattern and charged closure. Slight derivative echo of “keys to the heart” trope is transformed through meteorite pick and ribbon-prison, keeping it shy of 9.0 band.</comment>
