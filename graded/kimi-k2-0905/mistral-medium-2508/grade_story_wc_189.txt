<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical, embodied, and specific to the chronicler’s perceptual lens; her silences and micro-choices (pressing the cicada into the fisherman’s hand) carry cost. The “texture of time” motive remains abstract—never tested against a concrete reversal—so the change feels轻 rather than crucible-forced. Still, her refusal to explain and the final damp sleeve give visible endurance with price, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cicada exchange crystallizes both grief’s persistence and the necessity of carrying it, reweighting the earlier “listen for the quiet” rule. Cost is legible in the fisherman’s cracked hands accepting the object and the chronicler’s own sleeve “as if the cicada had wept.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of drip/ripple/shell layers accrues until the final image submerges the world in held-breath silence. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Grotto, cicada, and tidal pool function as micro-settings that constrain attention and supply metaphorical vocabulary for transition. Moonlit stone, metallic tang, hairline-cracked shell—each detail is filtered through chronicler’s professional gaze and later re-appears to rewire meaning at closure. Environment never neutrally described; it dictates how grief can be observed, not solved. Meets 9+ gate: cracked shell in final paragraph directly charges the image of repaired-yet-fragile future.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to witness another’s grief without collapsing into explanation—tightens once: silence kept, cicada transferred. Escalation is textural: each repetition of drip/ripple/shell raises the emotional density rather than causal options. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is felt but not persistent; no later tactic is visibly altered, holding score just below high-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of translating grief into language; the story enacts this by refusing to voice the fisherman’s loss or the chronicler’s prophecy. Subtext resides in gesture (handing the cicada) and echoed natural patterns (ripples, cracks). Final image of drowned world re-prices earlier “texture of time” into silent, shared endurance—no moral stated. Resonance is conceptual yet visceral: the sleeve still wet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, tidal, rhythmically varied; long breath-like sentences mirror tide retreat, single-drop sentences act as pin-pricks. Perceptual signature is flawlessly maintained—chronicler sees everything as shell, ripple, anemone. No dialogue to distort distance; free indirect style stays cool and exact. Compression in “world was holding its breath” is taught early and paid off in submerged dream, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is high but patterned (drip/ripple/shell) so density penalty waived. No mixed metaphors; each vehicle extends aqueous logic. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “humming potential”) stays within chronicler’s reflective register. Only minor scaffold: “She didn’t” paragraph echo; clipped repetition functions as deliberate pause beat, not artifact. Final line lands clean, no loops near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “mourning by the sea” trope and tilts it sideways: grief observed through professional tide-pool chronicling, solution refused. Jade cicada as non-singing listening device is fresh; hairline-cracked shell payoff re-invents standard “broken vessel” image. Tangential approach theme is embodied in crab-side methodology rather than stated. Risk of lyrical stasis accepted and paid off by submerged dream-image. Not quite paradigm-shifting, but specific and memorable.</comment>
