<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is rich—her tactile rituals with the orchids, the match flare, the trembling palm—but the decisive renunciation (“let the chime fall”) arrives with only a single line of interior justification. The contradiction between curator-instinct and destroyer-act is present, yet the hinge moment feels slightly under-dramatized; we see the gesture, not the internal cost calculus that makes it inevitable. Still, her lifetime of echo-hoarding is embodied in every beat, and the final empty-handed stillness is a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the chime’s shatter and sunlight gilding the ruins reconfigure the entire frame—museum becomes mausoleum, caretaker becomes mourner. The cost is legible in the splintered bamboo and the unhearable name now inside her ribs. Causal lens holds: because she resealed the tube, the song awoke; therefore she must destroy it. No orientation debt; spatial logic (dome, shelves, floor) stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The moonstone shelves, glass-orchids, and bamboo chime are not backdrop but instruments: orchids bloom/contract under touch, chime’s crack directs plot, dome panes rattle from internal pressure. Micro-setting (the chime itself) constrains the final choice—she must break the object she once mended. Sensory economy is tight; scent of ozone/foxglove regret arrives only when stakes demand it. Setting evolves with event: sunlight enters only after the song is silenced, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve extinct sounds”—tightens when the very act of preservation awakens a dangerous name. One meaningful escalation: the shift from coaxing orchids to silencing a song that can possess her. Agency is present; her match reseal triggers the crisis, her deliberate drop resolves it. Cost is felt: the library exhales its last breath, she internalizes the sound she hunted, sunlight exposes ruins—options permanently narrowed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via pattern: preservation ⇄ destruction, echo ⇄ silence, cradle ⇄ tomb. No explicit thesis; the final image of sunlight on wreckage reweights “museum of extinct feelings” into a lived future of mourning. Subtext in gesture—striking match to heal, then breaking to kill—offers non-literal answer: some memory must remain unspoken. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader left with the hush after glass shatters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter; diction (“opal,” “foxglove regret,” “shattered rainbows”) is luxuriant yet consistent with a librarian who names sensations precisely. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—single-line paragraphs mimic held breath released. No dialogue, so voice texture is carried through syntax; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“half-remembered dream”) pays off in final quiet. Filter verbs rare and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: varied sentence lengths, no template cadence, zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors integrated into action—“ink that whispered when stirred” does double sensory work. Information density high; every sentence advances mood or plot. Minor overworld risk in stacked perfume imagery (“ozone and foxglove regret”) but justified by peak moment. Final line lands with echoing monosyllables that mirror content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—“cloud-borne library of extinct sounds”—is fresh, yet the emotional arc (curator destroys what she loves to save the world) treads familiar elegiac territory. Specificity of glass-orchids and unsayable names rescues it from abstraction. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: pattern of silence ⇒ sound ⇒ silence reweights meaning. Would not work if relocated to mundane attic; setting is inseparable from conflict.</comment>
