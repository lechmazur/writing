<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is vivid—her hollow-eyed stare, the hush she weaves into a net, her cheek on the moss—yet her contradictory impulses (chase vs. hush) stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in simultaneous beat-level tension. The final renunciation is earned: she pays with solitude, burnt skin, and the lighter paper, foreclosing further pursuit. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choices (pressing the wing, lunging for the thread) are specific but could carry sharper cost-on-the-page immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the origami wing drifts back “quieter,” re-weighting the prophecy from scream to sigh with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—the hush she maps literally lessens the prophecy’s mass. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“summoner knelt by the brook”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (folding light, water-stillness) pays off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brook, reeds, moss, and lunar stones form a micro-setting that actively constrains her tactics: water accepts/rejects the wing, reeds sway to signal permission, moss becomes her final bed. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices cold searing skin, paper drinking light, earth pulsing—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean: she kneels, presses, lunges, lies down; distances remain legible. The final image (crane’s shadow overhead) is charged by the setting’s quiet blaze, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“hush the prophecy or the world unravels”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the thread breaks free and she fails to catch it, visible price paid in silver-bleeding wing and seared skin. Agency is accumulative: each silence-mappings adds weight-loss to the prophecy; the final quiet is earned, not gifted. No coincidence; pressure coils through cadence shift (murmur → breath → snap → sigh). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as active force—mapping it, folding it, trading it—re-prices the cosmic prophecy from fatal scream to livable sigh. The crane shadow at dawn non-literally answers the central question: language can begin again after silence is husbanded. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line is image-only. Recurring motif (wing, hush, blaze) constrains tactics and reweights at closure, not ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthetic fold-cuts, water that “drinks,” night that “keeps secrets.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“snap”—then elongates into lyric release. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Tense and psychic distance stable. Patterned elision (spaces-between-words) is taught early and paid off at closure when the hush becomes breathable. Register stays within her arcane-but-tactile lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is cadence-controlled: paragraph lengths visually mimic breathing; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors; “lattice of light” and “serpent of soundless syllables” extend origami logic without muddle. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn. High density: every sentence layers image, stakes, and sensory shift. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: origami crane wing as silence-engine is non-obvious and specific; removing it collapses both mechanics and metaphor. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off with legible closure. No close echoes of famous scenes. Conceptual integrity: commits fully to “mapping silence” as counter-spell without winking at reader. Within-band risk bonus +0.3 for daring quiet ending that still lands decisive change.</comment>
