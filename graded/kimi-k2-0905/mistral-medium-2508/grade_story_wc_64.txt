<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s “blithe” temperament is shown, not told, through his calm soil-work and refusal to panic at ghostly murmurs; the knot-unpicking micro-choices steadily reveal a deeper, compassionate stubbornness. Interiority stays concrete—fingers warm from earth, throat tightening at lavender scent—without diagnostic self-labeling. The final decision to reset the chessboard earns its cost: he knowingly shoulders the widow’s buried guilt and the cemetery’s living debt. Missing a 9.0 only because the contradictory impulse that could have foreclosed an alternate path (flee, refuse the case) is gestured at but not dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>A tight causal chain: widow’s gift → lantern scrutiny → knot-by-knot visions → silo-voice warning → knowledge of river murder → chessboard reset. Each knot supplies a because/therefore turn that narrows Elias’s moral options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chess pieces realigned under cobalt stars crystallize his new, irreversible role as secret-keeper. Orientation anchor (gardener, silo edge, midnight) is locked by line 3; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Selective, pressure-driven detail: lantern light on blood-colored thread, marigolds leaning like parishioners, silo door that “never quite latched.” The body-as-micro-setting (calloused fingers, soil warmth) constrains every untangling motion. Final image—stars too bright, petals praying—mirrors internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism. One hairline slip: “cobalt silo exhaled” risks physics vagueness, but the breath is Elias’s perception, not literal, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will Elias look away or absorb the town’s buried crime? Each loosened knot escalates personal risk—spectral accusation, scent of drowning, husband’s bribe—until refusal carries the cost of complicity. Agency is continuous: he could stop at any knot, yet chooses to keep decoding. The final tightening is conceptual: silence now equals active guardianship of the dead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the burial metaphor: intentions are living roots, not relics; gardening the dead means cultivating their unspoken truths. Subtext operates through sensory returns—lavender, wet stone, marigold prayer—rather than exposition. The closing chessboard reprises the opening fall of the black king, now re-priced: the game is justice, and Elias has voluntarily become its steward. No moral is stated; the emotional aftereffect is a hush of complicit wonder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter: soil temperature, plant gossip, knot “breathing.” Syntax mirrors his gardener patience—long sentences for untangling, fragment shards at each knot-pop. No head-hop; widow appears only as vision. Diction stays within rural, plant-based lexicon; “lamb’s ear,” “marigold,” “weaving” read as natural thought-words. Rhythm accelerates subtly as lantern flame blurs blue, then exhales into the final reset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or paraphrase; every sentence either advances knot, senses, or moral pressure. Metaphors are cross-rooted in horticulture—knots as rhizomes, stars as eyes—maintaining coherent vehicle. No filter-verb stacks; perceptions arrive direct: “fingers still warm,” “scent—wet stone and lavender.” Opening and closing lines perform bookend resonance: ticking clock → clicked door, king fallen → queen alone, soil breath → petal prayer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar gothic tropes (cemetery, ghost-visions, antique box) are grafted onto fresh horticultural logic: gardener as confessor, plants as parish archives. The tapestry-knot code reverses usual ghost-story rules—unraveling doesn’t free the spirit but binds the living to secrecy. Specificity of plant lore and river-drowning bribery elevates material beyond template. Risk in second-person-ish silo voice pays off by making landscape an ethical interlocutor.</comment>
