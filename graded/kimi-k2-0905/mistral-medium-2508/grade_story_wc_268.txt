<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Veythas’s long endurance and final whispered sacrifice land as credible renunciation; the interior contradiction between detachment and loyalty is implied rather than embodied in-scene, so the emotional cost reads slightly abstract. Micro-choices are present but filtered through lyrical exposition, muting the crucible effect. Still, the persistent refusal to act until the price is absolute aligns with his mountain-stone trait and lets the closure feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each sigil acts as a because/therefore trigger that narrows Veythas’s options toward the final sundering. Closure is legible—his naming of Lirien splits the scepter and ends the lie—with conceptual cost etched into the dais inscription. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the library’s namelessness is purposeful disorientation that pays off in the stilling of drift. One minor causality bump: the pretender’s instantaneous relief feels slightly unearned because we never see his prior constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library’s fracturing star-light and ink-eaten parchment act as micro-settings that directly enable the sundering ritual; the star-stutter is the visual proof that the drift rune has been broken. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—dragonhide, basalt veins, dust taste—never touristic. Spatial choreography stays clean as Veythas moves from shelf to dais to throne room with tracked objects. Environment constrains the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—tightens with each corrosive message; the third sigil (“sunder the crown…”) forces the decisive trade-off. Escalation is atmospheric rather than action-based, but the constellation stutter visibly raises the cost. Agency is present in the naming/sacrifice, though the external pressure is largely off-stage. Price is felt in the cracked scepter and Lirien’s erasure, satisfying the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of earned collapse emerges through image, not statement: the library’s sigh, the crown slipping like a rotten mask, the dais inscription that reweights “drift” from threat to stillness. Subtext resides in the contradiction between regal duty and personal forgetting. Final image offers resonant reconfiguration—the stars move again—without moralizing. Minor abstraction in the pretender’s one line keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed third-person hovers at mythic distance yet keeps perceptual signature—Veythas notices “edges frayed like the hem of a god’s discarded robe,” a titan’s simile. Rhythm modulates from long inhalations to the single-line fracture, mirroring the constellation stutter. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Syntax stays controlled; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned—ink as wound, crown as mask—but taught early and paid off in the cracked scepter, avoiding purple overload. No loops or synonym churn; “dust and old promises” is the only conceptual echo, intentional. Final paragraph cadence breathes exactly where the moral weight lands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of titanic scale with口袋-sized stature, a library that forgets its own name, and a sigil that pauses constellations feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Rune-of-drift as both literal tool and metaphor for dynastic amnesia synthesizes mythic and political fantasy without gimmickry. Risk is taken in the quiet collapse rather than battle, and it pays off. Specificity—dragonhide, basalt scepter—prevents generic tropes.</comment>
