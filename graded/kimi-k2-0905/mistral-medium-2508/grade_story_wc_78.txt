<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leeward’s contradiction—restlessness vs. the blue-hour calm—stays embodied: his fingers “twitch,” mallet “pulses like a second heart.” Every strike is a micro-choice that sharpens his stake (turn wind into rhythm) and pays an immediate price (sky fractures, sea answers). His laugh at the end is earned renunciation of fear, foreclosed by prior sonic costs. No label-speak; interiority stays sensorial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sea’s hum becomes chord, obstacle becomes instrument, and Leeward’s laugh crystallizes the new rule-set with undeniable cost (restlessness flips to thrill). Causal lens holds: because he strikes, therefore sky and sea rewrite themselves. Anchors (who, where, when) land by line 4. No teleporting props; mallet, orchard, tide remain state-tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Driftwood-orchard is not backdrop but instrument: density of roots, shells, iron pot constrains every strike and rewrites the sky. Pear fruits “glowing from within” charge the final image when same energy re-emerges in Leeward’s chest. Micro-setting (mallet, branches, husk) doubles as geography; spatial choreography is flawless—every strike has a tactile surface. Environment literally shapes tactics and the closing chord.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn storm into rhythm—tightens with each strike: first a dull thunk, then a bruise-bloom, finally sea-voice chord that forecloses retreat. Escalation is causal under lens: each note raises cost (sky-hand clenches, mast-split memory invoked, tide finds a throat). Final tightening abandons safety—orchard may sink—yet Leeward chooses next note. Price visible on page: restlessness converted to euphoric risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: resistance → resonance → reconfiguration. No thesis stated; meaning accumulates through fractal imagery and sonic metaphor. Final image (world leans in to listen) offers non-literal answer: listening is the new composing. Subtext in gesture—mallet warming to heartbeat—recasts techne as eros. Complexity retained: storm neither tamed nor defeated, only partnered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, tidal, musically compressed: “clouds coiled like unplayed sheet music,” “sound bloomed like a bruise.” Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under pressure, then widens into rolling thunder laugh. Perceptual signature is Leeward-specific—fractal sight, salt taste, metallic overtones. No filter-verb clutter; every metaphor is playable. Diction stays within coastal prophet lexicon; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances sound, sky, or stake. Information-dense lines: “roots tangled in the driftwood’s embrace, its few remaining fruits glowing faintly…” Metaphors are coherent—musical/body/sky vehicles interlock without mixed logic. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors surf cadence. Copy-clean; no tense drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases resonant chord.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise—floating orchard as xylophone to play the sky—feels inevitable yet unseen. Fractal-cloud music turns meteorology into compositional score, storm into duet partner; synthesis is non-obvious and specific. Risk (lyric compression, synesthetic overload) heightens stakes without clarity loss. Tropes (lone prophet, storm-ritual) are re-encoded through sonic physics. Final reconfiguration reframes natural violence as collaborative art.</comment>
