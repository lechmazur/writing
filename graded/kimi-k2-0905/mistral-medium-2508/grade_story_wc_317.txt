<comment>Elias’s quiet persistence and Lina’s receptive tilt feel lived-in; the seed prompts visible micro-choices. Interiority stays concrete—steam curling, hand warmth, cross-legged vigil—never drifts into label-speak. The final hand-squeeze crystallizes a credible, low-key relationship shift with cost: the business slows, the stench arrives, they stay. No contradictory impulses in scene, so the 9+ quick test narrowly missed.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of quiet arrivals, failed solves, seed cracks, bloom stench tightens the dominant stake—keeping a space open for wonder. Closure is Charged Poise: “Now we see what grows” reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality intact—seed’s warmth → puzzle shift → community vigil → bloom → hand-hold. No orientation debt; transitions legible across months in two-shard design.</comment>

<comment>Brook’s murmur and willow-filtered lamplight anchor early; micro-setting (warm seed in palm, glass case, trowel in damp earth) constrains replanting choice and charges final bloom image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s selective attention—smell of failure, sound of water—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: counter → windowsill → back soil → willow trunk. Environment directly shapes the puzzle redesign and communal vigil, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—safeguarding a space for slow revelation—tightens through seed’s biological clock: split → tendril → bloom. Each escalation is accretive, not adversarial; options narrow to “wait and tend.” Cost is communal time, lost revenue, endured stench; price visible on page. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: puzzles that reward failure, seeds that demand patience, community that forms around stench. Final reprise of “see what grows” offers resonant, non-literal answer—no moral stated. Recurring water/seed imagery reweights from prop to shared future. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers about what exactly will grow.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elias’s perceptual filter—brook sighs, seed warmth, Lina’s head-tilt. Syntax mirrors his deliberate tempo: long breathy sentences during calm, clipped fragments at crack of seed. No head-hops; psychic distance stable. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of quiet craftsman. Dialogue sparse but natural when present.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentence length modulates from languid to staccato at seed split. Figurative language selective—“stink of death and miracles” lands once, earns keep. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Minor overwrite: “orthogonal thinking” and “conceptual repricing” feel imported academic diction amid otherwise tactile voice, nudging down from 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Premise—escape-room prophet grows corpse flower—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails: swap seed for any rare bloom, beats hold. Risk is quiet, not bold; no structural experimentation. Specificity of brook-side haven and Fibonacci puzzle redeems from generic. Fresh inflection: bloom becomes communal endurance ritual rather than spectacle.</comment>
