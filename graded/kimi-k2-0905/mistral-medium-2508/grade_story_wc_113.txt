<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory need for silence yet hunger to “disrupt” is embodied in the bow-groan when he pries the floorboard; the single, sustained note he finally offers is a credible renunciation of speech that costs him the safety of solitude. Ghost-as-mirror is never reduced to therapy-speak; instead her absence-in-sound forces his micro-choice to listen rather than play, which scales to the closing duet. Interiority stays concrete: damp program fibres “soft as skin,” water resisting “like a held note.” The earned stasis—he leaves without looking back—carries visible cost: dawn, extinguished lanterns, the now-dry program bearing only Clara Voss’s name.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of the dry program in his pocket reweights every prior water-stain clue, making the conceptual cost of conversation-with-silence undeniable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each stain, lantern flicker, and bow-vibration layers density until the single sustained note releases meaning. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3: Elias, flooded orchestra pit, night of performance. Persistent constraint: the water and the absence-of-sound rule-set shape every tactic, from wading to waiting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The opera house is not backdrop but crucible: water resists thighs like a held note, lanterns turn sheet music into a “topographic map of shadows,” the bow becomes crowbar—each environmental detail constrains the next physical choice. Micro-setting qualification met: the antique program’s fibre-softness and ink-bleed alter Elias’s tactile threshold and decide him to pry the floorboard. Final image—the dry program—evolves from the same object, charging closure with conceptual cost. Sensory hierarchy obeys musician POV: pitch of air-hum, vibration of strings, echo-location in blackened mirrors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can silence itself be played?—tightens once when the water-stains spell a location, forcing Elias to trade passive reading for active prying. Escalation is textural: each new stain or flicker adds density until the single note becomes inevitable; the cost is the surrender of safe silence. No reversals needed; the deepening of pattern reweights options. Agency is attention-as-endurance: he waits, then answers with one sustained note—visible price paid in extinguished light and the dawn departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: conversation need not be verbal; art completes itself in the negative space. The antique program’s migration from water-warped to dry reprises the idea that damage can restore meaning. Subtext resides in gesture—floorboard creak “in sympathy,” bow-strings “groaning”—so the duet is felt, not declared. Final image offers non-literal answer: the name Clara Voss alone on restored paper equals collaborative authorship of silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is musician-centric: silence is a “held breath,” lanterns pool “unstruck chords,” water laps “like a slow, patient tongue.” Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—colon-separated clauses act as rests. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Register stays within a cellist’s lexicon: “downbeat,” “pitch,” “crescendo.” Compression taught early (“it wasn’t a sound—it was the absence of one”) and paid off in final sustained note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—one sentence delivers object, metaphor, and emotional turn: “the dampness making the fibers soft as skin.” Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence. Metaphors are coherent: water as tongue, pit as throat, silence as vessel. No register drift. Final line—“Some conversations didn’t need words to be finished”—earns its quietude through prior sonic imagery. Prop tracking clean: program starts wet, ends dry; bow starts tool, becomes crowbar, returns to instrument.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost story as duet score, detective clue as musical rest. Trope of haunted opera house is re-animated through acoustic rather than visual horror. Risk—entire plot hinging on ink stains—pays off because stains teach the reader how to listen. Specificity: “knee-deep water that lapped like a slow, patient tongue” could belong to no other setting. Transformation test fails if relocated to dry theatre, proving necessity of flood.</comment>
