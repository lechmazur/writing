<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Veyra’s hunger to translate texture into sound is vivid, but her interior contradiction—knowing the danger yet pressing on—is told rather than shown in body. The final cost is felt: she becomes the echo, copper frozen, voice stolen. Yet the micro-choice that tips her from caution to fatal answer happens off-beat; the diamond warms, but we don’t see the precise instant she decides to speak the name. Still, the inherited flaw and the bodily price keep the arc credibly tragic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon reclaims its last translator, language dies, and the starlings inherit the script—undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric but coherent: each breath into the diamond tightens the noose of echo, culminating in the towers’ answering song. Orientation is swift—Canyon of Endless Echoes by line 3—and the single-scene window holds. The turn from passive recording to active answer is the decisive tightening; the story could use one more beat of her conscious yes, but the ending image reweights all prior matter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bone towers, copper filaments in her skin, and the flawed diamond are tactile tools that constrain every move; the diamond’s warmth is the hinge beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices wind-texture, not color—so detail never stalls momentum. Spatial choreography is clean: starlings wheel above, towers ring below, Veyra anchored at the canyon’s lung. The final image of cracked diamond in dust crystallizes setting as both grave and cradle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—record the dying language before it vanishes—tightens when the language demands a living voice in payment. Escalation is textural: each echo gains flesh until the towers inhale; the protagonist’s agency is the fatal exhalation into stone. Cost is on-page: copper freezes, voice is swallowed, starlings re-write the script without her. One more beat showing her conscious trade-off would push this into the 8.5+ band, but the pressure curve is legible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation is consumption, not preservation; to understand is to be consumed by the understood. The starlings’ final pattern is the living script that outlives both tongue and translator—quiet but chilling rebuttal to archival nostalgia. No moral is asserted; the canyon’s memory is amoral. The cracked diamond’s shift from curse to quiet gravestone reprises the theme that meaning always costs a body.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught from line 1: “copper-veined storyteller” signals metallic diction that persists to the last fractured note. Syntax mirrors breathless inhalation of echoes—clause stacks mimic wind-gusts—yet remains legible. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent: Veyra feels language as texture, sees birds as cipher, never slips into tourist-catalog gaze. Final line cadence—“echoes…forget how to die”—delivers Charged Poise with rhythmic certainty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long inhalations to staccato shards (“The diamond cracked. The flock scattered.”) without algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—wind carries “voices no living throat had shaped” remains physically believable in this world. No synonym loops; each metaphor advances stakes. One near-mixed metaphor: “copper…turned to ice” is allowable under surreal license and does not fog causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of ornithological cipher, metallurgic inheritance, and linguistic necromancy feels non-obvious and inevitable. The starlings as living alphabet rewrites the trope of lost-language stories into ecological revenge. Risk—letting the antagonist be an inhaling canyon—pays off because the rules are taught early and paid in flesh. Specificity of “copper-veined” and “oxidized metal” in skin anchors the fantastical in bodily realism.</comment>
