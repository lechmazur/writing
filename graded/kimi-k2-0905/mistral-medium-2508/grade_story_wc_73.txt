<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is mathematically particular—equations scrawled on apartment walls, the chipped die’s edge biting skin—yet the “grim optimist” label is asserted rather than dramatized. Her final refusal to step through the café door crystallizes a hierarchy of values, but the emotional contradiction between optimism and grimness remains abstract, not embodied in a visible micro-choice until that last beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the staircase’s pattern accretes meaning until the chipped die’s recursive bounce ruptures it. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Lena’s sideways leap reweights the entire climb as chosen loop rather than prison, with the smooth die abandoned as visible cost. Causality is internal yet legible: because she treats texture as truth, therefore she can refuse escape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The staircase-as-setting is rendered through tactile micro-detail—stone seams, gray haze that “peels back like fabric”—and the dice function as portable micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the die’s stutter-path maps the exact step she leaps to, making environment inseparable from agency. Gate satisfied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure tightens when the chipped die’s return-path reveals the staircase is a closed loop with one manipulable flaw; this single deepening narrows Lena’s options to sideways leap or eternal upward trudge. The cost is conceptual but felt: she forfeits the fantasy of exit, embracing perpetual motion as chosen stance. Agency is clean—no outside interference, only pattern re-cognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges recursively: missed opportunity is only valuable because it stays missed; the staircase’s flaw is the possibility of refusal. The final image—smooth die left on threshold, chipped die kept—reweights the entire ascent as aesthetic choice rather than curse, offering resonant non-literal answer to the texture she sought.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice carries mathematician’s perceptual signature: recursive, proof-driven, yet sensorially grounded (“metronome for her thoughts”). Syntax tightens under pressure—single-word sentences (“She ran. Not upward, but sideways…”)—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so register remains stable; internal lexicon stays within plausible academic-math frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density, almost no scaffolding; each sentence advances pattern or texture. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—“gray haze peeled back like fabric”—and never muddles physical logic. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative clauses to staccato leap, mirroring conceptual breakthrough. Zero loops or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The recursive staircase-as-proof is a fresh angle on infinite-loop trope; the chipped die as physical key to pattern-break feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking—sideways leap而非exit—rejects conventional escape, embracing loop as chosen aesthetics, a stance rare in portal fantasies. Synthesis of higher-math abstraction with tactile object use is singular.</comment>
