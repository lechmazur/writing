<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially embodied and character-specific; grief is mapped through synesthetic language rather than labeled. The final renunciation—leaving the bone, carrying silence—earns its cost via the long dowsing quest and the absorbed sorrow-copper taste. One hairline slip: “his blindness had been a kind of sight” edges toward tidy epiphany, but the next line immediately re-grounds the insight in the oak bark under his fingers, keeping contradiction alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stillpoint migrates inward, foreclosing further search with the ring’s cooling pulse as felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each absorbed note layers density until the final chord reweights the stake. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors (bark, loam, frozen constellations) are vivid by 120 words. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore, permissible under Accumulative/Textural track.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but instrument: frequencies bend, trees cup hands, the ring’s warming platinum translates distance into touch. Micro-setting—his skin tasting copper—constrains every step and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, press palms, exhale; no impossible positions. Environment, body, and tool jointly constrain choice and reweight the ending, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map his own grief—signaled early; tightening occurs when the melody stops and the ring’s warmth peaks, forcing the realization that the stillpoint is internal. Cost is legible: he forfeits the external trail (leaves the bone) and accepts permanent interior silence. One micro-turn suffices for 700-word lyric arc. Slight reserve: escalation is accumulative density rather than narrowed options, acceptable under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from synesthetic mapping: grief is not erased but cartographed. Final image—dawn thinning the forest, melody now his—reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo violations; the word “remember” is carved bone, not authorial nudge. Ambiguity lingers: the stillpoint wanders, inviting counter-readings of continual loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually signature: salt/copper taste, bark as braille, compass that pulses warmth. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences absorb, then abrupt stop when music ceases, mirroring heartbeat. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Elian’s fingertips. Diction stays within blind cartographer’s sensorium; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances sensorial knowledge or stakes. Figurative language is patterned—sound as liquid, grief as metallurgy—taught early and paid off in the final chord. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the forest’s inhale/exhale cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise fuses blindness, synesthetic cartography, and sonic forest into an inevitable synthesis; remove any layer and the story collapses. Risk—telling a quest for silence—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The stillpoint as internalized pause reframes grief-mapping as non-visual, a fresh inflection on familiar quest tropes. Specificity of copper-sorrow and humming bark prevents abstraction.</comment>
