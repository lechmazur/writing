<comment>Interiority is lyrically sustained but stays at one altitude; we never feel contradictory heat or doubt undercutting her drive. Micro-choices are mostly "paint / look / write" without tangible trade-off or visible price until the blank postcard—too late to test her. Earned stasis is asserted rather than dramatized; the stillness carries no bodily cost we can witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated hush/jasmine/postcard layers tighten toward the glass-page reveal. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the re-framing of silence as answer—visible in the blank postcard left for morning light; cost is the abandonment of her mural quest. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality is loose but coherent under lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Amber pavilion, stained glass, and bare feet on melting snow are tactile and selective; scent of jasmine anchors beats. Micro-setting (window panes) literally constrains the final discovery—flowers pressed inside—so environment charges closure. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room drift. Some winter/season phrasing leans archetypal but is filtered through painterly POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—"understand why flowers bloom at night"—is declared early; escalation is gradual accretion of postcard/glass imagery rather than mounting external pressure. Single meaningful tightening occurs when glass layers part, but the beat is passive revelation, not active trade-off. Cost is conceptual (abandoning explanation) rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as epistemic space—emerges through recurring hush/jasmine/glass motifs rather than exposition. Final reconfiguration ("stop looking") reweights earlier chase without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful; complexity held. Postcard line teeters on echoing the prompt but is grounded in her lived gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter: color, scent, temperature. Sentence rhythm mimics breath-holding and release; patterned "hush" repetitions are taught early and pay off at closure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Psychic distance stable; diction painterly yet within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: strong verbs ("shivered," "unfurled"), varied cadence, minimal scaffold. Occasional soft intensifiers ("thick and sweet") flirt with overwriting yet serve atmosphere. No loops, mixed metaphors, or filter stacks. High information density; each sentence advances image or interior shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Cathedral-window-as-reliquary for audible silence is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. Transformation test passes: remove glass/postcards/jasmine triad and the arc collapses. Risk lies in lyric stasis—little external jeopardy—but coherence justifies the gamble. Specific painter-craft details keep concept grounded.</comment>
