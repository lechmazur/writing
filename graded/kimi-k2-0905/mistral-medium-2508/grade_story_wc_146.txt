<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tuner’s gauntness and stained fingers are vivid, but his interiority stays atmospheric—“infinitely patient” is asserted, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown in scene; he walks, strikes, listens, never hesitates or revises. The only micro-choice—quickened pace—tracks with stakes, yet feels instinctive rather than costly. Still, his embodied solitude and the fork’s weight keep him particular; the laughter payoff lands because we recognize his steadiness as the engine.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the town’s first child-laugh reweights every prior step, cost is the endless future walks he accepts. Accumulative lens declared at line 4 (“wild hush”) and held; each fork-strike layers density until cadence shift at sunrise. Orientation anchor (who/where) secured by word 60; no debt. One causal micro-leap: fork on well-rim → water resonance felt in soles, accepted as magical without set-up, but pattern teaches lyric acquiescence, pays off in final heartbeat sync.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the fork, cobblestones, and archway each constrain gait and sound, directly enabling the revival mechanic. Visual dominance is earned—sound is the plot—yet rust/gold light, cold well-stone, and warped door give tactile anchors. Spatial choreography immaculate; we track his looping route and feel stones warm underfoot. Only gap: no olfactory or temperature shift at climax to match rising sun, but the charged fork and child-laugh fulfill the 9+ object test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the town stay dead?”—signaled in line 3; pressure grows via accretive fork-notes, not opposition. One meaningful deepening: shutter creak → chime → door swing → laughter; each new sound forecloses surrender, tightens tuner’s endless obligation. Cost is legible: perpetual vigilance, aching legs, no finish line. Antagonistic force is entropy itself; escalation is density of response, not threat escalation, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of balance-as-process emerges from iterative footfall/fork duet, never stated. Motif of echo/reprise (fork, laughter) reconfigured at end: child’s laugh is unpaid future, tuner’s silence is unpaid labor. Subtext in “you’re late”/“I know” implies cyclical duty across generations. Refuses moral; resonance is felt sonic debt. Only twitch: final sentence “Balance…was a thing you kept” skirts maxim, but cadence and image carry the abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-omniscient with perceptual signature: the town “breathes,” stones “remember,” time is measured in fork-hums—consistent metaphoric register. Syntax mirrors pulse: long clauses for sweep, fragments for struck notes. No head-hop; distance stable. Diction stays within poetic folk-tale register, never drifts into workshop gloss. Dialogue (two lines) carries indirection and regional weight. Under stress, prose compresses to drum-beat repetitions of “walk,” “strike,” “listen”—rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm impeccable; sentence variety and paragraph breath match sonic arc. No loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative density high but patterned—each metaphor is sonic or geological, sustaining coherence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Only micro-slip: “weight heavier than it should have been” is vague, but it’s first beat and immediately grounded by temple-press test. Closure beat crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Reviving a ghost town via foot-tuned resonance is fresh synthesis; eschews carpenter clichés for acoustic myth. Tuner as quiet artisan-priest feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Risk: lyric omniscience could have slid into preciousness, but concrete sonic mechanics keep it grounded. No close echoes of famous scenes. Specificity of ebony fork versus generic bell gives irreplaceable anchor. Conceptual integrity intact—never explains magic, lets cadence earn belief.</comment>
