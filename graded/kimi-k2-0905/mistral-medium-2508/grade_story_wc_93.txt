<comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—her need to see the pattern vs. the pain of foreknowing loss—are dramatized in every beat (fingers tracing sand, bleeding as she weaves dust). Her final renunciation to keep placing rocks “until the promise slept” is earned by the prior cascade of irrevocable costs: eels burn her skin, the mirror almost unmade her, aurora threads through bone. No diagnostic labels; even “cursed” is shown via searing eel-coils and dust burning through flesh. Interiority is tactile, character-specific, and the endurance costs her future agency, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each rock/dust beat thickens pattern-density until the bluff itself groans. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the promise is not hers but she crystallizes a charged poise—she will repeat the ritual nightly, frictionless world permitting. The cost is legible in the final line—her footprints are the last friction left. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: collapsed-star dust grains (warm, pulse-heavy) function as both tool and anchor—she grips them, they bite, burn, thread aurora through bone, and settle inside her, literally re-weighting her bones. The tidal bluff under aurora is not postcard scenery; its vanishing friction enables the ritual and threatens to erase her. Spatial choreography is flawless: water rises with intention, mirror forms, shards scatter. Final image of her footprints as “only friction left” recharges both dust and bluff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the world from unmaking—tightens when the mirror shows her unraveling; the only tactic left is to push dust into rock-gaps, accepting searing cost. Escalation is accumulative: each spiral painted raises aurora threads, burns skin, and deepens her lifelong servitude. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent. The felt price—eels brand her wrists, dust fuses to bone—escalates under the Accumulative lens and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: inter-generational debt, ecological grief, and the price of pattern-keeping. The promise’s true beneficiary remains off-stage, making Liora’s endurance a critique of sacred obligation. Final image reweights “dust remembers” into bodily cost—stardust now inside her bones—creating Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing; resonance arises from the eels’ star-etched spirals mirroring her painted rocks, implying cosmic recursion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression taught early: “tide had stolen the friction” signals non-standard causality; reader quickly learns to read pattern-as-anchor. Diction stays within Liora’s plausible lexicon (grandmother’s whisper, net-craft) while syntax warps under aurora pressure—fragments like “world tilted” mirror her disorientation. No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature is coastal-erosion precise. Rhythm accelerates at peak (“bluff groaned / mirror shattered”) then settles into ritual cadence, mirroring her acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or paraphrase; every sentence layers job: “dust... fine as regret” marries tactile grain to emotional weight. Metaphors stay coherent—frictionless world, borrowed dawn, ember-aurora—all serve the same physics-of-absence rule. No overwritten beat; information density peaks as rocks flake “like dead skin” while still advancing ritual stakes. Final line is clean, propulsive, and recharges “friction” as both physical and existential.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eel-herder + star-dust + vanishing-friction creates a cosmological eco-fantasy unseen elsewhere. The promise’s reversal—that she serves an unnamed cosmic creditor—flips chosen-one tropes into tragic stewardship. Risky lyric structure (no antagonist, no dialogue) heightens solitude and pays off in Charged Poise. Conceptual integrity absolute: every image spirals back to pattern, dust, tide, making the story’s vision inseparable from its form.</comment>
