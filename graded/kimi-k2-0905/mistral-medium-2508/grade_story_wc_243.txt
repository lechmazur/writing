<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“steeped the memory…until the bitterness became part of her”), but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final stance is continuation, not renunciation. Micro-choice is present—tracing the photo onto vellum—yet the cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature lifts her above stock grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covenant is “breathing,” a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (“weight of small moments like a relic, like a weapon”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of steeping, ink, bloom repeats and tightens. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality break. One shard, one transitionless scene meets scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting supremacy: jetty cracks, salt-bleached wood, closing violets constrain her kneeling stance and echo covenant fractures. Walnut-ink vial and locket function as portable setting, charging the final image. Sensory triangulation (smell of damp earth, lap of waves) is filtered through archivist’s taxonomic gaze. Environment actively shapes her method and final walk-off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of small moments”—is signaled early and tightens once: arbitrary past must become living covenant. No antagonist; pressure is temporal/contextual. Single meaningful deepening when she presses vellum to chest, foreclosing passive nostalgia. Cost is legible: she leaves the jetty carrying unbroken but unfinished covenant—options narrowed, labor ahead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through accreted images of steeping, ink, bloom: memory must be actively reconstituted, not merely stored. No moralizing; final whispered words let harbor answer. Subtext of archival labor as militant love is implicit. Euphoria-haunted tone saturates every paragraph, reweighting the past without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is color- and texture-obsessed, befitting an ink-worker. Syntax is rhythmic, clause-stacked, yet never drifts from POV lexicon. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice remains idiosyncratic. Compression (“stars were just holes…”) feels taught, not mannered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences perform atmosphere, metaphor, and micro-action. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is controlled—one sustained walnut/tea/bloom motif—never clogs the final beat. Occasional elevated diction (“regenerated covenant,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by archivist’s vocation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archival craft with coastal grief feels non-obvious; covenant-as-inked-vellum is fresh. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in closure resonance. Could swap names but not sensory palette—specificity is tethered to ink-botany lexicon. Derivative premise guardrail waived; restoration trope is transmuted through tactile process.</comment>
