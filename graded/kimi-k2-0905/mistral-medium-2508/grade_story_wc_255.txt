<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s color-blindness and plant-messaging are vivid, embodied, and motive; his fear-of-silence interiority drives every micro-choice. The “cracked vase = perfect” beat crystallizes his flaw as strength. Liora’s desire to learn the language turns the relationship into a crucible that alters both states. One hairline slip: “he’d spent a lifetime learning to love them” is a touch expository just before closure, blunting cost by telling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final concertina note and clasped hands reconfigure stakes—Elias renounces sight, Liora renounces departure—cost is the thorn still in her palm. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of plant-messages + cracked vase + reed tongues tighten until the cracked-night image reweights imperfection as beauty. Orientation clean by line 3; transitions (dawn→evening→night) are legible shards under Track B. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in “Stay” / shoulder-brush / thorn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Courtyard as micro-setting: embered cobblestones, kiln heat, cracked vase constrain every action—Elias kneels where phoenix fire still warms the earth, Liora’s hand finds his on the same wall. Sensory economy favors touch-over-sight, matching POV. The cracked vase recurs as charged object in final image, passing 9+ gate. One minor float: “low wall” spatially appears only at the end—still trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: awaken to imperfect beauty before silence returns. Escalation via plant-messages, cracked vase, and broken reed tighten options—each beat makes silence nearer, connection more urgent. Final narrowing: thorn = patience, foreclosing immediate flight. Cost is felt—Liora’s pierced palm, Elias’s audible imperfection—but scale stays lyric; no higher band without a heavier forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through image pattern: cracked vase, dandelion behind ear, thorned vine—imperfection as vitality. No moralizing; the closing “world…made sense” is character-bound, not authorial thesis. Subtext in silence/awaken binaries reweights via concrete particulars. Resonant reconfiguration lands when moonlight hits the hairline crack—undeniable conceptual repricing of beauty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s tactile POV; perceptual signature (“fingers tracing the way they trembled when he hummed”) is consistent and distinct. Rhythm modulates: long breathless accumulations vs. fragmentary “Stay.” No head-hopping; old woman’s laughter is external, not interior. Free-indirect slips clean. One micro-template: repeated “Elias [verb], then Liora [verb]” in final paragraph—acceptable under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High density: one sentence often paints, smells, and foreshadows (“rosemary for remember…ivy to soften the blow”). No loops, no scaffold, mixed metaphor absent. Sentence variety propels—initial participle for immediacy, mid-length for breath, final fragment for cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blind plant-messaging + post-phoenix courtyard + cracked vase as beauty trope feels inevitable yet unclichéd. Reed-tongue concertina re-cast as pulse/imperfect voice is specific, not ornamental. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring closure. Minor proximity to “beauty in brokenness” meme prevents 9+.</comment>
