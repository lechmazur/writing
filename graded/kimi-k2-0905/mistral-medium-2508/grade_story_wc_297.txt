<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s scars-as-compass is a vivid, body-specific motive; each burn/pull propels her steps. The interior contradiction—seeking a covenant she once ignored—keeps tension alive. Yet the older-self encounter swaps concrete micro-choice for visionary exposition, slightly blunting the final cost. Still, the earned bloom of the silver-leaf scar sells the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every maze twist is triggered by scar-pain, clipping contact, or elder-Liora’s warning, tightening options until the bridge seals. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 6 and is re-anchored after each hedge shift; no penalty. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the covenant stays eclipsed but Liora’s stance is re-configured—her scars glow, the leaf roots behind her ear, cost felt without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt hue, crushed-violet scent, and willow bark give an immediate olfactory anchor; the shifting hedge rewrites geography as lived obstacle, not backdrop. The maze-topiary clipping acts as micro-setting, its yew scent guiding turns and finally sprouting the silver leaf that charges the exit image. Environment directly constrains footfalls and scar-burn, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock the covenant before time swallows it—tightens when the chasm opens and the bridge of roots offers a one-way crossing; retreat is literally removed. Each scar pulse marks rising cost: rooted-shadow memory → yew-key burn → elder-warning. Future-Liora’s refusal deepens, not resolves, tension, forcing stance crystallization. Price is visible: the sealed chasm, the weeping sap turned silver leaf.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of heeding wounds-as-knowledge emerges through action, never sermon: scars map paths, elder-self validates listening. Motif of eclipse migrates from sky to covenant to the crescent-moon eyes, reweighting the earlier bruised dusk. Final image reconfigures meaning—covenant remains eclipsed yet personal future blooms, avoiding tidy moral. Ambiguity lingers: who else might follow the root-bridge now gone?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is lyric-embodied: “future that had already arrived,” “dreams that had clawed at her ribs,” diction stays inside a visionary sensorium. Sentence rhythm mirrors breath: long clauses for glade awe, staccato fragments during root-bridge sprint. No head-hopping; future-Liora’s voice is filtered through present-Liora’s perception as echo. Experimental compression (“the glade screamed”) is taught early and paid off at climax.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: the iterative “She…then she…” in the maze run is a taught pattern that syncs footfall and scar pulse, not template cadence. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 800 words—each charging stakes (yew key, nautilus spiral, crescent eyes). No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Opening and closing lines book-end with cobalt/scent anchors, achieving propulsive circularity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: scar-cartography + sentient hedge + elder-self blockade converts familiar “visionary quest” into bodily navigation. Crescent-moon eyes and silver-leaf scar feel inevitable yet unforeseeable, growing from yew and eclipse motifs. Risky second-self confrontation could collapse into cliché but instead withholds resolution, forcing Earned Stasis. Specificity of crushed violets and sap-weeping palms keeps the fantastical rooted.</comment>
