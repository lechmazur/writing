<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s quiet-pattern obsession is embodied in her palm-press to glass and trembling fingers; the final choice to “turn around” is earned by the spiral of coins that reweights her prior forward-chase. Interior contradiction is present but thin—no simultaneous impulse to flee the invitation—so the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. Still, the atom-by-atom dissolution supplies enough embodied price to satisfy the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the observatory reset and single note reconfigure the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—“the universe that had not yet decided to begin.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break (coins smooth, static resolves) reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“universe that had already contracted”) so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber walls, curved glass, and static bursts are filtered through Liora’s pattern-hunger; each sensory pick is purposeful and narrowed by crisis. The coins act as micro-setting, constraining her spiral placement that triggers the harmonic reset. Environment charges the final image: the same walls now gleam with dawn, making the reconfiguration legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“dissolve or realign”—is signaled early and tightens once when the spiral harmonic forecloses the option to keep listening. Cost is visible: her bodily dissolution and the universe’s erasure of prior time. Under the Accumulative lens the single deepening suffices, though the pressure curve is more lyric than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the illusion of forward motion versus the contraction that was always return. The coin-mirrors and backwards voice reweight the meaning at the end, offering a resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing or thesis line intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is pattern-seeking, sound-oriented, with restrained diction that modulates into lyric cadence at the climax. No head-hopping or register drift. The final whisper keeps voice coherence while allowing the cosmic scale shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and high-density; figurative language is selective (“static bursts… like distant Morse”) and never clutters the peak beat. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The single nit is the echo of “had always been” in adjacent sentences, a hairline slip that does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Cosmic-contraction-as-return is not new, yet the treatment feels fresh: coins as mirrors, prophecy as backwards hum, choice to re-enter an un-begun universe. Risky second-person question from the static is earned and paid off. Specificity of the black-hole-minted coin and the spiral harmonic makes the synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
