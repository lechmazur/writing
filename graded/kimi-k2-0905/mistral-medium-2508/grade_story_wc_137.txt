<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Liora’s skeptical-scientist interiority stays concrete, her grief never diagnosed, always enacted (tracing symbols until ink bleeds, palms obsidian-stained). The micro-choice to keep transcribing even after the impossible vision appears crystallizes her shift from data to echo; cost is felt when she lets the parchment fly, surrendering proof. Brother’s remembered whistle is specific enough to prevent generic loss-portrait. No contradiction under pressure; competence (star-mapping hands) paired with believable helplessness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tile’s glow fades but the tower’s hum retunes, grief re-weighted from void to resonance. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of transcription, whale song, tile warmth intensifies until space folds inward; final image reconfigures meaning without causal sleight. Orientation anchored by salt wind and brass eyepiece within 50 words; no ambiguity. Persistent cost: she forfeits verifiable proof (releases parchment) and embraces unverifiable listening—price is on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower itself functions as micro-setting: its stones soften under whale-song pressure, bending space for the closure beat—environment literally shapes the impossible reunion. Brass telescope, obsidian tile, and ink-stained fingers recur as handled tools, each state change tracked. Salt-wind scent and whale-song vibrations are filtered through Liora’s astronomer bias, never tourist checklist. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to lost brother’s presence—tightens through pattern accumulation: each transcribed symbol raises emotional ante until spatial fold forecloses skepticism. No external antagonist; pressure is internal/epistemological, sufficient for length. Escalation visible in tile warming, song crescendo, tower tremor—each beat reweights belief cost. Final surrender of parchment is felt price, altering her future method from proof to listening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief as unheard symphony—emerges through image recurrence (whale song, tower hum, tile pulse) rather than assertion. Final “unfocused” telescope reprises early star-mapping, now revalued: clarity is relational, not optical. No moralizing; resonance carried by salt-air silence after song fades. Particulars (tide-pool tiles awaiting other doubters) universalize without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Liora’s perceptual filter: whales “vibrate through the tower’s bones,” ink “bleeds into the shape of his hands.” Syntax mirrors her scientist precision yet yields to tidal rhythm—long sentences swell, fragment at vision. No filter-verb clutter; “she didn’t look away” is direct action. Register consistent; diction stays within stargazer lexicon. Voice modulates under pressure without external exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line craft is dense: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic freight without purple drift. Rhythm breathes—paragraph breaks mirror tide pull; no template cadence detected. Metaphors (space “stretches— not outward, but inward”) remain coherent, grounded in tile/tower mechanics. Minor scaffold: “the tile’s weight… felt like an answer” and later “felt like a pulse” reuses ‘felt’ but doesn’t obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar grief-via-mystic-object premise is refreshed by astronomer POV and whale-song astrophysics; tile is not teleporter but tuning fork for memory. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—pays off in resonant closure. Specific inflection: transcribing star-patterns onto grief, letting wind steal proof. Concept commits fully; no retreat to easy magic. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
