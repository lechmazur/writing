<comment>Elias’s tactile, sound-centered interiority is vivid and consistent; the moment he palms the bell lip and “lets the vibration travel…into the marrow” embodies motive and flaw in one beat. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of self-diagnosis (“not for the sound they made, but for the silence they preserved”) that edges into thesis-speak; still, the renunciation of abbot approval for wind-earning costs him social safety and is legible on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bell tolls true, the valley gains time, Elias stands in lamplight knowing he is misunderstood yet vindicated—cost is the perpetual outsider stance. Causal chain never slips: each microclimate tweak reverberates through rope weight → resonance drift → slack introduced → final clean note. Lens is causal throughout; no orientation debt.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Bell, rope, stone spiral, and alpine wind are not backdrop but tools that constrain every micro-choice; the belfry itself functions as micro-setting whose drafts and damp literally warp pitch, forcing Elias’s on-the-fly re-binding. Sensory economy is tight—cold air curling, glue scent, bronze hum—never a catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the warning reach the valley in time?”—tightens exactly once when aftertone lingers too long, revealing the new binding’s unseen consequence. The slack re-weave is a visible trade-off that could let wind steal future notes, so cost is palpable; escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the ethics of attentive maintenance versus performative authority. Final image of lamp-lit waiting reweights “listening” from quirk to civic duty without moralizing. Irony abbot will never understand is left hanging, creating honest ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance, syntax tightening under pressure—“He pulled. / The bell’s voice shattered”—mimicking cardiac rhythm. Lexicon stays within Elias’s artisanal range; no filter-verb stacks. Wind howls function as choral punctuation rather than dialogue, so voice remains uncontaminated.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion; sentence length modulates from long spiral clauses to staccato test pulls. Figurative layer is spare—metaphors of stitching, blades, marrow—each anchored to physical task. One paraphrase loop (“the valley would hear… the valley would understand”) is forgiven because it cadences the ending refrain.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Storm-siren tester is a fresh vocational lens; microclimate tuning via rope slack turns a maintenance chore into existential engineering. Solstice hush as temporal rule rather than mood garnish is an inventive compress. Minor −0.3 because premise could transplant to any high-altitude bell tower; still, particularity of whale-sinew and alpine wind resists full genericism.</comment>
