<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The reaper’s contradictory motives—his self-inflicted hollowness versus the compulsion to name others’ fears—are dramatized through the tactile act of pressing terror-shapes into monsters. His “heart had been the first thing he’d reaped” crystallizes a prior, off-stage choice that now costs him the capacity for regret, a renunciation that charges the final image. Micro-choices (pressing the spire into Leviathan, rolling the atlas into his rib-hollow) visibly foreclose paths: he can neither undo the naming nor carry remorse. The only soft spot: we never see the moment he decides to continue after the atlas warns “You’ll regret this”; the decision is elided, slightly blunting the causality of the final march.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: the reaper pockets the now-blank atlas into the hollow where a heart should be, a literal Cost that fuses tool and body while the newly-named monsters ascend. Causality holds: because he named them, they become real; therefore he must walk on, shadow lengthening with a thing that “had not forgotten.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each fear-crystal added thickens the density until the final cadence reweights the world. One hairline slip: the atlas’s warning is disembodied voice rather than a beat anchored in physical cause, but the resonance still lands.</comment>

<comment>The observatory’s fractured dome, salt-bitten atlas, and rusted telescope function as micro-setting—every surface resists or enables the naming ritual. Broken lenses scatter dying light that literally powers the crystallization, so environment dictates method. Spatial choreography is spotless: the reaper’s palm on parchment, ink lifting, monsters stretching all track cleanly. The salt-eaten margins and groaning hull-voice of Leviathan give tactile specificity that could not be transplanted to any other ruin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“to give names to nameless fears”—is signaled in paragraph five and escalates by each injection of terror-crystal into monster-flesh. One decisive tightening: when the atlas itself whispers “You’ll regret this,” the option to stop is live, yet he rolls it into his ribs, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible: the first scream he hears on the road is a direct consequence of his naming, proving the price is externalized and rising. Agency remains accumulative rather than causal-per-step, fitting the lyric mode, but the final image unmistakably reweights the world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The emergent theme—naming as sacrifice—arrives through indelible images, never exposition: the atlas ingested into the empty heart-cavity is the literal cost of turning dread into form. Subtext coils in the sailor’s unnamed terror becoming a barnacled rope; the reader intuits that every future scream pays the reaper’s debt. No moral is stated; the final line—“a good sound. A named sound.”—offers a chilling, non-literal answer to what it costs to make the unknowable knowable. The refusal to comfort the reader with redemption keeps the complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is bone-dry, maritime-gothic: “the groan of a ship’s hull splitting” as Leviathan’s first utterance constructs a perceptual signature inseparable from the reaper’s vocation. Rhythm tightens under pressure—sentence fragments mimic wax-cylinder crackle: “He played it again. / The reaper wasn’t supposed to remember. / But he did.” No head-hop; the camera stays inside the hollow of his ribs. Diction stays within a deathless sailor’s lexicon; no corporate intrusion. Elision (“He did not look back”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final line’s coiling shadow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances either fear-crystal growth or setting decay. Metaphors are disciplined—ink “unspooling like threads of shadow” keeps physical logic. One paraphrase loop appears: “The echoes were silent now. / But the fears had names. / And names were the first step toward sacrifice” — consecutive declaratives that restate rather than deepen; a −0.2 ding. Otherwise density is high: wax dust, salt, ink, and bone each carry multiple symbolic and practical loads without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of maritime folklore, cosmic horror, and atlas cartography feels inevitable yet fresh: turning “Here be monsters” from marginal warning into ontological factory. Risk is maximal—naming the unnameable usually collapses into cliché, yet here the sacrifice is literalized by inserting the atlas into the rib-hollow, a bodily stakes claim I haven’t seen. The specific detail of wax-cylinder astronomers whispering coordinates at 34° south roots the myth in verifiable tech history, preventing generic drift. Transformation test fails: swap the atlas for any other prop and the ritual mechanics collapse, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
