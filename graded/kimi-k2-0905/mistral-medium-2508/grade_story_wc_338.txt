<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precision mapper vs. intuition listener—drives every beat. The final refusal to step through until she “first would listen” crystallizes her hierarchy of values: knowledge before self-preservation. Cost is felt: she walks out with no proof, only bone-level hum. Micro-choices (threading the third reel, palm to pillar) are concrete and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the map becomes key, the silence becomes presence, the tear becomes threshold. Cost is legible in the image “no proof, only the quiet certainty.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of three films, three dawns, three seasons—culminating in cadence shift: “the vault exhaled.” Orientation anchor (vault beneath cathedral) arrives within 60 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Environment constraints: projector’s click, dripping ceiling, and pillar vibration literally shape Elara’s next move—she waits, palm to stone. Micro-setting—tear in parchment held aloft—functions as pivot object that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors sound-adjacent touch over visuals, reflecting her profession. Fresco ripple from frequency is specific, not ornamental; it enables the discovery beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decipher the silence or remain locked out of uncharted time. Escalation arrives with the third reel—her own footage—turning passive watching into active endangering. Cost is the foregone immediate passage; she trades instant entry for deeper listening. Agency is continuous: every film alignment is her literal hand-crank.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of “threshold” objects—tear, henge, dawn—each reweighted from space to time. Subtext in the final image: key without lock, map without land, silence without absence. No moral stated; resonance is in the body—hum in ribs. The whispered chapel as temporal, not spatial, sacred site is non-obvious yet inevitable after third-film reveal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: cartographer’s diction—“quiet spaces between what was recorded and what was remembered”—threads every paragraph. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for vault description, clipped fragments (“Not yet. First, she would listen.”) under final pressure. No dialogue; therefore no voice leakage. Filter verbs (“seemed to whisper”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences weld sensory, metaphoric, and causal work—“ink bled into nothingness, dividing the known coast from the uncharted gray beyond.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle. Metaphor vehicles (embers, held note) stay consistent with sound/light motif. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with mirrored breath imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: map edge = temporal threshold, henge = seasonal metronome, silence = conversational partner. Risk in eschewing antagonist or dialogue pays off via sensory–conceptual escalation. Specificity of 1923 monk vs 1989 surveyor dates roots the fantastical frame in documentary grit. Premise would collapse if any element swapped; irreplaceable alchemy of cartography + acoustics + seasonality.</comment>
