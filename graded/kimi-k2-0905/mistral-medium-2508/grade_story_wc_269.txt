<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete—her habit of tapping the *two-quick-one-slow* rhythm anchors every beat—but the contradiction between scientific duty and grandmother-myth never collides on the page; the moment she steps onto the impossible road, her choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled. The torn atlas page is handled twice yet never becomes a tactile pivot in her hands; its emotional charge is asserted, not dramatized. Because the stakes leap from data-keeping to metaphysical pilgrimage in one sentence, we see no visible cost paid for abandoning protocol—no hesitation that costs her skin or信誉. What keeps this from the 9-band is the missing micro-choice where her rational self visibly loses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the station lights dying behind her while the road keeps humming reconfigures both world-rules and Lena’s stance with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern repetition (tide-gauge *clink-clank* morphs into road-pulse) reweights meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is anchored by word 90 (“station hummed”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. The only drag is the single paragraph of off-stage Collapse backstory; although under 20 % and anchored to the atlas page, it still momentarily pauses present pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sea-level station is not backdrop but instrument: its pilings, tide gauges, and flickering generator light constrain every move and finally flicker out to charge the closing image. Micro-setting objects—resin-coated desk, green sonar screen, barnacled stones—are handled in real time and alter tactics (the sonar stutter teaches her rhythm can re-write topography). Sensory hierarchy obeys Lena’s technician eye: she notices millimeter increments before color, metal before salt smell. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, water, and the impossible road track cleanly across the final wade.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can hidden coastlines be summoned back—tightens once, decisively: the sonar line appears, then the road surfaces, foreclosing retreat. Pressure escalates by pattern intensification (rhythm → visible path) under Accumulative lens, satisfying the single-deepening requirement for this length. The price is conceptual rather than bodily: the station’s depth drops to zero, erasing her life’s data—felt cost rendered in the alarms blaring behind her. No visible resource loss alters her bodily tactics, keeping it shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the coast that refuses to be erased is never named “hope” or “memory,” yet the final image of ink running from the dissolved atlas page reweights all prior logging as love letter rather than science. Subtext lingers in gesture—Lena’s palm pressed to warm stone repeats her grandmother’s boat-hull gesture, implying continuity between tech and myth. The piece invites counter-readings: is the road real or mass hallucination? No moral is extracted; the world simply reconfigures, leaving reader and protagonist in charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice carries a technician’s compressed lyric: “millimeter increments,” “depth readings flatlined,” yet can pivot to “ghost of a shoreline” without register drift. Perceptual signature is sharp—Lena sees the world as data first, myth second; the narration keeps that hierarchy. There is no dialogue; hence dialogue bullets are waived. Syntax mirrors tide: longer sentences for slow rise, staccato fragments when water recedes, all taught early and paid off at the road-reveal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is loop-free; no paraphrase or template cadence obscures meaning. Figurative density spikes only at two hinge images—“metronome counting down something no one could name” and “ink running like tears”—both earned and pattern-justified. Sentences do double work: “The station hummed…clink-clank” sets atmosphere while foreshadowing rhythm method. The only micro-slip is “as if listening,” a faint filter verb, but it passes under character-based license.</comment>

<comment>The fusion of climate-science realism with folkloric “eternal tides” feels fresh and inevitable; the story commits fully to the premise that geography can be periodic. Risk is taken in the lyric, non-causal escalation, yet closure remains legible. No trope is borrowed wholesale; even the “lost road” trope is re-cast as data-sonar glitch. Specificity—barnacled stones warm underfoot, ink bleeding into literal tide—grounds universality in irreplaceable detail.</comment>
