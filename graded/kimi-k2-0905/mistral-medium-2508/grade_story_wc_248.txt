<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drives—rescue/erase, create/destroy—are alive in every beat; the final match is the earned cost. Interiority is concrete (“volcanic tenderness erupting”) and never diagnostic. Micro-choices (key turn, ledger burn) trace a clear value hierarchy. The vandalized portrait as self-map is a flawless externalization of flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ledger’s ash reweights “mercy” from sin to gift. Causal lens holds: each fire is because/therefore anchored to the promise. The tapestry’s whispered clue pays off the slashed-face map. Cost is unmistakable—empty pockets, unmarked hands—at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archive-as-womb, soot-as-scent, and the silver key’s cold against bone give tactile micro-setting that constrains the final key-turn. Desert wind and dawn glare evolve with the emotional exit. Spatial choreography is clean: pillar crack → key seam → ledger reveal. Setting never stalls; every detail is filtered through arsonist-acolyte perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“save the world from the promise”—tightens once: discovery of ledger converts archive from tomb to womb, forcing the burn. Escalation is causal under lens: each artistic breadcrumb narrows options until only erasure remains. Visible price is dramatized: the ledger’s names, her first entry, turned to ash. No coincidence; fire is agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrent fire/forgetting imagery: memory is violence, mercy is erasure. Subtext in “the promise was the fire” reweights promise from sacred to destructive without moralizing. Final smoke-curl question lands as CR, not assertion. Emotional aftereffect—chill of dawn after auto-da-fé—lingers unsentimentally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, incantatory, POV-locked: “archive smelled of charred parchment and old regret” establishes perceptual signature. Syntax mirrors descent: long fever-dream clauses narrow to match-strike fragments. Diction stays within Elias’s esoteric lexicon; no filter-verb drift. Unreliability is subtle—he hides the ledger’s meaning from himself until the seam opens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“tapestry’s threads, frayed but stubborn”) carry triple duty: sensory, metaphor, foreshadow. Rhythm accelerates into final short beats, breathes at “He lit a match.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent (embers ≈ question). Opening and closing images bookend without symmetry clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist as midwife of forgetting, library fire as mercy. Self-portrait slashed into map is non-obvious transformation of vandal trope. Conceptual risk—burning the archive twice—pays off via causal logic rather than shock. Particularized detail (infinity loop with her initials) prevents template abstraction.</comment>
