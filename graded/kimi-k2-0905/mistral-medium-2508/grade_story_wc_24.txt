<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—goggles cracked, key worn smooth, pulse roaring—and his contradictory dread/curiosity is on-stage while he turns the key. The micro-choice to release the key at climax is earned by the prior bleed of the ship and the father’s dictum, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Flaw: the “gatekeeper” self-relabel is slightly overt; still, the embodied emotion and flawed hesitation keep him credibly human.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ship sight → key heat → Elias releases = because/therefore chain that reweights the premise. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: releasing the key forecloses reunion with the lost crew and leaves the notch in the bow as permanent price. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the black water vomit and the new notch—tangible, irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The brass heart, cracked goggles, and black water are tactile, bias-filtered through Elias’s profession. The horizon line that “wavers like heat haze” and the fjord’s swallowed quiet after the ship vanishes charge the final image, meeting the 9+ micro-setting gate. Spatial tracking of theodolite, pipes, and deck remains coherent; no filler exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clocks might unravel him—tightens when the key grows warm at 73 and the air burns at 51; options narrow to “hold or release.” The protagonist’s agency (release) drives the final reversal and avoids full collapse. Cost is felt: new notch in key, black water on stones, silence that swallows aftermath. One visible price rule met.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—time as chosen, not measured—emerges through the father’s aphorism and the final re-notched key rather than thesis talk. Subtextual silence of the fjord after the ship vanishes reweights earlier “quiet” as complicity. No moralizing line; the image of the notch reframes Elias’s role from shepherd to complicit gatekeeper with lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is perceptual, metallic, salt-stiffened: “gears groaning… water through veins of copper pipe.” Syntax shortens under stress—counting fragments—without losing clarity. No head-hop; free indirect stays clean. Diction stays within clock-keeper lexicon; “chronometric anomalies” is Bureau jargon that Elias would plausibly mock-internally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally: long aqueous clauses vs. staccato counts. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is spare—“pendulum swinging wide as a scythe”—and does not clog the high-pressure beat. Black water / notch imagery returns with reweighted meaning, avoiding decorative repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Time shepherd” and hydraulic clock-tending feel freshly synthesized; the father’s inversion—“the clock turns the key”—offers a non-obvious conceptual twist that the ending pays off. The notch as irreversible price is a specific, memorable inflection. Risk of near-steampunk cliché is transcended by fjord gloom and bodily cost.</comment>
