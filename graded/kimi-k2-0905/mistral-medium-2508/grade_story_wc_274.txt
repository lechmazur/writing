<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—compliance vs. truth—are dramatized in the warm-paper moment and the terminal keystroke; the smile under gunfire shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse scandalized the stillness”) and avoids label-speak. The martyr tag is external; her internal calculus is fully legible. Competence balanced with genuine jeopardy; no safe moral hedge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: warm letter → keystroke → replication → bullets; each beat tightens options. Closure is Charged Poise—archives “speak back” with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no debt applied. The final martyr scroll is external confirmation; the protagonist’s decisive act is complete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frost-laced ledger, pneumatic tube, blue flare of consoles—select tactile details filter through archivist POV. Snow-hushed cathedral metaphor underpins stakes: silence = held breath before scream. Micro-setting of isolation chamber constrains the keystroke. Spatial track clear from alcove to spiral stairs; no geography drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. annihilation—signaled in letter’s first line; escalation via irreplicable scandal broadcast. One meaningful tightening: keystroke narrows every future to martyr or fugitive. Cost paid on-page: the bullets. Coincidence absent; antagonistic pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as insurgency—emerges from Elara’s micro-choices rather than exposition. Final image of falling snow / speaking archives reweights earlier “hush” without moralizing. No redundant thesis statement; “they’re rewriting the thaw” remains the sharpest articulation. Ambiguity accepted: revolution’s success unmeasured yet undeniably launched.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains cryogenic archivist perceptual signature: temperature, metal smells, date misalignment obsession. Syntax alternates between compressed clauses under pressure and lyric spill at the end. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts smoothly. “Cathedral of secrets,” “treacherously alive” read as voice-permitted elevation, not register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: frost-laced spine, burnt-copper ink, ozone scent—each noun doing double duty. Rhythm accelerates into staccato bullets without scaffold. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay consistent (snow/shroud, light/blade). Minor filter-verb cluster (“should have hurt. Instead, it felt”) forgiven in collapse beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen library as totalitarian memory furnace is fresh synthesis; cryo-archivist trope rotated into data-martyr role. Specific detail—pneumatic tube suddenly alive, warm paper smelling of old lies—prevents generic rebel arc. Risk of martyr ending accepted because foreshadowed by “she’d just given it a voice.” Sufficient transformation to evade derivative guardrail.</comment>
