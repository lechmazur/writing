<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity trait is concrete—he follows the ghost signal into the atrium despite knowing it’s outside protocol. The moment he touches the glove and sees his own child-face, contradictory impulses (terror/recognition) collide on-page, forcing a renunciation of his former “only the living” stance. Cost is legible: he kneels, the aid dies, and he accepts dual clientele. Interiority stays specific to him; no stock labels intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph reappears in his palm with the child’s face now clear, reweighting his professional identity under the dead’s claim. Causal chain holds: curiosity → follow signal → touch glove → witness → accept witness role. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty. One shard, single POV, one tightening beat; cost is felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Glass dome fracturing twilight, damp-stone scent, and the hearing-aid’s warmth are filtered through Elias’s tracer priorities. The bench, glove, and photograph function as micro-setting; the glove’s texture triggers the climax. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. Environment constrains the final choice: the atrium’s silence after the mist vanishes mirrors his new vocational silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he heed the dead’s plea?—is signaled in line 3. One tightening: touching the glove collapses his option to remain only a living-world tracer; the price is instantaneous sensory assault and lifelong witness burden. Pressure escalates under causal lens because each beat (whisper → pulse → glove → scream) is a because/therefore linkage. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the vision is earned by his choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—listening as moral obligation to the forgotten—emerges through the glove-to-photograph trajectory rather than exposition. Subtext resides in the smudged child-face that later resolves into his own, implying the dead are family he once erased. Final image reweights “assuring the vulnerable” to include the dead without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the child literal or symbolic? Complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual bandwidth: metallic taste, static hum, fractured light. Syntax tightens under stress—“the mist screamed—not a sound, but a pressure”—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows at climax. Distinctive diction (“echoes weren’t meant to stay buried”) remains consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence often performs atmosphere, characterization, and plot advancement. No synonym loops or template cadences detected. Metaphors stay coherent (mist as pressure, photograph as memory contract). Strong verbs replace modifiers—“the mist curled,” “static hissed.” Final paragraph varies rhythm to create cadence of acceptance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ghost-whisper via obsolete hearing aid gives fresh spin to post-mortem accountability trope. Incidental heroism is inverted: he saves no one yet accepts perpetual witness, a non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity of tracer protocols and 1940s photograph grain roots the fantastical in lived detail. Risk in merging dead child with his own face pays off thematically without gimmickry.</comment>
