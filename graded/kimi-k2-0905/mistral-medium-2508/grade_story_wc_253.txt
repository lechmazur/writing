<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—performer reflex vs post-Mandate stillness—propels every beat: the pocketknife, railing balance, bouquet discard. Embodied grief is precise (wood curls “like shed skin,” face “smooth mask”), never diagnostic. Final offer to teach whittling shows earned micro-choice that forecloses isolation with visible cost (shared relic). Moral ambiguity sits in her refusal to fake happiness; flaw complicates without safety-hedging. Only cap is single-POV default; no relationship crucible or status swing tested on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence accumulates texture until scream breaks pattern. Closure is Charged Poise—scream swallowed by turbines, then shared bouquet—reconfiguring hush from imposed to chosen. Cost legible in “raw, ugly sound” and cracked mask. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: Mandate aftermath shapes every tactic; final image of split bouquet shows new social contract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Farmhouse/turbine dyad is lived-in: porch splinters, radio dust-exhale, boots kicking residue. Micro-setting object—pocketknife—constrains choice and charges ending when shared. Sensory hierarchy obeys grief: smell of nothing, mechanical mourning. Spatial choreography clean: railing balance, scattering petals, east-field can. Environment mirrors interior without overt symbol; turbines as “slow, indifferent gods” filtrates through Lena’s performer irony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Lena break the performed stillness? Pressure tightens once: scream renounces Mandate hush with audible cost. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; pattern break suffices. Escalation driven by her agency—knife set down, climb, scream—cost felt in throat and socially (Harkin as witness). Persistent constraint: happiness tin burned, bouquet split, silence remade into mutual labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refusal to fill silence with lies; no explicit thesis. Subtext in gesture: bouquet crumble = grief ossified; whittling = active griefwork. Final image reweights “remade hush” from oppressive to cooperative. Avoids sentimentality; scream is ugly, not cathartic slogan. Dramatic irony: reader sees turbines as indifferent long before Lena vocalizes it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: performer’s eye for staging (“chorus of mechanical mourning”), hospital-flashback idiom. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for held breath, fragments at scream. No dialogue contamination; Harkin’s grunt is staged. Diction stays within farm-bound lexicon; no academic register. Compression taught early (“performer once…”) and paid off at railing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Density high: “happiness tin…fire didn’t even cough” compresses history & futility. Metaphors precise and non-contradictory; turbines as gods never violates physics. Rhythm accelerates into scream, then exhales. Proofreading clean; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-utopia griefwork via whittling & scream. Turbines as indifferent gods avoids eco-cliché by staying inside performer metaphor. Mandate happiness tin transformed from prop to ash rather than recycled symbol. Risk—quiet ending without cathartic triumph—paid off by Charged Poise. Specificity: forget-me-nots & lavender chosen for preservation irony.</comment>
