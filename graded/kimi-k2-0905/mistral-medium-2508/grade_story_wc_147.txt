<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory drives—guilt vs. need for absolution—are embodied in micro-choices (uncorking vial, pressing wrist to nose). The renunciation of diving is credibly earned, but the interiority occasionally drifts into poetic self-diagnosis (“the hush had taught her the weight of words”) that flattens peak emotion. Still, the character-specific sensory bias (salt, violets, jellyfish light) keeps her singular. Cost is visible: she trades the sea for dry land, carrying the perfume ghost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perfume mist, signal decay, and temple silence layer until the final Charged Poise (“she was done answering”). Orientation is anchored by line 4; no causality breaks. The cost—she forfeits the abyss and her old self—is legible in the last paragraph. One minor scaffold: “the signal still waited, patient as the dark” repeats the patience motif without new pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment as micro-setting: the vial, rebreather timer, and jellyfish dome constrain every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Liora notices corrosion patterns, not tourist grandeur. Spatial choreography is clean; distance to surface and oxygen maths stay consistent. Final image of jellyfish above intact temple recharges the opening vista, now weighted by her refusal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt vs. obliteration—tightens when the signal dies and the hush offers erasure. One meaningful deepening: perfume mist rising “like veins of light” forces the trade-off between memory and silence. Cost is visible: she surfaces with “clear water” in the vial, proving the hush was spent on her. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, but coherent under chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges non-didactically: trauma cannot be outrun, only carried differently. The perfume ghost becomes the quiet emblem of that burden. Final image—wind-borne violets—reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: refusal is neither triumph nor defeat, just stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric-cinematic texture: fracturing blue glow, slow jellyfish stars, “gathered hush.” Syntax modulates from clipped panic to languid surrender, mirroring pressure shifts. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext through sensory indirection. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she swore she caught”) and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and plot data. Metaphors are coherent (signal = dying heartbeat; hush = frayed silk). One paraphrase loop: “she pressed her wrist to her nose and breathed deep” echoes prior perfume beat but earns reprise by charging the final loneliness. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold clutter in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater-gothic rescue turned meditation on carried silence. The “gathered hush” as consumable resource is non-obvious and followed to logical endpoint. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Specificity of salt-violet scent keeps the concept from drifting into generic haunt.</comment>
