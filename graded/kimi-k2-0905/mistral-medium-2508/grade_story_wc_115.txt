<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority—skepticism braided with heir-of-guilt craving—shows in micro-choices: pocketing bolts, pressing ear to valve, radio-silence as shield. The swallowed-thread myth is embodied, not exposited, tilting his appraisal into self-indictment. Final refusal to flee crystallizes the hierarchy of values, cost felt in the lighter wheel: earned stasis under causal lens. Only minor hedge: the psychic-voice tag drifts toward label-speak, blunting peak embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because father’s static confession → therefore Elias descends; because appraisal → therefore valve turn; because turn → therefore apparition & pressure exhale; earned stasis ends story with felt conceptual cost (“his ghost shift just begun”). Closure lands on-page, wheel lighter, meaning reweighted. Orientation taught early; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—wheel as confession-urn—shapes final tactics and image, satisfying 9+ cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tunnel, valve wheel, and water-sump function as micro-setting that constrains every move: crunch of glass under foot, valve’s brass jaw, black water climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s picker-eye—weight, rust, wet wool, rot-sugar—never catalogued but filtered through stake of “weight.” Final image reuses beads-as-rosary, fusing environment to interior guilt. Meets 9+ gate: tool/wheel charges closing beat and reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confirm/disprove swallowed truth—tightens once when appraisal of valve couples auditory hallucination; option set narrows to “turn or retreat,” price paid in drenching apparition that implicates family guilt. Escalation causal, single meaningful tightening sufficient at this length. Cost visible on-page: wheel weight loss = confession exhaled; protagonist agency drives turn. Situational pressure coherent; coincidence complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited complicity emerges through concrete heirlooms (bolts, valve, thread) rather than thesis. Subtext coils in radio static as secular confessional opposing mother’s candles; no meta-commentary. Final image re-weights “ghost shift” from factory lore to personal watch, inviting reflection on repeating cycles without moralizing. Could edge higher if psychic’s platitude were subtextually deeper, but ambiguity sustains complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s sensory idiom: “picker-eye,” “ribs of rusted track,” valve “molared jaw,” diction mining diction yet precise. Rhythm swells from deliberate openers to staccato lunges during geyser, mirroring breath. No filter-verb glut; compression taught early (“static three nights prior”) pays off. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; psychic’s cliché safely external, shattered. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence propulsion high: figurative density surfaces only at key beats (“tunnel exhaled damp”) and is patterned, not scatter-gun. No mixed metaphors; valve-as-jaw holds physical logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances knowledge or texture. Minor scaffold: over-fondness of em-dash phrases in radio snippets, but artifacts fall outside closure third, so 9+ pathway intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: industrial-gothic ghost-shift merged with talk-radio spiritualism, inheritor scavenger as pilgrim. Thread-inside-girl myth particularized by picker’s tactile appraisal; not generic haunt. Risk in lyrical elision (apparition one second) paid off by conceptual reweighting. Derivative guardrail waived: tropes transformed through concrete occupational detail. Could nudge 9+ with sharper socio-economic angle, but ingenuity solid.</comment>
