<comment>Voss’s skepticism-turned-reckless-commitment is visceral: the laugh when the ground splits is the exact beat where career-long disbelief ruptures into surrender. Interiority stays concrete—“fingers sticky with sap,” “breath came fast”—never abstract self-analysis. The final reach toward the diamond is earned because every earlier choice (eating the fruit raw, kneeling) embodies the same hunger to know. Only flaw: no secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible unused; still, the self-confrontation is sufficiently costly.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard transmuted from conspiracy site into living cure, refracting Voss into multiplied futures. Causal lens holds throughout—each image (letters, pit, diamond) tightens the because/therefore chain toward the valve revelation. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“wasteland orchard”) and the 120-word window clears with spatial clarity (“six feet wide, lined with lead sheets”). Cost is unmistakable: his body vanishes, the radio voice confirms the price is transmission itself.</comment>

<comment>Setting is a kinetic actor: the stillpoint’s ozone thickness pushes against skin, the diamond’s crack reroutes light and fate. Micro-objects—sap, cracked goggles, fruit skin—constrain tactics (eating raw to survive, lenses smeared yet still sharp). Spatial choreography is flawless; distance collapses when the pit’s lead sheets force him to kneel, aligning body with buried valve. Final image of fruit humming heartbeat on dashboard re-anchors the transformed environment as living organism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs survival—tightens when the stillpoint reveals the Liquidation was quarantine, not cover-up. The single reversal (“the lie that kept them alive”) narrows his options to either seal or release the cure; he chooses release with bodily annihilation. Cost is legible: disappearance + radio voice inheriting the message. Pressure escalates under causal lens—every discovery increases personal jeopardy rather than mere information.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of Voss’s life creed: lies can be life-support, truth can be fertilizer for something alien and green. Subtext operates in image: fruit thriving on buried horror reframes “conspiracy” as ecological symbiosis. Final heartbeat-fruit offers resonant non-moral answer—cure and catastrophe indistinguishable. No therapeutic summarizing; meaning stays lodged in the hummed fruit and multiplying reflections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is grimy, irradiated, sentence-level propulsive—“wind howled through skeletal trees” sets cadence. Diction stays inside Voss’s lexicon: bureaucrats, spreadsheets, valves, static. Compression taught early (“not secret cabals, but bureaucrats”) pays off in final garden inversion. No dialogue, so no register clash; perceptual signature—light-bending noticed through cracked goggles—remains consistent and character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or synonym churn; metaphor vehicles (“broken mirror,” “eye of the storm”) stay internally coherent. Rhythm accelerates into breathless final paragraph without drumbeat monotony. Minor over-density in three adjacent figurative phrases mid-story (−0.2) but never near closure; final line earns its silence after heartbeat-hum.</comment>

<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard as living valve feels genuinely new; diamond-as-seed rather than cursed MacGuffin flips trope into ecosystem logic. Stillpoint concept re-prices familiar conspiracy plot into bio-quarantine myth. Risk-taking—protagonist erasure without exposition—works because imagery groundwork (fruit, roots, static) is laid early. Synthesis of bureaucratic evil + alien horticulture is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
