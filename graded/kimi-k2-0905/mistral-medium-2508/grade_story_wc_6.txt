<comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s blood versus healer’s drive—are alive in every beat: she kneels in the same black sand that once drank her father’s fire, threads his luck-coin into her fire-coat, and uses the same red thread to bind a stranger’s wound. Interiority stays concrete (“the coin’s weight steady against her ribs”) rather than diagnostic; her compassion is shown through tactile micro-choices, not labels. The final stance—she will keep running toward smoke—costs her the village’s verdict forever, a price legible in the boy’s blood-darkened thread. Only a slight over-tidiness in the closing epiphany (“compassion wasn’t the absence of fire…”) keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because her father burned, therefore she stitches cooling coin to coat; because the boy bleeds, therefore the thread reprises. One continuous scene anchored by word ~60; orientation never wavers. Closure is Earned Stasis—she refuses to let ashes define her, foreclosing the village’s script at the cost of perpetual suspicion; the coin’s darkened thread is the visible price. Micro-turn inside the scene (wound-binding) tightens stakes without breaking causality.</comment>

<comment>Obsidian lagoon, black sand, and fire-coat function as micro-setting that literally constrains action: the jagged grains cut the boy, the mirror-still water reflects the sky’s gold verdict, the coat’s hem becomes surgical field. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices heat-memory in sand before she notices the child. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel → thread → stand → bind → help to feet, all tracked. Final image reweights the lagoon from mirror to lullaby, a cadence shift that charges closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: prove scars can sing—her own and the boy’s—signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the boy’s wound forces her to test her ethic publicly; refusal to flee costs her social credit on-stage. Cost is visible—blood on thread, coin dulled, village whispers crystallized. No artificial escalation; single tightening is sufficient for 750-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from reversal of fire’s meaning: destruction → warmth, scar → song. Subtext lives in objects: drilled coin once carried by arsonist now carries boy’s survival. Final image—“the scar would fade, or it wouldn’t. Either way, it would have its song”—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight deduction for explicit thesis line about choosing to warm not consume; still, complexity lingers.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter: “kelp-drift peace,” “rough and crackling like dry kindling.” Syntax mirrors pulse—long lyric coils calm, then fragment when the cry cuts. Dialogue minimal but natural; boy’s trembling question and her idiomatic reply carry subtext. No head-hop; distance clean. Voice modulates with pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: lapping clauses mirror lagoon, then staccato verbs (“She didn’t hesitate.”) under alarm. High information density—each sentence advances image, emotion, or causality. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (fire, salt, mirror). Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive. Minor tic: three consecutive sentences beginning “She…” in the final beat, but not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter—tilts familiar redemption arc, but specificity of volcanic sand as wound-tool and coin-as-suture reinvents it. Synthesis feels inevitable: fire lineage becomes healing instrument. Risk taken in quiet lyric ending rather than set-piece blaze; coherence holds. No close echoes of famous scenes; transformation passes proximity test.</comment>
