<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The tutor’s contrition is embodied in the tactile obsession with the tapestry threads; each tug externalizes guilt. The girl’s single spoken line crystallizes the relational crucible and forces the tutor’s micro-choice to kneel and re-weave. Interiority stays concrete, but “learning to beat without shame” drifts toward diagnostic-speak, blunting the edge. Change is earned, yet the absence of visible flaw-cost on the page caps intensity.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the board is reset, laughter thaws, and the tutor stays—cost is the lifelong exile now accepted. Causal lens holds: because he re-weaves the tapestry, therefore the village exhales. The platinum labyrinth returns as a mirrored “way back,” re-pricing the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors land by line 3.</comment>

<comment>The tapestry’s frayed edge functions as micro-setting that literally guides fingers and conscience; its evolving texture tracks emotional thaw. Platinum labyrinth’s metallic veins hum—sound-as-touch—making the abstract maze tactile. Spatial choreography is flawless: kneeling, palm-to-floor, then seated at hearth. Weather/thunder is filtered through bodily rhythm, not backdrop.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early; the labyrinth tightens memory into embodied pressure. One meaningful tightening: the tapestry confesses “You were right to doubt. But wrong to leave,” forcing active re-weaving. Cost is felt: the tutor forfeits the option to flee again. No external antagonist, but internal conflict scales appropriately to length.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the re-weaving act itself—scars become pattern, not sin. Subtext lives in silence: villagers watch “not as spectators, but as witnesses,” implying communal absolution without dialogue. Final image of the board remaining after tapestry vanishes reweights material guilt into ongoing play. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic, earned.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrichromatic third-person hovers close to tutor’s sensory filter: “frayed threads of the woven hush.” Syntax mirrors fidget—short en-dash bursts, clause-stacking. Rhythm breathes with scene: frantic tug-sentences slow into hearth-side cadence. No dialogue till the girl’s single line; its plainness contrasts effectively with ornate surround, keeping voice distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “threads whisper fragments: a pawn’s sacrifice…” collapses backstory into noun-phrase shards. No scaffold or synonym loops; metaphor stream is controlled. One mixed vessel: “fierce repose” juxtaposes oxymoron successfully, but “thunder’s lull deepened…inside him” momentarily blurs physical/acoustic logic. Final line is spare, propulsive.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time + chess-guilt + tapestry-maze synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable. Conceptual risk—village as memory-mirror—pays off without gimmickry. Transformation test fails generic swap: the specificity of “fourth move missed” binds premise to character. Minor deduction for echoing Rilkean “you must change your life” trope in quieter register.</comment>
