<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied signing of “forgotten songs” gives concrete interiority; Liora’s camera-stance crystallizes her quiet charisma under threat. Contradictory impulses—map vs. disrupt, remember vs. consume—play out in simultaneous micro-choices (lunging toward the faceless singer). The earned cost is legible: the camera’s new weight forecloses casual nostalgia. Minor slip: “quiet charisma” is once label-speak before it is staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the harbor’s silence is re-priced as *alive*, the camera’s heft the visible cost. Accumulative lens holds—each empty click layers density until the flash reweights the rule-set. Causality is clean: signing → waves rise → faceless thing unravels → camera drinks. No orientation debt; moon/tide anchors arrive by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor, camera body, and signing hands together function as micro-setting that constrains every tactic. The moonlit water’s shifting glow literally directs the color-chord crests that defeat the antagonist. Spatial choreography is immaculate: camera strap, finger-blur, water-crest positions track without drift. The vintage brass’s final heaviness is environment-object fused with emotional cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“steal back what time erased”—tightens when the faceless singer appears; option set narrows to *disrupt or be consumed*. Agency drives escalation: Liora’s toward-lunge, Elias’s signed *now* directly summon the chromatic wave-response. Cost is visible: camera gains irrevocable weight, harbor’s silence is no longer empty. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring silence→music transmutation: memory is not retrieved but *performed* into new medium. Subtext in gesture (empty shutter as heartbeat), not thesis. Final image reweights premise: silence is no longer absence but *latent song*. No moralizing; complexity intact—camera now hungry, price unpaid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers just above Elias’s perceptual field, filtering every detail through sign-language kinetics and chromatic sound. Syntax mirrors tidal rhythm—long wave sentences crash against fragment flashes. No head-hop; Liora’s interior is read only through her camera-stance and velvet-blade diction, maintaining distance. Patterned elision (“signs for sounds that had no voice”) taught early and paid off in color-chords.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; no template stems or synonym churn. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Metaphors stay physically coherent (moon fractured into notes). Single soft filter-verb cluster “seemed to breathe” is voice-motivated and immediately grounded by tactile breeze.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sign-language poetics + empty-camera necromancy + chromatic wave-music. The “mouth-only” singer is a specific, non-generic monster born from the premise. Risky lyric compression taught in line 1 and honored at closure. Without these exact elements the memory-heist collapses; swap any part and the harbor stays mute.</comment>
