<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—scientist vs. poet, preservation vs. personal haunting—are dramatized in the mortar-sealing beat; the inherited inkwell and the Keeper letters give concrete ancestry to his vocation. The final smile and ledger trade show a visible cost: he surrenders the inkwell to inherit the Keeper’s obsession, foreclosing a “normal” life. Interiority stays specific and embodied; no label-speak. The dead Keeper functions as off-page pressure, not a second character, so relationship crucible is waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias exchanges the inkwell for the Keeper’s ledger, accepting perpetual custodianship; cost is legible in the smile that follows the loss. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each submerged artifact and answered note deepens the pattern until the final trade crystallizes it. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at closure. One shard, single POV, default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The pavilion’s drowned marble and algae-slick chandeliers are filtered through Elias’s surveyor gaze; every sensory note guides his trowel or pen. The inkwell’s brass warmth against his hip micro-functions as setting-as-tool, constraining the final trade. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment directly supplies the note crack that triggers the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve meaning from abandonment—tightens when he answers the stranger’s note and seals it, narrowing future options to perpetual archive. One meaningful deepening: the Keeper’s ledger reweights the stake from casual surveyor to inheritor. Cost is visible: he gives up the inkwell and any exit from the obsession. Accumulative escalation suffices under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as an active, collaborative repair—emerges from the mortar-&-note ritual rather than exposition. Final image of “one hushed blaze at a time” reweights earlier light/dark imagery without moralizing. Subtext in the note exchange implies mutual rescue across centuries. Ambiguity is preserved: we never know if the Keeper received her answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—surveyor’s measurements, ink hue of dried violets, the ache of cracks. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for submerged reverie, staccato when the carp shadow intrudes. No head-hopping; diction remains within his lexicon. Voice-specific metaphor (“iron teeth locking the past”) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances action, e.g., “he knelt at the waterline, where the stonework split like a wound” simultaneously reveals setting and triggers the note find. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent. One filter-verb cluster (“he wondered… he thought… he woke”) is brief and voice-motivated. Final line lands with cadence shift that propels closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—drowned ballroom as archive of anonymous letters—feels fresh yet inevitable. The note-dialogue across centuries transforms a gothic trope into a quiet epistolary ghost story. Specificity of the Persian-ink lineage and surveyor’s tools prevents swap-out with generic relics. Risk is taken in the quiet, non-horror treatment of haunting; coherence holds.</comment>
