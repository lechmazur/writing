<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—archive vs. annihilate—are alive in the tearing of the poem; the renunciation costs him the last relic of his censored past and is earned by the storm’s literal rewrite of his words. Interiority is concrete (“ink-stained fingers,” “mouth full of silenced verses”), never diagnostic. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: poem > timer > timetable > wind. Flaw (scars as cartography) complicates rather than moralizes. No second character, so status and relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the scattered poem reweights “cartography of scars” into lived scale, cost felt in the empty envelope. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift (timer chimes, storm edits) tighten the stake without causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50. No lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the blank timetable and zeroed timer foreclose any future bus-route anonymity—he must now write forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory glass, rusted workbench, and cracked dome are handled, not wallpaper; the leaking pane literally re-inks the poem. Micro-setting (body as atlas) constrains the final self-definition. Sensory hierarchy narrows to storm-touch and ozone under pressure. Spatial choreography holds across spiral descent. One minor weather cliché (“sky turned ocean”) does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice vs. erasure—signals early and tightens through two timer chimes and the literal erosion of the poem by rain. Escalation is textural: each tear halves the archive until none remains; the cost is the irretrievable loss of the censored original. No coincidence; storm complicates, not resolves. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, still foreclosing the path of preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of ink, salt, and torn paper rather than thesis: “the map of his scars had finally found its scale.” Subtext lives in silence—timer runs backward, poem bleeds outward—never moralized. Final image reweights “atlas” from metaphor to skin he now carries empty-handed. No sermon, no tag-line epiphany; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, pattern-taught compression (“furiously tranquil,” “storm-kissed wonder”) stays legible under Accumulative lens. Perceptual signature is poet-sighted: ribs as landscape, timetable as destiny, salt as border. Rhythm modulates from long accumulative sentences to staccato fragments at the tearing beat. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated (“he let himself wonder”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry double duty: “the poem in his hands was the same” compresses memory + present object. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensorium or choice. Metaphor stack is deliberate and paid off—storm as editor, scars as roads. One mixed metaphor (“clouds unraveling like a censored line”) is minor amid otherwise coherent figurative logic. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: censorship enacted by weather rather than regime. Synthesis of obsolete bus timetable + darkroom timer + poet’s body creates idiosyncratic ritual unavailable to another name/place. Risk—letting the text be physically destroyed—pays off in irreplaceable loss. Not 9+ because the core “artist vs. silence” premise is familiar; the weather-editor twist is the main inflection.</comment>
