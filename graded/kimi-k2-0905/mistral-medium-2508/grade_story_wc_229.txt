<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is richly textured—micro-choices like rolling the cork or inhaling salt-laced lavender embody his mother’s creed without exposition. Contradictory impulses (prove whispers / fear ridicule) coexist in-scene, culminating in the earned renunciation of the cork itself. Harkin’s softening is credible because the object’s pulsing warmth is dramatized, not declared. The only hairline slip is “throat ached with the effort,” a stock somatic cue amid otherwise fresh embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse shifts from warning beacon to resonant invitation, cost visible in Harkin’s pocketed secret and the fishermen’s slower hands. Causal chain holds—because Elias risks the scent-whisper, therefore boats turn and keeper lore reweights. Orientation is anchored by 80 words (“cobalt lighthouse,” “lantern room,” “first fishing boats”). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative pattern (vibration → scent → return) teaches itself early and tightens at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s iron ribs, the cork’s ridges catching on callouses, and the salt-lavender air are not decorative—they constrain tactics (scent as silent horn, cork as proof). Micro-setting triumphs: the lantern room’s spent wick becomes the pivot from oil to intention. Spatial choreography is flawless; boats’ prows “shift like dogs” tracks distance and agency. Environment charges the final image: the structure groans in receptive, not warning, key.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove quiet pulls outperform brute blasts—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Elias must sustain the lavender note while visible skepticism watches. Cost is legible: physical ache, risk of mockery, and the cork’s retirement once belief is won. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. The single deepening suffices for 700-word scope; persistent constraint (scent’s fragility vs. horn’s blast) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: intention as vibration, silence as agency. Subtext lives in gesture—Harkin pocketing the cork replaces apology. The final image of “soil dark and waiting” reweights the mother’s purification creed into forward-looking cultivation. No moralizing; the tenderness is screaming only in precision, not sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: maritime metaphors (“like a bruise against the pale dawn”) and synesthetic slips (scent as sound) stay within Elias’s keeper-bred sensorium. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for the scent-ritual, staccato “He didn’t answer” under Harkin’s challenge. No head-hopping; Harkin’s softness is observed from Elias’s stance. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“Elias breathed in”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high: “the lighthouse’s bones, low and deliberate as a held breath” compresses atmosphere and stakes. No loops or synonym churn; “vial cork” recurs with accruing meaning, not repetition for padding. Metaphors stay coherent within maritime physics. One near-muddle—“tender, screaming only in its precision”—is saved by the surgical follow-up clause. Final line lands clean without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The whisper-versus-shout premise reframes lighthouse lore without genre gimmickry. Specificity anchors freshness: cobalt paint humming post-heatwave, mother’s cork as tuning fork, garden-scent herding steel boats. Risk in choosing lyric scent-ritual over action set-piece pays off in earned resonance. Could nudge higher if the mother’s fever backstory had been pruned to a single sensory cue.</comment>
