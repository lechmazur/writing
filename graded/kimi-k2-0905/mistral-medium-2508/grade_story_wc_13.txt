<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elspeth’s interiority pulses through concrete, illustrator-specific perception: ink-bleed moths, gravity-defying brushstrokes, the pendant’s hum against bone. Her contradictory impulses—preserve/erase, sketch/let fly—collide in the canal dip and jar-hurl, earning the final storm of living moths. The boy’s “ancient eyes” pressure her choice, but he stays too symbolic to shift relationship status; still, her micro-choice hierarchy (art vs. city survival) is legible and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pendant warmth cues → canal key → jar sacrifice → moth return, each because/therefore tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s breathless pause and sky-filling moths reweight time’s rule-set with felt cost—her sketchbook forever un-inks itself. One mild orientation drift: “the place where echoes are born” floats untethered for ~150 words, but the canal-hand-up moment retroactively anchors it, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop canal as vein-of-time micro-setting directly shapes the climax: water receives the jar, rewinds the boat, births the silver echo-leash. Sensory hierarchy is illustrator-biased—ink viscosity, stained-glass wing-veins—grounding abstract time in tactile surfaces. Spatial choreography stays clean: parapet → boat below → canal surface → upward moth spiral. Setting constrains the final choice; without the black-ink water the jar sacrifice fails, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the moths or lose city/art—signals early via disappearing specimens. Escalation: ink key → echo voice → boy’s bargain → jar payment; each step narrows Elspeth’s options under causal lens. Cost is visible: her released heartbeat-jar dissolves, leash dissolves, sketchbook empties. Pressure tightens once decisively; no multiple reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—artistic creation vs. temporal debt—emerges through moth/image erosion rather than thesis. Subtext whispers in gesture: she hurls her own “heartbeat” to postpone giant’s wake, implying art must sacrifice its blood to stay alive. Final moth storm reconfigures meaning: what was pinned now flies, reversing collector instinct. No moralizing line; resonance lingers in un-inking silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains illustrator’s perceptual signature: ink bled upward, canal as black glass, echo-leash silver-slick. Rhythm flexes with pressure: short clauses at cliff-edge (“Wait—”), then lyrical upward spiral. No head-hop; boy’s interior withheld, maintaining mystery. Diction stays within artist lexicon; phrase “stained glass wings” reappears with shifted weight, taught pattern paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “pendant…hummed against her collarbone whenever the city’s rhythm faltered” packs exposition into sensory hit. No loops; each sentence advances image, action, or rule. Metaphors (time as ink, canals as veins) stay coherent and mutually reinforcing. Final line “And the echoes—well. They were only just beginning to speak” lands with sparse propulsion, recharging silence motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“City as sleeping giant’s body” reanimates urban-fantasy trope via illustrator POV and inverse canal anatomy. Borrowed-time interest paid in living moths—not clichéd aging—feels fresh. Synthesis of art-creation & temporal debt is non-obvious; removing illustrator vocation collapses causal chain. Risk in lyric, open ending widens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
