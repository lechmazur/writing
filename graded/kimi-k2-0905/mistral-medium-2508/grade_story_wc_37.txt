<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Liora’s grief-laced obstinacy is lived in every beat; her bleeding fingers and cracked voice make the cost visceral. Contradiction is shown, not told—terror of the method vs. bone-deep duty—until she surrenders to communal release. The final smile carries earned stasis: her solitary burden dissolves because she finally lets it, a renunciation charged by decades of prior isolation. Voice specificity slips once—“diagnostic” interiority that labels her own throat-burning—but not enough to shear the arc.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each trapped shard, quivering leaf, and returned harmony layers density until the greenhouse itself becomes a tuning fork. Closure is a Charged Poise: the villagers’ entry crystallizes a new communal option while Liora’s outstretched hands show the price—her voice is spent, her keeper identity ceded. The first gold vein in the split leaf is the visible cost that reweights the world-rule. Pattern taught early (memory → shard → song) pays off in the final dissolve of mica, no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Glass fogged by root-breath, mica windows trapping half-remembered dreams: every sensory detail is filtered through Liora’s keeper gaze and directly constrains her method. Spatial choreography is flawless—trees lean, branches weave, distances track as she kneels and bleeds into soil. Micro-setting rule met: the greenhouse itself acts as crucible, its air thickening with returned dawn that forces communal choice. Setting never drifts into postcard; instead it tightens around her throat like a noose that only collective song can cut.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—realm-death vs. personal obliteration—is signaled in the first paragraph and escalates through each failed shard until the orchard “shudders…hungry.” One meaningful deepening: the moment Liora realizes the mirror world is not just dying but starving for the very memories she hoarded; this flips her from extractor to donor. Cost is repeatedly legible: bleeding fingers, burnt throat, spent voice; final price is her keeper identity dissolved into choral body. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her persistent song under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal knitting emerges from enacted song, never abstract assertion. Subtext operates in gesture: mica windows shatter into “sugar in tea,” re-pricing memory from private hoard to shared sweetness. Final image—villagers blinking in unfamiliar light—offers resonant non-literal answer: identity is transitive, light is loaned, not owned. No thematic echo sentence; the sugar simile is the closest, but it is earned within sensory action, not prompt-speak, so −0.1 only.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter: “mica windows set into their bark—thin, translucent sheets that trapped fragments of light like half-remembered dreams.” Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses when her throat burns, longer lyric sweeps during communal swell. No head-hopping; even the villagers’ arrival is given only through her bodily sensation of harmonic vibration. Occasional elevated diction (“swaddled,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register slightly above her keeper idiom, but the slip is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence layers new texture or causal push. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: “root-breath” returns as literal exhalation that fogs glass; trapped sunrise becomes live dawn. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay inside arboreal/alchemical logic. Information density high—one line can set, characterize, and foreshadow (“silver leaf quivered, then split open, revealing a vein of gold”). Final third clean: no artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mirror-world orchard that metabolizes communal song into literal dawn feels freshly synthesized; not a trope checklist but a singular metaphoric engine. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure, communal POV entry at end—heightens resonance without gimmickry. Specificity of mica windows as memory panes and alchemical trees as dawn-forgers is irreplaceable; swap any part and the causal logic collapses. Transformation test passed: story fails if re-skinned into generic fantasy.</comment>
