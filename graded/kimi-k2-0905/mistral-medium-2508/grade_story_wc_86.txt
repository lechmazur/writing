<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—trading lives while clinging to a talisman of neutrality—drives every beat; the micro-choice to offer the drawer-pull instead of intel crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Kaelis’s hesitation and nephew-memory are shown through gesture, not label. The boy’s raw wrists embody cost, but his one spoken line drifts toward therapeutic abstraction, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore links—drawer-pull offered → nephew freed → war limps on. The final image of swallowed footprints is a Charged Poise that reweights neutrality as a persistent, costly stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or causal amnesia. Cost is legible in the boy’s torn skin and the general’s surrendered cache intel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The parapet’s slick stones and windblown mist constrain footing and dialogue timing; the chasm’s void mirrors the unbridgeable moral gap. The drawer-pull’s micro-setting—moonlit tarnish on stone—becomes the decision pivot. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sight under storm urgency. Environment actively shapes the handshake and the boy’s first free step.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—neutral negotiator’s credibility vs. boy’s life—tightens once: intel offer for nephew, no second reversal. Escalation is causal under storm-clock; moon-phase mention adds texture but doesn’t drive the turn. Price is visible: cache lost, boy freed, negotiator’s neutrality further eroded. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: neutrality is not erasure but active, costly breathing space. Drawer-pull reprises as both gift and burden, reweighted by Kaelis’s brother-memory. Final image—footprints swallowed—offers non-literal answer: forgiveness must be walked, not traded. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the war’s continuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature favors tactical metaphors (chess, seeds, levers) and weather-filtered attention. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses during handshake. No head-hopping; Kaelis’s interior accessed only via gesture and breath-fog. Voice modulation under pressure is controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from storm-gust fragments to longer reflective coils without algorithmic pattern. Information density high: “windblown stones slick with mist that curled like ghostly fingers” does three jobs in nine words. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent. One clause—“recycling mistakes into wisdom”—edges toward aphorism but is earned by prior scene work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar war-parley terrain is refreshed by negotiator-as-seed-trader metaphor and the drawer-pull’s re-purposed leverage. Moon-phase tie-in risks ornamental but stays subordinate to human stakes. Risk: neutrality-as-choice rather than place feels freshly articulated. Transformation test passes: swap names and the seed-and-lever logic collapses.</comment>
