<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Eli’s interiority is vivid—his calloused hands, fogged breath, lantern trace—yet the decisive shift from isolation to porous witness is asserted more than dramatized; the star’s flare answers a whispered “I see you” without visible cost or contradiction inside him, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station walls “learn to breathe” and Eli walks out carrying starlight; the cost is the risk he accepts when alarms blare and he stays—causality holds under Accumulative lens. One transition (night → morning) is clean; orientation is anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cracked lantern glass functions as micro-setting: its fracture guides Eli’s finger, its glow bends starlight, its healed state signals the cosmos’s answer. Sensory triangulation—cold glass, ozone wind, vibrating dome—filters through Eli’s janitor gaze, constraining the final choice to leave with the lantern.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: solitary caretaker vs. cosmic abandonment. Pressure tightens when the single lingering star demands recognition; Eli’s refusal to flee the breach costs him obsolete safety and reweights his life toward witness. One meaningful deepening—alarms vs. stillness—sufficient for 700-word arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges through image chain: dust wiped, glass cracked then whole, station ribs breathing. No moralizing; final image of Eli as porous bridge reconfigures the premise without statement. Ambiguity lingers: is the cosmos benevolent or merely reciprocal?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Eli’s perceptual filter: “ghostly heat linger on his skin,” “scent of ozone and old metal.” Rhythm swells with participial cadence during meteor sigh, then shortens to declarative stride at departure—pattern taught early, paid off in final still line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, metaphor, and micro-action. No loops or scaffold; figurative stack (“veins of starlight,” “bridge between the fallen and the yet-to-be”) stays coherent because physical logic of light-through-cracks is maintained. Final line breathes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cosmic-janitor-meets-sentient-meteor could tilt twee, but grounded tool-use (wiping dust, tracing fracture) and risk-cost keep it fresh. Stillness-as-invitation reweights usual “lonely watcher” trope; healed lantern glass is inevitable yet surprising. Slight risk hedged by familiar lyric cosmos.</comment>
