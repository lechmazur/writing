<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “quiet, adaptive patience” is dramatized in the ukulele scene and the eclipse gamble; his childhood memory and tuning-fork tic give individual texture. The final micro-choice—handing the vial to Mira— crystallizes his vocational creed and costs him the keepsake, so the arc earns its shift. Interiority occasionally slides into therapeutic platitudes (“ordinary magic,” “always known how to sing”) that soften contradiction. Still, embodied listening as action carries the characterization above midpoint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s first hum and the ridge’s answer reweight the stakes for all three characters with felt cost—Elias forfeits the talisman, Lila forfeits guarded grief, Mira forfeits silence. Causal linkage holds: eclipse invitation → hum → ridge resonance, each step growing from Elias’s prior‘listening’ tactic. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the single flashback shard is cleanly cued and loops back to present pressure. One soft spot: the “ridge sang back” beat is asserted rather than dramatized through sensory cause, a micro-gloss but not a break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is sketched with selective desert sensorium—sagebrush, iron-tasting air, root cradle— that doubles as emotional geography. The vial and tuning fork act as micro-settings, constraining the final transfer gesture. Spatial choreography stays clean across the three bodies and props. Sensory hierarchy narrows under eclipse darkness, mirroring Mira’s contracted then expanded voice. The environment does not merely backdrop; its humming stones supply the acoustic catalyst that makes the closure plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Mira’s voice—signaled at Lila’s entrance and tightened by the eclipse deadline. Elias’s agency drives both invitations (studio → ridge) and the vial transfer that triggers the hum; the cost is the surrender of his own relic and the risk of public failure. Ridge resonance supplies external pressure but arrives as coincidence rather than earned escalation, blunting the final click. Still, the tightening sequence narrows options to one irreversible moment, satisfying short-form escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges through action, not aphorism; the eclipse merely amplifies what Elias practices daily. Baby curl → vial → transfer traces a silent motif that reweights from memento to instrument without overt statement. Final image of “breath-like melody” offers Charged Poise that answers the core question: voice returns when heard, not fixed. Avoids sermonizing; even the title is withheld until after resonance, letting particulars carry the abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays tight to Elias’s musical perception—metronome shirt-twist, tuning-fork pocket, “pulse thrumming like a plucked bass string.” Syntax breathes with crescendo/Release pattern matching eclipse arc. No head-hop; Lila and Mira remain externally focalized, preserving distance. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual cost,” “ordinary magic”) nudges out of desert vernacular but frequency is low and pattern-taught early, so voice keeps its license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose loop-free, high-density; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are organic—roots drinking rain, thread of spun gold—and stay within acoustic palette. Rhythm modulates from long pastoral lines to staccato eclipse clauses without algorithmic pattern. No strained register in peak beats; “ordinary magic” leans therapeutic but is earned by prior dramatization. Final line avoids uplift cliché, landing on inhalation imagery that mirrors the story’s first gesture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Music-therapy + eclipse + singing-land synthesis feels fresh, avoiding miracle-cure trope by making the catalyst communal listening rather than spectacle. Baby-curl vial supplies a portable acoustic resonator—an ingenious reframing of keepsake logic. Ridge-as-instrument risks echoing magical-realist shorthand, but local specificity (sagebrush, iron air) roots it. The risk is moderate, the payoff coherent; ingenuity lies in scaling the cosmic event down to a single exhaled note.</comment>
