<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the clock’s promise while engineering an escape from that same stasis—are dramatized in embodied beats (winding the silent clock, splicing the reel, carrying both instruments toward the door). The final piano chord is an earned renunciation whose cost is visible in her “steadying” hand and the arbor’s settling branches; no path remains open behind her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the reunited pair stand in a new room while the arbor itself exhales, re-weighting time and love under the rule-set Lena has re-cut. The causal chain—film splice → needle lock → door materialize → clock restart—pays off every prior constraint; the cost is the projector’s death-flare and the horizon’s irreversible swallowing of daylight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The arbor’s “gnarled branches above the clouds,” the salt-yellowed ivories, and the ozone-and-paper annex form a tactile tri-level set that gates every move: climb, play, splice, enter. Spatial tracking stays clean—projector beam, pocket compasses, swinging pendulum—all converge on the threshold without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Lena re-open a future already declared closed—tightens once via the film-door reveal; the price is the permanent burnout of the projector bulb, a felt loss that forecloses any second replay. Agency is hers alone: splice, walk, play, speak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the re-pricing of time itself: mechanical clock-time is revealed as editable celluloid, love as a cut that can be re-spliced. No character articulates a moral; the final image of two pianos facing across a restarted pendulum lets the reader feel the new affordance of shared latency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lena’s perceptual filter—wind “hummed through the leaves like a half-remembered tune,” compasses “shuddered.” No head-hop; free-indirect cadence modulates with breath and footfall, climaxing in the knife-edge exchange “You’re late / So are you,” where indirection carries apology.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job—image, motion, pressure—without synonym churn. Metaphors (clock “warm,” ozone “smelled of old paper”) stay consistent to the salt-air station register. Final bulb “burning brightest just before it died” is a surgically placed image that accelerates into closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The sky-tide arbor, spliced film map, and magnetic-compass love sonar synthesize into a fresh speculative grammar; without any one piece the logic collapses. Risk—treating film editing as literal world-editing—pays off because every splice carries a material cost (bulb, celluloid, door) rather than magic fiat.</comment>
