<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—her palm against the gauge, the dream of equations—but the “logical dreamer” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. The final ascent to “infinity” reads as serene acceptance rather than a costly renunciation, so the closure feels gifted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of lanterns → gauge → grandmother image tightens into a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by word 80; the final “infinity” needle spin is a Charged Poise that reweights hope as perpetual ascent, though the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Tide-polished grotto is tactile—salt air, spirals, lantern light on wet limestone—and the gauge acts as micro-setting that constrains every decision. Spatial choreography stays clean as Marina moves from shelf to waterline to sky; the fracturing brass fractures echo in the closing infinity spin, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“map the thin places and reach grandmother”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via each tide-borne fragment and lantern launch. The meaningfully tightening moment is the forty-ninth lantern spiral that lets her glimpse grandmother; the cost is oblique (she gives up single-timeline life) but landed conceptually at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: hope as inter-dimensional mathematics rather than moral. The closing image of “mathematics of hope itself” reframes earlier equations without sermon; ambiguity lingers—she chooses diffusion into infinity, not rescue—creating resonant after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric, precise, slightly elevated diction suits a physicist-poet narrator; patterned repetition of “trial balloons,” “equations,” and “gauge” teaches its cadence early. No head-hopping; perceptual signature—light bending through fractures, salt-weighted air—remains consistent and intensifies at the infinity spin.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers science, grief, and geometry. Minor scaffold: “she’d discovered…she’d mapped…she’d found” triplet; one paraphrase loop on “hope equations.” No metaphor clash; rhythm breathes with lantern rises; closing paragraph propels to Charged Poise without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum hope + tidal grotto + Fibonacci lanterns + vanished balloonist grandmother. Risky dimensional calculus is committed to fully; specificity of phosphorescent-ink spirals prevents swap-out. Not wholly novel ingredients, but the combinatory logic and lyric delivery feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
