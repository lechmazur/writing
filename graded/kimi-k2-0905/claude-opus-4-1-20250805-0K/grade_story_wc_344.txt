<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical yet concrete—her fingers “feeling for the tumblers beneath the frost,” the memory of starlight lost—so motive never abstract. The contradictory impulses (vault-fixing ambition vs. the gentler “listen to the locks” epiphany) braid tightly; her renunciation of force is visible in the final climb-down, costing her pride. Micro-choices (how she arranges the gears, uncaps the tube, watches mirrors frost) show hierarchy of values without label-speak. Still, village stakes remain more declared than embodied; we never feel a villager’s cold, so the cost is anticipatory, not palpable—holds just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gears’ song reframed from tools to teachers, the next eclipse now a site of listening, not forcing—felt cost is her relinquishing certitude. Causal chain is lyric-elliptical yet intact: each prophecy shard discovered → mirror epiphany → gear-hum → stance flip. Orientation (who/where/when) crystallizes within first 120 words; no disorientation debt. One soft spot: the “village in darkness” stakes are told late and never tested in-scene, so the Decisive Change is more conceptual than physically dramatized—keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric engine: ice walls that refract dawn, mirrors that frost over to reveal truth—environment directly shapes her tactile choices and the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias—she notices gear-tooth details, mirror temperatures, not tourist vistas. Micro-objects (brass wheels, leather tube) act as mobile “setting” that constrains hand-position and pacing. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body moves between ladders, podium, descent. Lacks only a live weather obstacle (wind, altitude effect) that could have raised stakes further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—“repair something broken within herself”—is signaled early and tightens via each prophecy shard that reframes her lock-picking creed. Escalation is accretive: density of mirror-images rises until the gear-lotus reconfiguration; no external antagonist needed. Agency is interior (learning to wait) but still forecloses the “force” path with visible cost: she descends without opening the sky-vault now, accepting three-month wait. Price would resonate more if village darkness were physically tasted rather than summarized—hence short of 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “rhythm of repair” emerges through sonic motifs: singing gears, soft hush, mirrored memories—never abstractly asserted. Final image reweights “driftwood holds the memory of the sea,” equipping her new patience with oceanic timescale—an earned, non-moralizing CR. Subtext in prophetic fragments operates by implication, inviting reader to assemble eclipse/lock/lotus equivalence. No tidy symmetry: she leaves powerful, still exiled from immediate redemption—ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, frost-bitten: “spires catching the hauntingly bright glow,” “words swam before her eyes”—diction stays within artisan-poet lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for awe, staccato triads for gear-clicks. No dialogue, so no register clash; free indirect thought is consistent. Perceptual signature is particularized (she hears gears sing when wind touches). One tiny lapse: “hauntingly bright” is repeated descriptor; elsewhere brightness is reframed inventively—keeps it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and plot data without scaffolding. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; paragraph lengths breathe with beat shifts. Metaphors are coherent (mirrors = memory, gears = teachers) and avoid purple layering. Only near-micro flaw: two successive “she found / she understood” leads create faint echo; otherwise propulsion is clean. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed vehicles—closure line is crisp artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frozen cloud-library + eclipse locksmith + memory-mirrors is a fresh genre splice; star-machinery gears as pacifist mentors invert steampunk trope. Core images feel specific to this text, not transferable without rewriting stakes. Risk of driftwood nostalgia motif could slide into coastal cliché, but here it’s saved for final reprise that re-weights patience theme. Not quite a 9 because the eclipse vault concept remains somewhat abstract—reader supplied cosmology rather than concrete rule shown early.</comment>
