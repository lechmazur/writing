<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s quietly rebellious drumming and final stance are motive-consistent and escalate; interiority stays concrete (“Each tap… created ripples”). Cost is felt in her bodily dissolution, but the beat-level contradiction is more asserted than dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the system inverts, Mira’s consciousness seeds an autonomous dream-field—cost is the loss of her singular self, signaled in “thirty-seven became infinite.” Causal linkage holds: tap-coded resonance → subnet → fusion → inversion. Orientation clear by word 50; lens (Causal) stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystalline barrier, auric lagoon, acoustic flowers—each is handled in action (Mira presses, waters rise, flowers bloom from her pattern). The garden’s resonant lattice constrains the climax: it physically broadcasts the inversion. Micro-setting (injection site, drum surfaces) tightly fused to POV sensory filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory agency vs corporate harvest—tightens once: her encoded rhythms hijack the extraction engine, foreclosing her survival but birthing collective autonomy. Price is her bodily death, legible on-page. Single meaningful turn sufficient for 700-word scope; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—consciousness as creative force, not capturable data—emerges through imagistic action (lagoon spills, garden sings) rather than statement. Final “nursery for dreams” reweights prior auric sorrow without moralizing. Subtext in drumming codes and corporate euphemisms (“participant”) enriches political edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly elevated register sustained and justified by transcendent premise; perceptual signature sharp (“frequencies only the dying could hear”). No dialogue to test, but free-indirect texture remains consistent. One micro drift: “the universe exhaled” edges toward cosmic grandiloquence yet fits closure’s repricing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphor chains; no synonym loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphor risk in “auric lagoon/aurora sorrow” is acceptably coherent under poetic license. Rhythm accelerates into short, pulse-like sentences during inversion beat, mirroring cardiac fade—line-level craft supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harvest-into-creation inversion feels fresh; drumming-as-code and subnet of prior patients offer specific mechanics absent from stock “memory garden” trope. Emotional specificity—patient-numbered anonymity vs communal song—grounds concept. Risky lyric escalation pays off in legible reconfiguration at close.</comment>
