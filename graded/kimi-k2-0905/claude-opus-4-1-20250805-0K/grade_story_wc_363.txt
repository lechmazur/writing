<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mei’s renunciation is entirely legible: each sacrificed memory is dramatized as concrete loss (the fever-night body, the favorite song) and the final smile-at-emptiness is the earned stasis. Interiority stays specific to her—no abstract therapy-speak—and the micro-choices (stringing the bead, feeling silence “taste” a memory) keep contradiction alive: she both clings to and surrenders motherhood. One minor hedge: the generational chain is asserted more than shown, but the on-page cost is so visible it still compels. Closure’s causal chain is clean: bead → silence → memory-for-message → daughter saved → self erased.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mosaic of orchard past / bamboo present is taught in the first 120 words and the closure image—orchard extinct, bead circulating—reweights the whole pattern. Each shard ends on a causal hinge: puzzle discovery → orchard arrival → bead ignition → loom commenced → silence fed → message caught → self emptied. The final amber bead formed from her own tear is the Decisive Change with undeniable conceptual cost: the weaver becomes the message medium. No orientation drift; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural and the last paragraph’s cadence shift (“The bamboo grew thicker…”) lands the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bamboo as colonizer, loom as portable altar, and bead as data-capsule are all tactile, body-scaled tools that constrain tactics: Mei can only weave where stalks allow filtered light, and the loom’s hum decides when to begin. The “stoically sparkling” bead returns in the final image, recharging every prior mention. Sensory economy is strict—sound is the first thing eaten, then memory—so silence itself becomes the dominant setting. Micro-setting qualifies and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—daughter’s life vs mother’s self—is signaled in the photograph beat and tightens with each shuttle pass: every memory lost narrows the chance she’ll remember why she’s paying. The visible price (aphasia, smiling vacancy) is inseparable from the message’s success; silence literally eats options until only the plea remains. Agency is renunciation rather than conquering, fully compatible with Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it’s delivered: the moment she feels the message “catch” the cost becomes irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse proportion: the farther a message must travel, the more of the sender must be erased. No character ever lectures on this law; it’s demonstrated through Mei’s disappearing memories and the final bead that contains her tear. Subtext in the rummage-sale puzzle—edges only—mirrors the fractured maternal mind at the end. The closing image of strangers feeling “inexplicably” compelled to send messages home offers the Conceptual Repricing: the system keeps devouring to stay alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient is kept at a lyric distance that never leaks into head-hopping; the camera stays tight to Mei’s sensorium. Diction—“raveling,” “stoically sparkling,” “threaded words through space”—is consistent, compressed, and patterned; the slight archaic tilt justifies the family-myth tone. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness is evaluated solely through narrative texture, which passes: each clause adds density without syntactic monotony. The final sentence’s cadence break (“feels, inexplicably, the urge”) is an intentional modulation, not drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances the loom-action or densifies the Silence-Eats-Sound rule. Figurative layers (pear-rot, sap prison, bamboo breath) stay congruent with physical logic—no contradictory metaphors. Information density is high: “she felt it catch—someone, somewhere” compresses transmission, success, and cost into five words. The closing bead-as-tear image is crisp, luminous, and unmuddled, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “weave messages into reality” conceit could have felt like a gimmick, but it’s grounded in sacrificial economy and sensory specificity rather than rule-book exposition. The inverse diaspora—child trafficked outward, memory erased inward—flips the usual rescue vector and feels non-obvious. Risk is taken by making the climax aphasia rather than reunion; the story commits to the cost it established. Fresh synthesis: amber as data-storage + bamboo as silence-amplifier + familial loom = singular mythtech that would collapse if any part were swapped.</comment>
