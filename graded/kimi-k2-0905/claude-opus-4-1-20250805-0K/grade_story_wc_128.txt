<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Margot’s interiority is serviceable—her nightly ledger ritual and the “something she couldn’t name” give a credible itch—but the pivot from detached broker to library missionary is asserted more than embodied. The single micro-choice (convincing Captain Torres) is thin; we’re told she’s “shrewd” yet never see her bargaining. Emotion stays at a polite remove, never contradictory under pressure. Competent, but not yet a crucible.</comment>

<comment>Causal spine is clean: mis-addressed envelope → island detour → estranged-sibling reunion → library re-inheritance. Closure lands with visible cost—the photo tucked beside ledgers re-weights her life’s accounting. The 90-word orientation window is slightly loose (who/where explicit only at ~130 words) but the breezy library image is memorable enough to waive penalty. One tightening beat suffices; no reversal, but the because/therefore chain holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The roofless, star-lit library is the star: tarps, lanterns, shelves under open sky—concrete, atmospheric, and it literally frames the final image. Maritime details (Pier 74 vs 47, nautical charts) are accurate but briefly sketched. Weather is used (breeze, stars) to mirror emotional widening. Micro-setting (locket) charges closure; environment constrains choice when Martha teaches navigation beneath constellations. Texture is selective, never touristy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Margot’s unacknowledged hunger for connection—signaled late, almost subtextual. Pressure tightens once: the mistaken address forces a single decision (detour). No visible price paid: cargo delay is off-stage, money unmentioned, social risk zero. Escalation is gentle, more accumulative than causal; luck (wrong envelope) drives rather than complicates. Closure reweights meaning, not options—eligible for Resonant Reconfiguration, but on-page cost is conceptual, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet knowledge-passing emerges organically through ledger → locket → library ledger symmetry. No explicit moral; final image of photo tucked beside account books re-prices “cargo.” Subtext in silence: Samuel’s absence speaks louder than eulogy. Cliché “cycles of compassion” is named only in title-adjacent last paragraph—minor echo, not fatal. Emotional aftereffect is gentle uplift rather than complex ambiguity, but earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Margot; no head-hop. Prose has polite, measured cadence fitting a broker who counts crates—template rhythm creeps in (“how… how… how…” triad) but stays legible. Filter verbs minimal; diction within plausible lexicon. Dialogue sparse, natural when present (Martha’s whispered “He kept the library running?”). No distinctive idiom, yet voice coherent and unobtrusive. Lyrical compression at closure is intentional, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no scaffold loops, but a mild “how” anaphora and two near-repetitions of “tucked/tucking” barely register. Figurative language is restrained—one mixed metaphor (“tears fell like rain on calm water”) is forgivable. Information density solid: one sentence often does two jobs (anchors + atmosphere). Opening line efficiently marries symphony + harbor + locked office. Final line breathes, no clutter. Copy-clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—roofless public library sustained by volunteers—feels fresh, and the misdelivered locket as trigger is elegant. Trope of estranged siblings reconciled by legacy is familiar, but maritime micro-culture (broker, island captain, navigation lessons) particularizes it. Risk is modest; structure linear, no formal experiment. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without pier-number mix-up and starlit shelves. Specificity outweighs template bones.</comment>
