<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and concept-driven, but the veiled dreamer’s wants and fears remain abstract—“to find the library of unspoken words” is never translated into a concrete, personal stake that could be lost. The only micro-choice—lifting the veil—reads as symbolic rather than a costly renunciation, so the Earned Stasis feels intellectual, not visceral. Character-bound knowledge is cleanly maintained; the absence of embodied contradiction under pressure keeps the score from climbing higher.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of propagation delays taught early, closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as “the pause before speech” is re-valued. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately mist-softened but pay off in the final transparency image, so Orientation Test is waived. Cost is legible in the future-self letter that forecloses exit—she is now archivist, not visitor. Minor slip: causality between documenting delays and the library revealing itself is asserted, not dramatized, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glowing library, mist, and watch function as micro-setting that constrain perception and pacing; the backward-ticking watch literally paces the protagonist’s movement through knowledge. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (amber light, humming shelves) and integrates into the concept of delayed information. The final transparency image recharges every prior delay, meeting the 9+ gate. Only the marble steps feel like tourist-catalog filler, a hairline drag.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map the silence-pattern before the farewell letter arrives—is signaled early and tightens when the watch ticks backward, forcing her to notice propagation delays. Escalation is textural: density of symbols increases, cadence of shelves grows louder, options narrow to “document or miss the window.” Visible price: she becomes the next invitation, foreclosing ordinary life. Could use one concrete loss (time, memory) on the page to reach 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the accumulation of pauses: silence as generative, not empty. The final image—“infinite potential of the pause”—reweights all prior delays without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture (lifting veil) and Conceptual Repricing rather than spelled insight. Avoids thematic echo; the librarian’s line is observational, not thesis. Stays capped under 9 because the emotional aftereffect is cerebral rather than gut-felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lush, rhythmic prose maintains third-person limited distance; diction (“cyclically reversed, consciousness folding through time like origami”) is poetic yet anchored to the POV’s heightened perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices frequencies, delays, symbols. Patterned elision (backward ticking, letter rising like ink) is taught early and paid off at closure. One register drift: “document with cautious exuberance” sounds like prompt language, a hairline knock.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long, misty coils to staccato observations (“The watch grew warm”). High information density: each clause adds new sensory or conceptual data. No paraphrase loops; metaphors are consistent (mist, folding, breathing). Minor scaffold: “documenting the delays” is repeated three times in close proximity. Closure image is clear and charged; artifact does not touch final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “library of unspoken words” accessed via information-propagation delays is a fresh synthesis of Borges-and-network-latency tropes. Transformation test passes: the story’s emotional logic depends on the specific cipher/mechanical delay nexus. Risk-taking (backward time, future-self letter) is coherent and heightens stakes. Not quite 9 because the core metaphor—silence as power—remains familiar at root.</comment>
