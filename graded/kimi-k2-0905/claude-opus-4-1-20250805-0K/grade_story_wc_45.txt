<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thomas’s skepticism-turned-forgiving-awareness is dramatized in micro-choices (returning the tooth, kneeling to weave the nest); the interior contradiction between loss and acceptance is visible. The final renunciation—pressing the tooth back—carries felt cost and is catalyzed by prior beats. Only the “shrewdly innocent” label is asserted, not embodied in a locatable action, a minor flaw that keeps it under 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gift of the tooth re-weights the siblings’ bond with undeniable cost (“for luck…or for remembering”). Drive lens is causal—each beat because/therefore narrows options toward forgiveness. The orientation anchor arrives ~word 60 (garden, hedge maze, Mother’s death), safely inside waiver window. No causality breaks; persistent constraint (the tooth) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden’s impossible blooms and perpetual season constrain the thematic idea that broken things grow differently; the broken nest Thomas rebuilds literalizes the setting’s pressure on choice. Spatial choreography is clean—fountain, bench, hedge exit track without drift. Sensory selection is biased toward Thomas’s healer gaze (spider silk, dried grass) rather than tourist catalog. Micro-setting (nest as setting-object) directly charges the closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Thomas forgive the changeling who replaced his sister? Pressure tightens once: the Council’s charge of unapproved bone-setting forces Thomas to articulate his stance, narrowing options. Cost is visible—he forfeits certainty and the talismanic tooth. Agency remains with Thomas; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular images (nest, tooth, out-of-season jasmine) rather than labels; the final line’s song about children “exactly what they seemed, even when they weren’t” offers a non-literal conceptual repricing. Subtext in dialogue (“Even changelings deserve their coin”) carries implication about mercy. No final-paragraph moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what “human” means. The emotional aftereffect is concrete—bittersweet acceptance rather than sentimental resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Free indirect style is clean; perceptual signature is healer-centric (“bones remember their original shape”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer reflective sentences calm, clipped exchanges under sun-dappled light quicken rhythm. No head-hopping; focalization stays inside Thomas. Dialogue indirection functions as action: “You kept it” accuses and invites simultaneously.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical patterns. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“belief could bend like willow branches”) stay coherent and sparse—never stacked in high-pressure beats. Information density high: one line often advances atmosphere and character simultaneously. Copy clean; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: changeling lore + orthopedic philosophy = “healing as transformation, not restoration.” Risky Garden-as-liminal-world is fully committed rather than decorative. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at start. Could swap names, but the bone-setting metaphor and tooth talisman are specific enough to resist full universalization.</comment>
