<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—crafting counterfeit selves while craving authentic human delay—remains vivid; her micro-choice to photograph the impermanent chalk pattern embodies the cost of her art, foreclosing anonymity for herself. Motivation stays consistent and scales to the stake: giving others the gift of “a true name” while erasing her own trace. The only flaw is a slight over-articulation of her desire (“she had given them what they’d really wanted”) that borders diagnostic self-summary, nudging the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (brass light, chalk dust, engine rumble) intensifies the single dominant stake—time-delayed intimacy—until the closing photograph crystallizes both preservation and loss. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the impending rain will erase the code, making the analog photo the only true relic, a felt cost legible on the final line. Orientation is anchored within the first 90 words; transitions are seamless. The causality is thematic rather than event-based, fitting the lyrical design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The golden arcade functions as micro-setting: its derelict glamor constrains Mira’s ritual—open marble for twenty-foot chalk canvas, skylight for dawn gold that times her exit. Brass fixtures, copper postal trucks, and resin-smelling chalk are tactile tools that charge the final photograph. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her knees on marble, chalk arcs, camera click, gate lock. Weather (impending rain) is an environmental clock that narrows options and prices her ephemeral art.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering authentic identity via delayed mail—tightens once: the approaching 3-hour deadline plus impending rain forces the decisive act of photographing the code. Pressure is textural, not causal; options narrow from “chalk exists” to “chalk will vanish” so the photo becomes the irrevocable preservation. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: Mira trades her own traceability for her client’s anonymity. Agency is present yet quiet; a second, sharper beat would have pushed this into 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: analog slowness versus digital erase, identity as palimpsest, memory as residue on marble. The final image—Mira locking the gate while holding the only physical proof—reconfigures the premise: future nostalgia is already past. No overt thesis is stated; meaning accrues via chalk dust, brass glare, and the photo’s undeveloped film. A slight softening comes from the reiterated “people wanted poetry, mystery, protection” which edges toward thematic echo, holding the score just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual filter: “memories of a future that never quite arrived” is her idiom, not authorial exposition. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fragments during chalk application—“Turquoise for water… Amber for preserved things”—mimicking the code’s rhythm. No head-hopping; POV modesty respected (she guesses client motives, never claims certainty). Register remains consistent: precise yet lyrical, never drifting into corporate or academic diction. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without drawing attention to itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long sensory sentences build texture, then a single clause—“Tomorrow, rain would wash it away”—delivers the gut-punch. Information density is high; each sentence layers metaphor and world fact without padding. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “the intimacy of handwritten addresses” follows “people had rediscovered the weight of paper” in contiguous summary; it advances world lore so only −0.1. The final line crystallizes earlier motifs without overwriting, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite micro-slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—anonymous letter names crafted in abandoned holographic mall via sidewalk chalk cryptography—is non-obvious and specific. Futuristic nostalgia is synthesized through copper postal trucks beside neural-link boutiques, turning cliché into lived detail. The chalk-code photography ritual feels inevitable, not gimmicky, because it grows from childhood sidewalk kingdoms. Risk is high (lyric accumulative structure) yet coherence remains intact, earning the bonus +0.4. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
