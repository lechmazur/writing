<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mariel’s mutism-as-gift and her ritual precision give her a believable, embodied interior life; the micro-choice to press the fragment to bronze is concrete, irreversible, and charged with contradictory tenderness and loss. No secondary character applies pressure, so the score stays single-POV clean. The only limit is that her flaw (solitude/silence) is also her super-power, softening the cost compared to a sharper sacrifice.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell absorbs the color, wonder propagates, Mariel’s silence is now the necessary guardian stance—cost is the final drip of extinct ice down her arm. Causal chain is intact: fragment melts → bell tuned → color encoded → world re-enchanted. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and hold. Earned stasis carries visible price, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tower’s gimbal mechanics are sketched just enough to let the kinetic sculpture constrain every adjustment; cloud-sea and bronze resonance act as environmental limits that shape the final transmission. Micro-setting (iceberg droplet, bell inner surface) is tactile and stakes-bearing. No spatial drift; geography stays consistent and POV-filtered. Slight cap because no environmental detail revises tactics after the absorption beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—tightens once: the fragment’s last heartbeat is dramatized in the drip. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each bell’s uptake increases the density of transmitted awe; no external antagonist needed. Cost is the ice’s extinction, legible in the final droplet. Lacks a second tightening or tactical loss, so stays below 8.8 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as the medium that keeps wonder audible; the bells reprice language itself as insufficient. Reprise of “glististen” fuses sound-color and crystallizes the motif. No moralizing line. Ambiguity is productive—readers can weigh whether the eternal broadcast is utopia or gentle prison. Minor deduction for thematic echo in the phrase “capacity for enchantment itself.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Mariel’s sensorium: “footsteps echoing against walls that remembered when language still mattered” is a perceptual signature unattributable to any other voice. Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under task—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No dialogue, so voice convergence issues are moot. Filter verbs are few and motivated. One hairline slip: “glististen” neologism could read as typo, but pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphors (stone finger, cloud-sea) stay coherent and non-contradictory. No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. One mixed metaphor risk—“kinetic sculpture that was the tower itself”—but tower-as-instrument is literalized, so forgiven. Final line lands with cadence punch. Minor overcoloring in “indefinable hue between surprise and joy” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of climate-loss elegy and wordless-acoustic utopia feels sui generis; the bells-as-prisms-of-wonder reframes both solarpunk and silent-monk tropes. Specificity of gimbal mechanics and seasonal mutism prevents abstract anywhere-setting. Risk in neologism “glististen” pays off by closing the sonic-visual loop. Conceptual integrity is total—no retreat from the premise that language died and bronze sings better.</comment>
