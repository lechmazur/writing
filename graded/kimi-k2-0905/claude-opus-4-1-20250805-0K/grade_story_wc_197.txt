<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s quietly obsessive scholarship (“anger without knowledge is just noise”) gives her interiority a serrated edge that lifts her above stock rebel. The brass key’s weight in her palm and the micro-choice to read star-maps in puddles embody her resourcefulness; her refusal to join the doomed senior cell shows earned, costly stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and Jakob is more echo than crucible, but her lone arc lands with visible forfeiture of safety. Meets the 9+ quick test on renunciation/causality despite secondary-character flatness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lattice is tight: key → lagoon map → tunnel archive → dawn upload → leaders’ arrest used as distraction. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: sunrise turns lagoon silver as the Ministry’s reality monopoly is publicly punctured; cost is the emptied resistance cell she can’t save. Orientation is anchored by 112 words; lens holds. One scaffold loop (“another revised history, another convenient lie”) is a –0.2 artifact but does not touch the final image; otherwise propulsion is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pacific Bell key, verdigris plaque, and fluorescent maintenance tunnel give tactile pre-revision texture; auric lagoon sheens from industrial spill quietly link ecology to informational pollution. The key’s metallic warmth against skin is the micro-setting that charges the final sunrise image. Spatial choreography is flawless through Pier 47 descent. Missing 9-band gate only because environment does not literally constrain final upload tactics—those occur off-page on servers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove erased public communication once existed—tightens when she trades the senior cell’s safety for archival exposure, a visible forfeit. Escalation is informational rather than explosive: each recovered box narrows Ministry’s future lie-space. Upload act is irreversible, conceptual cost legible. Agency drives every pivot; coincidence only alerts, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Refrain “they thought I was just another angry youth” mutates into “the real rebellion hadn’t failed—it had just begun,” reweighting dismissal into weaponized memory. Theme emerges solely through recovered documents and color-shifted lagoon, never sermon. Final silver surface reprices prior gold spill as reversible—history can change again. No thematic echo lines in closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s scholar-cool perception: “reading the language of reflected light” is idiosyncratic, not ornamental. Filter verbs are rare; perception degrades under tunnel glare (“fluorescent lights flickered”). Jakob’s two whispers carry distinct subtext of warning vs awe. No head-hopping; compression during archive raid is taught pattern, paid off in sunrise key-raise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes between descent beats and archive cascade; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Mixed metaphors avoided—“starlight like scattered diamonds” is single layer, quickly functional. One paraphrase loop noted in Q2; no other scaffold. Figurative language is sparse during climax, keeping archival clarity. High information density: one line often performs setting, mood, and plot advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Puddle-maps as pre-digital GPS feels freshly specific; synthesis of eco-disaster color shift with info-erasure is non-obvious. Brass key + Pacific Bell nostalgia could slide into retro-cute but is repurposed as evidence weapon. Risk of quiet archival victory over explosion is taken and lands. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—lagoon color logic and defunct telecom key are irreplicable.</comment>
