<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—wounding herself to invite healing—remains concrete and embodied; the garden-whisper epiphany is earned because her scar-tunnels literally let the green chorus in. Micro-choices (pressing palm to glass, re-turning the hourglass) visibly trace her shifting hierarchy: curiosity > self-protection. Final stance (“some wounds were meant to stay open”) costs her the fantasy of closure; the plants’ confirmation makes the price legible. Dialogue absent, so relationship crucible not required; single-POV voice stays coherent and specific.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “tiny legible marks” tightens across coffee ring, scar tunnels, hourglass sand until the miracle’s diffusion is reweighted. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—miracle becomes ambient rather than lost—felt cost is Maya’s acceptance of perpetual openness; image of turning the hourglass again crystallizes the reconfiguration. Orientation clean within 120 words; no causal breaks. One minor scaffold: “She understood now…” could be compressed, but doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Tower medical bay, dawn light strips, frosted hourglass, and rooftop garden are economically anchored; hourglass and glass pane function as micro-settings that constrain her final gesture. Sensory selection stays urgent—anesthesia fade, chlorophyll dream, coffee ring texture—mirroring her narrowing/widening perception. No spatial drift; transitions from bed to window to garden are cleanly tracked. Cold coffee ring reappears in final paragraph to charge closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she find the miracle or accept its scattering?—is signaled early through plant scream. Escalation is textural: each examined mark (scar, ring, sand) thickens the evidence that miracle has thinned rather than vanished. Final tightening occurs when garden confirms dispersion, foreclosing her search for a single locus; cost is the perpetual openness she embraces. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: healing is not closure but ongoing permeability. Subtext conveyed through recurring images of porous circles—coffee ring, tree rings, hourglass waist—reweighting “wound” from damage to doorway. Final image of turned hourglass offers resonant, non-moral answer: accumulation, not loss. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maya’s perceptual bias—sand whisper, vegetable grief, chlorophyll dream—creating distinct idiom. No dialogue, so voice convergence not tested. Compression (“meteor hush”) is pattern-taught early and readable at closure. No filter-verb bloat; psychic distance narrows convincingly under anesthesia fade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for dawning consciousness, crisp fragments at epiphany. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat—avoiding density overload. No loops or scaffold; “circles” repetition is purposeful motif. Strong verbs (“screaming their vegetable grief”) propel without purple excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing accidental plant telepathy with surgical self-scarification to decode dispersed miracles is non-obvious and specific to this narrator. Risk—lyric accumulation over causal plot—pays off because closure reconfigures meaning rather than delivering set-piece battle. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving freshness. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
