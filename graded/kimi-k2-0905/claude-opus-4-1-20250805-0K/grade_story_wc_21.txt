<comment>Amara’s grief-shock at the diary’s touch is visceral, her “hands tremble” under the weight of history, yet her interiority turns diagnostic (“retrocognitively trapped”) rather than embodied. The choice to descend and arrange debris crystallizes her hierarchy of values—archive over safety—but Marcus’s flickering ghost does most of the explanatory labor, blunting her agency. Still, the final stance—transcribing ugly truth—carries earned cost and individuates her from a generic “archivist” type.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “infinity of floating libraries” reframes the diary not as betrayal ledger but as love-and-betrayal braid, reweighting the myth of pure activism. Causal chain holds: diary → temporal trap → shoreline cipher → truth choice. Orientation clean by line 5; transitions legible under Hybrid lens (Accumulative past/present overlay, Situational pressure of myth vs fact). Cost is felt: “the real encryption had never been in the diary’s symbols but in the courage required to face the full truth.”</comment>

<comment>Obsidian lagoon is not backdrop but crucible—its mirrored surface literally reconfigures the zeppelin into “infinity of floating libraries,” charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Amara’s archivist gaze: she notes paper-wrapped diary, wind-exposed water, bleached wood as “letters” before touching them. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from gondola window to shoreline to simultaneous 1961 overlay. Micro-setting (diary pages, black water) constrains every micro-choice; no descriptor feels touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect movement myth vs expose betrayals—tightens once: Amara must choose whether to transcribe ugly truth. Agency is decision, not combat; the arrangement of debris is the visible tactic that forecloses denial. Escalation is knowledge-based: each decoded name narrows her moral options until only full transcription remains. Cost is legible: “searing weight” and the infinite mirror that removes any refuge in selective history.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: love and betrayal as co-authors of liberation. Subtext lives in silence—those betrayed “chose forgiveness over vengeance” never stated aloud, only spelled in stones. Final image reweights “encryption” from spy-craft to moral courage, avoiding moralizing sentence. Complex ambiguity survives: reader must decide whether mythic purity was noble lie or necessary fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Narrative distance stays tight to Amara’s perceptual filter—her archivist gaze catalogs, dates, cipher-checks. Free indirect style clean: “she thought of the letters that had led her here” keeps psychic distance consistent. One lyrical compression under pressure: “infinity of floating libraries” reads as earned apotheosis, not purple flourish. No head-hopping; Marcus’s dialogue is externalized through her temporal overlay, maintaining POV integrity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but oxygenated: “wind expose more of the obsidian lagoon” does triple duty—motion, reveal, metaphor. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphor discipline: black water as mirror, library as zeppelin, encryption as courage—vehicles stay consistent. Final line cadence slows to match contemplative re-pricing, avoiding drumbeat syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of civil-rights archive, Sahara occult geology, and zeppelin noir feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Stakes are inverted: the danger is not assassination but historiography. Temporal overlay freshens without gimmick because it forces Amara to physically collaborate with the dead. Risk-taking (retrocognitive trap, ghost Marcus) heightens stakes without obscuring causal clarity.</comment>
