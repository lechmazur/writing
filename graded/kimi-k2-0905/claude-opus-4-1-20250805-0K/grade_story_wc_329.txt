<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—longing to restore beauty yet steeling herself to become the expendable shell—remains vivid and embodied; the “locust shell memory” micro-choice (para 2) seeds her willingness to play herself empty. Emotions stay particular, never drifting into diagnostic speak; her fingers “finding notes that shouldn’t exist” shows embodied risk. Cost is legible: she ends eyes-closed, aware she may be the abandoned husk that enables others’ metamorphosis. Only the slightest safety-hedge keeps this from 9-band: the word “knew” softens the final sacrifice instead of letting us feel the terror of hollowing oneself in real time.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira keeps playing while enforcement closes in, her emptied body the price of the orchard’s rebirth—cost is felt in the final image (“played herself empty, becoming the shell…”). Causal linkage holds throughout: because she maps ghost-heartbeats → therefore she can fracture clockwork with off-scale notes → because hearts shatter → orchard walks free. Orientation anchors within 120 words (who=Lira, where=sky-bridge over mechanized orchard, when=pre-dawn of rebellion). No lens ambiguity; the story ends inside the same accumulative cadence it taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment (bridge lattice, welded tree angles, compacted soil grids) actively constrains every tactic and is reweighted in closure as the ground literally cracks under musical pressure. Micro-setting objects—locust shell pressed to light, warm seed pressed back into Lira’s palm—function as tactile pivots that charge the final image. Sensory economy is disciplined: industrial hum, translucent amber shell, root-legs seeking light—each detail either enables a choice or mirrors internal split. Tonal glow of “tarnished wonder” remains consistent, tensioning gritty mechanization against translucent memory without slipping into ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rekindle organic beauty before mechanized erasure—is signaled in para 2 and tightened exactly once: when the first statue heart shatters, Lira’s option to retreat dies with it; escalation is accumulative/lyric, not multi-reversal. Cost stays visible: each slurred note weakens her control, the final image showing her physical depletion as the price. Agency remains hers—she chooses to keep bowing while sirens approach. Coincidence does not solve; the orchard’s uprising answers her call but cannot protect her, maintaining coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete returns: shell → hollowness → freedom, bridge lattice → industrial cage → resonant amplifier, seed → dormant life → warm gift pressed back. No character articulates thesis; the reader must connect why leaving a perfect shell is liberation. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing: beauty is proved efficient only when it abandons efficiency, reweighting the Mechanization Council’s creed without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will Lira survive?—yet the emotional after-effect is sharp: wonder now includes the tarnish of personal loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lira’s perceptual signature—“notes that shouldn’t exist on regulation strings”—without head-hop. Rhythm swells and contracts with bow pressure; varied sentence lengths mimic musical phrasing. No filter-verb stacks; perception arrives as sensory flare (“stone eyes flickering with confusion”). Diction honors character-bound lexicon—she thinks in lattices, rivets, frequencies, never academic abstraction. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence survives peak intensity without thinning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Information density remains high: single sentences fuse metaphor, action, and world lore (“Her violin sang of locusts leaving shells, of hearts breaking free from clockwork cages”). No synonym loops or paraphrase clutter; each image advances choice or stakes. Mixed-metaphor risk is skirted because vehicles (shell, cage, bridge) all serve the same metamorphic logic. One near-loop—“played herself empty, becoming the shell another’s freedom might require”—is purposeful callback, not artifact, and charges closure, so exempt from penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: industrial orchard + violin hack of stone sentries fuses eco-fantasy with solarpunk resistance; locust shell as liberation memento feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—letting protagonist remain mid-bridge, potentially doomed—eschews tidy victory but sharpens resonance. Conceptual integrity: every magical-mechanical rule introduced (heart-rhythm translation, welded trees, frequency vulnerability) is paid off in the climax without late cheating. Specific detail (“trees welded into productive angles”) anchors novelty in lived specificity, preventing abstract allegory.</comment>
