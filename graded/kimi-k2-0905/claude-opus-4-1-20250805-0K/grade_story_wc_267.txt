<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s frost-bitten loyalty and Elena’s throat-scarred return both embody “seraphically mundane,” but the interior contradiction—his need to serve vs. her need to remain silent—stays stated rather than enacted in a single shared beat. The bolt-talisman and stair-worn mark are concrete, yet the final rapprochement is summarized, not pressured; we are told “safety wasn’t found in silence or sound” instead of watching a micro-choice that costs either of them on the spot. Elena’s seven-year surgical endurance is visible, but Marcus’s regenerated nerves never translate into a moment where the tingling forces a fumble or revelation that changes tactics. The reunion is tender, yet the crucible moment where their relationship actually shifts under pressure is elided, leaving the change credible but not fully earned in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the single new note at eight o’clock reweights the “unpardonable silence” into a deliberate artistic stance, and the cost—Elena’s mutilated voice and Marcus’s years of caretaking exile—is visible on their bodies. Causal chain holds: the bolt’s kept presence → stair-mark recognition → reunion → joint performance; each step is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of silence/sound). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit by line 3: cobalt fortress, seventh winter, bellhop Marcus; no penalty. One minor scaffold: “some silences were unpardonable” is iterated three times in different phrasings; since it never obscures causality at the closure beat, only −0.2 levied here. Overall, the lens tightens through recurrence rather than because/therefore turns, and the final image crystallizes meaning cleanly with felt cost.</comment>

<comment>The cobalt stone’s acoustic channels, the ice-glaze, and the bell-tower carvings all constrain the central conflict—sound vs. silence—so the fortress is not backdrop but instrument. Micro-setting objects (piano bench bolt, stair discoloration) function as geography inside 700 words; they are handled, tracked, and charge the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: staircase ascent, music-room entry, bell-tower search all stay oriented. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Marcus notices cold, dust, numb fingertips; Elena’s first gesture is touching the worn stone—familiar, not tourist. One minor lapse: “perpetually glazed with ice” is stated twice in similar phrasing; since it doesn’t stall momentum, only −0.2.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“who controls sound in this fortress and at what price?”—is signaled early and tightens once: choir’s demand for variety → Elena’s renunciation → Marcus’s exile → eventual shared re-appropriation. Escalation is accretive, not causal-reversal; pattern breaks when the bolt passes hand-to-hand, reweighting meaning rather than options. Cost is legible: Elena’s voice, Marcus’s frostbite, choir’s perpetual dumbness. A deeper beat of mutual endangerment or refusal is missing; the reunion softens rather than sharpens the trade-off, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: silence as both sanctuary and wound, art as refusal to commodify repetition. Subtext operates in the bolt’s transfer and the single note that replaces the once-denounced nocturne. The final paragraph’s “frostbitten hope” is the only overt thematic phrasing, but it is brief and image-anchored, so only −0.3. Counter-readings are possible: is the new composition genuine autonomy or another performance for the hotel’s myth? That ambiguity is invited, not closed, satisfying complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is frost-bitten, service-oriented, acoustically attuned—he hears the fortress “hum” approval. Elena’s whispered line is the only dialogue; it carries subtext (scars as credential) and is differentiated by rasped brevity. No head-hop; no filter-verb clot. Occasional lyric uplift (“seraphically mundane”) fits the hotel’s mythic register and is introduced early, so pattern is taught. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator meta-lexicon, not text; no in-story equivalent, so no penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: short sensory bursts under cold, longer reflective sentences during memory. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent: “something deeper had broken, something in the agreement between sound and silence” is abstract but pays off in the final note. One paraphrase loop: “seven winters… seven years… seven years of surgeries” restates time span; minor, −0.2. Information density is high: bolt, scar, stair-mark, and acoustic lore all delivered within 700 words without pausing plot. Copy-clean: no homophones, tense slips, or pronoun drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “haunted music venue that steals voices” trope is inverted: the choir’s demanded spectacle devours itself, while the disciplined solitary artist survives through chosen silence. Specificity—the cobalt acoustic architecture, frostbite as literal cost, a piano bench bolt carried like a joint—makes the concept fresh. The final synthesis (sound AND silence composed together) feels inevitable yet non-obvious, reweighting the entire myth. Risky compression into sub-800-word lyric arc pays off without clarity loss, meriting the high-band bonus.</comment>
