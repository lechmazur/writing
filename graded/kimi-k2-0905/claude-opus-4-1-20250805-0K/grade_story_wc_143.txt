<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s solitary vigil is credibly driven by a stubborn, almost monastic devotion to witnessing; her micro-choices—isolating the grain, mixing the regolith emulsion, placing the hourglass—are specific and costly, culminating in an earned renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, anchored in tool-handling and bodily action rather than abstraction. The only minor drag is a touch of diagnostic self-explanation (“she understood she was photographing…”) that momentarily over-articulates what the images already show.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the camera secured, the hourglass left behind, the rocket arriving—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration of human presence, weighted by the final image of “dawning hush.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each preparation beat (grain isolation, chemical timer, descent) tightens the stakes until the last wisp of ice is converted into irreversible record. The lens holds without slip; cost is felt in the act of abandonment itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crater, regolith chemistry, and hourglass each constrain tactics: only lunar vacuum allows the silver-regolith reaction to serve as clock; only Tycho’s fissure yields the vapor; only the ancient grain can be “returned.” Sensory selection is filtered through Vera’s professional eye—she notices seismic thresholds, sublimation rates, earthlight wavelengths—never a tourist catalogue. The final image of earthlight painting the abandoned hourglass crystallizes the setting-as-character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—preserve the last evidence of lunar water—tightens once: the chemical timer is started, the rocket incoming, the ice wisp finite. Agency is observational endurance rather than overt confrontation; nevertheless the choice to remain, mix the emulsion, and descend alone forecloses retreat and carries visible opportunity cost (her own evacuation). The escalation is modest but sufficient for the lyrical mode; a second reversal would feel forced.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of exploration myth: retreat becomes the new frontier, and abandonment is the artifact we leave behind. The hourglass—time displaced 4 billion years—reweights “progress” into a cycle of forgetting and remembering. No moral is stated; the final image of the sealed habitat and patient Moon lets the reader feel the conceptual cost of collective timidity.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distant-third filtered through a geologist’s precision: “sublimating ice released periodic wisps,” “earthlight painted Tycho’s walls in dawnlit melancholy.” Syntax lengthens with contemplative cadence, then tightens during descent, mirroring the shift from reflection to action. No dialogue is needed; the perceptual signature is consistent, restrained, and lunar-cold without becoming emotionally vacant.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyric: every sentence advances image or stakes; no filler verbs or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and tested—“ghost’s breath” is the one simile, justified by vacuum crystallization. A single paraphrase loop (“humanity was retreating… humanity remembered why it had reached”) is forgivable at closure cadence; otherwise density is high and rhythm varied.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of 1979 lunar shutdown with a 4-billion-year grain of Earth sand gives familiar retreat-fiction a deep-time spine. Using Apollo-surplus Hasselblad and improvised regolith chemistry as plot instruments feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The inversion—humanity leaves just as water is proved—reverses standard colonization arcs without preaching. Risk is quiet but real: a story whose climax is watching mist dissipate could have drifted into preciousness; instead it earns stoic awe.</comment>
