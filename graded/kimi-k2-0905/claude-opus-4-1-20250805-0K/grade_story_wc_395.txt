<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is concrete—“towers of obsolete servers… graveyard of deleted profiles”—and her motive (find Dad/4827) is legible, but the climactic self-upload is declared rather than dramatized; we see no contradictory impulse in-scene, so the final cost feels foregone, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“they go home”—with undeniable cost: Lila’s bodily erasure. Causal chain holds: recipe coordinates → ghost profiles → upload protocol, each step because/therefore. One micro-turn: lie to supervisor seeds her exile. Orientation anchor (“maintenance elevator… three keycards”) arrives by line 3; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive body-tool—“towers of obsolete servers”—constrains every move: she climbs, dives, types inside it. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: Apollo patch warmth against chest, “echo of forgotten songs” as audible hush. Spatial choreography clean: elevator → server canyon → terminal → upload. Final image reweights the patch as transmit frequency, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find 4827/dad—tightens when she realizes deletion = consciousness scatter; upload becomes only path, foreclosing normal life. Escalation is causal-deductive: each 4827 breadcrumb narrows options until self-archiving is inevitable. Visible price: she pays with bodily existence, legible in final “screen flicker.” One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme—digital afterlife as home—emerges from images (server graveyard, archived voices) rather than statement. Subtext in recipe coordinates implies survival guide, not dessert. Final “they go home” reweights absence as presence, avoiding moral. Minor abstraction in “sensed absence” tag slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice carries distinct perceptual signature: engineer-archivist diction—“cached views, substrata, RGB values”—married to grief-lit rhythm. Free indirect clean: “she lied… knowing…” Compression taught early (“between floors”) and held. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Final upload syntax shortens, mirroring data-flatline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric climb, then staccato “Four pounds, eight ounces…” No loops or scaffold. Metaphor disciplined—servers as graveyard, patch as radio relic—never stacked. Information density high: one sentence can anchor, characterize, foreshadow. Filter verbs rare. Closure line crisp: “they go home.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: cold-case missing persons + social-media data retention + Apollo radio lore. Ghost-network mechanic is taught early and paid off in upload. Risk—nonlinear digital afterlife—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Patch frequency twist feels inevitable in hindsight; premise could not transplant to another genre without collapse.</comment>
