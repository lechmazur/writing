<comment>Emil’s seven-year vow of silence, his damaged hearing, and his compulsive carving of never-to-spin horses create a believable, contradictory interior: endurance fused with futile hope. The moment he pockets the glass shard, then later fits it to the angel’s halo, his micro-choices visibly tilt that interior, making the final sung note feel earned. The only reason this stays shy of 9 is that the “courage to let brokenness sing” is named more than dramatized; we see the song’s birth but not its cost on him yet.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The piece works under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist-glow, chime-stretch, and wood-shavings accrete until the shard-to-halo click reweights meaning. The wrong-turn stumble is an organic micro-reversal that lands him in the garden; the final wordless song is a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes the ruin breathe. Closure carries unmistakable felt cost—his voice cracks, the train listens, tomorrow’s labor is now charged with song—so the lens holds and the ending pays.</comment>

<comment>Every descriptive bullet is filtered through Emil’s carpenter eye: sawdust “drifts through shafts,” fog “rolls like memories refusing to settle,” moss “covers painted bodies.” The third car, the warped boards, and the trickle of hidden water all constrain movement and later choice—he can only reach the angel by crossing this reclaimed space. That specificity plus the micro-setting of the shard itself (a tool-bit of light) satisfy the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether silence remains sustainable—tightens when the shard surfaces and again when the angel’s missing halo gap is discovered. Agency is present: he pockets, walks, stumbles, fits, sings. The cost is conceptual but legible: once the shard is fitted, silence is no longer a viable canvas; song becomes imperative. A hair more external pressure (e.g., an audible collapse, a witnessed moment) would have pushed this into the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: resurrection is not wholesale repair but the courage to let fractured things emit sound. The whispering gleam, the shard-star, and the wordless melody form a tight constellation that reweights “brokenness” from shame to instrument. No moral is stated; the final image of tomorrow’s singing horses offers quiet conceptual repricing. The only slip is a single line that almost spells the thesis—“silence was not emptiness but possibility”—but it is early and quickly submerged in sensory action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, anchored in Emil’s carpenter senses: chisel bite, fog weight, wood scent. Diction—“misting hush,” “whispering gleam,” “song only he could hear”—creates a lyric yet tool-specific register that never drifts into abstraction. Rhythm breathes with the elongated chime, sentence lengths swell and contract, mirroring the softening of time. No head-hop, no filter-stack; voice is singular and stays within lexicon of a man who thinks in grain and varnish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; every line either advances sensory knowledge or tightens atmosphere. Metaphors (“fog like memories refusing to settle”) are clean, non-contradictory, and brief. Minor scaffold appears only in the triple repetition of “misting hush,” but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final “whispering gleam,” so it reads as cadence rather than loop. No artifacts touch the closure beat; the final sentence lands crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The post-fire carousel ruin reclaimed by living vines, the halo shard as holy relic, and the mute carpenter who restarts the world with song feel fresh in synthesis even if individual tropes (silent artisan, secret garden) are familiar. The wrong-turn stumble into an impossible garden risks fairy-tale ease, but the texture of rotted train car and sawdust keeps it grounded. The final risk—wordless song as resurrection—pays off without gimmickry, earning the +0.2 risk bonus within band.</comment>
