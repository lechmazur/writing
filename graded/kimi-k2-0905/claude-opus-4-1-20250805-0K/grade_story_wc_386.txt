<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina’s grief-worn obsession and tactile handling of the globe give credible motive; yet her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“salvage artist of impossible things”) that feels externally authored rather than embodied under pressure. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—the choice to transcribe the formula is presented as destined, so the final ascent, while costly, lacks the sting of a path foregone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the constellation-candle map re-orients her life toward twelve new wrecks, cost felt in the weight of “borrowed starlight.” Causality is soft—ghosts hand her the quest rather than a misstep forcing it—but the accumulative pattern (globe→shrine→map) holds; the Orient test is met by line 4. Main weakness: escalation is delivered by exposition from the chemist-ghost instead of a choice that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Glacier shrine, frost-faces, candle-starlight, and diving gloves create a crisp micro-setting that directly enables the revelation; cold is not just backdrop but the medium through which ghosts speak. Spatial grounding stays clean across the single location; sensory hierarchy favors visual cold and reflected flame, apt for a seeker who “reads windows.” Environment charges the final image—constellations on the ceiling—earning the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the hidden antidote—emerges late (mid-story) but is tightly linked to the globe; one meaningful deepening occurs when Marina realizes the formula survives in the melted plastic. Pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; ghosts declare rather than test. Cost is conceptual (lifelong quest accepted) and visible in the ascent, meeting bar for short-form escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of salvage-as-redemption emerges through recurring ice/window imagery and the final image of “borrowed starlight,” avoiding overt thesis. Subtext whispered by frost-portraits lets readers infer that collective memory keeps victims alive; ambiguity lingers (will humanity deserve the antidote?). No final moralizing—just the map of future wrecks—gives quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Marina’s perceptions; diction (“dream architecture,” “windows of connection”) is consistent and textured, never generic. Compression taught early (“She had learned to read these windows”) licenses later ellipses; perceptual signature is strong—she sees cities in slag plastic and hears wind-cave voices. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on narrative cadence which modulates well under ghostly pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong opening propulsion with varied sentence shapes; occasional poetic overlap (“warmth carving tiny rivulets into walls that had stood frozen for centuries”) is vivid, not muddled. Minor scaffold: “She had spent fifteen years…” summarizes backstory without new pressure, and “someone who could see windows where others saw walls” edges toward template epiphany. No artifacts touch the final image; rhythm tightens in the ascent, satisfying read-aloud test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing Arctic shrine, melted souvenir globe, and collective-dream espionage yields a fresh angle on ghost-story rescue. The conceit that formula is encoded in toy-city geometry is specific and non-obvious; risk of lyric overload is held in check by tactile detail. Transformation test passes—swapping globe for any other MacGuffin would break the “dream architecture” logic that powers closure. Minor deduction for broad strokes of “biological weapon never made history books,” which feels outline-like.</comment>
