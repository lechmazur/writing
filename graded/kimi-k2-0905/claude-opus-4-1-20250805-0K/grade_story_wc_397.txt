<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marlene’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the parasol tip as tactile rosary and her calibrated sense of “ending pitch” are specific and character-bound. The contradiction between seeking death and finding patience-as-movement is dramatized in scene rather than labeled. Micro-choices (volunteering for night watch, gripping the lace until it cuts) enact a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Secondary characters remain functional; the Inuit grandmother’s mirroring is efficient but not a crucible, capping relationship pressure at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the marina’s song becomes Marlene’s new survival grammar, reweighting the failed euthanasia. The Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent—ice-crack sounds accrue meaning until the final crystallizing cadence. Causality is interior but legible: because she survives unchanged, she learns to accompany endings instead of seeking her own. The cost is felt in the parasol-tip cut and the closing duet, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is rendered through acoustic and haptic detail—frozen cemetery floes, breaking songs, minus-forty breath ghosts—rather than postcard vistas. The heirloom parasol tip operates as micro-setting that constrains: ivory spiral pressed to palm, lace shadow mapping neural deltas, cutting to confirm aliveness. Spatial choreography is clean: transport helicopter lifts, boats sink, observer post anchored. Environment guides choice—ice song dictates evacuation tempo and Marlene’s decision to stay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live when death refuses—signals early and tightens through acoustic attentiveness: each calving narrows her options from exit to accompaniment. One meaningful deepening at 3 a.m. when large section caves; sound as sigh externalizes her folding inward. Agency is attention-as-renunciation; cost is visceral (bleeding palm) and existential (accepting perpetual witness). No causal reversals, but accumulative pressure under inferred lens suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: ice that sings while dying mirrors protagonist kept alive to witness. No thesis stated; final image of duet reweights patience from passive to performative. Subtext resides in silence—never naming suicide after first paragraph—and in texture of lace cutting flesh. Ambiguity is fruitful: survival neither heroic nor redemptive, simply ongoing. Conceptual Repricing at closure invites reflection on what it costs to keep listening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV stays tight third; perceptual signature filters world through sound-pitch metaphors and heirloom touchstones. Diction—“fold in patience,” “windborne solace”—is compressed but patterned early, paid off in final duet. Rhythm modulates: elongated sentences during vigil, staccato radio exchange. No head-hopping; Inuit grandmother’s line is external speech, not interior usurpation. Voice feels singular and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, sentence variety, and high density—lace shadow “like neural pathways or river deltas” does three jobs at once. Two minor scaffolding echoes: “song of inevitable collapse” and “symphony of inevitable collapse” within 30 words (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; ice-as-music sustains physical logic. No filter-verb stacks. Closure image is crisp, uncluttered. Lyric compression is purposeful, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses euthanasia tourism with Arctic ice-disaster volunteering—fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Parasol tip as neural/sound map converts heirloom cliché into perceptual instrument. Inevitable-in-hindsight: failed death becomes ear for environmental death. Specificity of Zurich clinic, Inuit acoustics, minus-forty breath grounds novelty in lived detail. Risk-taking (quiet accompaniment over dramatic rescue) is coherent and heightens thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Setup in line 1; choice mid-scene to volunteer for night watch signals shift from self-exit to bearing witness; closure duet is direct outgrowth of that stance. Cost: perpetual vigilance, bleeding palm. Removing tourist context collapses motivation and final reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First paragraph seed; handled again at helicopter load, night desk, and final squeeze that draws blood. Lace shadow mapping cracks reweights object as diagnostic tool for endings. Irreplaceable—no substitute object carries ancestral fragility and cutting edge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Phrase appears once yet concept governs entire arc: patience folds into active listening. Micro-choices fold inward (accepting night watch) then outward (singing with ice). Conceptual cost legible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Trait enables hyper-acute hearing of ending-sounds, prompting her to stay and serve as early-warning system. Cost: social detachment, perpetual skin-thin grip. Demonstrated, not labeled—she records calving before radio call.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Trawling through wreckage provides acoustic training that primes her ear; same verb repurposed for trawling sonic depths of ice. Drives decision to remain. Swappable verbs exist, but maritime continuity with marina setting resists easy substitution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Introduced early; mechanics matter—disaster protocol gives her legitimate reason to stay in danger zone and access observation post. Without volunteer role, her presence risks implausible tourist loitering.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Setting is active antagonist: calving sequences force evacuations, dictate tempo, provide the final music. Micro-setting (thin ice transparency) guides her sonic focus. Removing marina erases pressure engine and closure duet.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Timeframe signals altered perception but is loosely tracked; no ticking clock escalates stakes. Main function is backstory justification for sensory anomaly. Could be swapped to “after the procedure” without structural break.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Desire articulated early; shapes every auditory observation and final decision to keep listening. Conflict: wants to hear endings vs. cost of endless vigil. Desire directly transforms into closure action—she sings along.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Tone established in frozen cemetery image and sustains lyric melancholy across pressure beats. Modulates: urgency during calving, quiet joy in duet. Final image of windborne song crystallizes tone as earned solace rather than despair.</comment>
