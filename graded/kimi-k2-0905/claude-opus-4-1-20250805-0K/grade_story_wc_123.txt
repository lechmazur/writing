<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—her methodical handling of the pigeon, the anemometer, the journal—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values (truth > safety). The final decision to cache duplicate records is earned by the prior stalking beat and the second note; cost is felt in the phrase “waiting for the storm that would set it free.” No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elena commits to continued observation with expanded risk, foreclosing the option of safe ignorance; cost is legible in the “something unbreakable” she now must conceal. Causal lens holds throughout—because she was followed, because the note confirms data theft, therefore she lateralizes her methods. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Elena’s courtyard”) and never loosens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The courtyard, fountain, and instruments function as micro-setting: the anemometer cups spinning “lazily” mirror her outward calm while the hidden compartment of the tube reweights the same space from sanctuary to espionage site. Weather tools constrain every choice—she calibrates by lamplight, decides on new stations—so the 9+ quick test is met. Selective sensory detail (amber light, pigeon body-warmth) keeps economy tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve meteorological truth against authoritarian erasure—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the second note confirms her data is weaponized. One meaningful deepening: realization that storms are being seeded converts her abstract vigilance into active complicity; the reply she drafts is the visible price that forecloses neutrality. Escalation is causal under the lens, no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—scientific integrity as quiet resistance—emerges through the recurring image of pressed flower petals against raw data: beauty persists amid fracture, recharged in the final “waiting for the storm.” No explicit thesis is stated; the conceptual repricing is that her solitude becomes insurgent archive. Ambiguity lingers about who “M” is, keeping the moral calculus complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elena’s perceptual signature—barometric gauge first, pigeon condition second—syntax lengthens only during reflective beats, compresses during threat (“She secured the message…”). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; technical lexicon stays within her professional idiom. Distinct rhythmic control under pressure meets the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The aluminum tube…bore official markings—pre-quarantine government seals that should have been impossible” advances plot, world-rules, and stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; prop tracking (tube, journal, anemometer) stays coherent. A single scaffold stem—“she had documented…she had assumed…she had pressed”—is purposeful anaphora, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The weather-data-as-resistance angle feels fresh; the carrier-pigeon noir twist refreshes the dystopia trope. Specificity of seventeen storm eyes crossing the checkpoint transforms abstract surveillance into lived science. While “rogue quarantine” is familiar, the synthesis with climatological insurgency and the flower-pressed journal makes the concept memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
