<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya’s embodied-decryption trait is vivid and consistent; the dance-cipher linkage feels lived-in. She shows contradictory impulses—awe versus tactical calm—while wading through flood-water. Micro-choices (spinning, stepping backward) visibly re-weight her goals. The filial reveal lands with a credible, felt cost: identity irrevocably re-keyed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: pattern of dance-splash⇄data-light builds texture until the “Welcome home” image crystallizes meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive before 120 words. Causal gaps are minor—no explanation for dice physics—but the lyric design teaches its own logic. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: her stance toward ancestry and knowledge is forever re-poised.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Flooded lab breathes, skylight-glow dances across shoulders, dice corner-balances: sensory triad anchors the beat. Spatial choreography stays clean—vent shaft→desk→console spiral. Environment constrains foot-placement and power access, feeding escalation. Micro-setting (warm humming dice) recharges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate sealed consciousness-data—tightens once: dance triggers encryption wall to fall. Cost is conceptual but legible: she can never again see herself as random orphan. Agency remains high; each splash is a deliberate decryption keystroke. Pressure peaks when reversal sequence demands she literally un-create her own knowledge path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited motion-as-wisdom emerges through concrete choreography rather than thesis. Subtext lives in dice refusal to land—silence as defiance of determinism. Final spiral of water offers quiet, non-moral answer: vulnerability encrypted becomes generative art. Ambiguity lingers—will world greet revelation with awe or weapon?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya; perceptual signature filters every image through dance vocabulary. Syntax flexes with pressure—long lyrical lines for flow, staccato fragments for beats. No head-hopping. Dialogue absent by design; narration carries subtext through motion. Dice glow is externalized without POV leap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence openings. Figurative language (“laboratory breathed”) is sparse and justified. Occasional loftiness—“mysteriously, defiantly alive”—skirts purple but stays in character. No loops, no scaffold, high info-density. Closure image crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dance-decryption concept gives fresh spin to both spy and lab-heist tropes. Inherited choreography as biometric key is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Dice that refuses faces embodies defiance of statistical fate. Specific familial science-ethics angle keeps idea from feeling gimmicky.</comment>
