<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cornelius’s longing for Isabella drives every beat; his synesthetic ghost-perception (tasting applause, seeing time as music) is vividly embodied and pressures choices. The final hand-clasp is a micro-choice that crystallizes his hierarchy of values—applause vs. love—with the cost of eternal repetition legible. Interiority never resorts to labels; contradiction lives in the sweet-acrid taste of possibility. Only the 17-posed Fool coin feels externally imposed, not character-derived.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lovers’ eternal encore reweights the garden’s fractured time into a Charged Poise where hope itself is the price. Causal linkage holds—coin → echoes → braided timelines → Isabella’s return—each beat a because/therefore step. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and never breaks; echoes accumulate density until the final image. Cost is unmistakable: “Tomorrow, they would perform again. And tomorrow. And tomorrow.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The mystic orchard’s orchard-as-clock rules—apples from all seasons, maze paths that reorder nightly—constrain tactics: Cornelius must sing echoes to navigate time, not space. Sensory hierarchy is ghost-specific: taste of honey-copper applause, purple light of despair, cinnamon warmth of touch. Spatial choreography remains clean despite surreal shifts. The amphitheater bench and tarot coin function as micro-settings that bear the final carved names, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Isabella from erased time—signals on page 2 and tightens when each echo risks over-braiding realities. One decisive deepening: the brightest timeline where they bow together aged is seized, foreclosing all other futures. Cost is visible: eternal repetition of one performance, never world-tour. Agency remains ghostly but active—he casts echo-lines, pulls possibility, accepts the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: art’s immortality is meaningless without love; nostalgia is the wound and the bandage. The tarot’s Fool transformed into two dancing figures reprises the motif with reweighted meaning. Subtext resides in sensory cross-talk—strawberry-silver voice, purple edge of despair—never translated. Final image of endlessly rising “tomorrow” refuses moral, offers charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, rhythmic: “taste of cardamom… spiraling gold.” Perceptual signature is consistent—time is music, emotion is flavor—without head-hop. Syntax grows shorter under pressure: “Then he saw it:” mirrors temporal fracture. Register never drifts; diction stays within ghost-poet lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but distinct—Isabella’s single whisper tastes of strawberries, proving voice separation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long liquid sentences alternate with fragment beats (“Tomorrow. And tomorrow.”). No scaffold; every sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent within synesthetic rule-set. Only minor loop: “apple trees that bore fruit from different seasons—spring blossoms beside autumn harvests” could compress, but does not dull closure. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic ghost-love story feels inevitable yet fresh; no close templates. Fractured-timeline orchard as theater is a specific synthesis, not checklist quirky. Transformation test fails if relocated—garden, coin, echo method are irreplaceable. Risk of eternal-loop ending is embraced, not hedged. Persistent constraint—nightly encore—grows from premise without late rule patch.</comment>
