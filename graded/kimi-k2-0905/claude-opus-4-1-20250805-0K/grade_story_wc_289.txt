<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her finger tracing the twig spiral, the “prismatic quiet” she recognizes in herself—and her contradiction (ghost-writing thousands of loves while avoiding her own) is active in every beat. The micro-choice to braid Chen into the installation crystallizes her hierarchy of values and forecloses anonymity with felt cost. Secondary pressure from Chen is present but diffuse; his one spoken challenge is the only on-page push, so the arc is almost solo. Still, the final hand-take is earned: she has physically woven her secret letters into public light, so exposing herself to him is the inevitable last step.</comment>

<comment>The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early—spiral, reflected lotus, repeated phrases—and lands a Conceptual Repricing: the same love letter under every private life is now literally shared in light, reweighting secrecy itself. Orientation is anchored by line 10; the later temporal jump (“By nightfall…”) is a single, legible transition inside the contiguous scene window. Causality is interior-accumulative rather than external-event: each inserted slide of ghost-text tightens the stakes of being seen. Closure carries unmistakable cost—her anonymity is gone, the temple now keeps her secret in reverse—so the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The lotus temple rising from the pond is not backdrop; its mirrored petals supply the prismatic motif that charges both the tone and the final image. The wire-and-light spiral is assembled on the exact marble where reflections double every phrase, so environment constrains the physics of display and forces the revelation to be duplicated in water. Micro-setting objects—copper wire, glass slides, solder smell—are tactile tools that alter how the art can be built and what can be hidden. Weather’s post-storm clarity is exploited: the pond becomes a second sky, making “every story told is both singular and universal” visually true on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she keep ghosting love or claim her own voice?—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each wired bulb is a public reveal of private text, tightening the risk of recognition. A single decisive turn occurs when Chen admits he kept her real letters; that confession forces the final choice to stand physically beside him inside the lit spiral. Cost is legible: anonymity forfeited, the installation now speaks her name.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterated refrain “we are all writing the same love letter,” reweighted when strangers will literally read one another’s phrases inside the spiral. Subtext operates in gesture—Chen’s welding hands never pause while confessing, making the metal’s heat carry what he cannot say. The ending offers resonant, non-literal answer: the temple keeps secrets by reflecting them, so revelation and secrecy become indistinguishable. No moral is stated; the conceptual repricing does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric is stable, focalized through Mira’s perceptual signature—“prismatic quiet,” “wisdom wearing dancing shoes”—a diction she could plausibly mint. Compression (“She’d written hundreds…hidden them in installations”) is taught early and paid off when the bulbs reveal those very texts. No head-hopping; Chen’s interior is surfaced only through Mira’s reading of his hands and voice. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflective beats, staccato sentence fragments when lights switch on, mirroring the tightening spiral.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense: “lotus petals seemed to cup the golden light, holding it like cupped palms hold water” performs mirror, hierarchy of hands, and spiritual vessel in one image. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances installation physics or emotional exposure. A single mixed-metor risk—“thread spiraling through every letter like the thrush’s instinctive geometry”—is justified because the piece’s rule-set explicitly equates nature and human pattern. Final line cadence echoes opening, producing quiet closure without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—professional ghost-writer of love letters turned public light artist—is fresh, and the fusion of bird-nest geometry with secret texts feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk of whimsy is embraced rather than hedged, proving “joy” can be serious structural material. Specific detail (solder smell, jasmine, rice-paper scroll) prevents the concept from drifting into abstraction. The synthesis of universal sameness and individual voice is non-obvious yet instantly legible to anyone who has ever written affection.</comment>
