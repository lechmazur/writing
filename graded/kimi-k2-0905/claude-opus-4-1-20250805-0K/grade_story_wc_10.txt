<comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—frozen tears, tactile vibration, the tuning fork pressed to glass. The contradiction between her grief for sound and her fierce need to “rectify” the loss drives every micro-choice; her silent transcription of thermal “notes” is embodied, not abstract. No epiphany is declared—she earns the insight by sleepless, data-heavy labor. The final, frozen tear crystallizes her cost without sentimentality.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each thermal snapshot adds density until the aurora-lit dawn reweights silence from deficit to new lexicon. Closure is a Charged Poise—she stands in a “concert hall” of temperature, foreclosing rescue-by-sound forever. Cost is visible: “tears had frozen on her cheeks.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60.</comment>

<comment>Winterglass walls refract aurora into “prismatic symphonies,” a visual metaphor that replaces unheard music; the 62 Hz floor hum is felt, not heard, keeping sensory balance. Conservatory layout stays coherent—monitor, vines, cloudberry cluster—each surface handled (fork pressed to glass, tablet keyed). The setting’s cold transparency literalizes her auditory void and supplies the thermal canvas that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove life sings after silence—tightens when each thermal pattern forecloses the old auditory method. Agency is continuous: fork, camera, keyboard—each act narrows her retreat to sound. Cost accumulates physically (frozen tears) and conceptually (she accepts Kepler’s death as price). Under Accumulative lens, the final aurora ribbon equals a cadence shift that locks her into thermal music.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: communication outlives the medium. Indigenous “plant spirits” echo as scientific confirmation, not appropriation, because Mira’s data validates rather than appropriates belief. Final image—frozen tear crystals catching aurora—reprises earlier “crystallized breath” and reconfigures loss into artifact. No moralizing; the reader carries the paradox of beauty born of injury.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains tight psychic distance; diction (“thermal phrase,” “quiet fire”) stays within Mira’s scientist-poet lexicon. Syntax lengthens during observation, shortens during fork strikes, mimicking data collection vs. stimulus. No head-hop. The aurora as “sound waves she could no longer access” is perceptual signature, not exposition. Compression is taught early (“silently expressive” hands) and paid off in final keyboard dance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—long aerial sentences for aurora, staccato for 62 Hz beat. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “prismatic symphonies” is single, sustained vehicle. Information density high: one sentence often delivers temperature shift, emotional valence, and world logic (“leaves brightening by two degrees Celsius in a spiraling pattern”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Two typos (“unshaken” for “unshattered,” “wavelengths” plural) are the only micro-slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of Arctic botany, acoustic science, and thermal imaging feels unprecedented; “music written in degrees” is a fresh conceit that could not swap settings. Tuning fork as stylus for plant-heat sonata transforms familiar object into new tool. Risk—making silence audible via temperature—pays off through rigorous on-page data. Final frozen tear crystallizes the concept without gimmickry.</comment>
