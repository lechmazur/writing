<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Marlow’s interiority is richly embodied (“mournful elation,” “tasting salt and liberation”), but his contradictory impulses are told rather than dramatized in scene; the ancestor’s memories flood in without prior micro-choices that foreshadow this surrender, so the final release feels assisted rather than earned. Ghost-bride pressure is atmospheric, not interpersonal—she never forces a visible trade-off on him—so the relationship crucible is implied, not activated. The bead’s hum and warmth are good object-handles, yet the emotional cost of letting her go registers more on the orchard (ordinary apples) than on his body/stance, softening the earned-stasis punch.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: bead’s warmth → her arrival → revelation his line must release her → dawn returns. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are vivid within first 120 words; no disorientation. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the breaking bead reweights three centuries of poisonous protection into mortal fruit and daylight; cost is legible in the orchard’s transformation and Marlow’s salt tears. One minor causality wobble: “resonant awakenings” are name-checked but never defined or shown to alter tactics, so their narrative function is decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<comment>Greenhouse-as-micro-setting is masterfully textured: glass catching no light, mercury pools, carnivorous vines feeding thieves, luminescent fruit pulsing like hearts. Each sensory layer (visual, haptic, olfactory from nocturnal blooms) constrains Marlow’s harvesting moves and charges the final reversion to “ordinary apples” with conceptual cost. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and tools track cleanly. The environment is not backdrop but agent—soil mixed with philosopher’s stone literally digests the ghost’s essence—satisfying the 9+ gate that setting must shape tactics or final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether the ghost can repay the debt—signals early and tightens once: bead’s accelerating pulse = barrier thinning. Escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; Marlow’s agency is largely receptive (he watches, remembers, weeps) so the visible price is paid by the orchard, not his choices. Still, the final dawn is irreversible and forecloses eternal-night protection, giving a felt cost under causal lens. One beat short: if Marlow had to decide whether to crush the bead himself, the trade-off would sharpen 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of toxic preservation versus release emerges through image pattern (poison fruit → mortal apples) rather than statement. Subtext operates in silence: ghost’s “lovingly venomous affection” is never explained, only enacted through murders and whispered formulas, letting reader weigh protection vs. parasitism. Final sunrise reweights the premise without moralizing—eternal night ends, but so does alchemical immortality. The orchard’s reversion is a resonant non-literal answer to the central question: holding on poisons; letting go restores natural decay. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermon detected.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited keeps steady psychic distance; diction (“starless sky,” “carved stone bead”) is idiosyncratic to Marlow’s alchemical worldview. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences in calm beats, staccato fragments (“The bead hummed. Dawn.”) at climax. No head-hopping; ghost’s voice is external, heard not ventriloquized. Only micro-slippage: “resonant awakenings” is an abstract phrase outside Marlow’s perceptual lexicon, a momentary register drift, but forgiven under lyric compression.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and musical: “tears of amber resin,” “white silk between the pomegranate trees.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative density is high yet coherent—metaphors (fruit as hearts, debt as weight) echo across beats and culminate in mortal apples without mixed logic. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, satisfying the read-aloud ear test. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“he felt” x2) in memory flood, but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so 9+ remains theoretically reachable; this keeps it just shy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Alchemical-orchard + ghost-bride + eternal-night is a fresh synthesis; the inversion that sunrise is catastrophic to immortal fruit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present—lyric ghost romance could tip into cliché—but saved by toxic metaphor and the orchard’s active digestion of bodies. Slight proximity echo to “eternal winter” fantasy tropes prevents 8.8+. Still, the specific detail (powdered philosopher’s stone soil, mercury pools) and the conceptual twist that love became centuries of slow poisoning give durable originality.</comment>
