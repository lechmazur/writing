<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s interior contradiction—cataloguing cloth while swallowing shame—lands early and stays active; the tactile memory of Julie cleaning bass strings crystallizes his loss into a micro-choice that reframes the cloth. His “confidently uncertain” voice is embodied, not labeled, and the final decision to vouch for the cloth costs him the safety of detachment. The flaw (failed expertise) drives every beat; no stock therapy-speak, but the epiphany is slightly rushed in the last paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV default met; orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 4. Causal lens holds: because he was publicly shamed → he hides in quarry → cloth triggers memory → he risks reputation again. Closure is Earned Stasis: he verbally endorses the cloth, reopening the wound he’d tried to bandage with facts, cost felt in the final sentence’s “space waiting to be filled.” No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quarry trailer functions as acoustic chamber—B-flat fluorescent hum, limestone walls that swallow sound—mirroring Marcus’s muffled life. Speaker cloth acts as micro-setting whose compression patterns literally encode past concerts, constraining his final choice. Sensory selection skews auditory, appropriate to a roadie. Spatial choreography clean; no weather clichés. Object-as-setting charges closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reclaim professional voice after public humiliation; signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation: cloth recognition tightens risk—if wrong again, final shred of credibility gone. One meaningful turn at phone call where he stakes name on tactile memory. Cost legible: “space waiting to be filled” implies future exposure. Agency resides in decision to speak, not exterior plot twist.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—preservation as performance—emerges through cloth’s journey from stage to trailer to collector, never sermonized. Subtext in silent handling: loupe, tissue, phone call speak louder than exposition. Final image reweights premise: archival act becomes new concert for unknown audience. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether redemption or merely more exposure awaits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person free indirect stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual filter—jeweler’s loupe, B-flat hum, 15-ounce weight—lexicon roadie-specific. Rhythm mimics set-list ebb: long reflective riffs broken by single-sentence drum hits. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Filter verbs (“he noted”) are voice-motivated, mimicking appraisal ledger. Compression taught early (“confidently uncertain”) and paid off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong nouns/verbs—threads worn soft, limestone swallowed sound—keep momentum. One scaffold loop: “remembered…remembered” in adjacent clauses (minor). No mixed metaphors; textile and acoustic metaphors stay coherent. Final paragraph risk of overwriting—“new frequencies” borders abstraction—but cadence earns it. Information density high; paragraphs pass cut test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle: failed rock-tech turned appraiser uses same skills—ear, touch, weight—to authenticate his own past. Cloth as palimpsest of concerts transforms familiar redemption arc into archival performance. Risk taken: 700-word single-scene meditation without exterior antagonist, yet pressure sustained. Synthesis feels inevitable: roadie’s expertise repurposed as existential act. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
