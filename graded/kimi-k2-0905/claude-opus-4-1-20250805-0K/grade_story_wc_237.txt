<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira’s crystallizing skin is embodied beautifully; the held-breath beat forces a visible cost as the crystals fall like glittering dust, making her final rune feel earned. Interiority stays specific—“the familiar geography of her stress-born scars” is vivid and particular—yet the epiphany about “boi = vessel” arrives as an abrupt etymological hand-wave rather than a dramatized contradiction, softening the motivational punch. Still, the arc from shame to self-authorship is legible and tied to one concrete object she physically creates. Meets 9- gate but not quite the hairline-free finish needed for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she holds her breath, crystals spread; therefore she traces them, producing a rune that literally embodies her flaw. The blank-page test is a clean early stake; the single-scene orientation is anchored within 120 words; the final image (rune glowing, crystals shedding) is a Decisive Change with visible cost—her skin clears, shame falls away. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; even the childhood rhyme pays off causally in the invented character. Closure lands on-page with felt cost and persistent constraint: she must now live as the scholar who wrote herself into being.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating tea-platform is more than postcard: its sway under her held breath tightens the stakes, and the crow quill is handled in multiple beats, reweighted when it delivers her self-portrait in ink. Selective sensory economy—jade-green leaves, velvet hush, crystalline dust—keeps description purposeful and filtered through Kira’s stress-narrowed perception. Micro-setting (her own skin as geography) constrains the final choice and charges the closure. Environment and tool both qualify for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“create one original rune or fail”—is signaled immediately and tightens through the single, literalized breath-held clock. Escalation is driven by her agency: each second of oxygen-starvation spawns more crystals, narrowing options until the only possible ink is her own skin-map. Cost is visceral and on-page: lungs scream, vision sparkles, crystals detach. Meets 9- gate; could push higher if the external world (Master Yuen) pushed back more explicitly, but internal pressure is coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the body’s flaws as alphabet, shame re-scribed into language. The rhyme’s re-translation from “boys” to “vessel” performs a conceptual repricing that reweights earlier material without moralizing. No abstract thesis is stated; meaning accrues through the concrete rune she literally authors from her scars. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: self as text, written in crystal ink.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kira’s perceptual signature—notice of “captured stars,” “velvet hush,” “liquid starlight”—with rhythmic compression under breath-held stress. Syntax mirrors physical constraint: short clauses when oxygen low, longer reflective cadence after release. No head-hopping; Master Yuen observed only through her filter. Distinct texture and modesty of knowledge maintained; qualifies for 9- band though not quite the last increment of daring compression needed for 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with diverse parts, no template cadence. High information density: “She didn’t draw a rune from any text. Instead, she traced the pattern of her own crystallized skin…” does triple duty—action, theme, image. Figurative language is restrained to peak beats and stays coherent (ink as liquid starlight, shame as shed dust). No synonym churn, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; minor alliteration feels voice-motivated rather than algorithmic. Clean grammar and spatial tracking throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “magic test” scaffold but transforms it through the skin-crystal language and literal self-inscription, producing a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to hinge climax on oxygen-deprivation and autobiographical ink is executed without clarity loss. Specific detail (grandmother’s children’s rhyme re-cast as vessel-code) roots originality in lived experience rather than ornament. The crystalline affliction and rune-creation are inseparable; story would collapse if swapped for generic powers.</comment>
