**Pre-Assessment Inferred Lens & Closure**: Drive = lyrical/accumulative (moonlight pattern, color motif), not causal; Closure = conceptual repricing (truth > beauty) via final line; cost = Cassia bears repeated witness to painful honesty; lens stable to end → 9-band gates viable.

<comment>Cassia’s quietly-savvy ethos is embodied in tactile micro-moves (uncapping jar, tracing tension on glass) that align with her “archaeologist of light” motive; contradiction between beauty-theft and truth-service remains implicit but legible. Mother’s grief supplies external pressure; Cassia’s renunciation of further explanation shows earned stasis at cost of ongoing emotional load. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; one beat of diagnostic phrasing (“already leaving…”) is forgiven for immediacy. No knowledge leak; competence balanced with fatigue.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens holds: moonbeam motif and color cadence tighten toward final conceptual repricing (“truth is more beautiful than the lie”). Single shard; spatial/time anchors clear by ~80 words; no orientation penalty. Closure lands on-page with undeniable cost: Cassia shoulders perpetual burden of unveiled truths. Persistent constraint—her need to keep walking into next night—shapes final image. Minor causal slippage: moonbeam mechanics not foreshadowed, but lyrical pattern teaches rule early enough.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Emerald-tiled walls, moss, battery spotlights, and moonlit jar form tactile micro-setting that guides access and frames final silver splash on wall; constrains choice by limiting light sources. Sensory hierarchy favors visual texture, but scent of orchids and tactile coolness of tile slip through POV bias. World rule (light-bottling) learned via action, not dump. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Recurring object—moonbeam jar—charges closure image. Meets 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: client’s need to see daughter’s truth vs. Cassia’s need to deliver it without breaking mother further. Pressure escalates through single deepening: golden glamour stripped, revealing departure intent; mother’s sob pays visible emotional cost. No external reversals, but micro-turn suffices under accumulative lens. Stakes remain personal, visceral. Agency rests in Cassia’s decision to exit, leaving mother with unretractable image. Tactic altered: she places next flower code, foreclosing rest.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty can mask painful truth; unveiling is a service and a burden. Subtext carried in repeated color inversion (gold vs. silver) and Cassia’s refusal to monetize comfort. Final line reweights premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; avoids pat conclusion. Ambiguity lingers: whether mother is healed or broken further remains unspoken, satisfying complexity requirement. Insight paid for by Cassia’s continued solitude.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited lyrical voice sustains moonlit, compressive cadence; perceptual signature filters every notice through light-quality. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Diction stays within Cassia’s artisanal lexicon (“molecular gaps,” “amber glow”) without academic drift. Dialogue minimal, subtext-heavy; mother’s two lines carry grief without exposition. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for golden lull, clipped fragments at exit. No filter-verb clusters. Meets 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Figurative language kept selective; no metaphor muddle. Varied sentence openings; paragraph cuts purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop (“golden hour… golden light”) forgiven for motif function. No scaffolding, synonym churn, or template cadence. Final silver splash image is crisp, propulsive. Copy-edit clean. Artifact-free in closure beat; 9-band eligible.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of light-thief and memory-archaeologist roles feels fresh; moonbeam-as-reagent rule original yet internally consistent. Concept of stealing not pigment but emotional masking layer offers non-obvious angle on familiar trope of truth-seeker. Color inversion motif (gold ⇄ silver) reweights familiar sunset symbolism. Risk taken in quiet, lyrical closure rather than twist; payoff coherent. Transformation test passed: premise inseparable from character voice and setting. +0.3 risk bonus applied.</comment>
