<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira’s “informally wise” label is repeated but never dramatized; her interiority drifts into editorial abstraction (“memories are like weeds—they find a way”). The synaptic-tasting gift is asserted, not embodied in scene. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her final quiet stance, so the renunciation feels lightly earned rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer of memory-garden builds density toward the final living artwork. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the neural garden recodes Ministry rule-set with undeniable beauty/cost. However, the missing Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (who/where until ~140 words) is taught early and pays off in the synaptic star-map climax, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rusted greenhouse body becomes protagonist-scale micro-setting: every touch of neural vine rewrites the rust into synapse constellations, directly enabling and charging the closure image. Triple-moon gravity tears supply the causal rule that lets memory leak between minds, a world-law learned through action not dump. Selective sensory hierarchy (taste > sight) mirrors Mira’s chef-perception, keeping exposition lean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve collective memory against Ministry forgetting—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when seed sprouts sideways into visible rebellion. Price is legible: if Ministry burns the garden, memories only root deeper, a felt cost crystallized in final line. One meaningful deepening suffices, but agency is more observational than tactical; escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: beauty as insurgency, vegetal persistence of shared past. Final reprise of “beauty from ruins” reweights the opening promise into societal repricing. Memory-taste motif accumulates pressure each time rust converts to neural constellation, avoiding tokenism. No late moralizing; resonance stays implicit in glowing soil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person selective stays anchored to Mira’s perceptual signature—synaptic-tasting air, pruning as culinary gesture. Diction (“knowledge fruit seed,” “neural garden”) coins without jarring; rhythm breathes with seed growth beats. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal metaphor control, which holds. Minor template cadence in “memories are like…” line, but forgivable at cadence peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: single sentences layer moon physics, memory biology, and political stakes. Mixed-metaphor risk (“rusted skeleton… constellation maps of synapses”) resolves because physical transformation is literally happening. One paraphrase loop (“memories… memories…”) costs −0.2. Otherwise scaffolding clean; no filter-verb stacks, no register drift in climax lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: culinary synaesthesia grafted onto neuro-garden rebellion. Knowledge-fruit trope is reskinned via plasticity physics and sideways neural sprawl, not predictable tree. Risk of sentimental “beauty saves all” is undercut by admitted vulnerability—Ministry may still burn it, cost acknowledged. Specificity of taste-based resistance feels organic, not prompt-box-checked.</comment>
