<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s single-minded quest to “harness” a dying language is viscerally embodied—every micro-choice (pressing the cracked diamond to bone, carving grooves with metal-laced nails) externalizes her motive. Interiority stays concrete: the feel of “dried lavender crumbling between fingers” translates abstract desire into sensory stakes. The final self-transformation into a new tower of bone is earned because her earlier willingness to accept the curse’s cost (hearing only loss) foreshadows that irreversible merger. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc is powerful but not yet fully contradictory; hence 8.7, not 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the instant the last speaker dies, the protagonist’s hybrid “Copper-Throat” language is already resonating in the canyon, making the cost of her metamorphosis legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through echo, texture, starling choreography—yet the final image reweights all prior pattern with undeniable conceptual cost: immortality as bone antenna. Causality is intact: accepting the curse → translating texture → becoming conduit. No orientation debt; spatial logic of descent, carving, and wind-borne return is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the bone towers’ hollowness literally supplies phonemes, the starlings’ negative space becomes tuning fork, the copper veins threading canyon walls after her death constrain future travelers’ experience. Micro-setting (cracked diamond, cracked bird formation) fuses with macro to dictate tactical choices. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—sound-as-texture over sight—keeping detail selective. Final image of “copper sealed crack” recharges the very object that initiated the pattern, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve Thuvenli’s texture before the final breath—tightens once: the diamond’s curse forces her to relinquish normal hearing forever. That irreversible trade-off escalates under Accumulative lens; each carved groove is a visible price paid. No coincidence; starlings’ shift is read as pattern, not luck. Cost is legible on-page (“her veins finally cooled”) and shapes the closing image. One tightening suffices at this length; would need a second fork or deeper moral trade-off to breach 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—language as somatic memory—emerges entirely through action and image: no thesis statements. The final reconfiguration (listeners feel words against soul) reweights every echo, bone, and bird motif without moralizing. Ambiguity is productive: is the hybrid tongue salvation or further exile? Subtext in starlings’ “negative space” silently argues that absence itself can be articulate. No thematic echo violations; insight stays embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains locked to the storyteller’s perceptual signature—metallic warmth, lavender crumble, silk on bark—creating a distinct rhythmic pulse. Syntax lengthens and shortens with wind-gust urgency; no head-hopping. Diction (“copper-veined,” “texture-sound”) is coinage born of her body, not ornament. Under peak stress the prose compresses to clause fragments that still scan. Voice modulation supports pressure without losing clarity; one hairline slip—“quietly articulate in seven living languages”—edges toward authorial inventory, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or sensation. Figurative vehicles stay internally coherent (diamond crack = starling gap = language fracture) and never mixed. Information density is high: one clause often fuses world-rule, sensory data, and emotional valence. Rhythm accelerates across night-long carving, then exhales into dawn quiet. No artifact touches the closure beat; flawless line-level control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses linguistics, ornithomancy, and osteomancy into an inevitable synthesis; nothing feels grafted. Risk—turning protagonist into literal infrastructure—pays off by making the canyon a living archive. Specificity of “texture-language” resists generic fantasy templates; the invented grammar of breath-on-skin is non-obvious yet fully grounded. Transformation test fails if relocated: bone towers, copper veins, starling cipher are inseparable. Bold structural choice to let the curse become translator, not obstacle, elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
