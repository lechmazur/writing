<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kael’s body-alienation after the transplant is vividly embodied; the interior contradiction between stranger-rhythm and deliberate climb is sharp. His micro-choice—asking “Teach me”—crystallizes values under pressure and forecloses passive absorption. The granddaughter remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible does not apply; Chen functions more as mentor than secondary pressure source. The arc earns its shift from passive receptivity to active illumination, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s pocketed wing reweights the premise—stories must flow, not settle. Causal linkage holds: because the heart draws stories, therefore he must learn to dye them outward. Orientation is clean by line 3; place and time are anchored in motion. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of color-whispers and sedimented tales tightens until the final scatter of light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house and light-chains function as micro-setting that constrains choice: ascent is the only path to Chen’s teaching. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—dye-master eyes notice indigo trench-whispers, vermillion lava-hum. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: ladder sway → veranda → table → pocket. The butterfly-wing-as-object qualifies as micro-setting; its scales redirect light and literally refract the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to survive the story-magnet heart—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Chen reveals the heart’s origin, shifting Kael’s stance from passive wonder to deliberate apprenticeship. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the final image of scattering rainbows makes the price legible. Escalation is Accumulative: color-whispers layer until the morpho wing offers a release valve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of bearing others’ narratives. Subtext lives in gesture—wing held to light silently teaches release. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing: scatter of light = re-pricing of “iridescent caution.” No thematic echo statements in final paragraph; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is dye-master synesthesia—colors whisper origins. Syntax mirrors bodily unfamiliarity: “unfamiliar rhythms” juxtaposed with deliberate climb. No dialogue, so indirection & tag tests N/A. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs serve voice (“he saw not just colors but narratives”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath of valley-mist wonder vs. clipped “Teach me.” Information density high—one sentence often does two jobs (“each batch of dye releasing tiny narratives”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally consistent (light-chains, sediment). Register remains within Kael’s artisan lexicon; no thesaurus drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cardiological ghost-story with dye-craft is fresh; “color as narrative carrier” feels inevitable in hindsight. Morpho wing’s iridescent caution avoids stock butterfly=trope trap by binding to medical warning. Risk-taking—floating rock tea house—heightens stakes without gimmickry because ascent mirrors bodily alienation. Transformation test fails if Kael is not a dye-master; specificity anchors premise.</comment>
