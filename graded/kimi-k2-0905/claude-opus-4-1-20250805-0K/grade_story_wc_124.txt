<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her trembling hand, tears that refract light, the way scent hijacks breath—but the “living archive” epiphany is stated more than dramatized. The contradiction between aromatic caution and inhaling the vial is present yet smoothed by authorial exposition rather than a visible micro-choice with cost. The mother’s absence is felt, but the filial relationship pressure is off-stage; the greenhouse ghosts do not talk back, so the crucible is internal and solipsistic. The ending renunciation (re-corking, accepting tears as translation) is earned, but the causal path is slightly shortcut by summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Elara-as-perfume-greenhouse reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is intact: because she uncorks, therefore she is transformed; because she weeps, therefore the conservatory blooms invisibly. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—scent layers density until a pattern break (empty vial) reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 3); the single transition (memory flash) is taught early and paid off in the spectral projection on glass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but instrument: spectral root systems and lantern glass constrain every move; the ultraviolet lamp is a tool that literally reveals hidden stakes. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Elara notices light spectra, resinous molecules, dying-star photons—never tourist-catalog. The final image of crystal shadows lengthening charges closure by marrying setting body and object: she is the greenhouse now. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible distances or prop drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she inhale the extinct memory and survive its cost?”—is signaled when the vial trembles. Escalation is accumulative: each ghost-scent tightens the noose of grief until the only remaining option is surrender to transformation. Price is visible on the page: the vial empties, her tears become the new medium, she forfeits normal human olfaction for archival duty. The final beat narrows options irrevocably—she cannot sell lanterns the old way again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—preservation as grief made luminous—emerges from the successive images of pressed light, perfumed ghosts, tear-prisms; no paragraph moralizes. The concept reweights at closure: “Some things must be lost to be truly held” is dramatized, not asserted, by her self-emptying into the greenhouse. Subtext operates in silence (the unspoken mother-daughter apology) and in gesture (re-corking an already-empty vial). The after-effect is concrete: reader leaves tasting extinct flowers that never existed for them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, matching a lantern-broker who thinks in spectra and photons; diction stays within her lexicon (“luminescence,” “olfactory archive”). Rhythm compresses under scent-attack—short clauses mimic molecule spikes—then lengthens into elegiac cadence at exit. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct (“Tears came unbidden”). Consistent perceptual signature: she sees light first, scent second, emotion last.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts are tight, no scaffold loops. Metaphors are coherent—light/memory/perfume share translucence—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high; every sentence at least doubles (action + atmosphere, or setting + metaphor). Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” phrase is justified by prior technical diction; does not breach POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct-flower perfume as grief technology + lantern-broker who trades starlight is not a trope bundle seen before. The concept commits fully—no safety hedge, no wink to reader. Risk—turning protagonist into disembodied archive—pays off by making the greenhouse feel inhabited again. Specificity of Silphium, Judean balsam, mammoth sunflower roots the fantastical in botanical fact.</comment>
