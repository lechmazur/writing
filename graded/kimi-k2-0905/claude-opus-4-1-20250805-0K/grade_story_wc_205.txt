<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cassia’s ex-revolutionary identity is concrete—her prison poems, her tactical eye for the “memory maps,” the way defeat has burnished rather than dulled her. The moment she angles the shard and the Venusians whisper back, her history and present motive fuse: she recognizes their last-ditch preservation because she once tried the same. Interior contradiction shows when her voice grows “thick with an emotion she couldn’t quite name,” revealing both longing and self-reproach. The final plan is earned: only someone who has already lost everything would dare promise resurrection to the dead.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Cassia’s promise of resurrection re-weights the entire dispute and the Venusian archive from “artifacts” to “waiting souls,” with the visible cost that she commits to an impossible, possibly self-immolating act. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: temporal light, baroque excess, and shard-whispers layer until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: the shard’s etchings → memory-map claim → ghosts appear → Huang’s curiosity shifts → Cassia seizes the opening. The persistent constraint is her irrevocable exile and the Institute’s legal grip—both still in force as she begins to speak in verse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The asteroid-Versailles is more than postcard: its mirrors (draped because they show possibilities) directly feed Cassia’s closing argument and supply the rule that reflections reveal branching selves. Spatial choreography is clean—shard on table, storm outside, mirrors lining the hall, bodies tracked. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices gold weeping cherubs because she’s alert to imperial decadence; temporal ribbons register as tactical data. The shard itself functions as micro-setting—handled, rotated, warmed—so environment, tool, and choice intersect in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is ownership of the Venusian archive; secondary is Cassia’s need to reinvent herself after defeat. Escalation is textural: each mention of visible time, the shard’s song, and the storm’s approach thickens the sense that something irreversible is approaching. The decisive tightening occurs when ghosts actually appear—Huang’s curiosity becomes a live option for Cassia to leverage. Cost is legible: she publicly commits to resurrect a civilization, staking her remaining credibility and guaranteeing future collision with the Institute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular reversal: defeated revolutionaries (human and Venusian) discover each other across extinction and exile. No moral is stated; instead, the final image of Cassia speaking in alien verse offers a resonant, non-literal answer—preservation as mutual insurrection against time. Subtext operates in gesture: Huang’s glove adjustment signals institutional anxiety; Cassia’s tearless thickness signals grief too old for crying. The mirrors’ symbolism (possible selves) is integrated through action—she uses the concept to persuade Huang—so theme grows from causality, not allegory.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Cassia’s perceptual signature: tactical metaphors (“read the temporal currents the way she once read tactical maps”), sonic memory (“singing the old revolutionary songs”), distrust of grandeur (“preposterous beauty”). Syntax lengthens under emotion: clauses pile up when she speaks of defeat. Dialogue is minimal but distinct—Huang’s nervous formality (“The Institute will need proof”) contrasts Cassia’s poetic cadence. No head-hopping; temporal-storm description remains filtered through her strategist eye.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences multitask (“the shard caught light like frozen tears, its edges singing the old revolutionary songs” sets object, simile, and historical resonance in one stroke). Figurative language is patterned and paid off: mirrors → possibilities → closure argument; crystals → preservation → resurrection plan. No scaffold loops; paragraph breaks coincide with tactical beats. Ear-test rhythm rises toward the ghost reveal, then softens into the final verse. Minor register lift (“conceptual matrices”) stays within Cassia’s intellectual range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of baroque asteroid, visible time-rivers, and Venusian soul-crystals feels fresh, yet every extravagance is tethered to Cassia’s emotional credibility. Genre tropes—ruined civilization, space Versailles, temporal storms—are inverted into a meditation on failure’s creative aftermath. Specificity anchors novelty: “ribbons of amber light” is precise; Versailles in miniature is absurd yet economically justified. The final reconfiguration (extinction as collaboration) is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
