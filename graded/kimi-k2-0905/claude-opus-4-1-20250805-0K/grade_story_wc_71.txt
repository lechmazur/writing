<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina’s quiet cartographer persona is vivid and consistent; her choices to trace, pocket, and finally surrender the shard are micro-turns that cost her the comfort of distance. Interiority stays concrete—violet warmth spreading through skin—without diagnostic self-labeling. The only drag is that her “why” remains a touch abstract until the final paragraph, softening the causal bite just before closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric arc holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each displaced object layers density until the shard becomes the pattern’s keystone. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she gives away the crystallized hush, forfeiting her exclusive witness role; the cost is legible in the surrender image. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. One causal seam: the leap from “offerings” to “houses alive” is told not tested, but the lyric contract carries it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bay, body, shard, and migrating mailbox form a living micro-setting that constrains every move: she walks the shoreline only because the objects point there, and the shard’s translucence literally re-visions the beach. Sensory economy is tight—three senses braided through one verb (“blazed through her consciousness”). Final image of bay “cradling its displaced treasures” recharges all prior anchors without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand the creeping wrongness—tightens when the shard reveals the beach’s temporal slippage, foreclosing her observer safety; cost is the act of surrender itself. Escalation is accretive, not causal, fitting the chosen lens. One visible price: she forfeits sole witness status by planting the shard in the sand. Could wish for a mid-scene complication that tests her resolve, but the quiet accrual aligns with hush concept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “houses learn to breathe absence into presence,” never sermonized. The orris shard and migrating gnome accumulate meaning without symbolic neon. Final image of bay holding breath reconfigures grief as spatial care rather than sentimental balm. One hairline slip: “inadvertently profound” skirts self-commentary, but context buries it in Marina’s awe, not authorial nudge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Marina’s synesthetic attention—streetlights “daydream,” silence “blazes”—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens then compresses with her pulse, climaxing in two blunt clauses: “She placed the shard… Marina walked home.” No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: she sees time as lateral drift and scent as crystallized epoch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—long breathy sentences for tide-hush, staccato fragments when she palms the shard. Information density high: one sentence can map, mythologize, and emotionalize (“mailbox that migrated three inches leftward each month”). Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. One tiny scaffold: “this wasn’t silence—it was the active presence of quiet” could compress, but it pays off in the final hush image, so artifact waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: domestic grief transmuted into geo-spatial offering via perfumery mineralogy. Orris-as-hush is non-obvious yet inevitable once taught. Risk of lyric quietude is high, but stakes stay intimate—daughter dead, son abroad—so concept never drifts into cosmic filler. Could use one more sensorial twist that only orris could enable, but the specificity of crystallized violet between plant and stone feels newly minted.</comment>
