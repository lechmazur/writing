<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—clinging to stories while learning to release them—surfaces early and culminates in the on-page renunciation of the shell. Yet her “lucidly watchful” stance is asserted more than embodied; no bodily cost or visible mistake undercuts it, so the final release feels lightly earned rather than paid for in sweat or blood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the shell’s surrender reconfigures her stance from collector to witness, cost felt in the emptied palms. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reverse-flow images tightens until release becomes inevitable—but the old woman’s footprints filling uphill remain a stray coincidence that neither complicates nor deepens options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The feral junction’s inverted physics—dew climbing blades, mist flowing inland—acts as a living constraint that funnels Marina toward renunciation; the shell on the rail gleams as the charged micro-object that focuses the final image. Selective sensory triage (rust, upward dew, humming spiral) keeps the lyric texture taut without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep or release the collected hopes?—tightens once, at the shell ceremony; no secondary reversal tests her further. The cost is conceptual (loss of curatorial control) rather than visceral, adequate for lyric mode but short of the visible price that would push the band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: stories, like fireflies, must be let go to stay alive. The closing whisper—“I release these hopes to find their own shapes”—flirts with echo-statement, yet the prior image-chain earns the resonance, avoiding moralistic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter; diction (“feral nexus,” “swirling hush”) is consistent and rhythmic. No head-hop or register drift; compression like “shapes of their hopes” teaches the reader to accept elision early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: no synonym loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional cadenced triplets (“erasure and becoming”) risk mannerism yet serve the incantatory release; momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Inverting natural law to frame artistic surrender feels fresh; the cameo-of-cameos device mirrors its own message. Risk is moderate—lyric eco-magic is familiar in lit-fic—but the specificity of dew climbing grass blades and the shell’s inland exile lifts the piece above template.</comment>
