<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s pacifism is shown through embodied ritual, not label; the moment she withholds haste to protect the roses’ “meditation” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Father’s micro-choice to sheath the weapon atop her soil links bounty-hunter identity to her ethic, earning the final quiet. Interiority stays concrete, but one beat drifts toward “teaching them to weave continuity” — a near-thematic echo that softens the contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: father’s sheathing reconfigures their shared future while the dome holds visible cost — the desert still waits outside. Causal lens holds: because Mira cultivated stillness, therefore the killer kneels. One soft spot: “engraved quiet” is named before it is dramatized, a mild causality bump, but the final image reweights it with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dome’s glass and the scrap-ballast pouch function as micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice — father kneels on the same canvas that once kept his airship aloft. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: light geometry, soil warmth under palm, metallic sheath click. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions even during the airship descent beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake — continuity versus retribution — is signaled early and tightens when the weapon stays unsheathed; the tranquil surface forecloses vengeance as a live option. One meaningful escalation under causal lens suffices; cost is the father’s visible exhaustion and the visible sheathing. No abstraction: the rose accepts the blood-scented air, making the price sensory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the roses’ learned patience rather than assertion; the final image of “something else rose” reweights the fallen tower without moralizing. Subtext carries in silence: father’s hand on soil = unspoken apology. Avoids thematic echo until the penultimate paragraph; the mild drift into “teaching them to weave continuity” is the only preachy breath, limiting the band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature attuned to hush and light geometry; diction stays within Mira’s contemplative lexicon. Rhythm modulates from long breathing sentences to the staccato of “Complete.” No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective — “prayer made solid” — and never muddles causality. Information density high: single sentences merge setting, body, and symbolism. One paraphrase loop: “the same way these roses bloom… the same way we persist…” costs −0.2, capping 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist botany as counter-bounty hunting, taught through desert roses that literally learn values. Risky quiet ending commits fully; no gimmick. The scrap canvas pouch reprises as seed vessel — an irreversible, specific object. Could swap desert roses for cacti, but the dome-and-airship pairing is idiosyncratic enough to resist generic transplant.</comment>
