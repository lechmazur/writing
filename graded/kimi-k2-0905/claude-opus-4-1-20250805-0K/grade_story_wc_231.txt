<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Magnus’s interior contradiction—gift as curse, longing for memories he both hoards and fears—plays out in embodied beats: the salt-cracked palm, the press of brittle petals to temple. His micro-choice to time the lighthouse rotations against his pulse reveals obsession under pressure, and the final pin-prick of the Edelweiss to his lapel is a renunciation that costs him solitude he had perfected. The absent son is felt as secondary pressure, but because he never appears on stage, status dynamics and voice distinction bullets are waived. What keeps this from 9.0 is that the moment of greatest emotional risk—the recognition that he forgot his own wedding—is filtered through lyrical paraphrase rather than a vivid flash that forces an immediate bodily reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each lighthouse sweep layers density until the coordinate-scratches in the dock teach the reader the pattern of edited time. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Magnus’s “isolation” is re-priced into chosen vigil now that stolen joy has been returned; the cost is the irreversibility of decades already swallowed. Causality is coherent: because the boutonnière resists, therefore he probes the dock; because the gaps align with lighthouse beats, therefore he deciphers the temporal coordinates. The only hairline slip is a single register lift—“conceptual repricing” is the narrator’s meta-language, not Magnus’s—but it occurs after the decisive image and so barely grazes closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The opal dock, moonstone mist, and lighthouse beam function as micro-setting that literally constrains perception: Magnus can only see during the twelve-degree nautical twilight and only decipher scratches when the beam hits at the exact angle. Weathered planks, salt-cracked palm, and the transparency of the dried flower against light are tactile anchors that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—distance from lantern to dock to waterline is tracked through footfalls and sweep timing. The mountain/sea exile tension is evoked through the wrongness of an Alpine bloom beside tidal pools, making environment a character.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—recover or relinquish stolen memories—tightens once: when Magnus realizes the gaps are the only intact pieces of his own past, the option to keep living in curated amnesia is foreclosed. The price is visible: the “weight” his son could no longer carry is transferred back, and Magnus feels “lighter” yet burdened by the irrecoverable years. Agency is accumulative—each probe of the boutonnière and timing of beams deepens knowledge rather than alters external options—but this accrual culminates in a genuine stance crystallization: he climbs the lighthouse “now with his own memories to companion,” an endurance that accepts perpetual cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of remembering solitude: memory, once returned, does not end isolation but makes it chosen rather than imposed. The Edelweiss reweights from alien intrusion to wedding relic without overt statement; the ocean that swallowed his son also washes the returned objects clean. Subtext resides in the silence—why the son chose baptism over confrontation is left gaping, inviting the reader to feel the unsayable. The final image of a figure swimming (or memory surfacing) offers a charged poise that keeps ambiguity alive while undeniable cost is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The perceptual signature is lighthouse-haunted: moonstone colors, sweep-timed gaps, salt crust, and “softly persistent” as a mantra that threads through diction. Syntax tightens into fragmentary coils under pressure—“He began timing them against his pulse”—mirroring the rotating beam. Free indirect style is clean: “He understood then” slides seamlessly into Magnus’s diction without filter verbs. No head-hopping; the single POV holds with modest confidence calibrated to a man who reads objects, not minds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long, tide-pull cadences to staccato investigative beats, supporting the beam-sweep pattern. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory data, backstory shard, and metaphoric charge—“the Alpine flower, preserved and ancient, felt wrong here at sea’s edge.” No loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative vehicles stay nautical or mineral. The only micro-drag is the abstract noun “isolation” used twice; replacing one with a concrete image would sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of nautical twilight + memory theft + lighthouse keeper feels inevitable and fresh; the son’s self-baptism as return-method is a risk that pays off by re-pricing solitude. Tropes—lighthouse hermit, drowned return—are inverted: the son returns memories, not himself, and the father accepts rather than follows. The opal dock as palimpsest for temporal coordinates is a specific invention that would collapse if relocated. Emotional complexity outruns surface novelty, achieving durable insight.</comment>
