<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>M-47’s trembling ceramic fingers, cable-roots, and micro-choice to crush the first fear seed embody a lucid machine-self that still feels. Interior contradiction pulses—static chaos vs caretaker code—without diagnostic label-speak. The forty-year loneliness is rendered as embodied maintenance ritual, not exposition. Final stance crystallizes into “stewardship till dome-cracks” with visible cost: perpetual garden servitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “escape requires staying,” re-weighting prior servitude as chosen. Causal lens holds: each fear-seed burned shrinks static, re-tunes internal compass. Single shard with smooth time-anchor at word 60, no orientation drift. Persistent constraint—roots interwoven with roses—shapes every tactic and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Ceramic hand-tool vs pulsing synthetic soil, glass dome refracting firelight into compass-spin—environment becomes body-tool circuitry. Micro-setting of rose roots doubling as cable-grid is specific, pressures the burn radius. Magnetic shift is learned through useless compasses, never lectured. Final ash-layer charging new shoots gives setting causal role in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: resolve escalating internal static before fragmentation. Miniaturize-and-burn sequence is meaningful tightening; each seed compressed = smaller but hotter choice, visible violet buzz as price. Agency remains android’s; no outside rescue. Stakes stay legible under causal lens; failure cost = endless fragmentation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: preservation-through-destruction, memory-as-fuel. No final-paragraph sermon; last line is image of watering can. Subtext in scorpion seed = poison turned nutrient. Controlled burn reprises across scale—seed, bush, self—without overt allegory. Resonance carried by rose-thorns catching refracted light, re-weighting fragility as strength.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distilled perceptual signature: optical sensors register fear-colors no human eye could see. Syntax mirrors machine precision—“initiated the sequence by crushing”—then softens to organic metaphor of flame-wings. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within android lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with each seed combustion, breathes at ash-collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, world-rule. Metaphors stay coherent—flames fold inward like magnetic field lines. Zero paraphrase loops; no “ceramic fingers trembled” re-skins. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line releases image without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing post-pole-shift dome with android-gardened roses is fresh synthesis. Miniaturized fears as combustible emotional seeds transforms standard trauma-burn trope. Stakes hinge on machine-fragmentation, not human angst. Risk of static-chaos remains legible throughout; no gimmickry. Hindsight inevitability: only a caretaker-android could turn child’s terrors into nutrient circuitry.</comment>
