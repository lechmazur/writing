<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “weathered,” her head “spinning worse than the carousel”—yet her contradictory impulses (archive vs rebuild) are summarized rather than acted out in a single visible micro-choice. The ghost functions as an external conscience, so the “relationship” crucible is diluted; negotiation stays verbal, no physical stake risked. Closure renunciation is signaled, but the causal bridge from scavenger to memory-keeper is compressed into one speech paragraph; the cost is declared (“these fragments—they’re instructions”) rather than dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the timeline “snaps,” ghost dissolves, waters restart—an unmistakable reconfiguration with felt cost (she surrenders linear life). Causality is lyric-accumulative; each camera click layers echo-voices until pattern breaks; lens holds. Orientation anchor (floating carnival, 3-mile altitude) appears by line 6, well before 120-word mark; deliberate disorientation is taught early and pays off, so no penalty. The persistent constraint—carousel stoppage freezes narrative time—shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Kinetic Lagoon is not backdrop but physics engine: water spirals generate lift, stalled carousel freezes narrative time, camera wheel becomes micro-setting that literally focuses the final beat. Sensory triage favors vapor, brass condensation, and creaking mechanisms—details filtered through Kira’s architect-trained eye. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her circling the ride, pressing wheel to ear, mist absorbing ghost—no impossible positions. The setting constrains the closure beat: only when she aligns spectral and solid fingers does time restart, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconcile eroded ambition vs archival duty—signals early; pressure tightens when ghost demands “accounting.” One decisive intensification: the finger-touch that liquefies ghost and restarts waters narrows her fate from restorer to memory-keeper with visible cost. Agency is interior-attention rather than external deed; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Coincidence is absent; escalation is steady accumulation of overheard warnings until pattern ruptures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of autopoietic utopias: success obsolesces its makers. No explicit moral; final image of restarting waters reweights earlier scavenging into stewardship. Subtextual irony—she clings to a “disposable” camera to immortalize impermanence—remains unspoken. Sentence “The world built itself without us” risks thematic echo but is brief and framed as her realization, so only minor ding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is architect-meets-medium: precise spatial verbs (“spirals,” “churned,” “anchored”) mingle with synesthetic listening to water-memory. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences stretch like carousel rotations, then fracture into staccato clauses at finger-touch. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within Kira’s technical lexicon. Final line “as if learning how” gives humble, tentative cadence that mirrors new role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver world physics, altitude, and evacuation history without stall. Figurative control tight—only two metaphors (“like rust,” “worse than the carousel”) and both character-apt. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: “or was it…” repeated twice inside 50 words creates hesitation loop but serves disorientation motif, so forgiven. Closure line is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Floating amusement-park-as-archive is fresh synthesis of solarpunk-ruin and ghost-memory tropes. Conceptual risk—stalling narrative time itself—pays off in legible Charged Poise. Specific detail (thermal spiral equations, disposable-camera archaeology) prevents swap-generic. Emotional truth—success displaces creators—resonates beyond gimmick. Not quite 9 because core arc (scavenger→librarian of echoes) is recognizable post-apocalypse beat with new skin.</comment>
