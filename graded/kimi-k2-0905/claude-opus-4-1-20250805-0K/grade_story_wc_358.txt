<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya’s calm professionalism under the anomaly is credible and specific; she photographs, bags, installs monitors—micro-choices that reveal methodical competence. Yet no interior contradiction or visible flaw surfaces; her emotional palette stays in narrow, competent register. The final image of foresight rings true because she alone has gathered data, but the cost is external (global risk) rather than a personal stake or limit faced on the page. Still, her perceptual lens—scientist acuity toward wind, rust, container geometry—remains distinct and propulsive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the port becomes a heartbeat, humanity warned; the patch and expanding field re-weight reality’s rules with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—patch → footprints → convergence → monitors → forecast. One soft causal leap: how Maya infers the time-dilation pause is shown only by overlapping footprints, never tested on-page; since closure accepts the rule, deduction stays mild. Structure is single-scene, orientation anchored by photo one, no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Immediately tactile: rust dust, metallic canyons, anemometer smoke spiraling at impossible angles—details filter through investigator gaze, not tourist catalog. Containers lean like flowers, mirroring anomaly pull, charging final image. Tool-as-setting (patch, smoke canister) constrains tactics and foreshadows cost. Spatial choreography survives maze turns without drift. Environment causes choice—Maya stations monitors where steel walls funnel wind, proving setting stakes claim.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—warn world before convergence devours cities—declared early via instrument readings. Escalation: wind anomaly grows, footprints overlap, field expands millimetrically, stakes tighten spatially and temporally. Agency visible: monitoring installation is tangible tactic under pressure; cost is knowledge of impending engulfment, accepted on page. No second reversal, but single meaningful deepening suffices; coincidence complicates rather than rescues. Cost legible in final heartbeat image, but felt more globally than personally, keeping score sub-9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: human perceptual frameworks—aviation regs, physics equations—shatter against emergent reality; investigator protocols must evolve or perish. Motif of wind, once mundane, re-acquires menace, reweighted at end. Subtext lingers in silence of citizens suspended mid-gesture—comment on modern systems blind to non-linear threat. No character articulates thesis; final patch gleam suffices. Slight abstraction in “forces humanity was only beginning to perceive” edges toward statement, preventing higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya with controlled psychic distance; vocabulary of flight procedures feels authentic without jargon dump. Rhythm flexes: longer reflective sentences for theory, clipped fragments when instruments scream, mirroring cognitive tempo. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature—she notes coins scattered, container serial numbers, wind vector math—separates her from generic narrator. Dialogue absent by design; prose compensates with scientific subtextual urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often advances premise, image, and emotional tilt (“The patch had fallen from his jacket as he'd crossed the threshold”). Metaphors stay precise—containers “like steel flowers following an invisible sun”—and pay off visually. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts tight. Opening line anchors voice and mystery; closing line cadence shifts to slow heartbeat, recharging motif. One micro-slip: “hazy precision” is abstract label twice used; minor but keeps from 9-band perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Anomaly-as-atmospheric-convergence feels fresh, not stock sci-fi portal; graft onto aviation-safety procedural is novel synthesis. Stakes externalized to civilizational scale yet routed through lone investigator keeps risk personal within short frame. Specificity of container yard topology, anemometer data, and flight-engineer culture differentiates from generic “reality rift.” Concept commits fully—no retreat to dream or hoax—follows implication to credible warning-system endpoint. Meets high-band risk distinction.</comment>
