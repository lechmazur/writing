<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s calm, methodical release of insects to scramble scanners crystallizes his quiet-rebel persona; Serena’s roguish charisma is conveyed through nimble dialogue and seed-handling beats. Interiority is concrete—“his beetles responded to his sudden tension”—and both retain distinct speech cadences. The final smile under raid-threat shows earned stasis: he accepts capture risk to keep the garden network alive. Flaws: no interior contradiction shown in-scene; competence feels near-perfect, softening pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s smile while locust “rain” floods the scanners crystallizes his stance—thoughts will stay wild, taxable or not—felt cost is the imminent raid. Causal chain holds: Auditor proximity → seed hand-off → insect countermeasures → tunnel exit → planted city-wide pattern, all propelled by because/therefore logic. Lens is Causal throughout; no orientation drift. Setup of “Cognition Tax” is brief, anchored to scanner squeal, therefore no orientation penalty.</comment>

<comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting: humid glass, condensation-fogged door, chlorophyll scent—details filter through Marcus’s entomologist gaze and directly enable his scanner-jamming tactic. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, tunnel, doorway distances track across beats. Insect inventory (mantises, moths, locusts) is handled tactilely, not listed. No externality cap applies; environment constrains choice and charges the final “rain” image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the seed-message network alive—tightens when Auditor squad triangulates the greenhouse; Marcus’s insect gambit is the decisive escalation that narrows options to “guard at personal cost.” Agency is present; coincidence (Auditor arrival) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the imminent raid and possible capture. One clear tightening is sufficient at this length; escalation is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: thought commodification vs. photosynthetic rebellion, seeded through insect-jamming and vegetable alphabets. No character articulates a slogan in the final paragraph; resonance lands in the final image of “soil that recognized no authority but the sun.” Subtext operates in Serena’s seed-pass and Marcus’s locust-release—gestures speak louder than manifesto. Complexity is preserved: rebellion is beautiful, fragile, possibly doomed, yet chosen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—wing-beats “scrambled frequencies,” scanner registers locust swarm as “rain.” Syntax mirrors Marcus’s observational calm even under raid; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue carries subtext: Serena’s “Fashionably so” and “plant the pattern” conceal urgency inside flirtation. POV stays single, stable; no head-hopping. No register drift; diction remains within an entomologist’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose shows rhythmic variety; sentences shorten during raid-entry beat—“The door burst open, but Marcus only smiled.” High information density—one line can world-build and advance: “Outside, Thought Auditors prowled… insect wing-beats scrambled their frequencies.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective and paid off—“rain” of locusts returns as scanner-confounding tactic. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—taxed thoughts vs. garden alphabet—is fresh, fully committed, and followed to logical extreme. Insects as encryption keys, tomatoes as typeface, and locust consciousness crashing software feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes (dystopian rebellion, rogue academic) are re-animated through sensory specificity and ecological metaphor. Risk of obscurity is embraced but never breaks clarity; reward is heightened stakes and memorable imagery.</comment>
