<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s linguist identity is more label than lived-in: her “expertise in dead languages” is asserted, not embodied through idiosyncratic perception or error. The diary-as-chest move is clever, but interiority stays at a scenic distance—no contradictory impulse under pressure beyond the single offer to “complete the diary.” The renunciation lands cleanly and frees the seekers, so motivation coheres; still, the arc falls short of genuine flaw-driven struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: diary gaps → map → silk trail → recursive room → negotiation → release. The blank-pages gambit is a decisive, visible cost that rewrites the contract; mountain’s acceptance provides clear DC. Orientation crystalizes by 120 w; no prop or rule break. One minor elasticity: the “hundreds frozen” appear only at the end yet feel narratively weighty—acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Granite shelves that hum, amber that smells of “forgotten gardens,” starlight-bound book—details are tactile, selective, and charged. The bookstore’s living rule-set (reconfiguring paths, demanding payment) directly constrains Mira’s tactics; silk threads and missing spines become interactive tools. Final image of a “garden of knowledge” re-weights the motif. Only absence: no body-as-setting beats under duress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes—“reach the library or join the amber museum”—are legible early and tighten through each sealed loop. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: the self-referential room forces pattern recognition, then the amber gallery presents mortal cost. Agency resides in the linguistic offer; mountain’s acceptance forecloses hoarding and opens dissemination. Cost is conceptual rather than personal, limiting top-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as knowledge versus transmission: unlearned lessons must be sown, not archived. The diary’s blank pages reframed as “space for future knowledge” reweights the premise without sermon. Motif of pressed flowers/seed recurs naturally, charging the closure image. Avoids explicit thesis, but “library of unlearned lessons” concept nudges toward allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person keeps consistent psychic distance; no head-hop. Prose texture leans literary—“corridors spiraling like chambers of an ancient heart”—yet stays controlled. Occasional elevated diction (“arcane linguist,” “condensed starlight”) fits the elevated concept; rhythm modulates with scene shifts. Dialogue-free, so no voice-convergence issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong info density: one sentence can stage, characterize, and foreshadow (“botanical diary grew warm… responding to the mountain’s peculiar acoustics”). Metaphors generally coherent; minor pile-up in “unheard symphony” paragraph but pattern is purposeful. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final image crisp, earns its uplift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusing living mountain, language-based escape room, and botanical codex gives a fresh braid on “magic archive” tropes. Turning the diary’s lacunae into negotiable blank pages is an ingenious, specific twist that grows from prior setup. Risk is present but cushioned by familiar enchanted-library frame. Resists quirky-for-quirky’s-sake; emotional core stays human.</comment>
