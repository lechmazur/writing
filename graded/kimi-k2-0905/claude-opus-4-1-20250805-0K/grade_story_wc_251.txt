<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses are sketched—Marcus both shelters and endangers Elena—but they stay verbal, not dramatized on the board. The final “checkmate” line is earned, yet the cost (Elena’s father, the town’s reprisal) is asserted, not shown. Interiority is vivid (“he heard its ancient warnings”) but leans on stock phrasing; still, the hierarchy of values (children > regime) is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—stars visible, the town’s stance permanently tilted; the synchronized window gambit supplies visible cost. Causal chain: Elena’s tears → Marcus commits → 9 pm display → collective awakening; each link is present and legible. Orientation is secure by line 10; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation of “amplified quiet” deepens rather than deflates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mist-breathing cobalt library functions as micro-setting that constrains visibility and time; the hovering chess pieces under magnetic starlight charge the final image. Selective sensory triage—pulse, thrum, glow—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is clean: Marcus sets Elena down, pawn advances, windows ignite in sequence. Environment is not backdrop but accomplice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom of thought—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the director’s arrival clock starts. One meaningful escalation: the synchronized window gambit flips abstract lessons into civic visibility, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual but legible: townspeople exposed, Elena fatherless if regime strikes. Agency remains Marcus’s; luck is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through chess-as-thought, not slogan: “Every revolution begins with a single square forward.” Final starlit image reweights the premise—kings are only pieces, not fate. No moralizing paragraph; ambiguity (what happens at dawn?) is purposeful. Subtext in Elena’s pawn push: sacrifice of innocence, not just wood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Marcus; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—aurally weighted, heartbeat diction (“thrumming beneath its foundations”). Filter verbs serve voice (“he heard its ancient warnings”). Rhythm modulates: long sentence for mist arrival, staccato for window sequence. Dialogue minimal but goal-driven; Elena’s whisper carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density high—“magnetic grotto under starlight” does three jobs. One paraphrase loop: “teaching them to question every move the town’s authorities made” restates prior sentence; minor, does not touch closure. Metaphors coherent (library as lung), no mixed vehicle. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chess + authoritarianism + sentient library + electromagnetic activism. Risk—lyric speculative in <800 words—pays off: final star image reconfigures meaning without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if moved to generic town hall. Tropes (rebel mentor, midnight signal) revitalized by sensory specificity and causal integration.</comment>
