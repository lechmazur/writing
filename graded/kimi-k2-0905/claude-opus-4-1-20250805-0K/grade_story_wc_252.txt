<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—binding her chest while longing for the island—grounds every beat; the unbinding is embodied, costly, witnessed. Torven’s pivot from gruff claim to vulnerable asking gives him credible depth and pressures her choice. Relationship shift alters both selves, not romance but mutual recognition, cleanly earned. Minor slip: “magnificent” is a touch abstract for peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scrimshaw found → claim/evade → shared backstory → unbinding → island surfaces. One smooth scene, ~750 words; orientation anchored by word 50. Closure is Charged Poise: they swim toward an island now permanently manifest because their authentic selves foreclose return to old roles—cost legible in abandoned clothes and dock life.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Kelp, whale-call vibration, phosphorescent surf are selective and body-filtered. Sublittoral fringe acts as micro-setting that gates the final crossing; discarded bindings on rocks reify the cost. Weather and tide stay coherent, never stall momentum. Could use one more sensory anchor to dock life to sharpen what is left behind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom to exist without violent erasure—signaled early. Pressure tightens when captain’s vulnerability removes physical threat yet raises emotional risk. One meaningful turn: Mira’s public unbinding irrevocably narrows options; no coincidence required. Cost visible in forfeited disguise and livelihood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-liberation emerges through concrete images—nets, bindings, glowing bone—never slogan. Final image of abandoned scrimshaw on pier reweights prior material: the tool is obsolete once hearts are unlocked. No moralizing; tenderness and risk coexist. Whale-call as ancient invitation feels inevitable, not symbolic graft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is fluid, tidal, slightly ancient without purple drift; diction stays within dock-born POV. Rhythm accelerates underwater, breathes on rocks. No head-hop; Torven’s interior arrives only through Mira’s perception. One filter-verb cluster during whale-song costs the 9-band by a hair.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high: one line often does description, emotion, world-rule. Mixed-metaphor check clean. Minor scaffold: “rough hands grabbed less often at those who slipped away like tide” could trim two words, but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Pacified world where violence is physiologically impossible is fresh lens on trans self-revelation; island appears only when identity violence ends—organic synthesis. Scrimshaw-as-key reverses typical magic token: it reveals viewer, not location. Risky choice to make climax a gentle swim rather than battle pays off through charged poise.</comment>
