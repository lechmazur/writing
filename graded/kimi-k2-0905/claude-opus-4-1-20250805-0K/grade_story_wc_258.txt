<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid—her noticing of ghost data, her generational reflex to map migrations—but the contradiction that should power her is only asserted (“steadily curious nature”). Marcus functions as appreciative straight-man; no status friction or micro-choice tests her. The ending renunciation honors the 43-day rhythm, yet the cost is conceptual, not dramatized through Vera’s body or wallet. Still, within 800 words the portrait is specific enough to feel individual rather than trope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each black card laid on the algorithmic tape adds density until the ultraviolet reveal reweights the whole archive. Orientation is swift—loft, rain, client arriving—and causality is replaced by pattern recognition; the final image of water finding new paths crystallizes the stakes without a causal duel. Closure is a Charged Poise: the choice to wait 43 days is crystallized, cost felt in the ghost-data hum. The piece teaches its elliptical method early and lands it cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The loft’s rain-beaded skylight, coiled tape-measure, and server-hum are tactile micro-settings that constrain Vera’s method; the ultraviolet lamp is the tool that literally reveals the final map. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s vocation—she hears fiber-optic ghosts before she notices Marcus’s wet coat. Spatial choreography is tight: cards, tape, lamp, stairs tracked without drift. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can the Jakarta archive be read before it dissolves?—is clear early; pressure tightens when Vera proves the 43-day sync, foreclosing the option to dismiss the network as dead. Agency is intellectual: each card laid is a renunciation of simpler explanations. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—her practice now bound to their calendar—yet the price is legible. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: persistence = distributed fragmentation, value = pattern not coin. The final image of water re-prices the premise—survival is liquidity, not solidity. Subtext lives in gesture (Marcus’s dripping coat ignored) and in the silence after “Forty-three days.” Complexity is honored: no moral is declared, only a calendar enforced. The refrain of inherited mystery links grandmother’s tea leaves to carbonized hard drives, turning genealogy into networked memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person stays close to Vera’s perceptual signature—light through raindrops refracted into “tiny prisms,” cards “darker than the night.” Syntax lengthens when she thinks in algorithms, shortens when the client arrives. No head-hopping; Marcus’s interior is inferred only through Vera read of his body. Register is consistent—technical terms (“algorithmic intervals”) feel native to her diction. Rhythm modulates: the final paragraph’s quiet cadence mirrors the earned hush after revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “carbonized hard drives” does double world and mood work; “ghost data singing through the walls” personifies without purple stretch. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence; metaphors stay physically coherent. Paragraph cuts are purposeful—each advances knowledge or image. Minor loop: “each black card…darker than the night” repeats the dark conceit, but the repetition accrues rather than stalls. Final line lands with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cartomancy with crypto-archaeology feels inevitable, not gimmicked. Inherited mystery as tonal through-line transforms a familiar post-crash survivor story into a meditation on mnemonic liquidity. Risk—using onyx cards instead of tarot—pays off when ultraviolet reveal reweights meaning. Specificity of “carbonized hard-drive ink” anchors the concept in tactile reality. The 43-day sync is a fresh inflection that grows from Vera’s method, not authorial sleight.</comment>
