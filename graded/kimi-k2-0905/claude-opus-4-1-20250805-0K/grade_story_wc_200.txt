<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation, perceptual bias, and micro-choice to sit and hum off-key are vivid; the “modestly fearless” trait is shown rather than labeled. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, so the interiority is coherent but not yet layered. Thomas’s ghost is sketched through gesture (tuning phantom strings) rather than internal access, adequate for a secondary on-page presence. The final smile is earned through her cause-and-effect guidance, yet lacks a visible cost to her, capping the arc at “strong” rather than “exceptional.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The closure lands as Charged Poise: Thomas’s dissolution into sunrise light reconfigures the gorge’s acoustic/memory rule-set and is felt as cost (his lingering laugh). Causal chain—Mara’s hum → Thomas embraces discord → release—stays intact. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. A 0.3 reserve remains because the persistent constraint (tooth compass) does not tighten or pay a price for Mara in this beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The gorge’s acoustic logic (echoes amplify, distort, fold) constrains every beat: speech returns “sevenfold,” music becomes “weeping made of music.” Tool-as-setting: the harp’s misalignment literally shapes Thomas’s spectral tether. Sunrise moisture turns stone to “cathedral of gold,” charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free Thomas via confession—signals early. Single meaningful tightening: Mara’s invitation to “play it wrong” forces Thomas to trade shame for acceptance, visible when his form dissolves. Cost is paid by Thomas (existence) rather than Mara, keeping the 8-band ceiling. Pressure accumulates acoustically under Accumulative/Textural lens; no causal reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—imperfection as beauty—emerges from the harp’s wrong notes and Mara’s off-key hum; no explicit thesis statement. Final image of “broken and beautiful” music reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silent mouth-open-close of Thomas’s ghost. A 0.3 buffer remains because the crocodile tooth motif does not shift meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly elevated diction (“spectral confessions,” “weeping made of music”) is consistent with mythic tone and taught early. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for dawn hush, fragments for ascent. Filter verbs are sparse; perception stays body-close (“tooth grew almost hot against Mara’s chest”). No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior is projected through gesture and music, not ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Metaphors are coherent (“sunrise… cathedral of gold”) and kept out of high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop—“music that knew its own flaws and loved them”—is forgivable. Information density high; opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The soul-collector trope is familiar, but anchoring her compass in a saint-swallowing crocodile tooth and using off-key humming as the healing catalyst gives a fresh inflection. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than twist—but coherence is high. Could edge 8+ with a sharper cost or world-rule surprise.</comment>
