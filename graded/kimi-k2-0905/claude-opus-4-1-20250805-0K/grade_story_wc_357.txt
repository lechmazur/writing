<comment>Kessa’s calm, observant professionalism is consistent and specific; her micro-choices (trusting upward water, slotting the arrow tip) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—“whirling silence pressed against her ears” is felt, not labeled. The earned moment of smiling in inverted gravity shows credible endurance with cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, slightly thinning the crucible effect.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the monument light seeds a conceptual repricing—colony survival now depends on dancing with, not conquering, Verdance. Causal chain holds: arrow tip → monument → planetary wisdom, each link visible. Orientation is anchored by word 70. No teleporting props; gravity flip is foreshadowed and paid off. Cost is legible—“the colony would survive now… by becoming part of its endless, graceful defiance”—a social cost of surrendering control.</comment>

<comment>The floating rock arches, upward rivers, and inverse orchard are not backdrop: they funnel every navigation choice and finally allow the trees to ignore gravity. The broken arrow tips form a micro-setting map that rewrites plant law. Sensory selection is urgent—sound spirals, metal pulses, water streams maintain path during inversion—guiding Kessa’s decisions. Final image of “endless, graceful defiance” is charged by these environmental constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find resilience source—tightens once: the monument reveals survival demands surrendering control, not engineering it. Agency is present; Kessa chooses up, slots the arrow, accepts planetary lesson. No reversible loss or tool cost is dramatized; escalation is conceptual rather than visceral. Closure cost is felt through reframed colony future, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: resilience is not endurance but irrelevance to change. Subtext lives in water that never notices inversion and arrows broken at identical angles—technology learning to bow to nature. No final moralizing; the smile and “graceful defiance” image reweights prior material. Ambiguity remains: colony may still fail, but stance is irreversible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps steady distance; perceptual signature is pilot-technical—“checking chronometer,” “reading currents,” “calling coordinates.” Syntax tightens under inversion: “Gravity flipped.” No head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction—“conceptual repricing,” “orbital groves”—slightly overshoots Kessa’s likely lexicon but stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sensory flows versus clipped inversion beat. No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“stone formations that hung like frozen waterfalls in reverse.” High information density: one sentence often delivers setting, motion, and emotional filter. Closure sentence lands clean without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Upward rivers and anti-gravity orchards feel newly inevitable, not gimmicky. Arrow tips as seeds of gravitational constants invert typical tech-nature hierarchy. Risky planetary inversion taught early and paid off in final image. Conceptual freshness couples with emotional specificity—“dancing with it” reframes survival as courtship, not conquest.</comment>
