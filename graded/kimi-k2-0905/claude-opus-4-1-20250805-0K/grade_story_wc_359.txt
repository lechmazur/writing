<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyrian’s synesthetic gift is vividly shown through mint-tasting violet footfalls and cinnamon-tasting turquoise sound, but her interior contradiction is asserted (“wonder versus Council decree”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice until the single strike. The seventeen-year backstory is efficiently anchored, yet the moment of irrevocable cost—her striker’s residual hum—feels ornamental rather than a felt forfeiture. No genuine flaw or blind spot complicates her flawless execution, so the “earned” change reads as coronation, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the aurora’s permanent synesthetic broadcast legally nullifies the Council’s decree, the cost being the amber sheet’s dissolution and the Basilica’s autonomy now tied to sky-music. Causality holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens: each resonance layer thickens until the world literally re-tunes. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation is taught early and pays off when the cavern itself becomes instrument. One minor lapse: the striker, not the sheet, is foregrounded as the persistent constraint, yet the ending credits the sheet’s loss; still, the reweighting is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Ice cavern as instrument is not postcard backdrop; every sonic hue is refracted through frozen air-bubbles that literally release their captive notes, turning setting into co-protagonist. Micro-setting of the amber sheet on its “pedestal of frozen time” constrains the single precise strike required. Spatial choreography stays clean as aurora light descends through cracks that were pre-established. Environment charges the final image: the sky keeps playing because the cavern taught it how.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential before tomorrow’s audit”—is signaled early and tightened when the sheet reveals it needs the aurora, not bells, forcing a one-shot gambit. Escalation is accumulative: each resonance wave adds density until Council meters shatter. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the Basilica’s bells lose monopoly on wonder, now sky-bound. No visible personal price for Lyrian keeps this from the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: synesthetic symphony proves wonder is an un-commodifiable frequency that breaks efficiency algorithms. Subtext whispers that art’s value lies in its uncontrollability—once the aurora learns the score, no state can meter it. Final image of “oscillating repose” reweights the opening sculpted hush from silence-as-absence to silence-as-potency. Avoids explicit thesis statement; resonance is felt through sensory overload in the reader’s own imagination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Lyrian’s synesthetic perception; every metaphor is filtered through her cross-wired senses (“tasted as cinnamon and seen as spiraling geometry”). Rhythm swells from hushed sibilants to crescendo of liquid light, mirroring the symphony’s arc. No head-hopping; even global reactions are rendered as colors she would hear. Distinctive syntactic layering—“sound-color-symphony”—teaches the reader the fused sensorium and pays off in the final sky-drenched chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is orchestral: short percussive strikes alternate with long flowing auroral clauses. Figurative density is high but patterned, taught early, and never muddies causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image adds new sensory fusion. Occasional elevated diction—“oscillating repose,” “conceptual repricing”—reads as liturgical register appropriate to the Basilica rather than authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of synesthesia, aurora-as-instrument, and silence-made-ice feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Trope of “art outlawed by rationalists” is refreshed by the solution being not rebellion but revelation: the sky itself pirates the broadcast. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple abstraction, yet precise sensory cross-mapping keeps it grounded. Transformation test passes: swap synesthesia for any other gift and the entire sensorium collapses.</comment>
