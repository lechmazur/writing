<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya’s solitude on the tower keeps the crucible internal; her contradictory impulse—commercial duty versus impossible spiritual hunt—is dramatized through the micro-choice to wire the fragment herself. Embodied emotion is sharp (“fingertips tingle,” “breast pocket thrummed”), but the interior shift from skeptical Guild employee to teacher of silence is declared more than demonstrated; we glimpse the decision but not the visible cost on-page. The final renunciation (“tune her life differently”) lands as Conceptual Repricing, yet the price (lost Guild income, exile?) is implied, not felt. Enough contradiction and sensory anchoring to reach the 8-band, but the cost legibility keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the shard’s darkening marks a Decisive Change—Maya elects to “tune her life differently,” foreclosing Guild monetization. Causal lens holds: each tower rung pitch, lunar perigee gap, and fragment glow tightens her options until the silence itself rewrites her future. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within first 120 words; no ambiguity at end. Cost is visible in the fragment’s extinction and her dawn-descent solitude; the city’s sway charging the final image satisfies the persistent-constraint test. A hairline slip: the “six hours” duration is told post-fact, not experienced, but it does not rupture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment and tool are inseparable: the swaying tower, copper filaments, and mineral-scented mist literally constrain where she can step and how she wires the fragment. Hollywood fragment functions as micro-setting—its weight and glow charge every decision beat. Sensory economy is POV-filtered (“rusted dishes pointed skyward like a congregation of metal prophets”) yet never stalls momentum. Final image of dawn-gilt towers reuses the established visual palette, crystallizing the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><question>Stakes tighten from impossible theory to tangible silence pocket; lunar perigee supplies a live clock that narrows the tuning window. Escalation is causal: each gravitational distortion enlarges the gap she must lock onto, forcing the hand-wired filament gamble. No external antagonist—pressure is orbital and existential—yet the final silence still exacts the fragment’s death as price. One meaningful turn suffices; cost is legible on-page, satisfying lens guardrails.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: silence as generative medium, endings as hidden on-ramps. Subtext is woven through reverse-echo physics and the fragment’s extinct Hollywood dreams—silence literally births her next career. Final image of “profound music of the space between” offers a non-verbal answer that reweights prior noise-filter science. No moralizing; ambiguity (will anyone follow her?) lingers, fulfilling the resonant-aftereffect test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s perceptual sieve: rungs “singing a different pitch,” gorge mist “lazy spirals.” Syntax lengthens during drift, compresses at fragment flare, mirroring signal intake. No dialogue to distort; narrative diction stays within her technical lexicon yet avoids jargon dump. Voice modulation under pressure is evident in the breathless listless cadence inside the shard.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned—“congregation of metal prophets,” “extinct dreams”—and pays off in the final religious hush. No mixed vehicles; physics imagery stays internally consistent. Informational compression is stellar: one sentence slip-streams Guild commerce, grandmother exile, and city origin without stalling. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are surgical. Minor template echo of “every…sang/beat” is purposeful, not mechanical; no loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Conceptual inversion—radio towers hunting silence—feels inevitable yet fresh. Shard of hush as cosmological lacuna re-weights standard SETI tropes. Hollywood nebula fragment fuses celebrity detritus with astrophysics, a specificity unavailable in generic stardust. Risk of lyric abstraction is embraced but controlled; closure remains legible, rewarding the gamble.</comment>
