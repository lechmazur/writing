<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coachman’s quiet, ritualized agency is consistent; his multilingual plant-whispering and bird-listening give a concrete, idiosyncratic lens. Interior contradiction is muted—no moment where his resolve or guilt is stress-tested on the page—so the arc feels more processional than transformative. Still, embodied detail (pods rattle “like old bones,” knees press into shrapnel) keeps him particular and grounds the final renunciation. Cost is present but generalized—“garden will grow without him”—rather than personally paid in a single visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each seed placed adds density until the closing image reweights the battlefield from scar to soil. Orientation is swift—purple twilight, rotting planks, dead reef—within first 50 words. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the promise that memory of war will be “especially fertile soil” crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. One scaffold loop (“within a season… within a year… within a decade”) slightly dulls the final cadence but does not rupture the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jetty, tide, roses, gulls, and dissolved phosphorus form a living micro-setting that actively feeds the action; every sensory note is also nutrient data for the seeds. Stillness of mirror-bright water and night-hunting sounds narrow and widen scale in one breath, creating the titular “narrow vastness.” Shrapnel under soil and calcium reef skeleton act as tactile constraints the plants will exploit. Environment is not backdrop but collaborator, charging the final image of star-lit shoots.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the shore accept amnesia through aggressive growth?—is signaled early and escalates by accretion: each pod species chosen to “digest metal” tightens the means of erasure. No reversal, but a deepening: gulls’ phosphorus news confirms the reef’s conversion to fertilizer, sharpening the cost of remembrance. Protagonist’s agency is deliberate scattering; the price paid is the certainty that human memory will be root-split and unreadable—felt as conceptual, not personal, loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “forgetting as mercy” emerges through vegetal violence rather than thesis: plants weaponized to erase history’s scars. Subtext lives in gull-calls and seed labels—languages extinct like the soldiers—implying culture itself is compost. Final image of “bones” becoming “especially fertile soil” reweights prior battlefield imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: reader must decide if erasure is grace or second death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the coachman’s ceremonial stance; diction (“salt-sweet air,” “calcium embrace”) is elevated yet consistent with a man who speaks dead tongues. Sentence rhythm swells and contracts—long anaphoric rolls for planting, clipped fragments for gull translation—mirroring task and perception. No dialogue, so voice distinction is carried entirely through perceptual filter, which remains idiosyncratic and controlled. One brief template cadence (season/year/decade) is the only minor slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: metaphoric layering (“garden would eat the battlefield whole”) advances both image and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds nutrient or ritual detail. Occasional elevated register risks purple but stays justified by the coachman’s philological mind. Final paragraph scaffold (“within a season…”) is the only artifact, a minor drumbeat that slightly dulls closure immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-war ecological reclamation with necrolinguistics feels fresh; no recent analogue pairs Akkadian seed-labels with reef-corpse fertilizer. Conceptual risk—using vegetal violence to argue for willed amnesia—pays off in a non-moralizing closure. Specificity of heart-vine, memorial grass, forget-me-spite turns abstract rewilding into palpable botanic arsenal. Transformation is complete: remove any ingredient (language, pods, reef death) and the story’s engine collapses.</comment>
