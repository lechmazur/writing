<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—she “feels the ridged texture” and sorts “entropy from chaos”—and her three-century longevity is shown through tactile memory, not exposition. The “furiously tranquil” contradiction drives her micro-choices (steady breath, dancing hands) and the final planting carries visible cost: she accepts sole stewardship of folded time. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are N/A; her flaw—willingness to shoulder causality-breaking power—compounds across beats and is accepted, not cured, at closure. Voice remains individuated, never sliding into therapy-speak; the earned stasis feels scaled to 800 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: planting the acorn reweights the entire premise—garden, time, and responsibility—with undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: seed-images accrue until cadence shifts in the final paragraph, crystallizing meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 and never drifts; transitions (ice → vapor → soil) are legible inside one continuous scene. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the acorn’s rule-set is taught early and paid off in the final image with visible price—Mira’s solitary future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is more than postcard: its sublimation reveals living oak that “had been growing for a thousand years,” directly constraining the reopening action. Micro-objects—acorn cap, suspended seeds—function as setting-extensions that charge the final image when the cap is planted. Sensory detail is selective (ridged texture, starlight glitter) and filtered through Mira’s seed-saver expertise; no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: spiral floats, seeds self-plant, Mira’s body remains centered; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—releasing vs. protecting the vortex inheritance—tightens once: the spiral slows and Mira commits to reverse the collapse. Escalation is textural: density of seed-memory increases until the acorn’s glow reweights options. Cost is legible on-page: she forfeits anonymity and conventional time, accepting eternal custodianship. No coincidence resolves; the garden’s return is driven solely by her entropy-decreasing agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance as continuation, not possession—emerges from seed specificity and Mira’s final choice, never stated. The Cherokee Purple and Glass Gem corn carry literal memory, so the closing oak feels inevitable, not symbolic graft. Subtext operates in gesture: the steady breath amid temporal vertigo signals acceptance of endless duty. Final image offers resonant, non-moral answer: new oak will remember both past and future, reweighting all prior “borrowed time” as gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is botanist-poet: “velvet worn smooth,” “recursive wheat,” syntax threaded with hyphenated compounds that mimic DNA strands. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—short clauses (“She smiled, furiously tranquil”) echo metronome breath. No head-hopping; single POV stays strictly bounded. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated; diction never exceeds Mira’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances seed, time, or body. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“spiral of seeds floating in frozen air” sustains physical logic. No register drift; elevated diction (“entropy,” “causality”) belongs to a three-hundred-year narrator. Opening line anchors voice and stake; closing line resolves by image that recharges “wild serenity.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vortex-as-genetic-inheritance is fresh synthesis; “seeds containing compressed time” feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risky temporal botany could collapse into gimmick, but specificity of Cherokee Purple and Dragon Tongue beans grounds the concept. Transformation test fails if renamed: the exact acorn grown from “first oak that learned to remember the future” is irreplaceable. Bold structural compression—entire cosmology in 800 words—heightens meaning without obscuring closure.</comment>
