<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s patient scientific gaze and Chen’s retreat from prophecy form a believable rift; her quiet refusal to accept his fear is shown through micro-gestures with the cicada and the calm offer of the grotto’s mirror-pool. Interiority is concrete—starlight on wet stone, crab-shell tactics—never textbook. The reconciliatory nod is earned because her earlier catalogues of “every ending is… another beginning” have already dramatized her stance; still, the beat is more acquiescence than visible cost, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Chen’s closed fingers around the cicada crystallize the option of return, the cost his acknowledged fear. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—star-fields in tide-pools, mating metaphors of molting—each image deepening the stake of bearing witness to transition. Orientation is clean within 120 words; causality is stable (Mira’s calm dismantles Chen’s withdrawal). Cost is felt but slightly diffuse—no single line screams loss—hence not breaching 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto architecture—barnacle acoustics, mirrored star water—literally refracts conversation, constraining privacy and metaphor. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting: handled twice, its translucence decides when dialogue turns. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Mira catalogues by scientific priority, not tourist visuals. Final plankton bloom charges closing image, satisfying 9-gate test by a whisker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Chen re-enter live chronicling—surfaces early. Pressure escalates through accretion of transition examples; the plankton wave provides a single tightening beat that reframes silence as invitation. Mira’s agency is observational, not manipulative; cost is Chen’s admitted fear rather than her concrete loss, capping intensity just above 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation’s witness emerges through iterated tide images rather than dictum. Final plankton star-map offers non-literal answer: seeing simultaneous creation/destruction is bearable only when shared. Subtext in dialogue—cicada seventeen-year pause vs tidal seventeen-breath pause—remains implicit. One minor echo of prompt language (“texture of time”) slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s scientific perceptual grammar—calcium cities, lunar reliability—without slipping into Chen. Syntax grows shorter under wave-crash moment, mirroring her quickened attention. Free indirect diction stays within coastal naturalist lexicon; no academic register drift. Cicada and star metaphors are voice-motivated, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</comment>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with tidal sentences—long clauses retreat, fragments crash. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles remain sea-locked. Two instances of near-repetition (“patient architecture… patient certainty”) are minor loops but do not stall propulsion. High information density—each sentence layers observation and judgment—largely free of scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: ecological chronicle as antidote to temporal vertigo. Tidal pool as micro-cosmic clock is non-generic; jade cicada reprises without feeling inserted. Risk is quiet—no genre pyrotechnics—but internal coherence justifies it. Could swap Pacific for Atlantic without structural fracture, keeping it shy of 9-band.</comment>
