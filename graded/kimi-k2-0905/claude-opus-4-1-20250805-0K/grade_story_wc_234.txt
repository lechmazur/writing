<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyra’s contradictory drive—science vs. memory—stays embodied (shell twist, calibrating fingers) and peaks when she risks the nexus with Marcus as witness; the cost (three lost years, cooled reactor) is felt. Interiority slips once into “scientifically romantic” label-speak, muting immediacy. Relationship pressure alters the dyad’s state: Marcus’s whisper becomes the catalyst she has to witness, not solve. Earned stasis: she accepts non-replication, trading certainty for return-difference.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the shell-sun hovers, re-weighting prior failures; cost is the cooled, darkened nexus—loss of old method. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of twilight images and iterative returns tighten until spiral-sun crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleport props. Single micro-turn—shell against nexus—reconfigures rather than resolves, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting (shell, nexus surface, dying light) constrains every move; twilight’s color shift times the beats and supplies the final palette image. Sensory hierarchy obeys alchemist gaze—veins, warmth, calcium curve—none feel touristic. Spatial choreography clean across hand/ shell/ nexus contact. Environment mirrors internal fade-to-glow arc without overt symbol declarations. No credibility hits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“density of presence” vs. replication—tightens when Lyra pivots from capture to invitation; decisive narrowing occurs at shell-nexus contact. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each failed ember beat adds weight until spiral reverb offers only one path: witness, not trap. Cost visible: nexus extinguishes, foreclosing old fusion tactics. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterative return imagery rather than thesis: twilight, spiral, friend’s name—each return differs, reweighting presence. Subtext carried in silence as Marcus watches hand-placement; final image answers core question non-literally by showing light that remembers. No sermonizing; complexity accepted—some moments can’t be bottled, only re-entered. Sentimentality avoided through concrete calcium-and-carbon specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lyra’s perceptual filters—alchemy lexicon, calcium curves, dying ember pulses—without POV leakage. Rhythm swells and narrows with experiment tempo; short clauses under nexus hum mirror stress. No dialogue ventriloquism; Marcus’s four words cut clean, carrying subtext of long witness. Filter verbs minimal and justified (“felt the sting”)—immediate otherwise. Voice distinct from grandmother legend yet lineage audible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose mostly propulsive; sentences multitask (veins pulsed / last warmth / failed experiment). One metaphor stack mid-scene—“dying heart at twilight” plus “crystalline veins”—approaches density penalty but pattern taught early, paid off. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts crisp. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge spiral image. Micro-movements narrated only when tactically significant (shell turn revealing columella).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of soft-science alchemy with lyric memory-philosophy feels fresh; trope of “bottled moment” subverted by refusal to trap, choosing recursive witness instead. Specific heirloomed shell and cooling reactor tether concept to tactile specifics, resisting abstraction. Risk in accumulative structure rather than plot reversals heightens resonance without gimmickry. Could edge higher if conceptual twist were even less foreseeable.</comment>
