<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured through tactile substitution of lost smell; the micro-choice to leave the screw deliberately loose externalizes her empathy and earns the tender closure. Mrs. Huang’s single line of dialogue and trembling hands supply enough embodied contradiction to make the grief legible. No head-count or status issues; aromatherapist past is anchored to present action via touch-based diagnostics. The −0.4 gap to 9+ is the absence of a visible cost to Mara herself—her gift feels pure, not personally priced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: mineral deposits, fog, and screw form a pattern that intensifies until the final loose reassembly reweights “repair” as integration of damage. Orientation is secured by word 60; single-scene default met. Closure is a Charged Poise: water resumes but now carries the daughter’s memory forward—cost is felt in Mrs. Huang’s dissolved sentence and the forever-loose screw. Causality is associative, not because/therefore, yet the pattern holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Steam-fogged windows, brass channels, and the green-tinged screw create a micro-setting that literally steers Mara’s tactile method and the final image of fog meeting water like ultrasound. The shop’s perpetual condensation externalizes the theme of softened grief and constrains visibility, forcing reliance on touch that charges the ending. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: no smell, so sound and texture dominate. One hairline slip: “towering buildings” is generic, but it’s outside the focal object and does not blunt closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate mechanical failure into human truth—tightens once: the screw blockage shifts from obstruction to keepsake. Pressure grows texturally: each mineral layer felt in the channels adds emotional weight until the deliberate loosening forecloses perfect restoration. No causal reversal, but the accretive deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope. Cost is vicarious rather than personal to Mara, keeping the score south of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the recurring water-and-screw motif: damage is not erased but integrated into continued flow. Subtext lives in silence—Mrs. Huang can’t finish the sentence; Mara finishes it with an action, not words. Final image of water drops as meditation reconfigures “ordinary miracle” without moralizing. No thematic echo or abstract statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s tactile perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“water sang different notes through copper versus brass”). Syntax breathes with foggy pauses yet accelerates during the screw extraction. No dialogue clutter; the single spoken exchange carries indirection worthy of the hush. One microscopic filter verb slip (“she thought about her lost sense”) does not contaminate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“fog…like memories trying to enter”). Sentence variety supports the meditative cadence without algorithmic pattern. Copy is clean; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with mirror-like fog/water imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—water-clock repair as grief translation—feels fresh and inevitable. The midwife screw is a specific, non-obvious catalyst that could not be swapped for any random part. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final ultrasound-like fog image. No derivative echoes or template plotting detected.</comment>
