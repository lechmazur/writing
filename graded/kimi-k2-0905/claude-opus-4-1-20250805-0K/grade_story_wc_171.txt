<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-into-patience arc is credibly embodied (traces clipboard, kneels to touch grandmother’s mark); the interior contradiction between banner of vengeance and operative gentleness is shown through micro-choices rather than label-speak. However, the leap from “three revenge kills” to “slow art of listening” is asserted in backstory, not dramatized on-page, so the transformative hinge feels slightly schematic rather than earned in scene. The final stance crystallizes with clear cost—she cedes the heroic narrative and positions herself as “just the ones still breathing”—which satisfies the closure gate for earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated failures etched in the clipboard accumulate pressure until the pattern break (red→amber light) reweights meaning at the end. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored within 120 words via terrace, twin suns, ebony prop. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clipboard’s new amber glow re-prices three centuries of grievances with undeniable conceptual cost, and the lens holds without ambiguity. One minor causality wobble: the “younger Kolani delegate” appears without prior spatial cue, but choreography remains trackable and does not fracture escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terrace as micro-setting constrains every move—ritual stones, memory-glass reflections, no-shadow light at alignment—charging the final image when delegates physically kneel to the clipboard. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices wood grain, light quality, bone-chime timbre because they bear on peace ritual. Selective detail avoids tourist catalog; instead, “translucent skin catching light” and “dark bodies moving like grief” evoke both species and emotional weather. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the group approach and kneel, so the environment actively shapes the stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is stopping inherited hatred; the meaningful tightening occurs when Mara abandons the grievance-recitation ritual and instead exposes the clipboard’s red constellation of pride, forcing delegates to recognize personal names in the failures. This narrows options—no retreat to old script—and escalates social cost: admitting they’ve become what they fought against. Agency is hers; coincidence plays no role. The price is legible on-page: relinquishing hero narrative and accepting “not heroes, just breathing,” which reweights the entire 300-year stalemate under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the price of redemption is the admission of mutual monstrosity, not forgiveness. Subtext operates in the clipboard’s color shift and the silent kneel rather than explicit moral. The final image—amber light between red and gold—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior failures. No tidy moral is stated; complexity remains intact, satisfying the 9+ quick test for thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric cadence and elevated diction (“operatively gentle,” “inherited hatred”) feel intentional, consistent with ceremonial register. Perceptual signature is POV-bound: Mara notices light through enemy skin, hears bone-chimes as emotional data. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Minor over-explanation in “grief transformed into something else—something operatively gentle” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but immediate embodied action (traces wood, kneels) rescues it. Dialogue is minimal, natural when present (“My grandmother’s mark”), serving subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: clipboard as both archive and mirror, light color as emotional barometer. No looped phrasing; sentence rhythm modulates from long ceremonial lines to abrupt “We gather as our ancestors did—Not in celebration.” One mixed metaphor: “corona bleeding into corona” is visually vague but thematically coherent. No artifact obscures closure; final line “painful and necessary and true” lands clean. Register stays elevated throughout, justified by ritual frame, so no drift penalty applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar “eternal enemies at magic peace table” is refreshed by the clipboard-as-archive and the Accumulative lens that makes failure itself the pressure engine. Specific detail—memory-glass, bone-chime timbre, last border tree—anchors freshness. The non-obvious turn is that redemption requires abandoning justice-as-vengeance rather than offering apology. Risk is moderate: lyrical, ceremonial voice could alienate some readers, but coherence holds. Transformation test passes: swap names and the ritual logic collapses without the species-specific biology and carved wood history.</comment>
