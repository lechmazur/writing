<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The keeper’s interior contradiction—needing to sever love in order to heal darkness—grounds every beat; the doorknocker ring’s return in the final paragraph shows embodied cost. Micro-choices (lifting the shadow, pressing it to her chest) tie directly to her hierarchy of values: solitude as pedagogy. The only slip is a touch of therapy-speak (“suffocation was simply breathing…”) that momentarily abstracts the wound instead of letting the image carry it.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring’s warmth and the graduate shadows gathered under starlight reconfigure the meaning of every burned bridge. Cost is visible—“some entries must be destroyed to find exit”—and constraints persist (tomorrow another shadow will arrive). One minor causality cloud: the moment the ring became warm is told rather than shown in a concrete beat, blunting the decisive snap that would make this 9-plus.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The charcoal pillars and absent roof are not backdrop; they are the crucible—starlight literally sculpts the shadows she teaches. The doorknocker ring operates as micro-setting, constraining her identity and closing the story when it grows warm. Sensory economy is excellent—char, ash, gasping darkness—but “wounded animal” twice edges toward cliché, preventing the last tick to 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the keeper transmit “emptiness” without relapse into self-annihilation—tightens when the fresh-scarred shadow refuses retreat. Escalation is textural: each healed shadow graduates to the far wall, narrowing her isolation and proving the method, while “tomorrow another shadow” raises the inexorable cost. Price is felt in the ring’s heat and the star’s indifferent witness, meeting the 8-plus gate.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—thresholds must be dismantled before passage—emerges through the doorknocker’s uselessness and the sanctuary’s ruined roof, never sermonized. Final image crystallizes the paradox: absence itself becomes doorway. Subtext in gesture (lifting, pressing) avoids abstract labels; the only fleck of echo comes from “some bridges must burn,” a near-proverb that slightly thins the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “burnt fingers against the starlight,” “shadows gasping in the space between existence and void.” Rhythm modulates—long sentence pools of memory, then clipped commands to the shadow—mirroring inhale/exhale instruction. Compression is taught early (“charcoal pillars rose like burnt fingers”) and paid off in the closing cadence. One filter-verb cluster (“she recognized… she understood…”) slightly dulls immediacy in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lines carry triple duty: image, emotion, world-rule (“starlight still leaked through the wound”). Varied sentence openings avoid drum-beat, but two successive “had” pluperfects in one early clause create micro-drag. No paraphrase loops; the single mixed metaphor—“thresholds must fade before new ones can form”—is acceptable in a conceptual piece. Closure line (“light the way forward”) avoids fireworks, letting density speak.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit—monastery as school for shadows that learn to breathe darkness—reverses every ghost-story cliché into therapy-as-cosmic-labor. Specificity of method (linking through scars, doorknocker as talisman of un-knocked doors) ties invention to character need. Risk is high yet coherence intact; the final re-pricing feels inevitable. Minor deduction for the familiar “burn bridges” phrasing, slightly diluting freshness.</comment>
