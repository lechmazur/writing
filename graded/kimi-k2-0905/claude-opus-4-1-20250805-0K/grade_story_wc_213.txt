<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “prefer listening over noise” is dramatized through her refusal to trust the electronic panel alone; the bell-rope choice embodies her trait with bodily cost (rope burn echo, shouted warning). Interiority is concrete—pressure felt in bones, grandmother’s proverb—without label-speak. One contradiction pulses: credibly curious scientist yet spiritually attuned, both impulses active as she reads impossible barometric data. The earned renunciation—staying alone in the sanctuary—caps her arc with visible stakes.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: impossible calm → microclimate readings dismissed by logic → granite vibration and animal flight → bell-rope act → villages evacuate → avalanche lands on empty slopes. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: modern system supplemented, not replaced, by ancestral act; “bell rope still warm” images the price she’ll carry. Lens stays causal throughout; no orientation debt; stakes tighten once via the zero-hour tradition that forbids unnecessary ringing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Windblown sanctuary above clouds is not backdrop but instrument: thin air stills sound, bell note travels farther, height equals isolation. Micro-setting objects—weather station, glue-dried acrylic seal, hemp rope—constrain timing and tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s vocation: pressure in bones before eyes see storm. Final image of ice crystals chiming reprises acoustic motif, charging the closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save villages—signaled by page 2; tightening occurs when anomaly readings clash with perfect visibility, forcing choice between data and intuition. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she pulls rope, then hits switch, layering warnings; cost is solitude during avalanche. No coincidence resolves; mountain’s shift complicates, her combined warnings save. One meaningful escalation sufficient; price legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—balance of ancient attentiveness and modern instrumentation—emerges through action, not thesis. Subtext resides in bell’s bronze voice versus electronic siren: which sound carries truth? Final image of rope “still warm” reweights prior material, implying ongoing responsibility. No moral spoken; ambiguity lingers about future trust in data alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual filter: barometric numbers, grandmother proverb, bone-deep hum. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She pulled with her entire weight”—then exhales into lyrical final paragraph. No head-hopping; diction stays within mountain-weather lexicon. Distinctive signature: storms speak in whispers before they scream.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length to mimic wind gusts and hush. Information density high—glue drying, cat vanishing, ravens fleeing each do double duty foreshadowing. Figurative language sparse but precise: cloud surface “smooth as fresh snow.” Final paragraph’s chiming ice crystals extend bell resonance without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: storm-siren tester as sacred vocation atop a cloud-sea cathedral. Synthesis of folklore “zero hour” with modern meteorology feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk taken—quiet avalanche birthed from tectonic hush rather than sky—pays off by subverting expectation while honoring setup. Specificity of “acrylic seal gleaming” prevents generic alpine disaster template.</comment>
