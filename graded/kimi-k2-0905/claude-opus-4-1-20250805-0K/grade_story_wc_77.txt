<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—repulsion yet nightly return—are embodied in tactile gestures (hand on warm mirror, gagging inhale). The clasp’s cold permanence and the backward-reading ritual dramatize a credible micro-choice chain that ends in earned renunciation: she carries Fear forward rather than fleeing. Interiority stays specific to her sensorium; no therapeutic self-labeling. Visible cost: the ruby eye closing, carnival finally silent. Missing 9-band only because Cornelius’s advisor function is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: stolen clasp → death imprint → nightly return → paradox utterance → Fear revealed → containment. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—mirrors go dark, carnival allowed to rest, Mara exits with new burden. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Mara pressed her palm…”). No teleporting props; dream-dictionary mechanics seeded early via Cornelius. One causal gap: why backward reading shatters Fear is implied, not shown, but paradox motif teaches the rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Funhouse mold, ozone stench, and bioluminescent walls are filtered through Mara’s disgust-fascination, guiding her steps toward the mirrors. The clasp’s ice-to-warmth shift and the child-Fear’s shapeshifting body function as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: entrance → mirror corridor → child-thing → exit. Selective sensory triage under crisis narrows to touch (warm mirror, cold clasp) and smell (sweet rot). Environment directly charges the final image: dark mirrors + closed ruby eye.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—free herself from nightly compulsion—signaled in paragraph 1. Pressure tightens through each failed prior night, then crystallizes when the backward paradox forecloses escape: she must confront child-Fear or remain cursed. Protagonist agency drives every beat: steal clasp, return nightly, read notes reversed, speak recognition. Cost legible: she gains control but must forever house Fear in the clasp; carnival silence is the price she pays.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—fear craves witness, not flight—emerges through image pattern (mirrors, photographs, reflections) rather than assertion. Subtextual turn: Fear weeping behind her corpse reframes monster as lonely child. Final re-pricing (“almost beautiful in its containment”) reweights earlier repulsion without moralizing. No thematic echo sentences; meaning arises from the clasp’s changed photographs. Ambiguity remains: who is guardian, who is prisoner?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres to Mara’s sensorium; perceptual signature skews toward tactile and olfactory extremes. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She’d died here once—technically died—” mimics resuscitation jolt. Cornelius’s voice (“silk through broken glass”) is distinct, goal-driven, disappears once purpose served. No filter-verb clusters; metaphors stay within POV lexicon. Final paragraph cadence slows, mirroring her measured exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: long fungal sentence vs. staccato “The clasp,” ensuring propulsion. Dense lines carry double duty—smell gag deepens attraction-repulsion theme. One mixed metaphor (“formaldehyde” with “flooding”) but does not touch closure. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line releases carnival silence with resonant punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fear as lonely child, photographically cursed mirrors, and backward dream-dictionary paradox synthesize into fresh emotional logic. Clasp-as-camera that records only terrors, then reframes to joys, reconfigures familiar “cursed object” trope. Risky second-person imperative (“Break it”) lands because Mara has earned the authority. Specificity of bioluminescent mold and ozone scent prevents generic haunt-location. Ending would collapse if swapped to any other object or setting.</comment>
