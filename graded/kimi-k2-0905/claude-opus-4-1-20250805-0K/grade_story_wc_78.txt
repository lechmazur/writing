<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kessa’s interiority is vivid—her bones ringing, the mallet pulsing “like a second heart”—and every strike is a micro-choice that compounds cost. The flaw is slight over-articulation (“She smiled, knowing…”) that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, trimming the highest band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the orchard freed, Kessa’s body humming with residual harmony, next prison already glowing in star-coordinates—cost visible in her aching muscles and the mallet’s unslaked hunger. Causal lattice holds: each strike → fractal wobble → whales → rupture, all legible under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard-as-instrument is the dominant setting, grain-lines and salt-kissed bark constraining where each blow must land; the driftwood platform’s “vast xylophone” status is tactile, lived-in, and directly powers the escape. Micro-setting (mallet, apple roots, her vibrating bones) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes—freedom vs. imploding spiral—tighten through ascending resonance frequencies that literally narrow the physical space; the whales’ bass note is the decisive escalation that forecloses retreat. Cost is continuous: bodily exhaustion, sonic overload, and the promise of eternal itinerancy encoded in the star-coordinates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “imprisonment re-scored as instrument”; the final star-coordinates reweight the premise, turning every future current into an unplayed score. No moralizing—just the crystallized recognition that obstacles equal latency—making the resonance earned rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: salt-kissed branches, cloud-script read as sheet music, mallet warmed by submarine memory. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short staccato sentences during strike-flurries, then longer lyrical cadences as harmonics become visible light lines. No head-hop, no register drift; lyric compression is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task (“The mallet grew warm…conducting vibrations up through her arm and into her bones”) without scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent (clouds as sheet music, driftwood as instrument); only micro-slip—“impossible circles” skirts oxymoron but recovers. No loops, no filter stacks, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard-as-instrument is a fresh synthesis of maritime-gothic and sonic-engineering; fractal-current mathematics and whale chorus feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk—the lyric escalation of sound into visible architecture—pays off in a luminous final image that reconfigures the whole premise. Not just novelty: emotional truth in the cost of perpetual transformation.</comment>
