<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—yearning for the old ritual while sensing its hollowness—drives every bell stroke; the carbide lens as inherited bias literally reframes what she sees, so her improvisation is motivated and costs her the safety of tradition. Embodied emotion is strong: “the title feels hollow” in her pocket, shoulders remembering choreography while mind “rewrites.” Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—she risks the guard’s censure and her own identity as “bell ringer” to choose rough, unauthorised music. Only drawback: the moment of highest cost (crowd’s uncertain humming) is slightly summarized, not fully dramatized, so the renunciation is clear but the price is more declared than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final shared silence re-weights the entire premise—pilgrimage is no longer travel but co-creation, and the cost is the permanent loss of her scripted role. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each improvised bell note thickens the air until pattern-break (off-script interval) crystallises new meaning; causality is interior but coherent. Orientation is nailed by word 60 (who, where, when). No teleports or amnesia. Slight softness: “someone begins to hum” is off-stage; if that first audience voice had been Vera’s shocked recognition, the beat would tighten further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Selective, urgent detail—golden motes, Victorian glass, the scratched lens catching splinters—roots us inside Vera’s selective attention. The lab itself acts: dust motes angle light that hits the lens that reframes her vision, so environment forces perceptual shift. Spatial choreography is clean; reader always knows where bells, chambers, doorway stand. Minor gap: we never feel acoustic texture (echo, dampening) that would sell “lost sounds”; visual dominates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace hollow ritual with living connection—is signalled early and sharpened by each off-key bell. One meaningful tightening: the first unauthorised interval makes air “shimmer,” marking the point of no return. Cost is legible: she forfeits her institutional script and faces strangers’ unfiltered judgment. Could push higher if a concrete external consequence (job warning, power flicker) had tangibly threatened, but internal cost suffices under Accumulative lens.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: lens-light-bell triad migrates from miner’s tunnel to cathedral of potential, re-pricing pilgrimage as communal improvisation. No overt thesis; final image lets strangers’ humming answer the opening question. Complexity preserved—ritual is neither vilified nor romanticised, just re-appropriated. Avoids tidy moral; resonance is sonic after-image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual register; “powerfully gentle” is narrator’s summary but repeated in her muscle memory, so acceptable compression. Diction—“crystalline notes,” “rough like her grandmother’s lens”—is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for lingering dust, staccato clauses during improvised strikes. No head-hop; maintenance worker/family remain opaque silhouettes, preserving focal discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Occasional softeners—“supposedly,” “slightly off-script”—could be trimmed for iron tension, but they don’t cluster in climax. No mixed metaphors; “cathedral of potential” extends tunnel-to-bell metaphor logically. One paraphrase ripple: “She strikes bells in combinations never tried before” restates prior beat; minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar “artist breaks ritual” arc by fusing extinct-sound archive with miner’s lamp, yielding a tactile, coal-dust-to-crystal metaphor chain. Conceptual integrity: follows implication that silence, not recording, is the artefact. Risky quiet ending chosen over triumphant crescendo, and it pays off. Not transformative at plot level, but specific synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
