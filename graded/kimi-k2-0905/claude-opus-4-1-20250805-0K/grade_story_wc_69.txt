<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Chen’s interior contradiction—clutching a heritage she half-understands while dismantling prejudice in others—is dramatized through the micro-choice to hand the zither over rather than hoard it. Embodied emotion arrives in the “eyes filled” beat that condenses forty years of loss and pride into one physiological flash. The renunciation costs her the last physical link to her grandfather, a price legible on the page, yet the gesture enacts the very pedagogy she preached, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: “expectantly resigned” is stated twice rather than lived through body or action, a label that keeps this just sub-9.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the layering of voices until the rosette’s silence is re-weighted as communal listening. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “tonight had proven something” explicitly revalues the vanishing arts as living practice, not institutional property, with undeniable social cost—the university still dissolves. Persistent constraint—tomorrow the program ends—shapes every tactic inside the library and is paid off in the final dispersal. Causality is intact: because she relinquishes the instrument, therefore the choir can carry the modes away, a because/therefore that holds under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The velvet library is more than postcard: its acoustic hush literally licenses the transition from speech to music, while the autumn air outside mirrors the seasonal dissolution of the program. Micro-setting inside the rosette itself—five cranes once frozen, now “implied to be moving”—functions as a tool that charges the final image when sound animates them. Spatial choreography is clean: instruments enter one by one, circle the zither, and depart, all tracked without drift. Environment constrains choice: the imminent lock-up deadline forces the gift of the zither, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can the art survive institutional erasure?—tightens when the security guard’s 9 p.m. warning forecloses rehearsal extension, converting library time into finite currency. Chen’s agency is renunciation: surrendering the heirloom alters tactics for everyone, turning preservation into itinerant practice. Cost is visible: she forfeits both her professional role and her last tangible patrimony in one evening. Pressure escalates once, but meaningfully, under Accumulative lens; the modes swell from three to five through collaborative density rather than external antagonism, keeping this short of the 8.8 band where a second, sharper price would be needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: “silence wasn’t the absence of sound. It was the presence of listening” is earned through the collective ear-training that finds lost modes. Subtext operates in the rosette’s glow—an image that reweights the cranes from antique decoration to living notation. The final hummed harmony offers a non-literal answer: the art vanishes only when listening stops, not when objects are stored. No moralizing paragraph intrudes; insight is inseparable from the choral payoff, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient remains stable, filtering perception through Chen’s musician ear: “braiding diverse voices,” “carpet of traveled stillness.” Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—modes, rosette, pentatonic—without academic inflation. Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing: long sentences for drone-like exposition, shorter fragments at the gift beat. Minor slip: “expectantly resigned” appears twice in identical phrasing, a template echo that nudges this below 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: one sentence often layers heritage loss, institutional collapse, and sensory detail—“velvet library absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain” does triple duty. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; verbs are muscular—“breathed beneath,” “unfolding,” “bore.” Mixed metaphors are absent; the autumn-to-music analogy is consistent. Final image is uncluttered, letting the hummed harmony resonate. Meets the 9+ quick test with zero artifacts touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Chinese zither, Japanese shamisen, djembe, accordion feels organic rather than checklist multiculturalism because each instrument arrives with a former student who embodies Chen’s pedagogy. The vanishing-arts frame is refreshed: instead of lament, the story converts loss into itinerant futurism. Specific detail—the five cranes once playable only by the dead—roots the concept in irreplaceable object history. The risk of sentimental choir assembly is averted by grounding every new voice in a former pupil who internalized Chen’s subtract-noise method, making the synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
