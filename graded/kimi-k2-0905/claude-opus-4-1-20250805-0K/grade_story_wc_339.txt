<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marina’s “quietly analytic” stance is credibly embodied—she photographs equations, times the air pocket, writes her own note—yet the interior voice drifts into diagnostic label-speak (“understood the physics of letting go”) that flattens contradiction. Because the captain is only a spectral proxy, the relational crucible is absent; pressure therefore stays intellectual rather than emotional, so the renunciation feels more conceptually tidy than personally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Conceptual Repricing: the library’s imminent flood is accepted as “transformation,” cost felt in the shrinking air pocket and the journal she seals inside her sample box. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (snow-globe recursion, entropy equations, transmission) layers density until the final cadence reweights loss as frequency shift. One scaffold artifact (“each loop she freed felt like solving an equation…”) keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The breached hull, green brass handles, and miniature snow-globe cathedral are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered; the library-as-micro-setting literally constrains her choice—she must decide what to preserve before the air pocket collapses. Sensory hierarchy narrows to visual+pressure+sound of her own breath, matching crisis urgency. Final image of the turning globe inside her sample box recharges earlier recursion with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the transmission / accept dissolution—tightens once: the shrinking air pocket forces her to seal the journal and globe inside the sample box, trading physical preservation for narrative transmission. Escalation is textural: each object (equations, globe, blank pages) accumulates meaning until the cadence shift (“the library would flood within hours”) makes the cost legible. No visible price beyond this single forfeiture, so stays short of 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: entropy as frequency shift, not silence. Snow-globe recursion and the captain’s final equation reprice loss as conversion rather than erasure, letting the ending image (globe turning in sunset light) answer the thematic question non-literally. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; only the notebook quote flirts with thematic echo, but its cost is dramatized by the sealing action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Marina’s perceptual filter—modified sonar gear, “electromagnetic whispers,” brass verdigris—syntax lengthens under pressure then compresses into staccato ascent clauses. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; the captain’s journal fragments are differentiated by antique diction and frantic ellipsis. Occasional elevated register (“cathedral of trapped atmosphere”) is earned by lyric mode taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent—long clauses inside the library, shorter strokes as she rises. Only one paraphrase loop (“each loop she freed felt like solving an equation…”) and one mixed-metaphor guardrail (“the ocean accepting her return with quiet recognition”) threaten clarity; neither touches the closure beat. High information density: single sentences layer sensory, technical, and metaphoric work without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Deep-sea librarian ghost-transmission is fresh, but the recursive snow globe and entropy-as-frequency metaphor feel inevitable in hindsight, growing from the captain’s on-page equations. Risky lyric structure (single POV, two-shard cadence) heightens melancholy without obscuring closure. Earhart parallel could be derivative but is transformed into a meditation on demystification vs. preservation, giving the concept conceptual bite.</comment>
