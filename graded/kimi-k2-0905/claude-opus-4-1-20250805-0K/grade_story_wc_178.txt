<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s frugality is dramatized through daily survival choices that feed the obsession; her trembling fingers on the tile embody the cost. The interior contradiction—devotion to pure science vs. hunger—is kept alive in scene. Yet her slide from scholar to cosmic gatekeeper is sketched more than dramatized; the final covenant feels slightly abstract because the prior beat shows only recognition, not a visible renunciation or risk. Still, the earned stasis of lifelong sacrifice lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because she deciphered ratios → found tile → aligned Mars → tile warms → second tile → knowledge uncloaks → beacon activates. Each step tightens options toward the final sealing. Closure is a crisp conceptual repricing: the palace becomes transmitter, her frugality retroactively labeled as down-payment on interstellar contact. One scaffold loop (“empirically ironic” twice) and minor orientation lag (ceiling gaps unnamed for ~140 words) keep it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Starlight-through-cracks, warmed stone, and humming mortar evolve with the beats; the palace itself is the tool that constrains every move. Spatial choreography is clean: descent → chamber → eastern wall → cavity → floor charts. Phosphorescent mortar in the closure image recharges the opening ceiling gaps, satisfying micro-setting recurrence. Sensory hierarchy tightens to touch and vibration under increasing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—complete the beacon before regime collapse or personal starvation—tightens once: the tile’s warmth signals the final alignment window. Cost is visible on page: decades of barley diet, satchel wear, the knowledge that one missed planetary angle would abort everything. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence resolves. A sharper intermediate obstacle (tools failing, body faltering) could have raised the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: devotion measured in coins, ratios carved in limestone, starvation as down-payment for cosmic dialogue. The coda reframes frugality as encryption key without moralizing. Irony (empirical proof of faith) is shown via stone warming under planetary gaze, not stated. The final image—amber light sealing covenant—carries conceptual repricing that reweights her sacrifice as currency rather than piety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tightly aligned to Mara’s perceptual filter: mathematical bias, tactile starlight, hunger-narrowed attention. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under tactile discovery. No POV leakage; palace “hums” remain exterior phenomena she interprets. Distinctive diction—“orthogonal to time,” “covenant waiting to be sealed”—reads as her scholarly idiom without drifting into jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer ceiling cracks, stellar ratios, and historic plunder. Rhythm breathes with discovery—long cadence for descent, staccato for tile release. One paraphrase loop (“empirically ironic” repeated) costs −0.2. Metaphors stay physically coherent: stone warmth → Mars alignment → bone-resonant hum. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: palace-as-radio, frugality-as-algorithm, erosion-as-cipher. Time-encryption via missing tiles is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of cosmic contact from austere math feels earned, not gimmicky. Babylonian star-cipher reframes real astronomical history rather than borrowing stock tropes.</comment>
