<comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; his “gift for reading between lines” is dramatized through tactile glass work and the stone-thrown interference experiment. Contradictory impulses—nostalgic preservation vs. transformative revelation—coexist in the same beats, peaking when he caresses the atrium he must soon lose. The final smile is earned: his communion via ripples forecloses despair and crystallizes a legacy stance. Micro-choices (kneeling, pocketed stone, photographing patterns) keep emotion embodied without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each glass surface, droplet, and ripple adds density until the final spectrum burst reweights the stake—“surfaces aren’t barriers but birthplaces.” The noctilucent trigger and development letter are early anchors; orientation is secure by line 4. Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus stands in gilded water, cost felt in the imminent demolition, options reframed. Persistent constraint—prism atrium destined for bulldozers—shapes every beat without soft reset.</comment>

<comment>Harbor-at-dawn specifics (oil-dark water, salt mist, angled greenhouse panes) are filtered through glazier’s professional eye, constraining his stone’s trajectory and the light spectra he records. Micro-setting (pocket river stone, mirrored pool) functions as navigable terrain that alters tactics—stone → rings → camera. Spatial choreography holds: entrance, pool, ceiling angles remain trackable. Final image of mist burning away while interference patterns persist anchors the closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve perceptual legacy vs. corporate erasure—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the letter is recalled. One meaningful deepening: concentric interference nodes become the method to “document” and teach, foreclosing passive mourning. Cost is legible in the decision to photograph rather than chain himself to the glass. Escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required, only the reconfiguration of loss into transmission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: transparency as generative boundary, not defense. Ripples reprise glass fractures, both revealing hidden languages without authorial thesis statement. Final image reframes prior thirty years of window fitting as cumulative pedagogy. Resists moralizing; the insight stays particular to Marcus’s craft and imminent loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited glazier voice shows perceptual signature—light angles, stress patterns, refraction indices—without technical exhibitionism. Rhythm swells from pre-dawn hush to spectrum cascade, mirroring rising illumination. No dialogue; prose carries subtext through spatial choreography and metonymic glass vocabulary. Filter verbs (“seemed, appeared”) avoided; knowledge stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; high-density lines (“each wave became a moving prism, splitting colors further”) propel without purple overload. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; “darkness clung to the water like oil” is single, apt image. Scaffolding absent; opening anchors voice and stakes in one line. Closing sentence resolves via image that recharges “clear view” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: glazier science + fluid dynamics as spiritual reckoning. Ripples-as-text trope is revitalized through precise glass-craft vocabulary and impending demolition stakes. Risky lyric accumulative structure is taught early via noctilucent clouds and pays off in spectral finale. Not transformable to generic artist story; specificity of harbor, prism greenhouse, and interference mathematics is integral.</comment>
