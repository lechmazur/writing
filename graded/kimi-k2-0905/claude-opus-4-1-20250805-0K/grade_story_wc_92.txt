<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thorne’s watchful patience and quiet defiance feel lived-in; his fingers on the quill holder and silent alignment of angles dramatize a man who has waited seventeen years for this hour. Amara’s arrival adds relational pressure, yet her interiority is ventriloquised (“understanding softened her stern face”) rather than embodied. The final shared gaze crystallises complicity, but the cost to each remains implied, not tasted; we see alliance, not what they personally forfeit at dawn.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: blackout → extinguished lamps → coded sundial signal → city-wide micro-rebellion. Orientation is swift—fort, twilight, gatekeeper—and the sundial’s half-painted geometry is taught early enough to charge the climax. Closure is a Charged Poise: the bronze gleam at 3 a.m. is both promise and irrevocable ignition; the lens stays causal throughout. Minor over-reliance on reflective exposition rather than beat-level action keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Sandstone walls “like captured fire” and the gnomon casting no shadow in lamp-less dark give tactile, shifting lightscape that mirrors conspiracy. The fort’s angles, corridors, and tower assignments are tracked cleanly; bodies move through believable space. The bronze quill holder operates as micro-setting—its weight and engravings constrain Thorne’s stealth moves—qualifying for 9+ gate, but one overworked simile (“blood through a waking body”) blunts the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—ignite a bloodless uprising—tightens when each coded angle forecloses the option of delay; the blackout is the visible price already paid. Agency is collective rather than individual: Thorne and Amara wager careers, lives, moral clarity, but the scene keeps the personal cost off-page, capping intensity. Escalation is steady but once-only; no second reversal raises the ante. Still, the “cradle of sparks” concept reweights every subsequent gesture under causal lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of incremental sabotage: revolutions can be seeded by clerks’ silences and misfiled parchment rather than blades. No character sermonises; the idea is performed through the sundial’s quiet geometry. The closing image—bronze glint that will travel like sparks—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about how empires fall. Only a faint late nod toward narrative omniscience (“they would tend its quiet fire”) nudges the reader rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays disciplined to Thorne’s sensory filter: weathered fingers, familiarity with every stone, selective attention to shadow-less gnomon. Syntax tightens under stealth—short, verb-forward clauses—then widens for the conceptual payoff. Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext (“The blackout was your doing” spoken as recognition, not accusation). One template cadence run (“Thorne…, Amara…”) mid-scene is the lone rhythm artifact; it does not touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is information-dense: each sentence both paints setting and advances conspiracy mechanics. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “light through prisms” stays consistent with sundial imagery. Paragraph cuts are purposeful—every one removed would delete tactical or spatial knowledge. A single paraphrase loop (“quiet certainty… quiet fire”) is repetitive enough to notice but occurs early, not in closure zone, so only minor deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “castle revolt” scaffold is inverted: the weapon is a writing desk accessory, the battle plan is geometry, the heroes are middle-aged bureaucrats. The half-painted sundial as encrypted bulletin board feels both fresh and inevitable once explained. Risk is taken in choosing a static, talk-free climax—yet the concept of “sparks” justifies the quiet ignition. Specificity of fort acoustics and lamp-oil logistics keeps it from reading like abstract allegory.</comment>
