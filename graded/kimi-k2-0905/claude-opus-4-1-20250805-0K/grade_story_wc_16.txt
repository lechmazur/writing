<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the ink glow—but her “carefully reckless” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The moment she laughs at the impossible glow is the first embodied contradiction, late but effective. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; mentor is off-stage exposition. The arc is credible endurance, yet the cost (sleep, career risk) is summary, not felt on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal track holds: discovery of mistranslation → all-night decipher → dawn translation → summit stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the manuscript and glowing ink reconfigure tomorrow’s options with conceptual cost (possible war). Orientation anchored by word 60; no spatial drift. Pearl-light payoff at end rewards early prism image, satisfying set-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archive is tactile—dust, lamplight, spiral stairs—yet never blocks motion. Glass ink well functions as micro-setting: glow-response turns it into lie-detector, constraining her belief in the truth she’s writing. Prague reference is atmospheric Proper-Noun economy, not excess. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent war via translation—signaled early and tightens when mistranslation knot is revealed. One intensification: ink glow confirms accuracy, raising stakes from academic to existential. Cost visible: seven nights’ exhaustion, risk of mis-translation worsening conflict. No reversal, but agency is continuous decipherment; coincidence complicates only, never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of lost harmonic language emerges from plot, not sermon: “symphonies of truth” motif evolves from metaphor to literal score. Final image of “tuning fork” reweights earlier prism-light without moralizing. No echo-statement in closing paragraph; theme stays implicit. Minor abstraction in “hearts that had forgotten they once beat in harmony,” but saved by concrete musical imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elena’s perceptual filter: ink “caught light like a prism,” “script danced.” No head-hop. Diction slightly elevated but consistent with scholar POV. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for scholarly awe, shorter bursts at dawn. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. “Carefully reckless” is the only faint committee phrase, but repeated sparingly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet lucid: “extinct language archive beneath Prague’s oldest library” packs place, history, authority in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Mixed metaphors avoided—prism, frost, symphony stay optical/cold/musical lanes. Register stays literary but justified by archivist mindset. Final “clink” is tactile cadence that punctuates without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise—dead language whose words literally bind reality—is fresh, not standard fantasy trope here. Integration with diplomatic cold-war gives conceptual stakes beyond magic MacGuffin. Risk of “symphonies” sounding whimsical is offset by grounded archival labor. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic fantasy city, so specificity counts. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
