<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s calm, ritualized patience is consistent and specific, but the possessed woman remains a near-blank vessel; we glimpse no contradictory impulse in either of them, so the “interior contradiction” test is only half-met. His final insight is earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early and held: each loop layer literally builds the mandala that will dissolve the demon. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“she remembered how to inhabit her own assumptions”—and the dimensional anchor reappears in the final image, satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cathedral acoustics, loop pedal, and palette function as micro-setting; the nave’s exact center literally constrains where Marcus can stand and where the woman floats. The stones’ resonance is returned in the final “ghost of loops,” charging the last image and meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes—“possession will complete in seventeen minutes”—create a ticking clock, but the countdown is background ambience rather than a live constraint that forces tactical changes. Escalation is textural: each new loop layer deepens the stakes by revealing assumption as habit; the cost is legible but soft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the demon is literally “the unexamined life,” and its defeat is the moment the woman voices it. The final image of indigo as “questions finally asked” reweights the palette without moralizing, meeting the 9+ test for resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s synesthetic perception; diction—“teaching stone to remember it was once sand”—is character-bound and rhythmically controlled. No head-hop, no filter-stack, and the lyric pattern is taught by line 3 and paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors are dense but internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. A single paraphrase loop—“stillness except motion holding its breath”—is pardonable because it is immediately re-cast. Final sentence achieves Charged Poise without clutter, sustaining high-band clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The exorcism-as-sound-architecture premise feels fresh; the loop-pedal priest and indigo palette are specific inventions rather than trope swaps. Risky lyric compression is held together by taught pattern, and the quiet reversal—“illuminate, not cast out”—re-weights the genre itself.</comment>
