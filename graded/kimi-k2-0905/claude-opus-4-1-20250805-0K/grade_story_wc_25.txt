<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s gait-reading skill and layered-map method are concrete, but his internal contradiction—quiet pride versus need for recognition—stays summary. The coin’s hand-off to Chen is a visible micro-choice that costs him his talisman, yet the emotional price feels scaled to parable more than person. Interiority relies on port-maintenance argot; we get competent craftsman but not intimate contradiction under live pressure. Still, the earned renunciation lands cleanly, satisfying the 9+ test for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: storm → GPS dead → only Marcus can navigate → challenge accepted → coin surrendered. Orientation arrives by line 5; the labyrinth’s daily re-shuffle is shown through stacked translucent maps, an elegant image that teaches the pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Chen’s whispered concession reweights the port’s hierarchy and Marcus relinquishes his inherited luck. Cost is palpable—his grandfather’s coin now belongs to the authority he undermined.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Container walls become an acoustic amphitheater, a micro-setting that literally channels whispers into authority’s ear; this constraint shapes tactics and charges the final image. Geomagnetic storm paints aurora on corrugated steel, turning industrial bleak into sensory overload without dropping momentum. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track three-container sightline, heel-echo intervals, brass-key taps that reveal hollow versus loaded boxes. Environment is not backdrop; it is the board on which the power game plays.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers outperform commands—signals early and tightens when only Marcus can locate XB-471 before hospital deadline. Agency is cerebral rather than brute: overlaying maps, tapping walls, modulating stride; each choice narrows options and raises social cost if he fails. The meaningful turn comes when Chen adopts his whispered cadence, compressing hierarchy into shared breath. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: Marcus trades ancestral talisman for institutional voice, forfeiting outsider status.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from acoustic metaphor: knowledge routed through quiet persistence beats loud authority. Subtext operates in graffitied container marks—dozens of whispered warnings validated by night crews—an image that reweights “maintenance” as collective resistance. Final image of coin transfer avoids moral tag; it reframes power as circulation, not conquest. Refrain from overt thesis keeps ambiguity alive: port may still shout tomorrow, but tonight the labyrinth belongs to murmurs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter—compass spins, aurora flicker, heel-echo signatures—without head-hop. Sentence rhythm lengthens during navigation beats, then fractures into shorter pulses at container intersections, mirroring mental map overlays. Dialogue is sparse and indirect; when Chen whispers “How did you—” the broken syntax feels stress-true. Port jargon (“corrugated fire,” “acoustic amphitheater”) remains inside Marcus’s vocational lexicon, sustaining credible distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence moves plot, reveals container physics, or delivers sensory hit. Metaphors stay physical—“aurora painted green fire across corrugated walls”—no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold stems (“He pulled… He pointed…”) appear but never cluster in high-pressure beats; rhythm breathes where needed. No loops or synonym churn; opening and closing lines bookend with aurora light and rolling gait, giving sonic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusing geomagnetic storm, maintenance lore, and bureaucratic insurgency through acoustics feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The zodiac coin evolves from talisman to institutional baton, transforming familiar “mystical compass” into social circuitry. Risk is taken by making navigation hinge on rhythmic tapping rather than lock-picking heroics, yet payoff is fresh. Close echoes of prior container-port stories exist, but the sonic whisper-network angle reconfigures the premise enough to escape derivative guardrail.</comment>
