<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia is not label-speak here; it is lived through tactile mapping and negative-space portraiture. Sarah’s methodical charcoal case and finger-counting of steps externalize her flaw and gift simultaneously. The final renunciation—leaving the quarry with seventeen portraits instead of pursuing the killer—costs her professional closure and is earned by every prior stroke. Contradictory impulses (justice vs. empathy) stay in scene, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each portrait adds density until the circle forms a composite killer. Closure is a Charged Poise: Sarah’s phone call and the ribbon pressed between pages reweight the premise—she trades capture for understanding, foreclosing the manhunt path. The 120-word anchor is satisfied at “The quarry’s limestone walls…” and orientation never wavers. One transition (descending → packing up) is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The quarry’s mist-concealed walls and dripping condensation narrow Sarah’s senses to touch and negative space, mirroring her face-blindness. The scarlet ribbon’s silk weave against limestone provides micro-setting that charges the final image when she presses it into the sketchbook, sealing the new weight of evidence-as-art. Spatial choreography is flawless: steps, easel, circle of portraits, ascent. Weather stays causal, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Sarah see the killer’s whole through fragmented victims—tightens with each portrait that eliminates one possible suspect-template. The eleventh portrait marks the decisive deepening: pattern shifts from “who wore masks” to “who collects contradictions.” Cost is conceptual but felt: she abandons standard police closure for empathic comprehension. No reversal, but accretion reweights options believably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation of fractured selves seeking dangerous unity; no character lectures us on duality. The final image—seventeen portraits forming one absent face—offers a resonant, non-moral answer: empathy is the act of holding contradictions without merging them. Subtext lives in the ribbon’s reprise: silk once masking now archived as evidence of choice. Complexity is embraced; killer and victims remain morally asymmetrical yet humanly mirrored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: every visual detail is translated into texture, angle, or charcoal hardness. Syntax mirrors process—layered, participle-rich, then clipped at climax (“She understood now”). No filter verbs; “her fingers finding the detective's number by touch alone” keeps knowledge body-bound. Voice never drifts into clinical or therapeutic register; even “prosopagnosia” is immediately rendered as lived limitation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with drawing strokes: longer sensory sentences for calm, staccato fragments when ribbon is found. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors are controlled—“justice over vengeance until they merged into something unrecognizable” stays within artistic lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Face-blind detective who draws truth from negative space is a fresh synthesis; transformation test fails if Sarah is swapped with standard profiler. Risky choice to make evidence vanish off-page yet still drive closure pays off through portrait-circle alchemy. Quarry-as-studio and ribbon-as-archive transform familiar noir tropes into lyric forensic ritual. Specificity of charcoal gradients and silk weave keeps concept grounded, not gimmicky.</comment>
