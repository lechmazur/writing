<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—reading star-maps in condensation, pressing palm to glass to feel ancient song—contradictory impulses (scientist vs mystic) coexist in-scene. The final “inhabit” stance is earned: three years of waiting crystallizes into a renunciation of explanatory mastery, cost felt as the feather dissolves and city goes dark. Relationship with Chen is crucible-light: his exhaustion vs her quiet certitude shift status once he stops watching instruments. Minor slip: “softly ingenious” is label-adjacent, though later embodied in her refusal to hammer mysteries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of star/coral reflections tighten until the final darkening reweights belonging vs knowledge. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: Mira’s palm on glass crystallizes her new stance; cost is the irreversible dimming of both city and explanatory ambition. Causality intact: feather appears → confirmation → descent → glow → extinction, each step because/therefore. Orientation clean by 120 words: who/where/when (Mira, Atlantic facility, night after dusk) anchored through burnt feather cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: glass tank, condensation tracings, palm on dome—each tactile object becomes conduit for ancient signal. Underwater city is not backdrop but active agent: glowing veins guide fish constellations that mirror sky, constraining Mira’s attention and final stance. Bioluminescent algae, bacterial light in stone, embedded alien minerals—details specific, never touristic. Final image of city going dark recharges every prior glimmer, making environment the decisive lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: belonging vs mastery—early signaled when Mira chooses “wait, watch” over spectrometers. Escalation via luminous respite: each intensification of glow narrows her options until only witnessing remains. Cost legible: city’s darkening is permanent forfeiture of full understanding. Agency is attentional—her shared exhale is the micro-choice that seals renunciation; no coincidence, all city-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: knowledge-seeking yields to participatory witness. Subtext in silence—Chen’s dropped instruments, Mira’s palm-press—speaks louder than any thesis. Final image reframes earlier star-maps as love-letters rather than data. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers: is darkness loss or invitation? Wisdom earned through three years of failed mapping, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice carries astronomer-poet idiom: “starlight filtered through fathoms,” “shy creatures emerging from tide pools.” Psychic distance tightens from reflective overview to sensorimorphic “vibration of ancient songs through water and time.” No head-hopping; Chen’s interior accessed only via observable cues. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences calm under glow, then shorten at extinction beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear clean: varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths breathe with light pulses. High density—“glass bubble pressed against ruins,” “constellation’s reflection triggered luminous responses” packs setting-science-emotion. Zero scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor over-adjectival drift (“gentle green radiance”) but does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of landscape astrology with underwater archaeology feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Burnt feather as time-bridge transforms familiar “message from past” trope into sensory relic. Risky long-view compression paid off: 600-year convergence, centuries of city-sleep condensed into one beat without info-dump. Specificity—Thymal’s bacterial veins, impossible-depth minerals—anchors freshness.</comment>
