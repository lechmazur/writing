<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is richly embodied—bone-level vibration of quartz, breath visible in chill—and his seven-year exile motivates every step. The moment he begins to dance, contradictory impulses (awe vs. vengeance vs. longing) coil in the same muscle, earning the climactic “tremor of certainty.” Micro-choices—palm on pillar, robe catching light—reveal hierarchy of values without exposition. Cost is legible: the lake cracks under his feet, exile’s boundary dissolved; no path back remains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (hum-frequency, cobalt light, lake-mirror) intensifies until pattern break at the dance. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of poets striding across cracking ice; conceptual cost is undeniable as scripture-carved truths sink. Orientation anchored by line 7; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: once-lifted ban can be re-imposed, sharpening the final image of collective trespass.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Colonnade hum, cobalt light, and frozen lake are never backdrop: the quartz frequency literally changes pitch under Silas’s touch, guiding his choreography; the lake’s scripture fractures along lines his dance reveals. Spatial choreography clean—feet track from atrium to lake without jump-cuts. Micro-setting triumvirate (body-robe-column) constrains every spiral; the final image of sky-doors reflected in dark water recalibrates the whole space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove cloud-shadow poetry’s right to exist—tightens when lake ice cracks under first pirouette, foreclosing retreat. Agency is aesthetic: each dissolve of boundary is enacted by Silas’s body, not declared. One meaningful escalation: colonnade hum crescendos → sudden silence → collective footfalls of other poets, multiplying consequence. Cost visible: sacred ice forfeited, scriptures drowned; no reset offered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: boundaries contain their own dissolution, first whispered to quartz, then danced, finally lived. Subtext operates in silence—hum cessation marks ideological shift more than any manifesto. Final image of sky-doors in water offers non-literal answer: permeability is the new scripture. Avoids sermon; no character states thesis aloud.</comment>

<comment>Perceptual signature is synesthetic—sound felt in bone, light read as text. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences during flow, clipped fragments at crescendo (“The humming stopped.”). Diction—“cloud-shadow poets,” “crystalline certainties”—remains inside Silas’s lexicon, never academic. No head-hopping; single POV holds through collective entrance framed as external observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high yet each metaphor does double duty: “robes catching blue-filtered light” also signals permission. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical (ice, quartz, breath). Zero loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm—participial openers timed to breath-cycle. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif: humming → “thousand voices.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dance-criticism and mystic architecture feels inevitable in hindsight; no extant template matches. Risk—making poetry a literal world-rewriting act—pays off by forcing every object to earn narrative weight. Specificity of “scripture-carved ice” prevents abstraction. Synthesis of exile-art-politics grows from particulars, not prompt check-listing.</comment>
