<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“cheerfully gloomy smile,” “bright melancholy”—but the recollectionist never makes a choice that costs her anything; she only observes and exits. The one micro-decision, pocketing the glass, changes nothing on-page. Emotional arc is atmospheric, not causal. Still, her perceptual signature stays sharp and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment adds density until the sprout image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the humming pouch and lullaby-dirge reconfigure meaning with felt cost (“work would never be finished”). No orientation debt; cave anchors arrive by line 8. Causality is thematic, not plot-driven, so the slight softening is lens-consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Geode-cave is tactile and optically alive—bare feet on crystal, rainbow ricochet, mineral breathing—yet never stalls motion. Micro-setting (crater glass) constrains her reading stance and reappears in the final sonic hum, charging the last image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices scent-tinted memories, not tourist gloss. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why do paths disappear?”—is declared early but never tightens; no option is foreclosed or price paid on-page. Pressure is atmospheric (cave dims, day wanes) rather than tactical. Escalation is a density accrual of fragments, not a narrowing of choices. Closure reweights meaning, not stakes, so the mild stasis fits the accumulative lens but caps the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: abandoned futures recycle into new growth—seeds in crystal cracks reprise the glass shards. No explicit thesis; the lullaby-dirge final image offers oblique wisdom. Ambiguity is purposeful—paths may never have been paths—but the sprout still asserts quiet hope. Emotional aftereffect lingers as bittersweet acceptance rather than moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><<grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea-foam recollectionist’s voice is unmistakable: synesthetic metaphors (“joy that tasted purple”), rhythmic anaphora, bell-velvet laughter. Syntax breathes with scene—long spirals for wonder, clipped fragments for tactile steps. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression and elision (“she supposed… that was rather the point”) are pattern-taught early and paid off in the final dirge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Metaphors are internally coherent—glass, foam, seeds form one fluid matrix. Occasional stacked modifiers (“green and impossibly alive”) flirt with purple but stay within POV diction. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles; final third is clean, so 9+ gate stays open.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Premise—emotion archaeologist in breathing crystal cave—is fresh, yet “paths vanish, recycle as seeds” drifts toward familiar life-lesson territory. Specific sensory fossils (burnt-sugar love, middle-C sorrow) transform the trope. Risk is stylistic not structural; lyric density heightens rather than obscures. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, but not radically surprising.</comment>
