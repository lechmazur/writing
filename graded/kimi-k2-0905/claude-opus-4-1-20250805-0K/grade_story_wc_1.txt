<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers from recognition, not cold—and her micro-choices (folding the strip to her heart, walking deeper) embody earned renunciation with visible cost. The “steadily adaptive” trait is shown via frost-to-glass epiphany rather than label. No contradictory impulses in scene, but the causality of her decision to abandon identity is more asserted than dramatized in a single beat, keeping her just shy of 8.8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frost’s “brief, harmless luminescence” reweights her father’s radioactive legacy with undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: ledger → recognition → renunciation. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 30. The only slack is that the “new life” leap is compressed into one sentence; still, the image carries the cost, meeting the 9+ quick test’s spirit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canyon walls, frost crystals, burnt paper edges, and starlight are filtered through glass-maker’s eye—each tactile detail later constrains her choice to forsake radioactive glow for transient frost-light. The micro-setting (charred ledger against stone) doubles as tool and mirror. Spatial choreography is clean; frost patterns track logically from night to dawn. One demerit: “luminous glass” is referenced but not physically handled in the scene, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or end the poisoned legacy—tightens when frost teaches “no radiation needed,” foreclosing the glowing-glass option with felt cost. Agency is internal renunciation rather than external fight, sufficient under Accumulative lens. No visible resource loss on-page beyond symbolic identity death, so the price is conceptual, not visceral, holding it under 8.2.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty born from poison versus beauty born from patience. Frost as “brief, harmless luminescence” reframes her father’s radioactive glow without moralizing. The final image offers resonant answer—art can glow without legacy of harm. No tidy maxim, but the conceptual reprice is slightly single-note compared to multi-layered nuance required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains glass-artist perceptual signature—microscopic lattice visions, frost as kiln-fired networks—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm breathes between long sentence and fragment: “The frost patterns shifted. Dawn touched the rim.” No dialogue, so voice purity is un-contaminated. One elevated phrase—“vast darkness punctured by stars”—nudges beyond POV lexicon, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught: frost ≈ glass lattice. No mixed metaphors or loops. “Drifting resonance” is repeated intentionally, paid off in final line. Information density high; each sentence advances recognition or stakes. Only micro-slip: “luminous material that would eventually poison him” is slightly expositional, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: uranium-glass legacy intersects with frost-crystal instruction to create a quiet renunciation of toxic art. Risk-taking lies in eschewing revenge plot for contemplative closure; the conceptual reprice feels inevitable. No familiar templates are echoed. The specific craft knowledge (glass annealing, radiation history) is grounded rather than Googled. Slight deduction only because the “artist fakes death” trope is familiar, even if reweighted here.</comment>
