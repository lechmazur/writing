<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “methodically curious” trait is lived-in: she syncs videos frame-by-frame, tests parchment under UV, presses her own oils onto the torn edge—each micro-choice costing time and bodily presence. The interior contradiction—guarded cartographer who learns to value wordless empathy—peaks when she films herself softening, a renunciation of pure observation that is earned by every prior tactile act. No stock phrases; her noticing is cartographer-specific (“spaces where certainty dissolved into speculation”). Cost is visible: she ends committed to an un-mappable pilgrimage, foreclosing the safety of frames and monitors.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the final palm-press reweights the entire premise—maps must tear for meaning to leak through. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, oil, flaking paint, and human residue layer until the vault itself becomes the message. Torn map + coordinates delivered by skin-secretions act as persistent constraints shaping every tactic. Orientation anchored by word 60; no Lens ambiguity. Cost legible in last line: “proof that empathy needs no language,” a social/ontological price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is not backdrop but tool: water enlarges stains into continents, UV makes skin-oil coordinates glow, peeling saints witness silent confessions. Micro-settings—torn parchment, skylight drip, monitor reflection—constrain every choice; she works around failing electricity, mildew, and the physical tear itself. Spatial choreography clean: Brother Thomas’s 1961 gestures map exactly onto modern teens’, verified by synced footage. Final image recharges setting: her palm on the tear literalizes the “bridge across silence” the vault has always enacted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can empathy exist without language?—tightens once: from decoding maps to adding her own silent testimony. Escalation is textural intensification: each layer of rain, skin-oil, and footage thickens until renunciation (mapping → participating) is the only remaining option. Visible price: she forfeits the distancing safety of frames, drives toward an un-mappable henge at night. Agency is accumulative—no single reversal, but each tactile act narrows the path toward embodied silence.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: torn parchment = knowledge via rupture; skin-oil coordinates = history written in body; final palm-print = empathy as residue. No abstract slogans; “shielded openness” is dramatized by her refusal to announce the chapel’s reopening, simply enacts it. Subtext carried in gesture: Brother Thomas’s air-tracing reappears in homeless teens, proving ritual continuity without exposition. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: silence is not absence but a medium that accumulates human presence like salt in rain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s perceptual filter—cartographic hesitation, UV lamp logic, rain as metronome. Prose texture mimics her precision: long sentence scanning parchment → staccato frame-stepping → lyric final cadence. No head-hop; 1961 monks and modern teens seen only via footage she studies. Diction stays within her professional lexicon (“mappa mundi,” “skin secretions”) yet flexes to spiritual awe at closure. Filter verbs (“she understood”) appear only at earned epiphany beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; information density high—one sentence often does three jobs: “She synchronized the videos, her methodically curious nature demanding precision” (character, action, motive). Metaphors are cartographer-specific, never mixed: “water stains spreading like continents” is physically coherent. Rhythm accelerates with sentence shortening during footage sync, then breathes into longer lyrical cadence at palm-press. No register drift; “conceptual repricing” vocabulary belongs to narrator, not POV, but occurs after closure and is therefore waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.9</question><comment>Premise—monks map a stone henge by tearing parchment, then preserve path via skin-oil thumbprints—is non-obvious synthesis of cartography and mysticism. Fresh angle: sacred space that resists mapping because it travels through touch and silence, not survey. Risk of mosaic footage comparison paid off by exact gesture echo and tactile closure. Specificity anchors universals: moorland coordinates remain invisible, yet reader feels the henge’s pull through accumulated human residue. Transformation test fails—story collapses without map-tear concept and vault setting.</comment>
