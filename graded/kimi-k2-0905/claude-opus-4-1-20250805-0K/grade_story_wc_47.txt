<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kira’s quiet reclamation of the server room is embodied through tactile gardening gestures; the offer of moss to Marcus crystallizes her shift from wounded exile to mentor. Interiority stays concrete—sunlight on pendant, drip cadence—avoiding label-speak. The cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity by inviting a witness inside her sanctuary. Yet Marcus arrives more as symbolic penitent than active pressure source, so relationship crucible heating stays mild.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each moss colony thickens the metaphorical palimpsest until the final gifting beat reweights silence into shared stewardship. Orientation anchors by line 5; no debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kira’s extended cutting accepted—felt cost is the breach of hermitic seal. One scaffold paraphrase (“here, in the honeyed hush…”) lightly dulls cadence but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Server-rack topology and skylight angles are filtered through Kira’s technician gaze; moss viscosity, dripping interval, and amber refraction steer mood without catalog excess. The icicle-drip pattern supplies both micro-setting and causal seed for the symbolic gift. Environment directly constrains the final gesture—only here could moss mediate apology. Spatial choreography clean; one minor leap assumes reader tracks “C-7” locale after first mention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preservation of self-healing sanctuary vs. urge to teach. Escalation is textural—viral noise presses inward, phone buzz counterpointed by drip—until Marcus embodies the threat/offer of witness. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: silence breached on her terms with proffered cutting. Cost clear (loss of absolute solitude) yet feels moderate; stakes could sharpen had Marcus carried external consequence (media, legal).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through living revision emerges via moss overtaking circuitry, never sermonized. The amber pendant’s generational survival quietly parallels Kira’s graft of pain into growth. Final image of “converting witnesses into gardeners” gives resonant non-literal answer. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity remains in whether Marcus can truly nurture what he receives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays snug to Kira’s technician-lyric perceptual filter: “emerald and jade” color coding, interval timing of drips, server-rack nomenclature. Syntax breathes—long aerial sentence for hush, clipped clause to silence phone—mirrors tension release. No dialogue contamination; Marcus’ two lines carry subtext of unearned apology. Only nit: “protected vulnerability” is named conceptually twice; trimming one would keep pressure inside gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong verbs (“claimed,” “draped,” “channelled”) and sensory nouns carry weight; few adverbial crutches. Rhythm varies across paragraph shapes; final sentence cascade echoes spreading moss. One paraphrase loop (“here, in the honeyed hush…”) and a mixed metaphor (“marriage of technology and nature”) slightly dent peak beats but do not obscure closure. Otherwise clean, propellant prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusing IT ruins with biophilic remediation feels fresh; execution grounds concept in species choice, water routing, generational pendant. Icicle-drip pattern repurposed as instruction manual for healing is elegant turn. Story would collapse if transposed to generic garden; specificity makes novelty inevitable. Minor risk in viral-confession frame, yet focus stays on interior transformation rather than media spectacle.</comment>
