<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—patina grooves, brass weight, grandmother’s memory anchoring each micro-choice. She hedges vengeance for a staged forgiveness, a believable contradiction. Thorne’s apology is scraped, not tidy; his relief reads as bodily collapse. The final stance—acceptance as “down payment”—crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lattice holds: brass pull → past strike → tomorrow’s exchange → apology → staged forgiveness. One continuous parapet scene, no orientation debt. Closure is Charged Poise: darkness makes them “equal in blindness,” reweighting every prior grievance. Cost is legible in the final image—Elara alone on stones, pocketed pull, peace still unpaid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mist-softened battlements, wind-driven moisture through coats, parapet stones worn by centuries—details filter through Elara’s peace-broker eye, never touristic. The drawer pull serves as micro-setting: its weight and grooves constrain hand-over-hand diplomacy. Spatial choreography clean: pull passes from palm to palm, distance held by neutral scar below. Final image of invisible moon overhead locks environment to moral darkness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she trade revenge for reconciliation—signaled in paragraph two. Tightening occurs when she hands Thorne the pull: gesture forecloses refusal, stakes a public ethic. Cost visible: she swallows her brother’s death, accepts apology as partial payment. Agency remains hers; Thorne’s son’s fate hangs on her moral calendar, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—history’s knots can only be loosened, never cut—emerges from brass lineage and moonlit ritual, never sermonized. Subtext hums in silence: “They stood together in the gathering darkness” carries both alliance and abyss. Final line reweights “untether” from geopolitical to moral: prisoners will walk, but history remains tethered to the pull in her pocket. No moral sentence, only charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric, elevated register stays consistent with mythic-peace tone; no filter-verb clutter. Elara’s diction—“patina darkened by decades of desperate hands”—is particular, not generic. Thorne’s speech is laconic soldier-speak; distinction preserved. No head-hopping; single POV holds with reliable inference.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for memory, clipped fragments for apology. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds density—brass weight + grandmother + treaty memory in one beat. Metaphors stay coherent: mist as confession, moon as blindness. Final line lands with monosyllabic thud—“She remained on the windblown stones”—propelling exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-war reconciliation arc is retooled through inherited brass talisman and lunar etiquette, a fresh cultural overlay. Transformation test passes: pull’s genealogy makes this negotiation irreplicable elsewhere. Risk taken by withholding explicit exchange scene; instead, immediate pre-night vigil chosen, paid off in Charged Poise.</comment>
