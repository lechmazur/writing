<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Vera’s contradictory drives—craving genuine feeling vs. never consuming her wares—are embodied in the static-charged amber touches and the micro-choice to press the petal to her own chest. Her “affectionate detachment” surfaces in every beat, from murmuring “There you are” to the widower’s laugh she’ll sell tomorrow. The rule “never consume the merchandise” costs her the moment of absorption she aches for, so the renunciation is earned and priced. Minor slip: “professionally thorough” is asserted more than dramatized in this single scene.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed grotto and Vera’s retreat into night reweight the stakes—she can carry mercy only by remaining emotionally exiled. Causal chain holds: dusk window → loosened amber → petal harvest → rule-enforced renunciation. Orientation is clean by line 3; timeline (exact dusk span) is tethered throughout. One micro-turn—the temptation to absorb—sets up the final restraint without breaking the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The amber grotto is not backdrop; its daily liquefaction window literally enables the harvest and imposes the ticking clock. Static-charged air, crystalline walls, and the blotter petal’s color shifts are filtered through Vera’s dealer-eye, turning setting into tool. Micro-setting (the petal, her satchel, the carved steps) tracks cleanly across beats. Final image of the sealed grotto mirrors Vera’s self-sealed heart, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Vera harvest without succumbing to the emotions she brokers? Pressure escalates as the grotto’s permeability narrows to a one-minute window, forcing the final choice. Cost is visible: she forfeits the intoxicating completeness of feeling she’s just tasted. Agency is internal—renunciation—but the static snap on her fingertips makes the price tactile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: mercy can lie in curated incompleteness—people need truths gentle enough to survive. The half-truth motif (mother-love without let-go, laughter without silence) is instantiated in every harvested streak, not abstractly asserted. Final image reconfigures the premise: Vera’s exile is the price of compassion. No moralizing, only the resonant paradox of “merciful lies truer than honesty.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>VOV is tight third-person; no head-hop. Vera’s perceptual signature—chemist’s diction (“fragrance chemist’s blotter petal”), dealer jargon (“half-truths,” truncated circuits”), and synesthetic verbs (“tasted of a mother’s love”)—remains consistent. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fragments at the restraint beat (“But that would violate…”). Static electricity as sensory motif is handled without filter-verb clutter. Voice modulates from clinical to quietly lyrical without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: one sentence often layers sensory data, tool function, and emotional cue (“sparks danced…petal began to darken”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the electromagnetic vein. Rhythm accelerates with the dusk countdown, then exhales in the final sentence. Minor overwriting in “liquid gold” and “pools of liquid gold” so close together, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The counterfeit-emotion dealer who harvests via static-charged amber is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Conceptual risk—equating emotional surgery with mercy—pays off in the final reconfiguration. Half-truth commerce becomes a compassionate vocation rather than a con, flipping reader expectations without violating prior rules. Specificity of the blotter-petal mod and dusk-timed grotto makes the premise feel discovered, not invented.</comment>
