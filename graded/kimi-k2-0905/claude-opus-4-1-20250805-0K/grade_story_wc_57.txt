<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—fingers numbing, breath visible—yet her contradictory mix of scholarly hunger and grief stays implicit. The “philosophical seed collector” label is shown rather than defined through her tactile decoding of knots. No second on-page character means relationship crucible is N/A; her micro-choice to teach the girl tomorrow crystallizes values with visible cost (sleep, warmth, solitude). Voice stays coherent under pressure; only minor slip is the over-tidy epiphany about “eternal truth” which rings abstract beside her embodied patience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of coiled rope + fog + tomorrow’s lesson reweights stakes without neat resolution; cost is felt in Mara’s stiff knees and the fisherman’s death. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of knot-decoding builds density until meaning crystallizes; no causal reversals required. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) reached by line 4; fog later pays off as closure hush. Persistent constraint—knowledge will die without her—shapes the final act of teaching; no outline-style sequencing.</comment>

<comment>Golden dock under snow is not postcard; its planks absorb heat and dissolve flakes, grounding Mara’s knees and later stiffening her joints—environment constrains endurance. Micro-setting of coiled rope functions as “map-tool,” dictating every micro-gesture and final decision. Fog supplies temporal hush that charges the ending; harbor laps and creaking boats stay audible through muffling. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s scholar-patience: touch first, sound second, sight last—no tourist catalog.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve dying knowledge—signaled in paragraph 2; tightening occurs when Mara realizes this rope is the “final record,” forcing tonight’s decoding. No external antagonist; pressure is time + cold + memory loss. One credible loss already paid: fisherman’s death removes future help, visible on page. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded knot increases the weight of what she must carry; final choice to teach tomorrow forecloses rest and risks further exposure—cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge persists in overlooked patterns—emerges through rope, fulgurite, fog, not thesis statement. Subtext of inheritance versus extinction is carried in silence: absence of fishermen, absence of sound, absence of tomorrow’s guarantee. Final image of rope coiled for teaching offers non-literal answer: transmission is the living knot. No moralizing; avoids thematic echo of “eternal truth” by anchoring it to physical dock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Mara’s scholar-perception: metaphors drawn from fractals, salt-tolerant botany, electrical branching. Diction precise—“fulgurite,” “sheet bend,” “clove hitch”—yet rhythm stays fluid, no academic stiffness. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Psychic distance tightens under cold: syntax shortens from reflective long sentences to staccato note-taking. Pattern of “weaving” motif is taught early and paid off at closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long hypnotic sentences for fog, clipped fragments for decoded data. Information density high—each sentence layers tactile detail + cultural history + emotional weight. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “silent snowfall” cliché is instantly saved by “dissolving into weathered planks.” Closing line “rolling eternal across the harbor” repeats ‘roll’ from earlier fog but earns resonance through reconfigured meaning—knowledge now rolls forward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime knot-code meets fractal lightning glass meets philosophical seed archive—none feel bolted on. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; specificity of salt-tolerant seeds + dock planks + NW storm lore is irreplaceable. Risk taken: quiet lyric ending without rescue or triumph; risk pays because cost remains felt. Conceptual integrity intact—never retreats to safe nostalgia, accepts ephemerality of oral transmission.</comment>
