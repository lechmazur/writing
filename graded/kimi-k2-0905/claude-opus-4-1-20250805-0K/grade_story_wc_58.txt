<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete, character-specific, and threaded through embodied micro-choices (winding the thread, writing Marcus in air). Contradictory impulses—mapping wounds vs. “peace”—co-exist without tidy epiphany. The final “map” stance is earned by the carpet’s progressive unraveling and her nightly projections; cost is felt in the wrist-pulse sync. No other characters on page, so relationship bullets correctly ignored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crimson thread around her wrist crystallizes the mapper stance with undeniable conceptual cost (“she was its humble cartographer”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thread-pulls and projections deepens stakes until cadence shift in final paragraph. Orientation anchored by ~90 words (garden, autumn, palace carpet). One soft spot: causality of Marcus’s tower projection is recounted, not shown, slightly cooling the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden, frost-edged roses, dry fountain, and the thread-as-tool constrain her choice to stay and map; these micro-settings charge the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual, tactile, scent) mirrors POV’s mournful attention. Weather hovers but never stalls action; spatial choreography clean. The thread’s evolving state (pulped, warm, wrist-bound) evolves causally—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping healing before the city dissolves—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each pulled thread and projection thickens the pattern of absences until the final crystallization narrows her life-path to cartographer. No external antagonist; pressure is ontological. Cost is visible—thread burns her wrist, garden darkens, Marcus thins—meets 8-band guardrail for visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating image of unraveling/ mapping; no moralizing. Final line reweights “healing” from cure to geography without abstract statement. Ambiguity—whether peace is possible—lingers but is charged, not confusing. Subtext in Marcus’s cardamom excuse and koi-shaped absence is specific and heartbreaking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close stays stable; perceptual signature is autumnal, textile-tender, astronomical. Syntax lengthens then compresses with emotional pulse; no head-hopping. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Diction (“lonesome splendor,” “explained absences”) is consistent, never showy. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—long clauses for garden lull, shorter for wrist-pulse climax. Metaphors (incense smoke, golden circles) stay physically coherent. One mixed image—“sky’s indifference”—is minor. No loops or scaffold; high density: one sentence often does description + interiority + metaphor. Final line cadence reprises “lonesome splendor,” ear-tested.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Obituaries-for-the-living + carpet-weft divining rod is a fresh synthesis; risk is high yet emotionally legible. Conceptual twist: healing = cartography of loss, not erasure. Specificity (cardamom, Lyra, koi-shaped absence) prevents template drift. Final image feels inevitable yet un-obvious in hindsight—meets transformation test.</comment>
