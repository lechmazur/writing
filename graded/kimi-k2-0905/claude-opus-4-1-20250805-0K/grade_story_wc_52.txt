<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Margaret’s interiority is concrete—knife grip, scent of ash, the feel of unfinished grain—yet the “hauntingly practical” trait is stated more than dramatized. The decisive micro-choice—carving a clock face without hands—crystallizes her shift from mourning to carrying forward, but the cost is felt more as theme than as tangible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rain, kettle whistle, and wood shavings layer toward a Charged Poise closure. The final image—“this roughed-out clock face that would never tell time, only hold it”—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost legible in a single sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Loft micro-setting is lived-in: skylight rain beads mirror Margaret’s unshed tears, ash blank constrains each cut. The tea kettle’s rising pitch acts as a diegetic metronome, forcing tactile pace that charges the final carving beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><answer>Dominant stake—how to keep Thomas present without freezing in grief—tightens through the carving act; the kettle’s four-minute countdown supplies external pressure. The cost is conceptual (clock that refuses measurement) rather than visceral, but remains legible under Accumulative lens.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><answer>Theme emerges via crystallized time artifact: love persists as fossil, not smoke. The closing refusal to “move on” reweights the premise without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing through the handless clock image.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><answer>Third-person intimate maintains perceptual signature—light through rain, sawdust sharpness, kettle steam—without filter-verb clutter. Prose rhythm modulates: longer cadence for memory, staccato during carving beats.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><answer>Information-dense lines (“ash wood released its sharp, clean scent, mixing with the steam”) do triple duty: sensory, thematic, temporal. No looped phrasing or mixed metaphor; closure sentence is lean yet resonant.</answer>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><answer>The handless clock carved from a lion-head blank subverts expected commemoration; “crystallized time” reframes grief as geology, not elegy. Fresh angle is rooted in craft specifics rather than abstract twist.</answer>
