<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s skepticism is asserted rather than embodied; the luminous trait never alters his perceptions or choices. The woman’s “patient fury of geological ages” is vivid but external, not demonstrated through micro-gesture. His decision to stay lacks visible internal friction or cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ambiguous drive lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant) is taught early via frozen geese & amber basins and held to closure. Closure lands as Charged Poise: empty box reframing tomorrow’s constellations reweights all prior anomalies with undeniable conceptual cost—composted memories now “nourish something new.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>City of dry fountains and viscous time is tactile, specific, and charges the ending—the first flowing water tastes of centuries. Micro-setting (stained glass box, feather) constrains every beat and re-images in the final projection. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when feather is lifted: geese begin to drift, viscous time liquefies. Protagonist agency is present yet low-heat; cost is conceptual (city’s remembering) rather than personal, keeping it shy of 8.5.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory must decay/compost before renewal. Final image—box now showing tomorrow’s constellations—reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (woman’s fingers through glass) and silence sustains ambiguity. No thematic echo slogans.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative with controlled synesthetic compression (“rain that remembered where it had been”). Perceptual signature stays consistent: Marcus notices anomalies, starlight, temporal viscosity. Rhythm modulates—short staccato for geese release, longer cadence for philosophical tilt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High figurative density is patterned early and paid off; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “defiant hush” appears twice without new charge—minor. Sentence rhythm breathes with emotional peaks; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Clean copy, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frozen-migration as memory snagged on time-fountains feels inevitable after the fact. Risk in lyric non-linear structure heightens resonance without obscuring closure. Tropes (skeptic, magical object) are re-encoded through temporal fluidity. No derivative echo of famous scenes.</comment>
