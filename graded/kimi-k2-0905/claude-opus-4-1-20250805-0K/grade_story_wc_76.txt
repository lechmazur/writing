<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s lifetime obsession with backward clocks is vivid and embodied; the yoyo-key and grandmother’s journals give concrete lineage to her skills. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where she doubts reversing the stone—and the “bleak exhilaration” is asserted rather than shown in body or choice. Still, her final laugh carries a felt cost: she accepts a life sentence of tending retro-light. Micro-choices (winding copper counter-clockwise, dismantling lens backward) tightly align motive and method.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: yoyo data → lighthouse arrival → lens dismantling → stone inversion → backward beam. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no penalty. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the beam now shines into the past, rewriting the lighthouse’s purpose and Elara’s fate. Cost is visible—“she’d stepped beyond fate’s design by fulfilling it perfectly backward”—and persists as the light keeps calling lost ships home.</comment>

<comment>Water dripping upward, tide as “dying breath,” and the void-stone’s pull on vision give tactile, multi-sense immediacy. Lighthouse geography is tracked cleanly up the spiral; lens assembly, copper wire, and meteorite fragment act as micro-settings that constrain each manipulation. The reversed beam recharges the opening image of clocks running backward, satisfying the 9+ gate. One minor slip: “rocky island” remains generic; no seabirds, salt, or wind detail grounds locale further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore or destroy the hunger stone—signals early and tightens once: each lens piece removed increases latent radiance, narrowing options to inversion or death-by-void. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; no coincidence. Protagonist agency drives every turn; price is the perpetual caretaker role she accepts. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no secondary reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: time’s arrow can be bent, but the archer becomes the arrow’s servant. Subtext lives in the stone’s inversion—consumption becomes generation, but the keeper is now consumed by eternal custodianship. Final image of backward beam calling lost ships offers resonant CR without moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy thesis stated; ambiguity lingers about whether restoring the past is mercy or curse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is precise, tool-oriented, slightly melancholy. Syntax mirrors her mechanical mind: clauses stack like gear trains, then fracture into short bursts under stress (“Light exploded outward”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Register remains consistent; “dying breath,” “latent radiance” fit her literate but solitary diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“illuminate… consume instead of create”) skirts purple but stays in character. Opening and closing sentences book-end the tide/light reversal with satisfying symmetry. One paraphrase loop—“backward-running clocks… counter clockwise clocks”—costs a hair; otherwise momentum is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combining retrograde clocks, a yoyo-as-astronomical-key, and a hunger stone that must be starved to shine is a fresh synthesis; no trope checklist feel. Risky backward-time beacon for lost ships feels inevitable yet new. Specificity of copper wire wound “counter clockwise around the stone” anchors the concept in tactile detail. Minor echo of “light that exists but can’t manifest” trope keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
