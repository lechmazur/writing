<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s undercover motive and grief anchor her; the brother reveal is late but lands. Thorne’s paternal desperation supplies immediate pressure. Micro-choices (pocketing arrowhead, dialling dead phone) show hierarchy of values. Interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic speak (“needs you to let go”) that flattens embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: accepting metamorphosis reweights all prior loss. Causal lens holds—arrowhead → phone call → dissolution into light. Cost is conceptual but undeniable (“her brother’s voice among the static”). Orientation clean by 120w; one soft patch is Thorne’s instant trust.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Gravity-pocket cavern is economically taught through floating soil/lavender and constrains the final ascension. Micro-setting (arrowhead, fungi towers) doubles as tool and mirror. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV priorities—physics anomalies first, sentiment second. The underground garden directly shapes the acceptance ritual, earning 9-band use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete or refuse metamorphosis—signalled early. Tightening occurs when Marina realises grief anchors the returned; this forecloses old investigation path. Agency sits with her choice to dial the dead line. Cost is abstract (conceptual surrender) but legible; would benefit from one tangible forfeiture for 8.8+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges: suffering transmuted into transcendence via communal release. Subtext carried by floating lavender and upward arrowhead rather than exposition. Final image of dissolve-into-light reweights prior disappearances as invitation, not theft. Avoids moralizing; complexity remains—some may call surrender delusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is calm-analytic with faint mythic lift, fitting undercover researcher. Perceptual signature sharp: Marina notices anomalies first, sentiment second. Dialogue minimal but distinct—Thorne’s bitter laugh vs Marina’s clinical brevity. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens as gravity pockets tug bones.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; almost every line advances plot or atmosphere. Rhythm varies—short spikes during phone static, longer calmer expository curls. One template cadence (“The ...”) opens three sentences in 40w stretch; minor. No mixed metaphors; figurative language kept spare. Closure beat is clean of artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Cryptid-as-balancer and grief-as-physics-flaw feel fresh; avoids simple monster plot. Synthesis of Thunderbird, gravity pockets, and emotional metamorphosis is non-obvious. Risk in positing cosmic benevolence is deftly handled without softening loss. Specific detail (floating lavender, moths hearing frequencies) keeps concept grounded.</comment>
