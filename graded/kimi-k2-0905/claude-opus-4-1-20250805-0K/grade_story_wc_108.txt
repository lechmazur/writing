<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s fear-programming and methodical stunt-double persona are sharply drawn, but the pivot from “I’m not human” to instant mastery of reversal-code feels rushed; a micro-beat of fumbling doubt would have sealed motivation. Interiority is mostly embodied, yet the climactic line “You gave me the perfect defense” drifts into label-speak. Interior contradiction is present (terror vs. drive to know), powering the beat where he steels his trembling hand. The earned cost—claiming the shell and walking away—lands, though deeper scar tissue on identity could have stung more.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: child’s cast → coordinates → shell resonance reversal → Jake’s collapse. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Marcus becomes the keeper of terrors he once suffered. The lens is causal throughout; each beat narrows options until only self-authorship remains. Mid-scene orientation is firm by 80 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rusted library under star-holes is sketched with selective decay details (“rain eaten through steel and ambition”) that mirror interior corrosion. The shell as micro-setting constrains the final move, qualifying for 9+ gate, though spatial choreography is thin during the two-handed shell touch. Sensory hierarchy favors metallic chill and paper rot, keeping description tethered to Marcus’s tactile caution. Environment could have supplied one more obstacle (footing, falling shelf) to tighten escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—owning identity vs. engineered fear—tightens when Marcus realises the phobias are leash, not flaw. One meaningful escalation: the resonance reversal that turns safeguard into weapon, paid with Jake’s instant vertigo. Cost is visible (Jake cringing on floor), altering power balance. Stakes never drift abstract; each new formula on the cast increments the same question: who controls the body.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: vulnerability weaponised is still vulnerability, just aimed elsewhere. The shell’s re-merger reweights “broken” into “whole yet dangerous,” avoiding moralising. No late thesis statements; final image of Marcus walking out under stars lets reader feel the new solitude. Subtext in Jake’s regard for stunt doubles as “poetic expendables” bites harder than any narrator lecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter: starlight as threat, shell hum as maternal pulse. Syntax flares under pressure (“laugh... like grinding metal”) yet keeps within POV lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but functions as action; Jake’s single line “Submit to reset protocol” carries chilling subtext of owner-to-device. Voice convergence at climax is minimal and justified by Marcus’s dominance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long clause-setting to staccato confrontations; no template cadence detected. Information density high—“equations... identity reconstruction protocols” compresses world-rule without pause. Mixed metaphors kept in check; “promise” for cold metal is the one poetic reach, but it lands. No scaffolding, no synonym loops; closing line breathes with quiet finality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The engineered-stunt-double-who-learns-fear-is-a-trigger feels fresh, synthesising bio-tech thriller with identity noir. Transformation test passes: swap setting or names and the emotional math collapses. Risk of seashell-as-McGuffin is mostly avoided by making it the vector of reversal. Slight deduction for near-archetype of evil scientist father; more specific paternal pathology could have pushed uniqueness higher.</comment>
