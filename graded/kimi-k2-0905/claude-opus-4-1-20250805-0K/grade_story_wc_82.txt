<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are strong; Mei's trembling fingers and the parallel between lantern-folding and grief-crane-folding show motives turning under pressure. The final shift—from absence to transformation—is earned via the thousand-gem accumulation, with visible cost in the luminous torment she hangs. Minor slip: “crafty nature” skirts diagnostic-speak, though it’s quickly grounded in glass-and-wire memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (“down into the stone, up into light”) and holds through the cadence of gem-polishing repetitions. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica lanterns cast dancing-shadow daughters, re-weighting love-as-light with undeniable conceptual cost. One soft spot: the “three months later” transition is told, not shown, slightly thinning the hinge between garden arrival and present pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Floating island, glass basilica, and moonlight bridges are anchored within 120 words; spatial choreography stays clean across garden paths and workshop memories. The dream-gem micro-setting constrains every polishing motion, charging the final image. Weather and scale remain poetic without physics contradiction; a hairline slip is “bridges of woven moonlight” — lovely, yet untethered from tactile usage until lanterns are hung.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief before it corrupts—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each successive gem. The deepening is accumulative: each crane-gem forecloses nostalgic retreat and raises the cost of continuing. Agency stays internal yet visible; the final lantern-installation is the visible price. Escalation is steady, but because pressure is lyrical rather than causal, the peak feels plateau-adjacent rather than sharply narrowed.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief is not destroyed but re-formed into light that guides others. The returned image of dancing shadows refuses moral summary, inviting counter-readings (is memorialization consoling or compulsive?). Subtext lives in gesture—polishing, folding, hanging—never in exposition. Final paragraph’s “ascending descent” re-prices love’s trajectory without declaring a moral, achieving nuanced resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtering perception through Mei’s glass-worker eye: “memories of her daughter’s laughter” is a precise occupational metaphor. Lyric compression (“luminous torment”) is pattern-taught and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so voice texture rests on rhythmic recurrence of “fold,” “polish,” “ascend,” which modulate under pressure without drum-beat monotony. Diction remains within artisan lexicon; only “shadow-plague” edges toward abstract coinage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; opening clause-initial participles are controlled and serve emotional deceleration. High information density: each sentence layers craft, memory, and cosmic geography without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (lantern/crane/gem as grief-vessels). Two near loops: “transform grief into something bearable” echoed by “transformed into something almost bearable” — minor paraphrase, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating isle + dream-gem economy fuses craft fantasy with bereavement tech; the combination feels inevitable, not grafted. Lantern-making as origami-of-grief is a fresh inflection unseen in familiar loss narratives. Risk is taken with accumulative lyric structure over plot reversals, and it pays off in the final re-weighting. Only the “shadow-plague” label feels generic; otherwise specificity is high.</comment>
