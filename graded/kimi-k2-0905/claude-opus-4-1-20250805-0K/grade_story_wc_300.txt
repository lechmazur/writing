<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hand, the impulse to carve, the memory of the hospital bed—but the interior contradiction (“I inspect bunkers because I’m terrified of living above ground”) is stated rather than enacted. The micro-choice to carve is credible and costly, yet the prior emotional architecture leans on summary, not simultaneous contradiction in scene. Crown remains off-screen, so relationship-as-crucible doesn’t apply; his regrets function as thematic echo more than lived pressure. The change is earned, but the emotional crescendo is slightly smoothed by diagnostic self-labeling at the knife point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl’s eruption reweights isolation into connection, and Mara’s phone-dialing crystallizes a foreclosed path with undeniable social cost. The causal spine—finding shell → reading confessions → adding her own → light burst → surface decision—holds without gaps; each beat alters her viable options. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“crystal caves beneath Mount Erebus”), well inside the 120-word allowance. One micro-turn (the glow’s intensification) tightens stakes exactly at the knife-point beat, satisfying the single-deepening requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystal cave is more than postcard: its phosphorescence guides attention, the conch’s spiral literally channels the confession act, and the weakening walls (“hairline fractures that sparkled like veins of hope”) feed the closure image. Sensory hierarchy follows Mara’s inspector gaze—she notes structural integrity first, emotional residue second—keeping POV bias tight. The bunker’s luxury fixtures are skimmed, but the omitted detail never constrains a choice, so economy bias is met. Environment constrains the final tagging of the bunker as “unsuitable,” a direct causal outgrowth of the pearl’s irradiation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question></grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will Mara speak her fear aloud?”—is signaled by her tremor at the first etched confession. Escalation is accumulative: each carved line thickens the air until the glow forces the knife choice; the cost is the irreversible public fracture of her professional armor. No reversal in the classical sense, but the light’s eruption is a deepening that reweights silence vs. speech from abstract to urgent. The price is legible: she marks the bunker condemned, forfeiting future access, and carries confessions upstairs where they will become live conversations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—“no one survives alone”—emerges from the spiral of confessions and the pearl’s transmutation of regret into light, never sermonized. The final image of phone-dialing reframes the entire inspection genre: bunkers as emotional avoidance devices, not survival tools. Subtext hums in the shell’s calcium scratches, the “breathing” cave, the pearl as fossilized loneliness; no character articulates the thesis until Mara’s carved line, which is dramatized action, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers: we do not know if Marcus or her mother will answer, so the cost stays open-ended yet felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly glued to Mara’s perceptual filter—“standard inspection forgotten,” “professional distance,” “inspectors’ jargon” shape diction. No head-hopping; Crown’s interior is accessed only through his etchings, a legally observable artifact. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for cave awe, staccato carved fragments mimic fingernail scratches. Filter verbs (“she noticed,” “she understood”) are sparse and motivated by inspector protocol. Voice remains consistent under stress; no register drift into abstract therapy-speak beyond the single self-diagnostic sentence that is itself carved, hence objectified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Information density is high—“latent radiance that seemed to breathe with the cave itself” does double sensory-conceptual work. One mixed metaphor (“walls… dissolve like salt in warm water”) is minor and emotionally apt. No scaffolding; paragraphs are trim and cut-test clean. The final line’s image of “spiral silence” is crisp, texturally specific, and propels outward motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of bunker inspection with confessional sacrament feels fresh; the pearl as regret-to-light engine reconfigures both spy-thriller bunkers and grief-memorial tropes. The spiral shell overwriting luxury survivalist aesthetics is a specific, irreversible invention—remove it and the entire mechanics of confession collapse. Risk is taken: the literal glowing pearl could tilt magical, but the cave’s established phosphorescence and Crown’s “experiment” notes prime the reader for radiance-as-metaphor-become-real. The inspector’s emotional arc is inseparable from this invented device, passing the transformation test.</comment>
