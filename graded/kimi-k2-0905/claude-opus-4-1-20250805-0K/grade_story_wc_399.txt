<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract—”she understood immediately” tells more than dramatizes. Her final unmasking carries symbolic weight yet feels pre-ordained rather than driven by a visible, costly choice on the page. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the epiphany is delivered by the prophet’s voice first, then ratified by her. Still, the vocational identity is memorable and the ending image of scars-as-boundaries is specific enough to feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clearings become living libraries, the walkers lifelong vessels, announced in the final paragraph with undeniable social cost—no going back to mere patrolling. Causality is soft—prophet arrives, she intuits, then group ritual—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence thickens, images echo, stakes reweight. Orientation is secure by line 4. The lens ambiguity cap does not apply because the lyric pattern is taught early and closure salutes it.</comment>

<comment>“Kinetic parapet beneath the dunes” and “murmuring pavilion” are vivid, impossible, and immediately functional: the parapet’s restless motion externalizes memory-loss anxiety; the pavilion breathes and teaches its own sonic rule-set. Sensory economy is high—sound (twelve tongues), sub-audible hum, crystalline pillars—each filtering through the walker’s border-trained perception. Spatial choreography stays clean across spiral stairs, threshold rituals, night circuit. Final image of “wind through infinite pages” recharges the motif of wisdom-as-sound, tying environment to closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“wisdom echoes fading”—is declared early but remains conceptual; no concrete example of a lost echo is dramatized, so cost feels abstract. Escalation is a single thickening: dimming maps of light signal urgency, prompting the consecration march. The walkers’ agency is collective and ceremonial rather than individuated risk. Hence pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; options narrow metaphorically (memory loss) but never practically threaten a specific clearing or walker. Closure reprices the concept, yet the beat-to-beat tension stays modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory must be housed in living, tended space—emerges through the consecration ritual rather than exposition. Subtext operates in the prophet’s riddles and the walker’s scars, both left quiet enough to invite reader extrapolation. Final line’s “wind through infinite pages” offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the central question. No late sermonizing, though the mid-story declaration “Our clearings must become sanctuaries” flirts with thematic echo; penalty minimal as it propels action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the half-masked walker; perceptual signature filters everything through boundary imagery—edges, thresholds, peripheral awareness. Rhythm varies from long breathless sentences during night ritual to clipped fragments at dawn: “We are the vessels.” No head-hops; Marcus’s single line is的外在 observable. Diction favors Latinate abstraction (“consecrates,” “conceptual”) yet stays internally consistent with a mystic cadence. No register drift; metaphor chains are purposeful, taught by the pavilion’s murmuring and paid off in the final breeze-through-pages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is music-box steady; occasional stacked modifiers (“crystalline pillars humming at frequencies just below human hearing”) verge purple but fit the lyric mode. Scaffold minimal—no synonym loops, no template cadence in peak beats. Information density high: one sentence often layers setting, mythic lore, and emotional tilt. Occasional abstraction-itis (“accumulated knowledge of ten thousand years”) keeps this from 8+ band; a single concrete relic or countable memory would sharpen edge. Closure line is clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: shifting dune-wall as living memory bank, clearings as portable libraries, walkers as half-masked librarians of reality borders—specific enough to escape generic desert mysticism. Risk is structural—lyric accumulative plot with collective agency—yet coherence holds. No close echoes of famous franchise scenes; prophet trope is subordinated to archivist labor. Transformation test passes: swap desert to city or librarians to monks and the emotional arc collapses because the sonic, sandy, peripheral imagery is integral.</comment>
