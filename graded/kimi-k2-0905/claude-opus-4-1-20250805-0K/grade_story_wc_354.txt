<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viktor’s renunciation is fully earned: the stone’s transfer to Mira crystallizes a lineage of “difficulty-as-beauty” and costs him the visible prestige he could reclaim tomorrow. Interiority stays concrete—thumb in dent, pieces sliding under magnetic drag—never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9.0 is that Mira’s pressure is gentle; her stake never truly tests Viktor’s hierarchy of values on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant’s end becomes Viktor’s chosen invisibility, cost legible in the stone’s passage and the aurora-lit final image. Causal chain holds—exile → teaching → recognition that exile was gift → refusal to return—each beat tightening options under the Causal lens. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and tighten through magnetic cues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is not backdrop; its torque on metal knights directly shapes the impossible final position that justifies staying. Twilight aurora and magnetite/quartz board provide micro-setting that charges the closing image. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Viktor’s priorities—magnetic tug before visual spectacle—keeping detail purposeful. One hairline slip: “six miles every evening” is told, not felt, but does not mute the final resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return to Academy vs. remain in exile—tightens once: covenant expires, Viktor refuses. The magnetic board’s literal tilt externalizes the irreversible choice, forcing a visible trade-off. Cost is felt (stone given, public identity forfeited), though pressure is more philosophical than endangering. Sufficient for this length; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—“beauty lives in difficulty”—emerges through stone, board, and renunciation, never sermonized. Subtext resides in tactile silence: the dent, the sliding knight, the aurora’s mute dance. Final image reweights exile from punishment to gift without moralizing. A hairline deduction for Mira’s line “discover beauty in the difficult,” the closest thing to an echoic thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Viktor’s perceptual signature—magnetic fields before color, chess geometry before social noise. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, staccato for piece moves. No head-hopping; Mira’s interior is implied through gesture. One clause (“thoughtfully precise arrogance”) momentarily lifts into editorial diction, but recedes quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every image pulls double duty—magnetic nexus mirrors psychic displacement. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Sentence variety propels the twilight momentum without purple drag. A single paraphrase shadow—“patterns they'd never imagine” echoes “patterns within patterns” two beats later—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing geomagnetic anomaly with chess pedagogy is fresh; the conceit that strategic depth mirrors planetary field lines feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—renouncing triumph for invisible mentorship—pays off via the magnetite board that literalizes the choice. No stock tropes; even the worry-stone becomes a calibrated instrument, not a prop. Transformation test passes: swap magnetism for any other force and the entire metaphoric scaffold collapses.</comment>
