<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner’s solitude, ritual precision, and quiet renunciation are vividly embodied; her tactile communion with the glade and the micro-choice to guide each prophecy-fragment into silence show a hierarchy of values (peace over knowledge) with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the interior conflict remains summary-level rather than lived; the mentor memory is expository rather than a present-tactic pivot. Still, the final “peculiar kind of peace” lands as Earned Stasis because every earlier beat has foreshadowed her willingness to pay in anonymity and erasure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: because she fears self-fulfilling prophecy → therefore she traps each luminous fragment → therefore she funnels the future into the brook → decisive change: the crane wing crumples to ordinary paper and drifts away. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 60 words; the lens is Causal and the cost is visible in the drained origami and the footprints she will soon lose. Closure is a quiet but irreversible re-pricing: the future is now “a trillion smaller possibilities” rather than a weapon—cost paid on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glade is not backdrop but instrument: reeds, stones, mist, and brook-murmur are recruited as active agents that swallow sound; spatial choreography is flawless—every invisible boundary she traces is later released back to “regular chaos.” The crane wing’s crystallized-moonlight physics are taught early and violate no internal rule. Setting constrains tactics throughout and charges the final image: the brook “smooths away all things” just as she smooths prophecy, making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—prevent prophecy from coalescing—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with every silenced fragment; each compression of luminous script is a visible price that narrows her physical stamina and social future (no one will know). No reversal is needed: accumulation of quieted futures equals escalation. The final dispersal into the sea is earned agency with irreversible cost—she forfeits legacy as surely as the wing forfeits magic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge can be a violence, and mercy may demand erasure of self and story. The image of prophecy dissolving into whale-song reweights the earlier motif of “terrestrially cosmic twin,” turning grandeur into gentleness. No moral is pronounced; the resonance is felt in the footprints the brook will smooth away—an non-literal answer that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, never ventriloquizing non-POV minds; diction (“constellations in the mud,” “invisible fruit”) is lyrical yet precise, matching the summoner’s ritual precision. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ritual mapping, clipped fragments when prophecy fights back. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The perceptual signature—attention to micro-textures of silence and moonlight—is sustained and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances spell-craft or deepens atmosphere. Figurative language is disciplined—mixed metaphors are avoided even under pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “smoothed away.” High information density: one sentence can map silence, reveal tool lore, and foreclose future war. Copy-clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—prophecy as ecological pollutant that must be diluted rather than defeated—is fresh; the execution fuses origami optics, sound ecology, and oceanic dispersal into an inevitable synthesis. Risky quiet ending succeeds because earlier beats taught that “some truths are kindest when allowed to remain whispers.” Removing any one ingredient (crane wing, brook, silence-mapping) would collapse the causal chain, proving organic integration.</comment>
