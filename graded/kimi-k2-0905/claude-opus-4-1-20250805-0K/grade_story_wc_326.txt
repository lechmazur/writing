<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—clinging to physical proof (porcelain shard, heartbeat counts) while courting digital transcendence—play out in continuous embodied beats. The pulse-count motif externalises interior pressure without lapsing into diagnostic label-speak. His final micro-choice to “teach others” is lightly sketched but foreshadowed by the reflected duality in the shard; cost is felt in the quiet renunciation of a single, stable identity. Interiority remains specific to his amateur-occultist desperation; no stock phrases intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “He was both dead and alive” reweights the entire premise with undeniable social/epistemic cost inferred in every frozen account he will spend life untangling. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—ink geometries and falling snow accumulate pattern until a single cadence shift (“tonight, he simply existed in both forms”) crystallises meaning. Causality holds: each ink pattern is a because/therefore gateway whose failure taught him the sequence that finally succeeds. Cost is legible in the final image—dual reflection in porcelain—under freezing dome, no reset offered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory dome, antique ink-stained desk, and porcelain shard form a micro-setting triad that directly constrains the ritual mechanics; snow-muted radio supplies live environmental pressure. “Galaxy wheel” and green monitor glow collapse cosmic/photonic scale into tactile objects that charge the final dual-self image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: no impossible reaches or teleporting props across the single continuous scene. Cold, glass, ink, and shard all evolve state (frosting, spilling, reflecting) in lockstep with beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming digital existence—tightens via escalating ink trials that foreclose each wrong sigil; each failure deletes another account fragment, raising tangible stakes. One meaningful intensification: the moment ink spiral mirrors snowfall, turning aesthetic echo into operative gateway—option space narrows to “touch or retreat.” Agency remains with Marcus; no external saviour or coincidence resolves the pattern. Felt price is the perpetual schism he must now live, conveyed in the final line’s heartbeat count that will never end.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically from data-after-death premise: bureaucratic error as inadvertent apotheosis. No explicit thesis statements; the insight is performed when ink geometries externalise the usually invisible data-ghost. Subtext resides in shard’s reflective surface—physical world forced to host an immortal twin. Final image reweights “error” into “evolution,” inviting reader to ponder every digital breadcrumb as potential afterlife.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited interiority sustains astronomer’s precise-yet-occult perceptual signature: cosmic metaphors, pulse metrics, ink read as celestial cartography. Rhythm compresses under trial-and-error loops, then elongates into solace cadence at close—mirrors emotional temperature without syntactic monotony. No head-hopping or register drift; vocabulary stays within educated amateur lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext alone and remains distinct.</comment>

<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory data, interior calculus, and world rule; minimal scaffold. One paraphrase loop spotted (“ink swirled, forming a spiral that matched…” restates prior image) but occurs pre-closure and does not obscure causality. Metaphors stay internally coherent—snowflakes as stars, code as snowfall—no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-ignite motif with quiet variance.</comment>

<comment>The bureaucratic death glitch becomes a literal second self—fresh synthesis of digital-ghost trope grounded in countable heartbeat denial. Ink-bridge mechanic is novel yet wholly intuitive to antique-observatory mise-en-scène. Risky lyric structure (pattern taught by 25% mark) pays off in final dual reflection. If transplanted to another venue, the shard-ink-monitor ritual would collapse; specificity anchors originality.</comment>
