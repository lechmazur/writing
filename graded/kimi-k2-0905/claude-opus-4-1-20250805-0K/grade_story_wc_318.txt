<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s “mournfully eager” trait is more label than lived; only late does it bloom into the image of him packing blowers slowly. Interiority is strong (“weight of unfinished business pressing against his chest like a stone”), but contradictory impulses stay off-page—he never doubts or recalculates. Closure choice is gentle, yet the cost is felt: he will return monthly, chaining himself to other people’s grief. That earned ritual lifts the score just under the 9-line because the flaw is motivational softness, not failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: tunnel conductorship → mechanical choir → returned laughter. Orientation is instant (“Maple Street… twelve leaf blowers arranged”), no debts. The final image of Marcus walking home “through darkness that felt lighter” is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration—options reweighted, future path foreclosed by his own promise. Cost is visible and persistent: the clinking pull cords compose “their own quiet song,” a life-sentence of caretaking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The tunnel is not backdrop but instrument: its limestone pores, ventilation shafts, and acoustic curve literally transmit wind-borne memory into living-room dust motes. Leaf blower specs (middle-C drone, F-sharp) are accurate and choice-constraining—Marcus must tune them or fail. Spatial choreography is clean: semicircle → upward shafts → house floorboards. Final image of cords clinking as he walks recharges the tool-as-setting rule. Meets 9-gate but for a hairline lack of body-scale tactile detail inside the tunnel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—restore laughter—signalled in paragraph two and tightened when the first cord is pulled. Escalation is accumulative: each blower adds harmonic density until the tunnel “breathes,” then the house answers; no reversal, but option space narrows—silence is no longer possible. Price is conceptual: Marcus commits to eternal return, a living maintenance contract. Could enter 8.8+ if a visible sacrifice (stamina, social ridicule) had been dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief is aerated, not erased; joy is a mechanical respiration that must be serviced. The leaf-blower-as-organ trope reconfigures from comic to sacred without authorial nudge. Final image answers the implicit question—“Who keeps the laughter alive?”—with the clinking cords, a non-moral cadence. Avoids sentimentality by staying inside tool-noise and wind physics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter (“gleaming like teeth,” “pull-cord handles clinked softly”). Syntax mirrors acoustic obsession—long vibrating sentences for drone, staccato “pull-cord, roar, sing” for attack. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Compression and elision (“three years… macerated more than flesh”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm control is exemplary; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical itself—crescendo of gerunds, then diminuendo of monosyllables matching the fade-out. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within acoustic physics (“breathing entity,” “fingers of wind”). One near-purple phrase (“ground their happiness into dust so fine”) is earned by prior grief set-up. Closure line is crystalline, artifact-free.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sonic resurrection of grief via leaf-blower choir is a fresh synthesis of magical realism and blue-collar tool kit. Tunnel-as-echo-church and gardener-conductor are non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—turning laughably mundane machines into liturgical instruments—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity (middle-C, F-sharp, limestone pores) prevents abstract allegory, making the concept un-portable: this story dies if the blowers become trumpets.</comment>
