<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is concrete—her clay-trained precision, the glass’s heartbeat against her spine—but the “zen-minded” trait is told, not embodied. The only micro-choice she makes is to sit and understand; the promised renunciation of leaving is stated, not dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. Reflection is anchored and changes her stance, satisfying BRR, but the absence of visible flaw-driven error keeps the arc shy of full contradiction. Voice remains singular and perceptual; the slight under-embodiment of the final renunciation is the sole bar to 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass’s golden tint and the echo of wings reweight the premise—patience, not force, anchors time. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each sun-patterned hive image layers until the final crystallization. Orientation anchors by line 3; timeline fracture is taught through the lantern-glass vision and pays off in the synced-smoke moment. Cost is legible in the charged image of Mei walking away, carrying the borrowed gold, foreclosing immediate return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hexagon hive layout literally constrains her reading of the oasis and supplies the epiphany; the cracked earth underfoot mirrors her interior fracture, charging the final image. Lantern glass functions as micro-setting, its thrumming body pressed to spine, guiding every step. Sun-path geometry is tactile, measured by hive angles and smoke ceiling. Sensory economy is perfect—no visual tourist excess, only the shimmer, the purr, the flattened smoke.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—why this place resisted burning—signals early and tightens once: the hive geometry reveals the solar anchor, foreclosing other explanations. Agency is attention/understanding rather than external action; the cost is the irreversible knowledge that she must leave and wait. Escalation is density-driven: each vision through the glass thickens the pattern until the smoke-sync crystallizes it. Price is conceptual but unmistakable—she gains the answer at the price of immediate return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the hive-to-clay-to-time analogy: care that follows natural pattern creates temporal immunity. No explicit thesis; the final image of her shadow leading her away reweights “patience” from passive to active force. Subtext resides in the ghost hum and the glass’s borrowed gold—kindness as phototaxis across eras. The refusal to moralize and the lingering ambiguity of “when the timelines finally healed” give the resonance staying power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught—“three lifetimes. Or was it four?”—and paid off in the flattened smoke cadence. Perceptual signature is potter-specific: sun patterns read in clay cracks, glaze settling on bisqueware. No dialogue; interior diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Metaphorical layering is dense, yet rhythm breathes—long sentences for shimmer, fragments for thrums—without drumbeat monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or knowledge. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges honey/gold motif. Metaphors stay coherent—smoke like spilled cream, silence like a cat’s purr—no mixed vehicle slips. Information density high: “glass thrummed yesterday, or perhaps tomorrow” compresses temporal fracture and emotional pull in one stroke.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: beekeeper solar calculus as temporal anchor is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken with lyric non-linear structure pays off in closure image. Specificity of “faded lantern glass pale green like memory” prevents generic substitution. Transformation test fails—plot could not survive with different objects; the hive geometry and phototropic glass are irreplaceable.</comment>
