<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s “gift” stays abstract—no embodied contradiction or micro-choice lets us feel it trip her up. The grandmother hand-sign memory is recalled, not dramatized, so the motive to “honor overlooked histories” is declared, not strained. Interiority drifts toward thesis (“Some things are too precious for museums”) instead of live tension. Still, her trembling fingers and the final pocketing of the map show a hierarchy of values with cost, earning a solid mid-8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira pockets the transformed painting, foreclosing the option to leave history sealed. Cost is felt—she will trespass beneath the lighthouse—but the causal chain skips the actual retrieval, so the “before/after” is legible yet not fully paid on-page. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the pentimento reveal is the single intensifier that reweights stakes. Pattern is legible, but the final beat lands more in future conditional than present consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The swaying rope bridges, indigo-stained hands, and mercury-silver spells are tactile and selective, never tourist-catalog. The painting-as-map object is micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy tightens under urgency: only the glint of crystalline light matters until Mira’s blade lifts paint. Environment and tool charge the closing image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—recover the fragment to return erased stories—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the palette-kife moment narrows options from observation to complicit theft. Cost is conceptual (she will trespass), but price stays prospective; no tangible loss on-page. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens yet not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: paintings as star-maps, hand-signs as living archive. No moralizing; the final image of fog-projected stories offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier pentimento. Subtext lives in silence—market crowd “oblivious” while Mira commits to theft. Complexity lingers: colonial erasure is wrong, yet Mira’s remedy is itself a kind of appropriation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature: Mira notices “spaces between languages” and “refractions carrying narratives.” Rhythm compresses at peak—“She accepted the knife”—then widens into future conditional. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no academic register drift. Filter verbs appear (“she noticed,” “she thought”) but are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence. Sentences often double-duty: “Each ghosted layer revealed the lighthouse at different moments in history” advances both image and plot. One mixed metaphor—“eternal instant stretched into something infinite”—is momentarily abstract yet recovers. Minor scaffold in “layer by layer” repetition, but it serves the pentimento motif and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Freshest synthesis: colonial erasure encoded in optics, star-maps that exist only in art, translator whose medium is paint-scraping. Risk-taking—lyric compression of twenty years into an “eternal instant”—heightens resonance without gimmickry. Could not swap the lighthouse lens for any generic MacGuffin; its optical logic is the plot engine. One small echo of “spaces between” feels prompt-close but is transformed by embodied gift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Setup in first paragraph; development when she chooses to scrape; closure when she pockets the map. Causal pressure: her gift lets her see the pentimento, directly enabling the theft. Cost is prospective trespass, still conceptual. Irreplaceable—no other skill could unlock paint-coded coordinates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Present in the first painting glimpse, re-weighted when revealed as projector, drives final image of fog-stories. Two beats: canvas inspection → pocketed map. Optical mechanics are core to plot; removing it collapses both discovery and future projection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Anchors of intuition guide every scraping stroke; narrative states she follows “anchors of intuition” as concrete tactic. Shapes middle choice to keep scraping rather than stop. Not just theme—actual method for locating fragment beneath constellation stone.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Trait named early; enables sight of crystalline glint. Yet “elusively tangible” remains descriptive rather than a constraint that costs her. No moment where the gift fails or over-delivers to force trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Action verb is literal: she unfastens paint layers to free the map. Single decisive turn that commits her to trespass. Could not substitute “peel” or “lift” without losing the liberation metaphor central to theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Method taught early in Valdric stall; mechanics matter—each scrape reveals older light-patterns. Drives two beats: initial discovery and coordinate extraction. Without hidden paint layers, no story.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric but largely ornamental; bridge sway adds texture yet never threatens or enables tactical change. Could be a ground-level market with minor edits. Still, height justifies eternal-instant tone and isolates Mira’s act.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</question><comment>Childhood memory primes hand-sign knowledge; present action compressed into single eternal instant. Timeframe is tracked via pentimento layers rather than clock, so no live countdown alters tactics. Functions as memory contrast, not pressure engine.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Motive articulated in first and last paragraphs; friction appears when she commits to theft in order to honor histories. Tension between legal safety and moral duty is implicit. Could swap “honor” for “preserve” with only soft edit, so not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>“Eternal instant” is seeded in middle, reprised at end when fog will project stories. Tone modulates from nostalgic childhood memory to crystallized recognition. Charged poise at closure relies on this temporal suspension. Removing it would flatten lyric compression.</comment>
