<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kira’s perpetual surprise is named repeatedly but never shown as an embodied contradiction; her interiority stays safe and diagnostic (“made her gasp—again,” “breath caught”). The climactic shift to “perpetual wonder” is asserted, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs her anything. The pilgrim functions as oracle, denying Kira a relational crucible that would force visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the tonal pattern reweights belonging—yet the cost is purely cosmic, not personal: Kira sacrifices nothing, risks nothing. Causal chain is soft: the pilgrim simply produces the exact chip needed, and Kira’s drone happens to possess the one imaging mode that reveals the hidden chambers. Orientation is clear by word 80; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural pattern-break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Limestone, drone optics, and socket tolerances are tactile and POV-filtered; the thermal star-trails dynamically guide the final pulls. Observatory-as-body constrains movement and supplies the only path to completion. Micro-setting (matrix socket) literally shapes the climactic action. No spatial drift; bodies and tiles track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“decode the frequency of belonging”—stay abstract; no concrete price (time, social credit, bodily risk) is risked or lost. Escalation is a smooth accumulation of chips, not a tightening that forecloses options. The final chord feels inevitable but not costly; pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of cosmic belonging emerges through the tonal floor rather than sermon, but the pilgrim’s overt gloss (“we belong…to the entire tapestry”) edges toward echo. Repricing at the end is earned by the image of star trails inside the dome, yet the absence of personal cost keeps resonance slightly cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Kira’s perceptual lens; drone optics filter description in character-specific ways. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that matches twilight’s slow fade. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s speech is external, readable only through gesture and dialogue. Voice never breaks register into editorial commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; occasional soft repeats (“perpetual surprise/wonder”) and one scaffold clause (“like movable type, each one a glyph”) slightly dull momentum. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, letting image carry the lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing movable-type astronomy with cosmic-consciousness resonance feels fresh; the star-map floor as playable instrument is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than causal twist—but the piece commits fully. Could swap names without breaking arc, yet the thermal-reveal mechanic is irreplaceable at climax.</comment>
