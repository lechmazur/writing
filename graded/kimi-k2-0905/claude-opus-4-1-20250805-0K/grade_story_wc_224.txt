<comment>The seer’s contradictory impulses—addiction to prophecy vs. ache for soil—live in her fingertips: she “navigates…by trailing her fingers along leather spines” and later kneels to “press the stone deep into the earth.” The mercury blindness and gardener past are not labels; they collide in the final renunciation of visions for planting, costing her the only future-seeing she has left. No other character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; interiority stays concrete, never sliding into therapy-speak. The only micro-drag is a slight over-explanation of “what she’d been searching for,” but the embodied cost of burying the stone keeps motivation earned.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sense-memory (rain-smell, soil-ache) layers density until the skylight chamber breaks pattern, reweighting stakes from seeing to growing. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“mercury-glass seer lived deep within the mountain’s hollow chambers”). Closure—planting the stone, mercury stilled—lands as Conceptual Repricing: futures are no longer watched but cultivated, cost legible in “she didn’t seek visions of tomorrow.” No causality breaks; every beat is textured accumulation that culminates in the garden shift.</comment>

<comment>The mountain bookstore is not backdrop but tool: book-spines she reads by touch, soil-floor that finally accepts the stone, skylight that delivers starlight she hasn’t “seen in decades.” Micro-setting (the stone’s feather-soft surface) literally guides her down unmapped passages and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—fingers, soil, skylight track without drift. The environment constrains the final choice: only the dark earth chamber can receive the seeds of language, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover buried talent vs. addiction to prophecy—tightens through sensory intensification rather than external opposition. The stone’s warmth and soil-sensations escalate pressure under Accumulative lens, forcing the decisive renunciation of mercury visions. Cost is visible: she forfeits her only means of future-seeing the moment she “press[es] the stone deep into the earth.” No reversal, but the single deepening suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete return of gardener muscle-memory: “the particular ache of kneeling in fresh-turned earth” vs. silver blindness. The garden that blooms “words…that helped visitors remember” is the non-literal answer to the unstated question of how to heal prophecy’s forgetting. No overt moral—just the reweighted premise that home is not a place but a recovered talent. Thematic echo of “buried talents” is spoken once, early, and then embodied, avoiding final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to the seer’s fingertip perception; no head-hop. Diction—“silver-blind,” “book-lined walls that rose into darkness”—is sensuous and specific to her synesthesia. Rhythm mirrors pressure: long, liquid sentences for mercury visions; clipped parataxis when she kneels. The only dialogue is her single whisper, keeping voice pure. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is tactile, not abstract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances layer or image. Figurative language is sparse and organic—“hidden thunder rolled…that quiet rumble of recognition”—never cluttering peak beats. Information density high: one sentence can convey blindness, navigation method, and emotional displacement. Opening line anchors voice and premise; final line—“she had learned to read the future in mercury, but here she grew it from seeds”—resolves by image that recharges prior motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: prophetic blind seer who literally plants language seeds inside a mountain library. Gardener-oracle fusion feels inevitable yet unexampled; transformation test fails if talent is swapped out. Risk—quiet lyric closure instead of set-piece showdown—pays off by making “reading the future” tactile agriculture. No recognizable trope echo; specificity of mercury vs. soil anchors originality.</comment>
