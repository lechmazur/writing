<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied interiority is precise: the tremor read as “memory approaching,” palms hot with anger, cedar bark as stillness-anchor. Contradictory impulses—panic vs. intentional freeze—are dramatized in real time, not summarized. Micro-choice to transplant the sapling crystallizes her hierarchy: growth over grief, with dirt under nails as visible cost. Flaw (quiet talent) directly shapes the pruning action; no diagnostic clichés.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each tactile beat (pruning, photo-smooth, sapling re-potted) layers density until the final image of “dirt still dark beneath her fingernails” reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise: options (revenge/despair vs. tending) are made legible, cost felt in the same dirt that will stay under skin. No orientation drift; lighthouse/arboretum anchors planted by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the shift from “they could destroy” to “she would continue planting” lands the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting—cedar trunk, crumpled photo edge, jade cutting—functions as tactile geography that constrains every choice. Salt wind and automated beacon integrate into the final sweep of light, charging the ending image. Sensory hierarchy obeys trauma-narrowed attention: visual field shrinks to charred faces, then expands to decades-long plant succession. Tool-as-setting (pruners, soil bag) alters tactics in-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep grieving or keep planting—tightens when each dead branch she prunes mirrors the “row of bodies.” Visible price: Panic tremor yielded to stillness, then to deliberate propagation; the cost is the irreversible knowledge that violence will recur. Escalation is textural: each new plant she pots raises the ante of return after next strike. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from organic reversal: life’s indifference to human tragedy becomes her refuge, not insult. Final line “Both facts existed simultaneously, without resolution” offers non-literal answer—no moral, only rhythm larger than grief. Subtext in the jade’s “quiet multiplication” reframes optimism as insurgent biology, not ideology. Photo’s half-smile reweights from wound to warrant for tending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; no filter-verb bloat. Perceptual signature—botanist-precision in “rosemary bush…exactly where to curve toward light”—anchors POV. Rhythm modulates: long sentence of white / white / white phosphorus mimics breathless shock; shorter declaratives at end mimic steadied pulse. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence propulsion: information-dense lines (“Mediterranean natives alongside hardy immigrants”) do world-building while hand moves. Zero scaffold; no paraphrase loops. Metaphor string—drone/wasps, compass/magnetic—stays coherent and brief. Final clause “dirt still dark beneath her fingernails” is irreducible image that lands closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drone-strike grief botanically metabolized through clifftop succession ecology. Risk in making plant-empathy literal pays off because trait is embodied, not magical. Lighthouse automation as metaphor for guidance without humans feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific regional flora and 3-year keeper abandonment timestamp the world.</comment>
