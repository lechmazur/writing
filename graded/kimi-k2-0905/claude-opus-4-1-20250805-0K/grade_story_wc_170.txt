<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s grief and hope are embodied in every brush-stroke; the “borrowed heartbeat” is never abstract. Interiority stays concrete—“doubled and strange” beats felt in her own chest—so motivation remains legible. No secondary character on scene, so relationship crucible waived; her stance crystallizes when she lays the brush down, cost visible in trembling fingers. Micro-choices (faster brushwork, last spiral) map her value hierarchy cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each painted layer and echoed lullaby thickens possibility until the sparrow’s song reweights reality. Closure is a Charged Poise—doors “invisible” but now legible, cost felt in the hush before bells. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the jammed bell tower she painted yesterday shapes the final quiet that lets Sophia answer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism parapet and echoing terrace are not backdrop; they supply the literal surface that refracts light into dream-maps, constraining how Maya can paint “possibilities.” Rain-left rainbow fragments return in the sparrow’s damp feathers, recharging the setting at closure. Sensory hierarchy filters through painter’s eye—cerulean load, indigo depths—so detail never stalls momentum. Micro-setting (easel, brush, droplets) is handled, not catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mother re-opening dream-path to comatose daughter—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: bells stay silent because she painted that possibility, forcing the final hush that lets Sophia respond. Cost is felt time-pressure—city waking, canvas unfinished—and conceptual—if mirrors can refuse to reflect, reality itself is negotiable. Agency remains hers; coincidence (sparrow) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repeated refraction motif—light, song, heartbeat—rather than statement. Final image of “mirrors taught to dream” reweights premise without moralizing. Ambiguity tolerated: we never learn if Sophia wakes, but the reconfiguration of what counts as real is undeniable. Subtext lives in lullaby code and sparrow song, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays tight inside Maya’s perceptual filter—“rainbow fragments trapped,” “dusky harmony”—so voice remains singular. Patterned elision (painted bells, painted doors) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm accelerates with paragraph breaks mirroring faster brushwork, then stills on final line. No dialogue, so no contamination risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high but purposeful—each figuration (prism, echo, mirror) returns as material cause. No mixed vehicles; “rainbow mist” stays consistent with prior rain-soaked parapet. Scaffolding nearly absent; one near-loop “painted…painting” is voice-motivated. Closure line “mirrors she’d taught to dream” lands clean, no clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: painter who treats optics as spellcraft, heart-transplant as radio receiver, lullabies as router packets—yet all feels inevitable. Premise risks sentimentality but escapes via concrete specificity (cerulean load, sparrow feather). Risk taken in letting coincidence (sparrow singing lullaby) be the answer; groundwork in “reality as one arrangement” justifies it. Removing any refracting surface breaks the logic.</comment>
