<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s guilt and need to atone are embodied in her shaky inhalation of the perfume; the micro-choice to collaborate rather than expel cleanly reverses her prior stance and costs her professional identity. Marcus/Elisabetta registers as one fused, morally ambiguous agent whose composed duality pressures Vera without degenerating into polite ghost cliché. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, bergamot and sawdust carry the emotional freight. The earned renunciation—writing a slanted column that confesses complicity—caps the arc with visible social cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Vera’s apology transmutes from private utterance to public column, reframing her whole exorcist ethos. Causal chain holds: because she once ripped Elisabetta out, the orchard’s looming erasure now forces collaborative completion; each falling tree tightens the deadline beat by beat. Orientation is nailed within 60 words; no prop or spatial drift. The lens is causal throughout; no ellipsis breaks the because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The archive’s paper-dust and rose-oil air supply the only “current” that allows spirit collaboration; this micro-setting literally enables the plot. Spatial choreography is flawless: perfume bottle, sheet piles, and distant chainsaws remain trackable. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s journalist nose and Elisabetta’s composer ear. Final image—empty corked bottle—crystallizes both orchard loss and spirit departure, charging the requiem’s completion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Vera repair the spiritual rupture she caused before the orchard—and the tether—is gone. Escalation is linear and causal: each tree felled = one step closer to irreversible erasure, forcing faster composition. Agency is hers: she chooses to inhale the perfume, transcribe, and finally out herself in print. Cost is legible—her authority as “exorcist” is forfeited in tomorrow’s column.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from tangible particulars: perfume as communion, orchard as sacrificial ground. No moral sermon—just the bitter knowledge that some roots need damage to open. Subtext hums in silence: Marcus’s steady hum versus Vera’s scraped apology says more than any manifesto. Final slanted column image reweights the premise without stating a thesis, inviting reader to infer that exorcism can be an act of violence rather than rescue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Vera’s perceptual bias: she clocks details through journalist metaphors (“Think of it like a dance”). Diction stays within her lexicon; no sudden graduate-seminar uplift. Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during tree-fall, longer melodic lines during transcription. No head-hopping; Elisabetta’s voice arrives only via Marcus’s throat, maintaining distance control. Dialogue carries subtext: “Apologies are just words floating in air” both refuses and demands action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or motive. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “perfume that glowed faintly green” telescopes magic without excess. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line resolves by image (“empty corked bottle”) that recharges earlier motifs. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: staccato during saw-crack, legato during melody transcription. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: exorcist as gossip columnist + haunted perfume as collaborative interface + orchard requiem timed to chainsaw countdown. Risk of sentimentality is averted by sawdust realism and journalistic self-exposure. Transformation test fails if relocated: the specific urban-ghost trope is re-rooted in 1920s composer granny and parking-lot politics. Final reconfiguration—apology delivered as sheet music—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Bold structural choice to let ghost finish piece before extinction heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
