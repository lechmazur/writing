<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is textured and embodied; her prosopagnosia is never labeled, only lived through fingertip “reading” of faces and the coin. Micro-choices—salvaging mirrors, aligning moonbeams—externalize her drive and evolve under time pressure. The final acceptance of the coin gifts her a persistent constraint (she will carry the library’s “face” forward) with visible cost: she walks away at sunrise knowing the oak will fall. Only a slight over-calm in the last paragraph keeps this from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the portrait exists now in light-pattern and memory, the library’s face secured inside her. The “because/therefore” chain—coin discovery → spiral light-map → acceptance of guardianship—tightens once yet decisively. Time anchor (4:47 AM) and spatial anchors (hollow trunk, mirrored moonbeams) are locked early; no orientation debt. Cost is felt in the final sentence: she carries the sky inside her walls while the external tree is erased.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library-as-body is rendered through touch, scent, and acoustic memory; every shelf-groove and ladder-scar constrains Lyra’s finger-portrait method. Mirrors and coin operate as micro-setting objects whose physical placement alters the final image. The “mirror the sky inside walls” charter is not decoration—it motivates the light-craft and is recharged when the guild walks through the living projection. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies track cleanly around the hollow, ladders, and projected beams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“create a final portrait that preserves identity”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and narrows to “will the portrait survive the saw?” The tightening beat is the coin discovery: it switches her medium from tactile to light-craft, foreclosing erasure. Cost is visible: she forfeits sleep, the tree forfeits life, she forfeits visual memory forever. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, perfectly legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as continuity beyond sight: identity stored in layered touch, metal, light. The coin’s spiral of carved faces reweights the library from “books” to “human stratification,” a conceptual repricing paid off when Lyra becomes the next layer. No explicit thesis; the final image of her pocketing the coin while carrying “the sky inside her own walls” answers the thematic question wordlessly. Subtext of stewardship vs. demolition lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, synesthetic, and rhythmically controlled (“fractally precise detail,” “mirror the sky inside walls”). Lyra’s perceptual signature—reading faces like braille—remains consistent; no filter-verb drift. Compression such as “whispered debates, turning pages, the scratch of quills” telescopes centuries without breaking immediacy. Only one clause drifts toward lit-speak (“crystalline clarity”), but it’s earned by the hush device.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“fractally precise” returns in closure), never stacked. Opening line anchors stakes and clock; final line recharges “sky inside walls” motif. High information density: “green with verdigris” does double duty as color and corrosion cue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses prosopagnosia + dendro-library + light-portrait in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmicked. The coin-map of predecessor faces is a fresh inflection on ancestral memory. Risk—quiet lyric ending instead of demolition spectacle—pays off by making absence the final image. Transformation test fails if Lyra is swapped out; her blindness is integral to the method and meaning.</comment>
