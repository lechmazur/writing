<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kessa’s vocation and exile-backstory give her a sharp, specific lens; her micro-choices (turning the valve, re-ordering fragments) embody the need to “read absence.” Interiority stays concrete, but the piece leans on summary rather than in-scene contradiction under pressure, so the final “mechanical sigh” feels earned yet not viscerally costly. Secondary characters are off-page or functional, so relationship crucible is N/A. No motivational breaks, but depth plateaus just below high-band tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valve’s whisper reweights exile from wound to grammar, cost legible in “sum of presence and absence.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of cataloguing light/ink/water-marks tightens meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is swift; no prop or knowledge teleporting. One minor scaffold: “staggered intervals” is declared twice without on-page calibration. Otherwise structure is taut, transitions legible, final image reconfigures stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salt-crystal towers, rain-washed windows, and the seized valve create a tactile micro-setting that constrains action: the corroded valve literally limits announcement, shaping Kessa’s archival ritual. Sensory hierarchy mirrors her cataloguer’s gaze—light angles reveal hidden ink, never touristic excess. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Weather and salt accretion evolve with story time. Setting could edge into 9+ if one environmental detail forced a costlier choice on her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning fragments into communal meaning—surfaces early; pressure escalates through accumulating donations and Kessa’s mounting curatorial responsibility. No external antagonist; tension is textural: each new fragment risks overwhelming pattern. The valve’s ghost-click marks the single tightening beat, signalling acceptance of incomplete restoration. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, sufficient for 600-word scale but not foregrounded enough for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “absence as grammar” emerges inductively via cataloguing praxis; no thesis statements. Subtext lives in silent valve, blank ledger pages, torn poem—objects speak loss without naming it. Final reconfiguration reframes exile as ongoing composition, resisting moral. One tiny echo: Kessa’s “compile fragments into meaning” skirts prompt-echo, but context absorbs it. Complexity and ambiguity linger cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Kessa’s perceptual signature—salt, paper, light—syntax calm and cataloguing. No head-hops; psychic distance stable. Prose rhythm modulates: longer accumulative sentences for archive growth, short percussive bursts for valve turns. Dialogue is minimal, natural, sub-textual. No filter-verb stacks; diction precise yet unshowy. Distinctive without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High information density—each image does double archival and emotional work. Mixed metaphors absent; “ocean spray” recurs but accretes meaning. One paraphrase loop: “collision and retreat” / “sing its particular song” adjacent—minor. Otherwise clean, propulsive, read-aloud ready. Proofing perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise flips standard return narrative: archivist of spray patterns reassembles community via negative space. Valve-as-ghost-telegraph feels fresh, never gimmick. Specificity of salt-stained documents and light-reveal timings grounds abstraction. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant final image. Not quite 9+ because core arc—collecting fragments to heal collective memory—has familiar bones beneath innovative skin.</comment>
