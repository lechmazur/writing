<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—her need to keep carving yet surrender to the storm’s time-fold—is embodied in the warmth of the slide and the micro-choices of each cut. The “wood remembers” refrain and the blade’s grain-following motion dramatize her perpetual learning trait so it costs her the chance to leave early. Earned Stasis arrives when she tucks the sculpture and the van’s engine turns over without the GPS: she accepts an unmapped life, price visible in the rear-view mirror of the arch. Hairline slip: the final line’s “reimagined by the storm” drifts toward diagnostic self-label; still, the contradiction holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the archway’s turbine-hum becomes her compass, reconfiguring freedom as unmapped attention with felt cost—she drives away from certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each temporal layer (shipwright, stonecutter, future potter) densifies the stake until the spiral sculpture crystallizes the pattern. The GPS resurrection is no cheap fix; it frames the choice to refuse its directions. Causality intact: the slide warms → she sees → she carves → she renounces maps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archway’s limestone throat, the van’s metal drum, and the storm’s turbine-hum constrain every cut; the sculpture’s spiral is literally carved under that acoustic roof. Driftwood’s tactile memory replaces generic seaside postcard with palpable grain. Future shards are anchored in present sensory cues—slide warmth, rain shift—so setting evolves rather than repeats. Micro-setting triumph: the dashboard groove where the slide rests becomes the decision altar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to timeless creative alliance—tightens when the slide’s glow forces her to carve or retreat. One meaningful deepening: the lantern’s projection of future seekers forecloses isolation as an option; she must gift the sculpture outward. Cost is the relinquished GPS certainty, legible in the engine’s first unmapped acceleration. No reversal, but the pattern’s intensification meets Accumulative/Textural escalation test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral’s double helix of destruction/creation rather than overt statement. The lantern’s final unlit projection on the windshield reweights the premise: legacy is not fame but anonymous relay. No moralizing; the turbine-hum tonally sustains meditative awe while the storm’s retreat offers quiet catharsis. Subtextual punch: the GPS reboot is the world offering old logic back—she refuses, a conceptual cost made resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—storm-lit translucent colors, grain-guided fingertips—remains character-locked throughout. No head-hopping; even the temporal apparitions are filtered through Marina’s carving rhythm. Diction stays within a maker’s lexicon: “grain,” “cut,”“spiral,” never academic. Compression taught early (“wood remembers” as mantra) pays off in final line when the hum becomes compass.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm syncs to storm gusts: long sentence for turbine-hum, fragment for cut. No loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors (wave/wind/woman spiral) stay coherent to carved form. Minor scaffold: “she felt the presence of those other artists” could lose “the presence of” without loss—still, artifact does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: GPS failure + magic lantern slide + driftwood carving = 21st-century parable of pre-digital navigation. Risk—time-collapsing archway—pays off because the spiral sculpture makes the alliance physical, not hallucinatory. Specific detail (brass frame warming against skin) prevents allegory drift. Transformation test: swap driftwood for clay and the entire ethic of grain-guided patience collapses.</comment>
