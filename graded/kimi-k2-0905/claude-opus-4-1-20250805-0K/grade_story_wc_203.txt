<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt-driven vocation is vivid; his embodied reactions to the dead and the toolbox weight work. Internal contradiction—comfort with ghosts yet dread of their evidence—shows in how he handles the journals. The final micro-choice (winding the spring while lights stay off) crystallizes his new burden. Cost is felt, but the grandmother backstory is summarized, not dramatized, so motivation’s full pressure is slightly blunted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Marcus gathers proof, ghosts fade, and the decision to confront the city carries conceptual cost. Causal chain: broken elevator → sight → spring → ledgers → public revelation plan holds. Orientation anchored by line 3. The reflective block (’09 accident) is brief and cues present action, satisfying BRR. Grandmother’s ghost handing the spring is elliptical; tiny causality wobble keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust-maps, sequined costume catching non-existent light, and the mainspring’s warmth are highly specific. The ticket counter as micro-setting constrains the discovery beat. Ceiling cavity and journals tumble provide spatial coherence. Environment charges the final image when Marcus kills the fluorescent, embracing darkness that once hid the evidence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose deadly corruption—signals early and tightens when each journal appears. Protagonist agency drives every gain: he pries the board, climbs the counter, decides to contact reporters. Cost is knowledge-plus-guilt; options narrow from private obsession to public risk. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal, but deepening satisfies accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of complicity versus repair emerges through dust patterns and hidden spring, not lecture. Final image—honest darkness—reweights earlier “cracks between working and broken.” Moral complexity lingers: grandmother’s sabotage was illicit yet life-saving. No tidy moral, only charged stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual filter—mechanical singing, dust geometry. Prose rhythm mirrors hush and buzz of dying light. No dialogue, so voice carries idiom through tool-names and sensorium. Occasional elevated phrases (“crystallized final moment”) register as narrator insight rather than character, a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary fluidly; information dual-loads (e.g., “dust motes spiral through the last shaft of evening light” sets time + atmosphere). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay consistent. Opening and closing lines frame with sonic imagery. Near-perfect clarity, but one register bump—“conceptual repricing” concept itself feels academic for the POV—prevents 9.0.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost-seeing repairman chasing elevator failures is fresh; coupling it with grandmother’s sabotage timer deepens ingenuity. Specificity of circus ticket booth, sequined ghost accountant, dust-map forensics makes premise memorable. Risk of multiple ghosts handled cleanly. Could swap city for another, but circus+elevator+corruption fusion feels non-obvious.</comment>
