<comment>Edmund's contradictory drives—stoic duty vs. tender preservation—are embodied in the inkwell ritual and the knee-deep wade; the final sealing of his grandmother's bottle crystallizes a renunciation that costs him official sanction. Interiority stays concrete ("weight of witnessed absence") and avoids label-speak. Only flaw: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A and cannot elevate to 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensual layer (barnacled walls, chandelier inches above water) tightens the stake of memory-loss until the hidden bottle becomes the decisive preservation act. Closure is a Charged Poise—options narrow to solitary secrecy, cost is the condemned pavilion plus his own exile from official narrative. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Lacks a persistent external constraint that would push to 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The pavilion-as-micro-setting constrains every step: water height dictates satchel lift, chandelier level times the ink-dip, cornerstone gap shapes the bottle placement. Sensory selectivity filters through surveyor habit—"angle of subsidence" not "pretty crystals." Final image of ripples refracting through broken glass recharges the opening "half-drowned" vista. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue stories from erasure—tightens via each surveyed detail until the bottle act forecloses public testimony. Agency is accumulative: note-placing ritual deepens until final cement seals both pavilion fate and his own silence; cost is legible (condemnation tomorrow, solitary archive). No external antagonist, but water pressure suffices. Missing a second tightening beat that would force trade-off → holds at 8.3.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: what survives is what is hidden, not what is declared. Subtext resides in gesture—cement smear over bottle mouth speaks louder than any thesis. Final image of ripples refracting light offers conceptual repricing: preservation equals abandonment to secrecy. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains surveyor idiom—"interlaced absence," "angle of subsidence"—syntax stays clipped, metric like a field book. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as water rises. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on internal diction; succeeds. Perceptual signature consistent—he notices subsidence before splendor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: long sensory sentences in calm moments, staccato propulsion during cement sealing. High density—"barnacles crusted the lower walls and seaweed draped the doorways like funeral bunting" does three jobs (sight, metaphor, tone). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Minor register lift ("conceptual repricing") still within surveyor lexicon; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—surveyor-as-memory-undertaker—flips vocational expectation; inkwell-as-reliquary freshens the trope. Synthesis feels inevitable: bureaucratic tool becomes sacrament. Risk of quiet ending paid off by Charged Poise. No close echoes of famous scenes. Specificity of Victorian pavilion + shoreline protocol creates irreplaceable texture.</comment>
