<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is textured—“velveteen gloom,” root-system patience—but her one visible micro-choice is to let the chess clock stay silent; all other action is memory or tapestry reading. The final decision to plant the fragment is announced, not dramatized, so the cost is only conceptual. Traits align (night gardener, quilterly care), yet no contradictory impulse pressures her on-page. Earned endurance is present, but the path feels pre-set; the tapestry, not Marta, supplies the reversal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of grief-coded objects (roses, clock, tapestry) layering until meaning re-weights. Closure is a Charged Poise—Marta exits into starlit garden, options re-cast, silence of clock = visible cost. Orientation is secure (who/where/when inside 90 words). No causality break, yet escalation is mild: the tapestry reveal is the single intensification; no narrowing of live options occurs—she already gardens, she simply keeps gardening. Cost is felt but not paid in-scene; therefore capped below 9 band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt silo, midnight roses, starlight on shears: sensory selection is filtered through Marta’s professional eye for color and texture. The silo-as-shed constrains her ritual space; the open door frames the final star-pinned tableau, charging the closing image. Micro-setting (sovereign case, tapestry under lamp) functions as tactile environment that guides finger-work and decoding. One minor over-flowering: “velveteen gloom” and “softened death’s sharp edges” border on abstraction, but passages stay anchored to action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to transmute private grief into caretaking devotion. Tapestry discovery supplies one deepening, not escalation—knowledge widens, stakes stay flat. No reversal narrows her options; she begins and ends as night gardener. Cost is conceptual (clock silence), not tactical or emotional on-page. Pressure remains reflective; therefore capped below 8.2 required for 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as cyclical cultivation—emerges through vegetative imagery and the tapestry’s stitched memorials, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: she hums to the dead, prunes roots instead of memories. Final image of planting the fragment re-prices her work as collaborative with the anonymous weaver, a quiet conceptual repricing. Avoids sentimentality; however, thematic echo “shape of intentions” borders thesis in closing paragraph, preventing higher band.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Marta’s perceptual hierarchy—color shades, root tension, textile grain. Rhythm lengthens in calmer tapestry passages, compresses during needle-work; sentence variety supports emotional respiration. Diction maintains gardener-textile lexicon without register drift. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. One elision—“uncharted echoes”—is pattern-taught early and paid off at close; remains legible under accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; each paragraph advances pattern or stakes. Figurative layering is high but purposeful, reinforcing textile/garden motif; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided. Two micro-loops: “tender precision” echoed as “tender organization,” “velveteen gloom” repeated; minor, no clarity break. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with sonic snap. No scaffold, no filter-verb clutter; clarity survives peak lyricism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gardener-linguist decoding ancient fibre-code feels fresh; transforms familiar grave-tender trope into archival botanist. Sovereign-case-as-reliquary and chess-clock-as-liturgy are surprising object twists. Conceptual risk—lyric stasis over plot—mostly succeeds because closureimage crystallizes. Slight overlap with “memory quilt” and “tending graves” tropes keeps it from full originality spike.</comment>
