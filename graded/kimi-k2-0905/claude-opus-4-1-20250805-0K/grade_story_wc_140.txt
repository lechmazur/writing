<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mari’s contradictory impulse—clinging to erasure while hungering for witness—surfaces in every micro-choice: letting the false death stand, penciling “light enough to be mistaken for shadows,” signing a hybrid name. The final renunciation (joining the erased congregation) costs her the last scrap of legal self and is fully earned. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the absence of on-page opposition keeps this shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of layered annotations and tide-cycle returns tightens until the fresh-ink injunction reconfigures Mari’s solitary erasure into communal testimony. Closure—“she signed her mother’s name, then her own, then something in between”—pays the cost of permanent namelessness. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container maze functions as micro-setting: shifting walls force Mari to navigate by echo, dictate when she can safely enter 47-B, and supply the metal groan that harmonizes with the nameless chorus at closure. Tide rhythm tracks time and stakes; rust, salt, and dawn-light selectivity mirror internal corrosion and fleeting clarity. Spatial choreography clean across beats. Environment directly constrains final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mari remain alone in erasure or risk collective witness—tightens when she reads the wet ink injunction and must decide: add her trace or retreat. Signing forecloses any future claim to legal identity; cost is legible. Pressure escalates through accumulation of marginalia voices rather than causal reversals, coherent with chosen lens. One decisive turn meets scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges from concrete ritual: annotated newspapers, poison label, hybrid signature. Final image reweights premise—erasure becomes communal archive without moralizing. Subtext in “texture of memory” and steel groans invites reflection on what persists after data dies. Ambiguity lingers yet feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—“texture on objects, rough or smooth”—is character-specific and recurs under pressure. Syntax lengthens contemplatively then fractures during tide-turn, mirroring Mari’s dissolution. No head-hopping; diction stays within Mari’s plausible lexicon. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with tide. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“metal cliffs,” “grammar of erasure”—never clutters high-pressure beats. Information density high; each paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. Clean grammar and precise punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—bureaucratic death glitch as portal to living archive—feels fresh and fully committed to. Accretive annotations and tide-cycle structure risk gimmickry but pay off in resonant final image. Specificity of mislabeled prescription anchors surreal frame in verifiable detail. Transformation inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
