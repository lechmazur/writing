<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s Methodist-scientific skepticism is sketched early and steers his decision to photograph, not touch, the valve; the interior divide between curiosity and credulity is felt in micro-gestures (hand pausing, radio tuning). Yet the “weight of swallowed truth” is asserted more than embodied—no bodily cost or lasting handicap is dramatized—so the renunciation feels light. Secondary voices (callers) supply pressure but not relationship crucible; their guilt is atmospheric rather than interactive. Interior contradiction is present but not sharpened to a wound that lingers on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Marcus leaves the valve untouched, crystallizing the shift from collector to witness, with conceptual cost legible in the final image of “metal dust, like prayer.” Causal chain—radio testimonies → valve location → choice to document—holds under an Accumulative lens; each caller adds density that reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (who, where, when). Non-closure slips are minor: the “swallowed truth” metaphor is repeated without deepening, and the timeline of callers vs. tunnel descent could be tighter, but these do not touch the resonant exit image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel’s sweating brick, rusted junction box, and oxidized valve are tactile, selective, and filtered through Marcus’s explorer gaze. Radio static acts as a sonic extension of setting, tightening the space. The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its oxidized surface and rosary DNA charge the closing image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. Slight cap at 8.1 because environment could have pressed physically harder (air quality, claustrophobia) to raise stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the truth behind the accident—rounds into a moral choice: possess or witness. Escalation is textural: each caller thickens the communal guilt until the valve’s physical presence forces a decision. Agency is real but low-heat; Marcus’s micro-choice (photograph vs. remove) narrows options with symbolic, not bodily, cost. Tightening is singular; no second reversal. Sufficient for this length, but a sharper physical jeopardy or social consequence could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: collective guilt as industrial haunting, the ethics of witnessing vs. looting. Subtext lives in radio silences and the hush after confession. No moralizing line; final image of “metal dust, like prayer” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers—whether ghosts are real or radio-induced—inviting reflection without confusion. One minor echo: “swallowed truth” is thematic shorthand used twice; otherwise restraint is exemplary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s sensorium; perceptual signature is explorer-methodical—radio dial turns, brick sweat, valve oxidation—never sliding into omniscience. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under radio static, mirroring drowsy alertness. Dialogue (callers) carries regional taint and subtext of evasion. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly. Voice is distinctive enough to be memorable within the genre of urban-exploration noir.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with descent—long sentences for tunnel crawl, staccato for caller bursts. Information density is high; each radio fragment layers history without repeat. Metaphors are kept physically grounded (“metal tombstones,” “circulatory system”). Minor loop: “swallowed truth” appears twice with no new inflection; otherwise no scaffold or paraphrase. Copy-clean except one comma splice after “1982” that does not fog causality. Final line lands with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of urban-explore trope with talk-radio confessional feels fresh; valve-as-rosary is specific and memorable. Ghost-shift legend is familiar, but the radio-psychic conduit revitalizes it. Risk is moderate—quiet renunciation rather than spectacle—coherence high. No close echoes of iconic scenes. Could push bolder had the radio voices broken into real-time dialogue with Marcus, but originality within restraint is solid.</comment>
