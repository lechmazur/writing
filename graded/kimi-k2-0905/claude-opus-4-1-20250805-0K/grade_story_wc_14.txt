<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stationer’s quiet, meticulous ritual is vividly embodied; her aching fingers and reverent handling of lamp and notepad make the obsession tactile. Yet the interior contradiction—belief versus official denial—stays summary; we never feel her doubt or risk. The monk’s wordless tea offers a micro-choice of acceptance, but the cost of her “invented histories” remains conceptual rather than personal. Still, the specificity of her craft and the bodily toll earn a strong mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp switched off, the notepad warm, the town waking below—an earned stasis that forecloses nothing yet reweights everything. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each charted modulation layers density until dawn’s first light reframes the archive. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the final image crystallizes the stakes with visible cost (her fatigue, the silent monk’s recognition). No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: root-scars, lean-to-light, and dew-caught hum constrain how and what she can record. Fountain stones shaped as sleeping birds, unlit lanterns waiting for dawn—each detail is filtered through her cataloguing gaze and later refracts the lamp’s data. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we never lose her crouch, the moss, the monk’s distant silhouette. Environment, tool, and body converge in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering erased time—signals early and tightens through sensory micro-shifts: hum strengthens, temperature drops, dawn thins the boundary. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is epistemic and atmospheric. One meaningful deepening occurs when the monk appears, wordlessly validating her forbidden archive, narrowing her solitude into shared complicity. Cost is felt in cramped fingers and the weight of unspoken risk, though not yet personal consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as luminous protest against erasure. Gold-leaf margins, humming lamp, and bonsai scars recur not as symbols but as working parts of the argument. The final image—tea in silence while the town wakes—offers no moral, only the quiet reconfiguration that official silence has been breached. Subtext resides in gesture and refraction, never exposition.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to the stationer’s perceptual signature: every noticed detail is filtered through her taxonomic hunger. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens under strain (“She charted the sound’s refraction carefully”), mirroring attention. No head-hopping; the monk remains a watched presence, never interiorized. Distinct rhythmic control and diction within POV lexicon satisfy the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “water trickled over stones shaped like sleeping birds” does triple sensory work without clutter. One paraphrase loop—“the trees always knew” echoing “the trees knew better”—is minor enough to keep 9+ eligibility. No mixed metaphors or register drift; technical language (fluorescent refraction, electromagnetic patterns) stays accurate and motivated. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with temperature drop and dawn surge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The core conceit—archivist of erased time using a battery lamp’s hum—feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesizing eco-memory, monastic bonsai, and low-tech sci-fi sensing. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into gimmick, but every refraction is grounded in tactile procedure. Final image reweights the premise: silence officially unbroken, yet the archive now exists in gold-leafed pages. Specificity makes the invention non-transferable; swap any detail and the whole shatters.</comment>
