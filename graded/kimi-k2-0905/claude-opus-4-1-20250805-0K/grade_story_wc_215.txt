<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her “careful steps of someone who had learned that survival meant noticing everything while disturbing nothing” shows embodied habit—but the decisive turn (accepting custodianship of silence) is declared, not dramatized. The grandfather’s “tranquil perception” is stated repeatedly; we never see it complicate an on-page choice. No contradictory impulse is enacted in scene; the arc is a single, steady dawning. Still, the final renunciation carries a palpable cost—“luminous weight”—that justifies the stoic endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara lifts the warm box and embraces lifelong solitude as custodian of silence; the cost is the “luminous weight” she will carry. Causality holds: because the ghosts cannot touch the covenant, therefore Mara must. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3; no penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated ghost choreography and the warming glass rather than because/therefore chains. The final image crystallizes stakes under that lens with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<comment>The stained-glass box functions as micro-setting: it warms in shadow, constrains Mara to lift it, and recharges the ending image of “captured sunset.” Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—she notices bleached hive frames, translucent panes, the hum that isn’t bees. Spatial choreography is clean: ghosts circle, she steps between hives, box sits among rotting frames. Desert scorch and dawn light that “shouldn't exist” are economical, purposeful, and charge the final tableau.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserving the unspoken covenant’s weight—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: midnight ghosts → dawn fade → Mara’s recognition that she alone must bear the box. Under the Accumulative lens, the warming glass and intensifying ghost gestures reweight the stake; cost is the lifelong sentence of “mute eloquence.” Agency is renunciation rather than action; the price is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the refrain of silence: covenant failed not by words but by withheld ones. The stained glass box reprises as “captured sunset,” reweighting past photographs into future burden. No explicit thesis is stated; subtext lives in gesture—ghosts who cannot lift, woman who can. The final image answers the central question wordlessly: preserved silence will outlast both bees and keepers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mara’s perceptual bias—“white boxes bleached by decades of desert sun,” “hum that shouldn’t exist.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure: “She lifted the box carefully.” No head-hopping; ghost interiority is projected only through gesture she decodes. Register remains within a solitary oasis dweller’s lexicon; no academic drift. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences yield to terse final cadence that mirrors acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense—“broken teeth,” “captured sunset,” “honey in abandoned combs.” No synonym loops or template cadence. Figurative language is spare; when it appears (glass like captured sunset) it charges closure. Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraph cuts coincide with tactical shifts. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the covenant motif. Zero scaffolding artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper ghost-museum is fresh, yet grounded in specific generational detail and tactile objects. The covenant as living silence, not legal MacGuffin, re-infuses familiar eco-collapse with moral complexity. Stained-glass box as portable reliquary of unsent letters feels inevitable, never contrived. Risk—quiet lyric ending—pays off via Charged Poise that reweights all prior gestures.</comment>
