<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is specific and embodied—humming as a lie-detector tic, the seashell against her ear—and her shift from debunker to co-creator is legible. Claudia’s entrance supplies external pressure, yet her own motives remain a touch schematic; the father-daughter grief is told more than dramatized. Overall, credible emotional stakes and a visible renunciation (joining the unfinished instrument) earn the arc, but the slight over-reliance on Claudia’s exposition keeps the change shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory becomes a living archive of regret, Marina’s participation costs her professional detachment, and the final image (“waves…keeping time”) reweights the premise. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each resonance layer deepens emotional density rather than forcing external reversals. The orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. The cost is felt rather than declared, satisfying the 9- gate although not quite transcendent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The copper-domed observatory, salt-sprayed cliff, and half-carved cello body function as micro-setting—every tactile detail (dust motes, rusted stairs, sympathetic string vibration) constrains or enables the sound experiment. Salt-green corrosion mirrors emotional decay; the unfinished sound-hole literally shapes where the shell must be placed. Environment and tool together charge the final image; no static tourism. Enough specificity to flirt with the 9-band, but one fewer sensory echo would have left space for the reader’s own vibration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can regret be given acoustic form?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Marina’s empirical filter collapses when the cello answers the shell, foreclosing her exit strategy. The tightening is single but decisive, and the cost (she stays to finish the instrument) is legible. Meets the 7.2+ threshold yet lacks a second, higher-octane trade-off that would push into 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the human need to rehearse unsaid words is dramatized through acoustic physics rather than thesis. The final image of waves “keeping time” for mental rewrites offers Conceptual Repricing—reader reweights every prior echo. No overt moralizing; the bitterness of unfinished grief stays palpable. A hairline slip into interpretive signage (“the myth wasn’t about time travel…”) docks a tenth, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited stays glued to Marina; perceptual signature—astronomical metaphors, “myth buster” diction—remains consistent. Syntax breathes with pressure: short clauses when she plucks the cello, longer tidal sentences at close. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat. Voice modulation is present but not showy; distinctiveness lies in the scientific-melancholic idiom rather than pyrotechnics, landing safely above the 8.0 gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, strong verbs (“perched,” “froze,” “rusted”). Information density high—each sentence layers setting, character, or concept. Occasional lushness (“papers rustled…like dying moths”) risks purple but stays tied to emotional temperature. Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines bookend with cadenced certainty. No artifact touches the closure beat; qualifies for the high band but lacks the last measure of compression that would lift to 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “acoustic regret compass” is a fresh synthesis of ghost-frequency lore and DIY lutherie; trope of haunted observatory is retooled into emotional sonar. Risk is taken—scientist turned co-author of an unfinished séance-cello—yet coherence never frays. Specificity of the painted-shell star-map and salt-rotted dome roots the concept. Not quite a 9 because the core insight (unfinished conversations = constellations) is telegraphed rather than discovered through surprise, but still a memorable inflection.</comment>
