<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—blind seer, cartographer of the unseeable—anchors every beat; her embodied diction (“Portuguese flooded through her skin”) fuses trait to action. The ring’s warming spin and her barefoot soil-reading show micro-choices that tighten stakes. Cost is legible: she forfeits outer sight for inner maps, paid in the final stillpoint where she “became the destination.” No secondary character appears; pressure is self-forged and credible. Minor therapy-speak (“source of all maps”) keeps it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring’s stillness inside her signals a new mapping power with conceptual cost (she will guide others through grief). Accumulative/Textural lens—languages layering into silence—holds from first line to last. Orientation anchored by ~70 words via tactile bark and humming ring. The final image reweights prior motif (ring, languages, stillpoint) without causal zig-zag, satisfying the cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is lived-in: bark under fingernails, soil whispering directions, ring vibration against bone. Micro-setting (ring) charges closure; forest silence constrains her final stance. Sensory economy skips visual junk, favors bone-resonant diction. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no physics drift. Weather absent but irrelevant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the stillpoint to master emotional cartography—signals early. Escalation via accumulating languages; each tree tightens the sonic net, foreclosing retreat. Agency: she chooses to “become the destination,” paying lifelong solitude as guide. Cost is felt but not dramatized in a tangible loss (tool, limb, relationship); holds it below 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recursion: maps as living tissue, blindness as deeper sight. Subtext in ring’s ancestral weight and forest silence avoids thesis. Final image of her “quiet blaze” reconfigures premise without moralizing. One hairline platitude—“every uncharted emotional depth”—but otherwise earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, bone-deep: “languages… like warm honey,” “sonic architecture.” Rhythm modulates—long lyrical clauses slow to final crystalline sentence. Compression taught early (“Portuguese flooded through her skin”) and paid off in last-line stillness. No dialogue; no POV drift. Lexicon stays within blind cartographer’s diction, never academic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence pulses: opening spondaic bark-press, closing monosyllabic stillness. Metaphors are coherent (honey, compass, blaze) and tied to character. No synonym loops; “languages” repeats only with accruing weight. One filter-verb cluster (“she realized it wasn’t leading her somewhere”) in low-pressure beat. Closure line is clean, image-driven.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses blind cartography + ultrasonic forest + language osmosis into a fresh emotional geography. Risk—lyric accumulation without plot zig-zag—justified by resonant payoff. Particulars (ring vibration, bark fingertip reading) prevent trope drift. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick.</comment>
