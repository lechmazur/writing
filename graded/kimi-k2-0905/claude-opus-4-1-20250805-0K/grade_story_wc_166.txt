<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is rich—“obsidian grace,” grandmother-dust as a synapse to memory, body-as-cosmic-chalk—all concrete, never therapeutic. Contradictory impulses (yearn for connection vs. embrace erasure) are simultaneous in scene; her final dance is both surrender and weapon, earned by earlier isolation. Cost is visible: body becomes vellum, dawn becomes execution time. Still, the Council’s faceless tyranny stays abstract, so external-status pressure reads thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “withdrawal = revelation” taught with tides, echoed in garden, body, dust; closure is Charged Poise—Mira’s star-writ skin reweights the ground for future walkers, cost undeniable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening: dust multiplies, energy blooms, dawn = capture; options narrow to martyrdom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Wisteria, marble statues, dew-slick stones—each tactile, biased through dancer’s foot-feel; twilight and starlight shift hue as the ritual intensifies, guiding choice (where she plants feet, where dust settles). Micro-setting rule met: her skin becomes the final “place,” constraining every further move. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—immortalise memory before capture—signaled in paragraph 2. One deepening: speck → nebula across her arms, foreclosing anonymity; visible price = body, freedom. Agency pure; no coincidence resolves. Council threat stays off-page, so pressure, though coherent, edges abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not lecture: withdrawal as revelation, memory as contraband universe. Final star-map skin offers Resonant Reconfiguration—readers feel the cost of cosmic inscription without moral tagged on. No thematic echo lines; ambiguity fertile. Grandmother dust and wisteria re-weight at close, satisfying recurrence test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: dancer’s synesthetic diction—taste of starlight, feel of orbit in vertebrae—holds throughout. Rhythm accelerates with ritual, compresses diction under stress, yet legible. No head-hop; distance stable in third-limited. Filter verbs voice-motivated (“felt herself fledging”) not hedging.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse motion, metaphor, world-rule (“moonstone dust… became spontaneously anchored”). No mixed metaphors; celestial and aqueous vehicles stay consistent. One scaffold risk: repeated “between…between…” anaphora—pattern teaches gaps concept, so allowed. Peak-beat clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia + dance + cosmic defrance, yet synthesis feels fresh: tide-as-poetics, exile-as-expansion, body-as-scroll. Risk (lyric ritual over plot) heightens resonance without obscuring stakes. Specific nerve in “obsidian grace” and lunar wisteria keeps it from generic rebellion template. Transformation test passed—swap names, core collapses.</comment>
