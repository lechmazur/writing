<comment>Marcus’ claustrophobia is embodied early (“already clawing at his chest”) and governs micro-choices (memorising escape routes, breathing control). The interior contradiction—fear yet deliberate descent—stays active, and the final ascent is credibly powered by his reframed relationship to enclosed space. No second character on-page, so relationship/status bullets N/A. Cost is felt: the “two compass points” he pockets signal a literalised, paid-for shift in identity.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Situational—pressure forces stance crystallisation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s understanding of space re-orients with conceptual cost (“even they could be moved”). Orientation clean by line 3; single-scene default met. One meaningful tightening when music collapses corridors into a spherical nexus; final image reweights earlier motifs. Persistent price: the knowledge that space is mutable now lives in his pockets—visible, portable, dangerous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Anchor established in first paragraph: open sky, blueprint, drafting compass. Micro-setting (the compass) and macro (star-wheeled night, “geometric wound” entrance) constrain choice and charge closure. Sensory hierarchy obeys Marcus’s cartographer eye—angles, starlight, stone—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: descent/ascent track cleanly; impossible geometry signalled through perceptual strain, not contradiction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: map or be consumed by mutable space. Pressure tightens from surface anxiety → corridor shift → spherical nexus where up/down vanish; each stage shrinks tactical options. Agency remains Marcus’s: he chooses to follow the organ coordinates and to pocket the twin compass. Cost is conceptual but legible—he exits carrying the heresy that space can be bent, foreclosing a return to ordinary perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: cartographic rebellion against divine fixity. Subtext loaded into objects—compass, blueprint, organ—never stated. Final image of movable stars reconfigures premise without sermon. Wistful note persists: “lonely anthem for all who dared to map new worlds” lets rebellion keep its melancholy cost, resisting tidy moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Marcus’s perceptual signature: geometric metaphors, precision verbs (“traced,” “marked,” “calculating”). Rhythm tightens under stress—short clauses mimic constricted breathing. No dialogue, hence dialogue bullets N/A. Diction stays within a scholarly explorer’s lexicon; no register drift. Prose itself performs spatial compression in the nexus paragraph, mirroring theme.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythms vary naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information-dense lines (“encoding rebellion in architecture”) advance both world and character. Mixed metaphors avoided; celestial/stone imagery stays coherent. Only minor scaffold: “the music wasn’t coming from above or below, but from between” reads as purposeful pattern, not artifact. Closure beat free of figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: claustrophobia + cartographic heresy + organ as GPS. Premise reframes familiar Gothic descent into spatial epistemology. The mutable corridor that “hurts to perceive” is a specific, non-portable image. Risk—treating horror-complex geometry as romantic revelation—pays off by making the cosmic feel intimate. Transformation test failed: story collapses without these exact compasses and angles.</comment>
