<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya’s “serene therapist” persona is established through her ritualized music-making, but interiority stays at a lyric remove; we see calm hands and decisive kindness yet no rupture that would let us feel the fracture she claims in the mirror moment. The terminal prognosis, the single motive engine, is declared rather than dramatized, so her final renunciation reads graceful but externally smooth rather than torn from contradictory impulses. Because no micro-choice visibly costs her a live alternative—she never contemplates fleeing, silence, or rage—the arc is more luminous stencil than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each patient soundbite layers into the hospice album, tightening the dominant stake—how to aestheticize dying—until the fused vinyl delivers a Charged Poise. Closure lands with a tangible conceptual cost: the circle is cracked but whole, institutionalizing her absence. Orientation anchors by line 5; the rooftop garden and blood-work envelope ground who-where-when without lapse. One causality seam: the “four weeks, maybe six” never limits her stamina on the page, so time pressure is declared not enacted, a soft ellipsis that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Radiant Haven is evoked through breathable sensory triads—sunlight like an anthem, bamboo rustling, fountain trickling—each filtered by Maya’s musical ear so setting doubles as instrument. The broken vinyl functions as micro-setting, its jagged edge handled twice and finally charged in the fused circle; this meets the 9+ gate for an object that constrains the final image. Hospital geography stays coherent, no impossible positions. A half-point shy of 8+ because weather/clouds remain ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to shape a communal soundtrack for her own disappearance—tightens once when she commissions the craftsman to preserve the vinyl halves; this single move forecloses secrecy and spends social capital. No antagonist or ticking clock beyond the distant prognosis, so escalation is accretive: each sampled sound thickens the texture of imminent loss. Cost is present but conceptual (her erased future voice in the mix) rather than a felt bodily price on the page. Meets the lens-standard for one meaningful deepening; lacks a visceral trade-off that would punch 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: beauty is reparable but never intact. Subtext lives in silence—Maya never says “I’m terrified,” yet the act of pressing vinyl from ventilator beeps confesses mortal fragility. The fused circle reweights earlier motifs (broken Beethoven, rooftop haven) into a resonant non-verbal answer. Minor ding for the final line “proof that every goodbye could be a beginning,” a touch thematic-echo, but the image itself resists tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya’s perceptual filter—sound before sight, light as music. Syntax grows lean under pressure: “She played what she called ‘hymning the mundane’—transforming the elevator’s ding into melody…” captures her vocational cadence without ornament. Dialogue is sparse and indirect—Dr. Williams’ “You’re early” carries subtext of mutual prognosis knowledge. No head-hop, no filter-verb fog; voice modulates from observant calm to final benediction without register drift.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, create natural breath; no template cadence runs. Occasional elevated diction (“pulsing stillness,” “ineffable rising”) borders on poetic overlay but stays justified by Maya’s lyrical vocation. One paraphrase loop: “sunlight filled the space like an anthem” mirrors earlier “sunlight…like an anthem” without fresh increment, a −0.2. Otherwise high density—each sentence layers sound, object, and emotional charge. Metaphors cohere, no mixed vehicles; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</question>
<comment>Premise—musician remixes hospice noise into farewell album—feels fresh yet internally inevitable given character. Vinyl fracture as self-portrait is a sharp specific, not stock symbolism. Risk is present (quiet ending, communal chorus) but not wild; transformation test passes because the rooftop garden + sound-collage logic would collapse if Maya were a painter. Loses higher band for leaning on familiar “life-death-art” uplift arc without subverting it.</comment>
