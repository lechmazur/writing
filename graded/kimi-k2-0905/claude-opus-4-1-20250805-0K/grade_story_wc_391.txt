<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is concrete—meteorite-iron instruments, palm on cold basalt—and her 17-year vigil manifests as embodied patience, not label. Micro-choices (placing each copper rod while restraining the urge to run) externalize the “sculpt patience from impatience” motive with visible cost. The final quiet smile is a credible renunciation of loud rebellion, earned by the slow ritual. Status/relationship pressure is absent (Tomás is only a courier), capping the score short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: freeze-after-rain → polarity window → rod circuit → viaduct retune. Orientation is nailed in the first 80 words (basalt columns, frozen lake, moon, Kira’s palm). Closure is a crisp CR: “the magnetic viaduct hummed its new tune” reweights the rule-set; the conceptual cost is legible in the spreading free thought. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Basalt organ-pipes, hexagonal ice faces, meteorite-iron tools—details are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered through a mapper who notices angles and magnetics. The frozen lake functions as both mirror and clock, guiding rod placement; environment actively constrains tactics. One minor over-description loop (“frozen lake reflected…” twice) keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate minds via viaduct hack—is signaled early and tightens when the 73-hour window shrinks toward dawn. Each rod placed = incrementally higher risk of detection, a meaningful narrowing under causal lens. Cost is conceptual rather than bodily, but still felt: “freedom always felt like falling at first.” No second reversal, so escalation plateaus just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from act: patient geologic time defeats synchronized control. The moon-path motif reweights at closure—revolution “begun with the patience of the moon itself”—without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (copper rods = bone-setting) and silence (no crowd cheering) keeps sentimentality absent. One soft echo of “revolution” as abstraction nicks the perfect 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly glued to Kira’s horizon-mapper perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under pressure (“molecule by molecule”). Diction within plausible lexicon—meteorite iron, polarity, cardinal points—yet avoids textbook dryness. One templated cadence (“like water…, like ice…”) is minor enough to keep the 9- gate open.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long lyrical sentences for vigil, curt clauses for rod placements. Metaphors (basalt organ-pipes, ice glass) are clean and non-contradictory; no purple stacking. Info-density high—each sentence advances lunar math or magnetic trick. One paraphrase loop on “frozen lake reflected” and a single filter-verb cluster (“she could feel”) are tiny scuffs below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mind-control basalt viaduct is fresh synthesis; lunar-patient revolution reframes familiar freedom trope through geologic metaphor. Specificity—meteorite-iron instruments, 37° moon angle—prevents swap test failure. Risk: quiet ending rather than spectacle; payoff is conceptual re-tune, not explosion. The inevitability feels earned, not gimmicked.</comment>
