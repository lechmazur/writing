<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kova’s calm discipline, embodied silence, and zig-zag mimicry of the stars create a coherent, individuated fisher. The interior contradiction between practiced stillness and hammering heart is dramatized in-scene, and the final acceptance of the goddess-echo costs her prior solitary identity, visible when she walks home already changed, humming winter-blooming lullabies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she chooses to carry the echo, reconfiguring her voice and future. Cost is felt in the rail-spike burn and the dawn’s inevitable re-patterning. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure intensifies through density and cadence shift; the garden’s hybrid bloom under star-rain is the decisive intensifier that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden, rail spike, and sleeping constellations constrain every tactical choice; the spike literally channels frequencies and dictates silence-voicing posture. Sensory economy privileges acoustic and light detail over visual clutter, mirroring Kova’s profession. The feral lullaby at the end recharges the opening “patterns break” frame, making environment the final instrument of change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>One dominant stake—secure or refuse the goddess-echo—tightens when the echo circles and tests her silence. Escalation is textural: each star-dream leak thickens the garden’s hybrid blooms, narrowing Kova’s tactical options to silence or surrender. Felt price is the spike’s burn and the irreversible internalization of alien song; no reversal, but a meaningful deepening that forces stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Themes of transmission, inheritance, and art as wound emerge through the concrete act of catching song across centuries. No moral is stated; the final image of flowers blooming in winter air reweights the premise: some songs never die, they just change vessels. Ambiguity persists—cure or curse—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric, third-person distant texture is stable, with purposeful compression—“voicing silence” is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is acoustic-first, star-drunk, cool-toned, matching fisher-of-sound vocation. Rhythm modulates: long breaths during casting, fractured fragments when spike burns, closing on feral lullaby cadence that echoes opening. No dialogue, so voice evaluation focuses on narrative idiom which stays consistent and character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—“constellation tumbled lower… new hybrid blooms erupted—part music, part light, entirely impossible.” No template cadence or synonym loops; mixed metaphors are intentional (sound-flowers, star-dream rain) and coherent within fantasy rules. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs cleanly. Occasional elevated diction (“somnambulant giants”) risks register drift but reads as voice-motivated celestial scale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fishing for an echo of a dead goddess with a rail-spike rod in a sound-wave garden is a fresh synthesis. The sleepwalking constellations and voicing-silence mechanic are non-obvious yet internally logical, charging the final lullaby image. Risky lyric structure holds under accumulative lens; transformation test fails—this exact premise and emotional arc could not swap settings without collapse. Specificity and conceptual commitment earn the extra 0.2.</comment>
