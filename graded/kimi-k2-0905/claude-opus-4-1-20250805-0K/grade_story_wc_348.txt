<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory drives—control-through-chemistry vs. release-through-music—are dramatized in the chrysalis pocket and river foam beats; the final “I’m learning to think symphonically” is earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose the old lecture-mode with visible cost of released grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: foam → chrysalis → text “I saved you a seat” crystal- lize options with felt cost; each braid image reweights the stake without causal cheats; Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ravine foam and braided water constrain her insight method; chrysalis-as-micro-setting is handled twice and charges final release; sensory selection (iridescent wings, papery shell) filters through chemist perception; spatial choreography clean; environment forces pattern recognition that ends silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake “translate separation into connection” is signaled early; pressure tightens when she decides to release the literal chrysalis and send the risky text; cost is the relinquishing of control (grief loosened) with page-visible tremor; escalation driven by her noticing agency, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The divergent-path motif emerges from foam braids and musical vs. chemical thinking; final image of “three voices becoming one” offers non-literal CR that reweights earlier silence without moralizing; theme resists tidy symmetry—connection is ongoing rehearsal, not single chord.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains chemist-perceptual signature (“polymerized into distance,” “structural color”); rhythmic control mirrors musical cadence; no head-hopping; diction stays within educated but maternal lexicon; foam imagery repetition is pattern-taught and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density—every sentence advances pattern or character; no loops or scaffold; metaphors (foam fugue, neural tributaries) cohere under science-music fusion; final line “three voices becoming one” delivers textural specificity that recharges entire braid motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer chemistry + musical form as mother-daughter bridge; foam → fugue insight is non-obvious yet inevitable given set-up; monarch chrysalis retooled from sentimental keepsake to release object; risk of lyric science pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
