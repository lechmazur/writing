<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elena’s grief-hardened interiority is specific and embodied—her steady hands once trembled, candlelight glints on silver wire. The origami crane her fingers fold while listening to the widow is a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values: gift over sale, future over past. Contradictory impulses (tattoo stencil designed for her own skin yet un-inked) stay alive in scene, not summary. Final smile still “feeling foreign” shows cost scaled to length; renunciation of suicide is legible without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena lights the next candle, leaving a crane for the next wanderer—visible cost is the perpetual reopening of her own wound to serve others. Causal chain holds: stranger arrives because Elena keeps beacon lit; Elena keeps beacon because she once slept in her car and was saved. Orientation anchors at line 4 (“The observatory had no clocks…”) and never drifts. One transition (stranger enters) is cleanly cued by candle glow through window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory dome, jeweler’s bench, and tray of candle stubs recur as micro-setting that constrains choice: only star-time, no mechanical clocks, dictates pace. Vellum stencil and rice-paper cranes are tactile objects whose handling advances beats; candle array literally guides the stranger inside. Sensory hierarchy narrows to glinting wire, hot wax scent, and wheeling stars—details filtered through artisan-grief attention. Final image of fresh candle recharges earlier beacon motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elena will tattoo the phoenix and fully re-enter life—tightens when she instead transmutes the widow’s ring, deferring her own skin-commitment. Agency is service to others as rehearsal for self; cost is postponed catharsis. Pressure grows accumulative: each crane, each candle, each stranger widens the aperture of responsibility. No coincidence; star-time and visitor arrival are externalized gauges of internal escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of alchemy-through-service emerges from image pattern—ashes inside lockets, coiled silver becoming pendant, cranes bearing coordinates—never from thesis statement. Subtext in silence: Elena never says “I almost killed myself,” yet the empty tattoo stencil and perpetual open door imply it. Final smile’s foreignness resists tidy healing; ambiguity lingers. Conceptual repricing occurs when “genuinely artificial” phoenix is reappraised as truthful—artifice becomes authenticity, reweighting grief craft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elena’s jeweler-eye perception: wire “coiling,” rice paper “tucking,” candle glow “joining the constellation.” Diction is precise—no filter-verb clutter; “wheeling overhead” and “aperture” feel star-bound without jargon drift. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: widow whispers, Elena replies in low, instructional cadence. Internal texture remains artisan-tactile; no POV leakage into stranger’s mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long星光 strands and short metallurgical taps, mirroring star-wheel / bench-strike duality. No scaffold or synonym loops; “candle,” “crane,” “ash” recur with accretive, not repetitive, force. Metaphors stay coherent—phoenix half ash half flame parallels Elena’s half-life. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges motif. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Memorial-jeweler-as-astronomical-keeper is fresh synthesis; grief-work aligned with star-time feels non-obvious. Origami cranes containing GPS of hope sites transforms familiar sad-lonely trope into lived map. Risk of sentimentality avoided by keeping tattoo un-inked—hope suspended, not consumed. Specificity of abandoned church dawn AA meetings and hospital tomato garden roots universals in verifiable detail.</comment>
