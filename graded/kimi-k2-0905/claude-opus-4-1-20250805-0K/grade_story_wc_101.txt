<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority (“need has no face, and neither should kindness”) is concrete and character-specific; her renunciation of credit is earned through six months of micro-choices. The only flaw is mild label-speak (“she understood human nature with a gently persistent wisdom”) that abstracts rather than embodies. Still, her endurance carries visible cost—she is “tired now, her work complete”—and the community’s anonymity preserves her hierarchy of values. Relationship crucible is off-stage, but Samuel’s silent partnership shows status shift without exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each midnight bell ring layers density until anonymity becomes identity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marta’s final toll crystallizes the community’s self-sustaining ethic; the cost is her expendability now that the system no longer needs her. Causality is coherent via “because/therefore” of gifts returned. One micro-turn (the first basket appearing) sets up the pattern without breaking ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and silver bell function as micro-setting: they constrain when and how anonymity can occur; the ridge vantage frames both exposure and concealment. Sensory selection is urgent—weathered columns, gentle toll—never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean; the cart’s path and doorstep drops track across months. Final image recharges the arbor as marketplace of dignity, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival via dignity—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each midnight thickens reciprocity until officials find “no desperate chaos.” Visible price is Marta’s exhaustion; tactical shift occurs when she realizes she “no longer needed to make most of the runs.” Agency remains hers throughout, even in renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: anonymity as communal glue. Subtext lives in silence—no one points when cameras arrive. Final image of “anonymous footsteps” offers non-literal answer: identity dissolves into collective heartbeat. No moralizing; complexity preserved by refusing to name saviors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, anchored to Marta’s perceptual filter. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, staccato for midnight runs. Distinct diction—“benevolent shadows,” “midnight grace”—without purple drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Samuel’s whisper breaks silence with subtext. No head-hopping; voice coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver time-jump, supply detail, emotional shift. No loops or scaffold; “midnight bell” repeats with accruing weight, not churn. Metaphors are consistent—“forgotten prayer,” “heartbeat”—and physically coherent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks. Copy clean; no tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh angle: aid embargo solved by de-sourcing charity itself. Transformation test fails if anonymity removed, proving integration. Risk—lyric montage across six months—pays off in resonant closure. Specific detail (silver bell, preserved plums) prevents generic fable.</comment>
