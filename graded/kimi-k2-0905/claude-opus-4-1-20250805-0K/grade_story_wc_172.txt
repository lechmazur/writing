<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—destroying ecosystems to archive extinction—rings sharply in the salt-cradle beat; her trembling fingers embody the cost. Yet the amoral-philanthropist motive is declared more than dramatized: “every devastation was calculated preservation” tells us the paradox rather than letting us discover it through a micro-choice on this page. The final bitter smile is credible endurance, but the arc leans on summary of off-stage atrocities rather than new, visible stakes in-scene. Still, the specific image of her as “sole, terrible translator” of dead birdsong gives her a memorable, haunted individuality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s salt-fossil silence reweights every prior drought-engineered scar with undeniable moral cost. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—the satellite redirection, salt fusion, and thunder diversion all pay off in the final aerial gaze. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words via drone-feed map and crystalline crunch. The only slack is an over-reliance on reflective exposition to explain the drought scheme rather than dramatizing a beat of choice inside it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but active archive: its acoustic resonance chamber and heat-fusion mechanics determine both burial method and final permanence. Micro-setting extends to the climate-sealed case and turquoise shell—objects whose tactile clicks constrain each step. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through Vera’s engineer-eye: satellite grids, mineral matrices, algorithmic cracks. The drought-made map is spatially coherent, and the evaporated wetland history sharpens the horror without extra exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo of extinct birds—surfaces early and tightens through salt’s acoustic fossil property. One meaningful deepening occurs when the egg’s deliberate crack allows salt to fossilize albumen, narrowing options: ruin the shell or complete the monument. Cost is legible: she trades live storm moisture for eternal mineral silence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversal is needed, only the intensification of monument-building under her own manufactured desolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: salvation-through-destruction is enacted, not asserted, in the cracked egg fused by drought. The salt monument becomes a non-literal answer—an eternal silent song—reweighting every prior act of engineered starvation. Subtext lives in gesture: the empty case clutched at lift-off shows the hollowness of her archive. Final line “grace came broken, piece by hoarded piece” offers resonant ambiguity rather than moral closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature—drone grids, calcium-carbonate resonance, algorithmic fractures. Diction (“surgical precision,” “tax write-off,” “acoustic fossil beds”) marries corporate lexicon to grief without register drift. Rhythm accelerates through shorter clauses during the burial beat, mirroring trembling urgency. No head-hopping or filter-verb fog; the satellite thunder diversion is rendered as observed weather, not omniscient exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers job—salt crunch underfoot, Smithsonian heist backstory, satellite feed logic—without scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent (map of fissures = flight paths) and avoid purple overload. Minor template cadence in “more importantly…” clause is the only near-loop, but it does not touch closure. Strong verbs (crunch, fuse, divert) and specific nouns (bio-foam, pellets, satellites) keep texture taut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The drought-scar-as-migration-map conceit is strikingly non-obvious and transforms familiar eco-dystopia into a mourning archive. Risk is taken: a villain protagonist whose redemption is exactly her crime, yet the story commits fully, no hedging. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—salt acoustics, engineered drought, and parakeet egg all converge in the fossil silence. Fresh angle plus conceptual integrity earns the high band; no derivative premise penalty applies.</comment>
