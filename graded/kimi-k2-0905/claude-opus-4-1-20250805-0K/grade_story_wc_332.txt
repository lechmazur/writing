<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s renunciation is legible and carries cost—she forfeits her own shot at love to keep her grandmother’s dream incomplete yet honored. Interiority is concrete (“something leaving her own chest”), but the psychic ledger (“spending her own capacity”) edges toward label-speak. The seven-year search motive is stated, not dramatized, so the final sacrifice feels slightly abstract rather than wrested from lived pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the refusal to seize the vitalized lover reweights the premise—dreams can stay luminous in absence. Causal chain is thin (why does letting him dissolve spare her own future love?) but the accumulative pattern of dawn-light callbacks holds. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; escalation is a density shift rather than because/therefore turns. Cost is felt in the final image of softening whispers, meeting the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The archipelago-as-memory-cipher is evoked through selective sensory filters (molten copper water, salt-stained pages) that constrain Mara’s ritual path. Palette and sunrise mechanics are grounded in tactile detail; space tracks cleanly from skiff to island. The world rule—light through ground glass can vitalize memory—is taught early and paid off at closure. Setting charges the final image: the dissolving figure redefines the islands from scattered fragments to a completed constellation of acknowledged longing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—complete vs. release the grandmother’s dream—is signaled early and tightens once: the cost of vitalization becomes visible (warmth leaves Mara). Escalation is a single deepening rather than reversible turns; agency is renunciation rather than confrontation. Coincidence is kept to atmosphere (whispers at dawn) and does not resolve the conflict. Price is conceptual but unmistakable on page, meeting the 8.0+ trade-off threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: some longings achieve beauty only by remaining unlived. The final image of quiet whispers revalues the prior seven-year quest from recovery to recognition. Subtextual irony—Mara sacrifices her own romantic future to honor a romance that never happened—lands via image, not statement. No thematic echo in final paragraph; the refusal to literalize the moral keeps resonance intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect voice stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter; diction (“molten copper,” “cipher of longing”) is lyrical yet anchored in her craft. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dawn hush, short beats for choice moment. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is waived. Palette-as-prism motif recurs with shifting meaning, taught early and repriced at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean for its lyric load; only one paraphrase loop (“whispers seemed softer, almost grateful”) could be cut. Metaphors stay coherent within light/water register. Sentence variety supports the hush-to-choice arc. Filter-verb clusters absent; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The memory-vitalizing watercolor palette refracted through sunrise is a fresh synthesis of magic-realist trope and maritime setting. Transformation test fails—core arc could survive renamed places—but the specificity of glass-ground light mechanics and the grandmother cipher keeps it from feeling template. Risky quiet ending is handled confidently; no late rule change. The conceptual turn—renunciation as completion—reweights familiar material with non-obvable sting.</comment>
