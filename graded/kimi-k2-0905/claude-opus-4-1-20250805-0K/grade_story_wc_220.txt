<comment>Contradictory impulses ripple through her nose-versus-leaf skepticism and the later surrender to ancestral magnetism; the howl at the end is earned. Her micro-choice to leave retirement is embodied when she palms the amber and breathes “following a scent.” No interior diagnostic chatter; the war-scarred refusal to trust smell alone is shown in the twitch of her muzzle rather than labeled. Flaws (age, fading senses) complicate tactics and remain uncompensated.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is tight: scent distrust → leaf riddle → phonograph translation → magnetic pilgrimage → valley reconfiguration. Each groove-etched color narrows her map options under a Situational lens. Closure is a Charged Poise: the howl crystallizes her new vocation and reweights “distance” from kilometers to shared grief. The cost—leaving Heap safety and admitting the nose can fail—is legible on page.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Heap’s crushed-car mountains, rust-motor-oil air, and the amber-wax leaf pressed to a phonograph horn are tactile, non-generic. Spatial choreography is clean: den → outside → cratered valley. Environment constrains choice—scrap alleys channel her route; the valley’s impossible autumn charges the final image. Weather is implied through dawn timing, supporting the hush.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate distance into reconnection—signals early via the girl’s whisper. Escalation occurs when the leaf’s chromatic veins physically rewrite the cylinder, foreclosing the option to ignore the call. Cost is visible: she abandons her sealed shipping-container den and the illusion of retirement. No antagonist needed; the pressure is the wasteland’s scale versus her failing senses.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: waxed autumn becomes covenant, distance becomes grief, howl becomes bridge. The valley’s reappearance of leaves reweights the motif from relic to promise. Moral ambiguity remains—she isn’t saving everyone, just guiding the findable. Final howl offers non-literal answer: closeness is audible, not measurable.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays inside Sage’s sensory frame; no head-hop. Diction—“scarred muzzle,” “tower-stacks of crushed automobiles”—is bloodhound-particular, never academic. Rhythm grows breathless during crater descent, then lengthens into the valley hush. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is direct: “leaf glowed like trapped sunlight.”</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“chromatic compass,” “magnetic scripture”—without purple swell. Opening line anchors nose distrust and stakes. No synonym churn or paraphrase loops. Final line lands on image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic bloodhound using phonograph grooves as braille-like cartography is fresh and specific. Transformation test fails if retold with generic wanderer + map. Premise commits fully: no retreat to pre-war tech ease; waxed leaf mechanics stay consistent. Valley of autumn trees inside a glass crater re-enchants without violating established wasteland rules.</comment>
