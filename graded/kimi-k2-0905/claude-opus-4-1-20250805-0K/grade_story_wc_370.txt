<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ezra’s empathic curse/gift is credibly embodied (the telegram scene forces him to move). The final “stay while leaving” stance is earned by prior micro-choices and costs him continued solitude, giving a visible Resonant Reconfiguration. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but the sister’s grief is sketched more as label than body. Still, the contradiction between compassion and self-denial drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the expanded quiet in the reading room reweights both characters’ options with felt cost—Ezra forfeits isolating exit, the woman forfeits solitary grief. Causal lens holds: because he feels her pain → he approaches → they share folded paper → midnight crystallizes shared absence. No teleporting props; invitation and telegram fold mirrors are clean. Minor slack: orientation (who/where) is 40 words late but ultimately serves the hidden-in-plain-sight payoff, so Orientation Test waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Library’s impossible third-floor scale is taught early and constrains the scene: the vast hush permits the “enlarged tranquility” tactic. Sensory triage favors hush and paper texture over visual clutter, matching POV bias. Midnight anchors time without telescoping. Micro-setting—the corner table—becomes the crucible; its distance rules shape every move. No object or space contradiction at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Ezra act without self-annihilating empathy? Escalation is one deepening: her grief surge → he abandons hiding → shared folded papers compress guilt into mutual shelter. Cost is legible: he sacrifices the safety of absence, she sacrifices private mourning. Agency is attention/approach, not external victory. Coincidence (late telegram) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme—“compassion sometimes demands self-cruelty”—emerges from the founder’s journal line, then is tested by the encounter rather than restated. Subtext operates in the silent folding of papers: two artifacts of lateness turned into shared shield. Final image of “quiet that contained multitudes” reweights prior paradoxes without moralizing. No echoing thesis sentence at exit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Ezra’s perceptual filters: selective attention to paper creases, breath-counting to manage empathy surge. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses when he expands calm, fragments during sensory overload. No head-hop. Diction stays within a reclusive autodidact’s lexicon; “enlarged tranquility” is the one coined phrase but is patterned and paid off. Dialogue minimal, indirection successful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence starts avoid monotony. Information density high: single sentences combine spatial cue, interior reaction, and paradox tag. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold spot: “staying while leaving” is repeated with near-synonyms in closing paragraph; costs −0.2. Passive voice minimal and purposeful. Clean copy; no typo hits.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Secret library above train station” and “empathic recluse” are familiar tropes, but the folded late papers as mirrored talismans and the use of paradox as tactical method (not ornament) give a fresh inflection. Conceptual commitment is total—no winking at reader. Specificity of enlarged-tranquility technique makes empathy-management feel discovered, not borrowed. Risk in quiet ending is coherent with premise.</comment>
