<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>A disciplined, embodied caretaker whose ritualized movements anchor every beat; the solitary POV means we measure her through micro-choices (breathing the name into the orchid, steadying the lamp) rather than relationship dynamics. The grandmother quest supplies clear drive, yet interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“foxglove regret, beautiful and poisonous”) that tells us the emotion’s label instead of letting embodied contradiction show. Closure is earned: the refusal to surrender the name hardens into a new lens on her lifelong task, cost legible in the split bamboo’s silence.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of catalogued losses → sensory orchid capture → resonant reconfiguration at the wall. Orientation clean by 60 words; stakes tighten when the cracked bamboo becomes an unrepeatable recording device, foreclosing hesitation—Mira must act before the tube fully splits. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the constellation of glowing orchids re-weights her labor from futility to continuity, the cost the irreversible snap that ends the song. Persistent constraint—the library’s isolation—shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Crystalline airborne library, glass orchids, and the sundered bamboo function as micro-setting: each constrains action (fragile blooms demand slow hands, cracked bamboo imposes countdown). Selective sensory layering—visual translucence, hollow undertone, breath-heated glass—guides pacing without tourist clutter. Spatial tracking holds as Mira moves from atrium to workshop to wall; no impossible positions. Final image of orchid constellation mirrors internal reconfiguration, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the vanishing name—tightens once: the widening crack converts routine ritual into urgent salvage. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; each repetition of “Solmieth” layers urgency rather than looping. Cost is visible: tool destroyed (bamboo snaps), path foreclosed (song gone except in glass). No reversals needed; single meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: preservation as quiet rebellion against oblivion. The glass orchid’s glow reframes the caretaker’s solitude from futility to defiance without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—the split tube, the whispered triad of syllables—rather than abstraction. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: a flower that never wilts, sealing both loss and victory.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person adheres to Mira’s perceptual bias: shelves of translucent blooms, dawn light unfiltered by earth. Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual pace; diction stays within her scholarly-caretaker lexicon. No dialogue, so voice judged by interior texture: meticulous, reverent, slightly aloof—matching her systematic gentleness. Occasional poetic register (“opal library,” “garden of extinct beauties”) risks purple but stays motivated by the world’s crystalline aesthetic.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with ritual: short clauses for heating glass, longer flowing lines for memory descent. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“beautiful and poisonous in equal measure”) but immediacy recovers in tactile orchid shaping. High density: each sentence advances image, task, or cost; no filler. Final line lands clean, recharging “forever found” against earlier “always eluded.”</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—floating library, memory vault—are re-forged through acoustic botany and cracked-bamboo recorder, a specific invention that drives the climax. Conceptual risk: solitary caretaker story could drift into elegiac cliché, but the orchid-phonograph mechanic and the grandmother-name payoff provide fresh inflection. Emotional specificity anchors novelty; solitude feels earned rather than sentimental default. Synthesis of sound-capture and glass horticulture feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
