<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orin’s prism-mind is dramatized only once—when it “reveals the grotto’s true nature”—but never forces a micro-choice or visible cost under pressure; the interior contradiction stays abstract. The final decision to keep drawing warnings is foreshadowed yet feels like a summary rather than a crucible that forecloses a path with embodied cost. No second character appears, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A. The competence/struggle balance is respected: Orin is capable yet still endangered; still, the emotional flattening after the node-vision keeps the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: doodle → map → grotto → node → new doodles; each step is a therefore-link. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Orin accepts perpetual custodianship, the cost legible in “burned into their prism-mind.” Orientation is clear by word 80. The single soft spot: the “forgotten combinations” are told-important but never tested on-page; they don’t narrow options during the grotto crawl, slightly deflating causality at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grotto is not postcard scenery—it dictates locomotion when gravity inverts, turning stalactites into floor, droplets into upward “silver rain,” so environment actively shapes tactics. Mist, water, and stone are returned to in motion, not static catalogue. The largest crystal node reappears at closure, recharging prior images. No slip touches the final image; specificity is selective and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the hidden combination before gravity rights itself”—is signaled early and tightened by literal loss of footing. Agency is continuous: overlaying doodles, kicking off archway, palming node, choosing to perpetuate warnings. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal: the prism-mind’s permanent burn. The hour-long inversion window is named but not tracked as a live clock, so pressure is atmospheric, not ticking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge as immune response—emerges through images (glowing ink mixed with blood) rather than thesis statements. Subtext is richest in the dragon ouroboros shifting each time, hinting vigilance must evolve. Final image of new doodles quietly reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. One near-tell: “understood now that these weren’t random embellishments” could be trimmed, but it’s brief and mid-story, not closing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays consistently inside Orin’s perceptual filter: “prism-minded,” “clandestinely luminous,” “threshold effects”—diction belongs to an archivist, not encyclopedia. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic sentences for scholarship, staccato motion beats during inversion. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One register wobble: “metastasize” feels clinical against the abbey mystique, but isolated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Information density is high—each line advances map, body, or atmosphere. Two small loops: “gravity inversion would begin… gravity’s reversal transformed” compress the same fact twice; “doodles… glowed” repeats three sentences later. No mixed metaphors; imagery is coherent. Closure line is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The ouroboros-as-warning-device and gravity-inverted archive spelunking feel fresh, not derivative. Conceptual leap—archivists as civilization’s immune system—grows organically from the premise and is paid off in the final image. Risky structural compression (700-word single scene through a grotto) succeeds because spatial logic stays legible. Minor echo of Borges/“Library of Babel” is transformed through embodied traversal rather than abstract maze.</comment>
