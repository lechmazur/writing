<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s numbness is embodied in the jar-handling and sword-work; the mirrored sparring lets contradiction play out physically. Motive intensifies: from passive victim to co-creator once Chen reframes the duplicate as complement. Interiority avoids label-speak, using “architecture where feeling could live” to show the blankness. Micro-choice—lifting the jar—carries visible cost: accepting a third self.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Tomorrow, I would meet my other self…to complete us.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mirrored halves building to synthesis. Orientation clean by paragraph 3; no disorientation. Persistent constraint: the floating dojo’s low gravity keeps every sword stroke slow, forcing contemplative tempo that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystalline walls and gravity generators are skim-named yet tactilely used—swords drift, bodies hover, forcing deliberate movement. The jar’s amber fluid catches light twice, becoming a micro-setting that constrains choice: to vivify or not. Spatial choreography precise: blades never occupy impossible angles. Earth glimpsed through floor reweights the stakes—home, daughter, history being rewritten below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who gets to feel—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation via Chen’s reframing: duplicate ≠ enemy but missing half; this deepens rather than widens. Tightening beat: vivify the jar or stay numb—options narrow to one path with visible price (potential third consciousness). Cost legible: surrendering exclusive claim to “Marcus.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from mirrored sword rhythm: identity as synthesis, not ownership. Subtext in silent sparring—conflict danced rather than argued. Final image reweights premise: numbness becomes “possibility waiting to be born.” No moralizing; complexity held in the jar’s uncertain future.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person texture remains clinical, matching emotional flatline: “voice hollow as the stone chambers.” Syntax lengthens under low gravity, mimicking slowed pulse. Dialogue spare, indirect: Chen’s questions answer themselves through motion. No head-hopping; perceptual signature fixed on sensory minutiae of weightless combat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with micro-variations: “thesis, antithesis, synthesis” mirrors duel cadence. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motive. Metaphor disciplined—glass jar as both literal container and conceptual womb. Minor over-layer in “historical revision” mentions (three), but cadence shifts at closure, earning forgiveness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: custody battle turned onticide—creates third self to escape mutual numbness. Trope of split consciousness repurposed via martial synthesis rather than legal victory. Risky low-gravity dojo pays off by externalizing internal stalemate. Specificity: amber fluid, crystalline walls, gravity generators—details impossible to swap without breaking metaphoric frame.</comment>
