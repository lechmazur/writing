<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—mathematical certainty against ancestral terror—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (hand tremor, larynx micro-adjustment). The final dispersal into beacon-song is an earned renunciation foreclosed by prior causal chain; cost is visible in the abandoned coat and the melted key. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are bone-deep and ice-bright. Azure coat functions as both professional skin and abandoned humanity—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira becomes the living wave, a conceptual repricing that reweights every lighthouse horn. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of harmonic imagery tightens until flesh turns frequency. Cost is legible in the melted key and the empty coat; persistent constraint is the new sonic ecology she now inhabits. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but active antagonist: groaning platforms, shifting floes, Arctic cold that seeps through rivets. Azure coat, bronze key, and frozen metal door function as micro-settings that constrain every gesture. Final image of blue shimmer inside gold beam re-sets the entire spatial contract—environment is now her body. Specificity ties harmonic frequencies to ice memory; no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the living covenant—tightens once: remove artifact → silence lighthouses → break ice-truce. Escalation is textural density: each harmonic beat makes the covenant more audible and the cost of defending it more visceral. Agency is renunciation rather than combat; she adapts by dissolving into the very medium the Collectors would mute. Visible price is her human form, traded for perpetual vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the counter-pull between human scale (grandmother, key, coat) and inhuman resonance (ice memory, sonic covenant). Final image offers non-literal answer: guardianship is not possession but dispersal. No stated moral; the song itself is the ethic. Subtext in the melted key—bronze surrendering to frequency—reweights “sacred artifact” as relational, not relic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is synesthetic and precise: “vibrations travel through her skull like whispered prayers,” “larynx adjust microscopically.” Rhythmic control mirrors harmonic escalation—short clauses under pressure, lengthened cadence at resonance. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Mira. Diction stays within Arctic-engineer lexicon; no register drift. Final shimmer is voiced in the same timbre as opening chill.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety propels: fragments at resonance (“she could feel every molecule…”), then lyrical sweep at dispersal. Metaphors are consistent—sound as light, flesh as tuning fork—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new sensory angle or causal link. One minor scaffold: “the artifact responded, its light intensifying…” could trim, but occurs pre-closure and does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse + sonic covenant + Inuit drift-ice theology, compressed into 800 words without exposition dump. Risk—turning protagonist into disembodied harmonic—pays off by making guardian cost felt rather than explained. Ice-as-memory and coat-as-shed-skin are not trope recycling but specific world logic. Transformation test fails if any element swapped: only this sphere of first sound could silence all lighthouses, only this engineer could vibrate into it.</comment>
