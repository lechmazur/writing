<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—her “boldly sympathetic certainty” shows up in micro-gestures like extending the reed circle to the exiled artist—but the final reconciliation beat is off-stage summary (“They climbed back together…”) so the cost of her compassion is asserted, not embodied. The ancient artist’s decades of isolation are likewise compressed into a single tear, blunting the emotional crucible needed for a 7+ score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the arbor becomes a communal mirror (Charged Poise) whose cost is the admission that they almost let their founding artist vanish. The spiral-path reveal is motivated by visible pattern, not coincidence, and the final image reweights every prior reed-sculpture as dialogue. Causality is intact, though the summit ascent is telescoped; still, the emotional logic holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Crystalline fruit catching fire, obsidian dust on fingers, and marsh reeds bending like lullabies create tactile micro-setting that charges the final arbor image. The crater lake’s moonlit pool is returned to at closure, spatial choreography is flawless, and the orchard constrains movement (slippery glass under bare feet). Environment is not just backdrop; it supplies the very material of art and reconciliation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community inclusion of the forgotten artist—tightens once: the tag-path discovery forces the village to confront its own erasure. Pressure is coherent but single-arc; no resource is lost, no option foreclosed beyond the moral acknowledgment. Sufficient for length, yet lacks a visceral price that would lift it to 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal memory emerges through the arbor’s transformation from monument to living dialogic web; no character moralizes it. The final wordless melody in seven languages reconfigures “lost” tongues as present harmony, a Conceptual Repricing that avoids sentimentality. Early tag graffiti pays off as inverse commemoration, giving the idea teeth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lush yet disciplined lyricism—"lantern light like fallen stars"—is filtered through Kira’s sculptor-perception; no filter-verb stacks. Seven dialects are rendered only by report, avoiding caricature, while reed-and-obsidian diction stays sensorial. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for ascent, staccato clauses for tag discovery. Voice is distinctive without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong density—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work: “each translucent fruit catching fire” does triple duty. A few near-metaphor clusters around “web” appear but never obscure causality. No scaffold loops; opener and closer are crisp. Minor register inflation (“conceptual repricing” risk) is avoided by keeping abstraction tied to reed image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing extinct-language reclamation with volcanic-glass graffiti art is fresh; the orchard-as-3D-archive feels inevitable only after the tag-spiral reveal. Risk is taken via lyric accumulation rather than plot reversals, and it pays off in the communal song. Not ground-breaking, but specificity (obsidian dust on cave fingers) lifts it above trope collage.</comment>
