<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—her synesthetic taste of “copper on her tongue” and the way she names plants recoiling from her path show a clinician-scientist who has learned to trust impossible data. The contradiction between her clinical training and her occult listening is kept alive in-scene, not told. Her final sprint is a micro-choice that costs her the safety of disbelief, earning the shift from observer to guardian. Only knock: the grandmother-backstory line is a 19-word expository nugget that could have been folded into present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is “because/therefore” linked—hearing-aid SOS therefore atrium therefore basement therefore sprint. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: she crosses the threshold from curiosity to prospective theft-recovery, abandoning professional distance. The fading photograph reweights the stakes inside the final image, satisfying CR. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no teleporting props; no soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atrium is not backdrop but instrument: mist density modulates visibility, orchid-lean creates spatial dread, amber light fragments become the cathedral that licenses her to listen. The hearing-aid circuits and copper-taste interference are micro-setting objects that constrain how she can gather evidence. Spatial choreography is clean: we track her distance from glass ceiling to green-shadow caves to exit without jump-cuts. One notch off: “dying light into amber fragments” is gorgeous but repeated in adjacent clauses, a micro-loop that dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue seventeen stolen voices—is signaled by line 9 and tightens when photo faces begin to vanish in real time, converting abstract mission into countdown. Agency remains with Mara: each pulse she decodes narrows her tactical options until only basement-invasion remains. Cost is legible: she forfeits her former identity (“hadn’t meant to be a hero”) and accepts risk of confrontation. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient for 700-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the moral cost of harvesting final memories is shown through Mrs. Valdez’s erased laugh and the17 catatonic bodies. Subtext is carried by object—the photograph that loses pigment as voices are siphoned—so the reader feels abstraction as visceral erasure. The ending image reweights “protect vulnerable voices” from slogan to lived stakes: Mara runs toward stolen selves while mist lifts, implying city-wide restoration is possible yet fragile. No moralizing line; resonance stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: syntax lengthens under dread (“petals trembling in the windless air”), then fragments into sprint (“She ran”). Hearing-aid crackle is rendered as onomatopoeic telegraph, not clinical exposition. No head-hop; no filter-verb clot; diction never exceeds her audiologist lexicon. Rhythm accelerates from dirge-beat to heartbeat across paragraphs, tightening pressure without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Density is high—each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent (mist=breath, amber=cathedral) without mixed collisions. One paraphrase loop: “someone had been harvesting memories, collecting final moments…” repeats concept inside one sentence; trim would sharpen. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero synonym churn, zero register drift; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—emotional-contact-tracer-as-mystic-audiologist—is fresh synthesis of noir detective and speculative grief-work. The rule-set (hearing-aid tuned to dead frequencies) is introduced early and obeyed throughout. Risk of sentimentality is averted by metallic sensory details and by making the rescued “voices” literally absent bodies, not cuddly ghosts. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight. Only close echo is the title-phrase “reeling hush,” which faintly recalls Dylan Thomas; still transformed by context.</comment>
