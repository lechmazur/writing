<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Vera’s lie-sensitive hands, her refusal to soften truths, and her solitary endurance crystallize a believable outsider-artist psyche; the grandmother’s letter finally forces a costly choice—deliver every buried honesty even if the dome’s peace wilts. Interiority stays concrete (“hands didn’t shake,” “golden ink flowed freely”) rather than diagnostic. The only minor slack: we are told she is lonely rather than shown a present-moment wound; the emotional cost is back-loaded onto the leaf-transcribing decision, but it lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: Vera commits to broadcasting the crystallized confessions, accepting that civic tranquility will dissolve—cost is the felt chill of “watching the greenhouse city’s carefully maintained peace dissolve.” Accumulative lens holds: each shard she decodes deepens the pattern of concealed truths until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is tight—finding the plate → map → tunnel → grandmother’s crystal letter → decision—no late rule changes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse city under toxic sky is sketched with sensory economy (“copper-and-regret” condensation, crystallized conversations in pale green) yet always filtered through Vera’s calligrapher eye. The zinc plate, breathing leaves, and pneumatic tubes double as micro-setting that constrains action: only living tissue accepts ink, only metal shards survive the damp. Spatial choreography is clean as she crawls junction seven. Final image—“morning condensation on glass”—mirrors the dome’s fragility and recharges the motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stake is legible early: Vera’s reputation as the city’s only reliable truth-teller vs. the social cost of total honesty. Pressure tightens accumulatively—each decoded confession widens the gap between private knowledge and public lie until silence becomes untenable. The grandmother’s crystal letter is the decisive intensifier: it transforms a personal search into civic rupture. Cost is visible on-page: Vera knowingly chooses to “watch the peace dissolve,” trading collective comfort for moral oxygen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without announcement: truth as an ecosystemic force that, like water, will corrode any container built to hoard it. The crystallized conversations literalize “candor in small moments” as physical debris, letting the motif accrete meaning rather than preach. Final image reweights the premise: the same condensation that once fogged the dome becomes the solvent that dissolves it. No moralizing coda; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual filter—gold-tipped brush, magnifying lens, copper stink—no head-hop. Syntax sharpens under pressure: short clauses when she crawls the tunnel; longer, breath-held cadences while reading crystal. Diction remains within a calligrapher’s lexicon without showiness. Dialogue is absent, but interior monologue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Voice is distinctive yet transparent enough to let the conceit shine.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; sentences often do two jobs (“The fragment had fallen… while she’d been searching…”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (condensation = dissolution). One near-purple phrase—“smelled of copper and regret”—is earned by character POV and momentary intensity. Final line lands with imagistic snap, no mechanical coda. Copy clean; pronoun and spatial tracking flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing postal archaeology with lie-detecting calligraphy feels inevitable in hindsight: both revolve around inscription, circulation, and censorship. Crystallized sound-waves trapped in pneumatic tubes offer a fresh speculative physics that grows from the world’s temperature differential rather than arbitrary magic. Grandma-as-whistle-blower embedded in a green crystal letter is an indelible image not seen elsewhere. Risk—quiet ending, no villain—pays off by letting the conceptual cost resonate. Synthesis of eco-SF and epistolary noir is specific, not quirky ornament.</comment>
