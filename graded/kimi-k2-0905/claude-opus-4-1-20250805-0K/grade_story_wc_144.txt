<comment>Maya’s blindness is not a label but a lived perceptual system: the droplet acoustics, wing-beat vortices, and bench-top vibrations are embodied, contradictory, and decisive. The apprentice exists mostly as witness, yet his one question (“How do you oversee…”) triggers Maya’s clearest articulation of stakes, so status shifts are minimal but present. The final renunciation—“I just helped them find their way”—carries visible cost: she turns back to “broken things,” foreclosing any heroic credit. Competence is balanced by genuine struggle (micro-fracture search, exact membrane pressure) and no safety-hedging perfection.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: explosion → heightened hearing → droplet sonar → drone repair → ship sails. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at “Meridian anchor lift in twenty minutes” narrows options to a single beat. Closure is Earned Stasis: Maya refuses external validation and returns to bench; cost is the audible departure horn that marks her perpetual exile from the voyage she enabled. No teleporting props; every tool and droplet is tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mist-coated depot is not backdrop but sensory interface: droplets act as pixels, skylight tubes as prisms, corrugated eaves as metronome. Micro-setting (drone wing, bench surface) constrains the final patch pressure and is recharged in last image. Spatial choreography is clean: drone under skylight → exit door → Meridian chain rising; no impossible positions. Weather (mist) actively guides choice rather than decorating scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: ship blind without drone; signaled early. Escalation is causal and single: 20-minute announcement compresses time to one decisive patch. Cost is visible—Maya’s cut finger tremor on membrane, audible loss of drone hum into fog. No reversal, but knowledge deepening (she decodes the ship’s path yet stays behind) satisfies lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: repair as mutual navigation—ship, drone, artisan each broken/steering the other. Final image reweights “finding way” as internal, not geographical. No moralizing; silence after horn replaces thesis. Subtext in apprentice’s awe vs. Maya’s refusal to monetize miracle keeps complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maya’s sonic retina: “condensation dripped rhythmically,” “vortexes painted aerial patterns she could track.” Syntax shortens under time pressure: “Hands moved faster now, but never frantically.” No dialogue clutter; apprentice’s single question carries subtext of funding vs. wonder. Register stays within depot mechanic’s lexicon; no elevated drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm mirrors droplet cadence; no template runs. Figurative language is sparse and tied to mist physics—“acoustic signatures,” “whispering locations.” Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new tactile data. Minor scaffold: “The patch adhered perfectly” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind artisan uses mist droplets as sonar to repair navigation drone that guides ship through fog—disability flipped into hyper-ability without miracle cure. Specificity of copper filament “thinner than spider’s silk” and synthetic membrane pressure prevents trope recycling. Risk taken in quiet ending (no voyage disaster, no applause) pays off in conceptual repricing of “navigation” as mutual. Removing mist or drone collapses entire logic; elements are irreplaceable.</comment>
