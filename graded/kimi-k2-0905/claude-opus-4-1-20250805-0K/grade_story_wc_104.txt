<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is lean but embodied: the chain-song, the token filing, the seed scattering all manifest patience without naming it. His estrangement from carnival fame and his quiet cultivation of maps inside a piano feel idiosyncratic and credible. The moment he pockets heritage wheat crystallizes a hierarchy of values (freedom < eco-insurgency) with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, only implied, so the final renunciation is just shy of 9-band earnedness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty arcade glowing with unclaimable seeds reweights the Authority’s sterile future. Causal chain is tight: seed-arrow → decoded keys → snapped link → loaded exodus. One soft spot: GPS digits arrive as pure cipher; we never see Marcus test or doubt them, so the turn feels engineered rather than discovered. Still, the final image of “ten thousand possible futures” carries undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<comment>Redemption-center detritus is filtered through utilitarian attention: teddy-bear bellies as silos, snow-globes as nitrogen flasks. Micro-setting (the piano bench) doubles as both cipher-text and work-bench, constraining the single feasible tactic. Light, dust, and chain-sound layer economically; no tourist catalogue. The closing desert horizon evolves from prior concrete floor, sustaining spatial coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—living seed sovereignty versus synthetic dependence—tightens once: the decoded coordinates concretize abstract hope into a route that can be walked. Marcus’s agency is absolute; luck merely complicates (the arrow’s arrival) but does not resolve. Cost is visible: years of filing, the snapped link, the carnival banner now a seed-sack. The cap keeps just below 8.8 because the Authority’s threat stays off-page; pressure is conceptual rather than viscerally re-embodied at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through seed = memory = resistance; no editorializing. The redemption center’s name flips from cheap prizes to spiritual redemption without textual nudge. Final image of “patient rebellion” reweights the premise: revolution is photosynthetic, not explosive. Some abstraction remains—“sterile tomorrow vs. fertile one”—but it is grounded in tactile seed-names.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is tool-and-terrain—every noun is something he can pocket, file, or plant. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments like “The chain snapped.” No filter-verb bloat; “feeling the weight of possibility” is the single near-lapse. Lyric lift in final paragraph is earned, not decorative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: long sentences for surveillance lull, staccato for escape. Metaphors stay physical (“chains singing,” “roots breaking through concrete”). One mixed vehicle: “weight of possibility” is abstract poundage. No template cadence; openings vary. Final line achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Seed vault hidden in carnival trash is a fresh synthesis; the piano-bench cipher repurposes musical notation as insurgent cartography. Concept risks twee but is grounded by drought-science specifics (nitrogen seal, heritage grains). Not a radical formal risk, yet the accretive micro-choices feel specific to this world rather than plug-and-play dystopia.</comment>
