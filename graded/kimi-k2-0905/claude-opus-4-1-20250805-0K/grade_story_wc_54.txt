<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s curiosity and engineering mindset stay consistent, but interiority slips into abstractions (“stoic wonder,” “mechanics of hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after the valve-turns shows cost or risk; the resurrection succeeds on first try. The notebook closing is a gesture, not a renunciation that forecloses anything. She reads as competent and determined, yet the arc lacks a visible flaw or price that would make the triumph feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: sextant fragment → decoded pipe logic → valve sequence → fountain resurrection. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the terminal becomes “a machine for hope,” reweighting the premise. Cost, however, is purely rhetorical—no resource spent, no option closed. Orientation is secure by 120 words; the lens holds as Causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>Neon afterglow, confetti on terrazzo, rust flaking from copper—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Maya’s engineer gaze. The pipe network itself functions as micro-setting, constraining every move she makes. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her step-by-step from concourse to fountain without drift. Setting subtly guides choice and charges the final image of arcing water trajectories.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes are signaled early—“equations traditional engineering couldn’t solve”—but never tighten: no leaking joint, no risk of flood or collapse, no external opposition. The single reversal (dry fountain → flowing) is pure success; no option narrows or price appears. Escalation is therefore flat, though coherent under the Causal lens. The resurrection beat would carry cost in a real hydraulic system, yet the text keeps it consequence-free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—engineering as vessel for human aspiration—emerges organically from the pipe-map/celestial-map fusion, avoiding overt thesis. The final image of water tracing “equations that proved hope could be engineered” offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the absence of cost blunts the thematic punch; hope feels declared rather than paid for. Subtext is thin because no contradictory impulse complicates the triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Maya’s perceptual filter—numerals in notebook, hydraulic haptics, copper gleam. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, and slightly technical without jargon overload. No head-hopping or register drift; voice modulates from cautious observation to quiet elation. The lyric final paragraph edges toward elevated diction, but remains within the POV’s newly elevated awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences carry double duty—world + metaphor (“water arced in precise parabolas, each stream calculating trajectories”). No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb clutter. One mixed metaphor cluster (“machine for hope…mechanics of intention…physics of purpose”) is permissible at climax. Line-level craft is publish-ready with only hairline figurative overlap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The spaceport-as-sextant, pipes-as-star-chart conceit is fresh, specific, and rigorously followed through. Tropes of abandoned carnival and ruined utopia are transformed by hydraulic engineering logic rather than decorative retro-futurism. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: fluid dynamics ↔ celestial navigation. Risk is taken and paid off without clarity loss, meriting the high band.</comment>
