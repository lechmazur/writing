<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Thrain’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “gift” opening fully in the spiral stairwell is a micro-choice that costs her equilibrium and locks her into custodianship. The contradiction between solitude and the need to keep every echo alive is felt, not stated. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A; single-POV arc earns credible Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the axis-shift realization reweights all prior wall-whispers and forecloses Thrain’s option to leave. Causal linkage holds—tapestry + diary → insight → custodial vow—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. Cost legible in final line: “stories would be waiting… ready to remember themselves into being.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo-library is tactile—fingers on scorched diary edges, breath misting cold paper-air—every detail filters through Thrain’s echo-navigation. The fireplace as micro-setting supplies the decisive diary fragment that triggers axis insight. Spatial choreography clean on spiral ascent. Environment constrains final choice: only within these walls can echoes survive the bronze quiet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve stories vs. succumb to existential drift—signaled early. Single tightening: tapestry-dragons + child’s tilted drawing collapse into axis knowledge, narrowing her options to lifelong tending. Cost is the eternal solitude implied in “descended back into the bronze quiet.” Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory as counter-gravity against cosmic displacement. No moralizing; final image lets the silo “hold its breath” to reweight prior motifs. Subtext in dragons-as-stellar-markers reconfigures medieval art into warning system. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone ever return?—but thematic arc completes with custodial acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “bronze-quiet,” “wall-whispers,” “ash-memories” all issue from Thrain’s perceptual signature. Compression taught early (“grain repository once…”) and sustained. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Psychic distance tight; no filter-verb stacks. Final cadence mirrors spiral descent, reinforcing closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies—long breathy sentences for ascent, clipped fragments at insight. High density: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority). No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“broken birds” for diaries) but does not obscure causality. Clean grammar; paragraph cuts pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-human library + cosmic axis slippage + custodian-of-echoes; synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Trope of “last librarian” transformed into listener-of-walls. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off in Charged Poise ending. Specificity of tapestry-dragons as star-charts anchors novelty.</comment>
