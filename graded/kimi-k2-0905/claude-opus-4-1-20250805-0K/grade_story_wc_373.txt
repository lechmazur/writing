<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mae’s lineage and badge reveal are cleanly motivated; the heirloom-as-evidence pivot crystallizes her contradictory loyalties. Interiority stays concrete—tide through piling, watch ticking at hip—yet the emotional cost is slightly under-embodied at the moment she irrevocably burns the Clearwater name; a single visceral beat of hesitation would push this to 8+. Still, her hierarchy of values—justice over blood—drives every micro-choice, and the forfeiture of return rights lands as felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: failed covers → bloodline gambit → badge reveal → sunrise raid, each because/therefore link narrowing escape routes. The hidden-badge twist is set up by the “ticking against hip” cue and paid off when trust snaps audibly. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: market dissolved, Mae exiled, cost visible in the “weight forever changed.” Only a hairline slip: the off-stage buyer never materializes, so the final raid lacks an on-page antagonist to crystallize opposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rotting pier, candlelit chaos, and salt-soaked wool blanket deliver selective, POV-filtered sensory density that guides Mae’s stealth. The watch fob functions as micro-setting—its hidden compartment literally reconfigures the stakes. Spatial choreography stays coherent through the tarp maze; bodies track cleanly. Weather and tide act as lived clock, not backdrop. Without the badge-bearing fob the final image would lose its charge, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—record evidence before sunrise—tightens via each failed cover and the woman’s growing suspicion. The reversal when the fob is opened forecloses Mae’s undercover option with audible cost (“drowning in reverse”). Agency stays hers: she chooses to keep recording even after exposure. One further increment would land 8.8—e.g., a visible sacrifice such as surrendering the heirloom to buy final minutes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Trust as audible fracture emerges through image and action, never thesis: the snap of metal-in-winter, reversed drowning, market dissolving at dawn. The father’s honest death reweights into “rare currency,” then into betrayal—subtle thematic inversion without moralizing. Final line—“some sounds…worth the breaking”—offers resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: Mae wins yet loses home, keeping complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coastal-noir diction—“truce of hush,” “skeleton hosting darker trades”—remains inside Mae’s ken without forced lyricism. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for stealth, staccato beats at reveal. Perceptual signature filters through bootlegger lineage—she notices shine routes, not generic gangs. Dialogue indirection carries status shift: “Tommy’s girl” turns from honor to death sentence in four words. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences pull double duty—action + atmosphere—without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay maritime and metallic. Only micro-loop: “trust breaking…like wet sand…like metal snapping” repeats fracture concept across two adjacent similes, a minor echo. Otherwise density is high, rhythm breathes with tide, and no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Federal-agent legacy heir recording black-market trust fractures via an heirloom spy-cam fob—synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. The pirate-market-under-pier breathes new life into smuggling tropes through sensory specificity and codified “truce of hush.” Risk: lyric escalation instead of gunfight, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if relocated inland, confirming irreplaceable salt-rot DNA.</comment>
