<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Margot’s contradictory impulses—yearning for truth vs. empire loyalty—play out in live micro-choices (nib handling, letter sealing). Her final renunciation of honesty costs her a private reckoning, foreclosing the path of revelation; the seal-in-vault beat makes the price legible. Observant trait and family flaw feel idiosyncratic, not label-driven. No status/second-character crucible to test: headcount forgiven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed letter and vault image crystallize that truth will orbit forever unpaid; cost is the surrender of public accountability. Causal chain (call → proof → contradiction → Tokyo misdirection) holds; each step narrows her moral options. Observatory frame anchors who/where by word 40; orientation clean. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Copper dome, brass instruments, and the nib as micro-setting constrain her tactics: vault seal, acoustic echo, telescope memory all feed the final image. Sensory selection stays biased to her astronomer’s eye—"orbits of regret," elliptical shadows—never catalogue. Cloud-glow newsprint simile merges family trade with celestial metaphor, charging closure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from eyepiece to vault.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect empire vs. expose father—tightens when the journalist’s contradiction proves both alibis real. The Tokyo hoax is her decisive escalation that forecloses honest exposure; price is permanent moral self-exile. No antagonist on stage, but internal pressure suffices. One meaningful turn; coincidence only complicates (ambassador diary) and does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth as untouchable orbit—emerges from the observatory imagery, the telegram-proxy crime, and her final act of orbital misdirection. No explicit thesis; resonance arrives when she seals the letter beside the telescope her grandfather used to hide an asteroid. Moral complexity lingers: reader left weighing cost of perpetual deferral. Final image reweights prior "orbits of regret" without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed third-person sticks close to Margot’s astronomer perception; diction ("telegrams read aloud by a trusted proxy") stays within her lexicon. Rhythmic propulsion mirrors her accelerating logic—short sentences during proof cascade, then cadence slows into seal-and-vault coda. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Patterned elision (proxy death) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences often fuse image, backstory, and causality ("Three generations of newsprint fortune built this sanctuary..."). Metaphors stay coherent—newsprint clouds, orbital regrets—no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrasing ("crystallized final moment") barely grazes register drift, not in closure beat. Zero loops or paraphrase; sentence rhythms breathe with tension shifts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: astronomical observatory as locus for media-dynasty cover-up, telegrams as proxy "presence" at board meeting. Grandfather’s unreported asteroid subtly prefigures her unreported truth, making secrecy feel hereditary. Risk of abstract "orbits" concept is embraced and grounded in tactile nib-shadow and vault seal. Not a template plot; removal of Tokyo misdirection would collapse the moral orbit.</comment>
