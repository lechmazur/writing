<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory beautician/mortician identity fuels every micro-choice; the shift from cosmetic preservation to star-embedding is credibly motivated by her remembered craft and the Silence’s advance. Interiority stays concrete—“One last spark” is felt, not diagnosed. The final renunciation—standing frozen in “almostness”—is earned and visibly costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star and Mira suspended in radiant hush, cost felt in perpetual almostness. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (crystallized cloud, frozen fractals) reweights the stake until the final image crystallizes meaning. Causality holds: each ritual act tightens the bubble of potential. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto isn’t backdrop—it supplies the only material (crystallized aurora table) and the final cathedral of frozen light that locks them in place. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting, constraining every infusion gesture. Sensory economy is exact: “aurora’s magnetic breath” is heard, felt, seen. Final image recharges the grotto itself as eternal reliquary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last spark before Silence—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accretive: each infusion gesture narrows options until the Silence’s tide forces the final suspended state. Cost is visible: Mira’s feet begin to freeze; the star’s body shudders. Agency remains hers—she presses the chip, she chooses stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of beauty and death into “radiant hush”—no moral stated, only enacted. The emerald chip’s song reweights the premise: preservation is not life, not death, but endless almostness. Final image answers the implicit question—what is beauty at the end?—with luminous silence rather than explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “patterns in static,” “aurora’s magnetic breath” are hers, not decorative. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—short clauses mirror rising Silence. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal diction; no leaks. Compression (“she was both”) is taught early and paid off in final suspended plural state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors are coherent—crystallized cloud, frozen fractals—mirroring the world’s logic. High information density: “emerald chip pulsed faintly, holding the last warmth of a billion years” packs time, light, scale. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse trope into beautician’s final cosmetic: preserving the moment between beat and silence. Emerald chip as stellar embalming tool is fresh, inevitable. Risky accumulative structure teaches its pattern by word 150; payoff in suspended cathedral feels earned, not gimmick. Specificity—“crystallized aurora table”—prevents generic cosmic elegy.</comment>
