<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is specific and embodied—trembling fingers, the tactile memory of inserting bio-chips—so her later micro-choice to suture the tail feels earned. The contradiction between savior and exploiter pulses in scene, not summary. The final renunciation (public confession) carries visible cost—sanctuary’s closure, her freedom—so the arc satisfies the 9+ test even though the chameleon itself is more victim than relationship crucible. Voice remains coherent and individual; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes on the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she lied, therefore exposure arrives; because chips are removed, therefore the tail can be re-attached; because the surgery finishes at dawn, therefore she writes the confession. Each beat tightens her options until only surrender remains. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she accepts bankruptcy and indictment—charged by the image of the ordinary-green ch gripping its branch, cost legible in the glass between them. No orientation debt; stakes are anchored by word 50.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass-roof star panels, mist between redwoods, and the workbench’s surgical lamp form a micro-setting that literally throws light on her crimes and later spotlights the re-wired tail. The moonlit tail tip itself functions as a recurring object whose color-shift loss charges the final image once it reverts to plain green. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible hand or tool positions during micro-surgery. Environment constrains choice: isolation plus visible heavens force the confession to be posted online rather than delivered in person.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the sanctuary—collapses when Chen exposes the fraud; every subsequent beat shrinks her agency until only ethical surrender remains. The meaningful tightening occurs when she finishes the re-attachment: she could still hide, but the healed yet colorless tail makes continuance impossible—cost is felt on page. Agency drives escalation: her own hands remove the implants and later draft the confession. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the final image crystallizes her stance with undeniable social cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the chromatic lie: false brilliance sells, authentic green is unmarketable yet survivable. The tail’s reversion reweights “rainbow” from wonder to indictment without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—the chameleon’s blink and the un-sent messages—rather than exposition. Final image reconfigures value: ordinary green is enough, a conceptual repricing that lands as CR with quiet social cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Marina’s perceptual filter—scales “still shifting through impossible colors” reads as her guilty awe. Syntax grows clipped during surgery (“micro-sutures, precise stitch”) mirroring her narrowed focus. No head-hopping; chameleon perception is projected, not ventriloquized. Diction stays within a vet’s lexicon; no sudden学术register lifts.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. High-density lines—“moonlight blazed quietly vivid against the darkness”—do double sensory and symbolic work without overwriting. Rhythm varies: long breathy sentence for dawn light, then terse “She pulled out her phone” to launch confession. No mixed metaphors; “glass absorbed her confession” sustains physical logic. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the final image resonate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The uplifted-tail-as-spectacle is fresh, but genetic-mod fraud and redemption arc are familiar; particularized veterinary detail (subcutaneous emitters, neural stimulators) and the color-loss payoff transform trope. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than courtroom drama—but coherence remains high. Specificity of the illegal-augment black market and the star-roof workshop gives the piece memorable texture. Could edge higher if the chameleon’s POV risk had been attempted.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Early setup—she heals animals on a workbench—frames expectation. Middle: she chooses surgery over euthanasia, then chooses confession over cover-up; both turn on her gentleness warped by desperation. Closure: the same steady hands that saved the tail now dismantle her life—irreplaceable causal link. Cost is felt: 300 animals will lose their guardian.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Present in opening image, handled in extraction beat, re-attached in climax, and its color loss drives the final reconfiguration—meets all three integration gates. Tail’s shift from rainbow to green literalizes the theme on the page. Remove it and the entire causal chain collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Her conviction that “desperation justifies spectacle” fractures under Chen’s exposure, forcing every subsequent choice. The concept shapes tactics: first she clings to the lie, then strips each layer of deception. Closure reweights the conviction—truth now justifies extinction of the sanctuary. Visible cost paid on page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Reconstruct action spans the entire middle: removing implants, micro-suturing tail, drafting confession. Each stage forecloses an easier path. Without the literal reconstruction of the tail, the metaphoric reconstruction of her ethics fails—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Layer-shedding is signaled from the first excision of bio-chips and continues through public confession; mechanics matter because each removed layer worsens the chameleon’s ordinary appearance, destroying the lure that funded the sanctuary. The method is inseparable from the downfall and rebirth arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Misty redwood workshop under star panels supplies isolation and moral spotlight; moonlight on the bench enables the color comparison that triggers her decision. However, setting could be replaced by any remote lab without breaking causal chain—moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Tonight” and “dawn leaks” create a live clock; night-long surgery forces immediate confession before daytime investigators arrive. Timeframe tightens every beat—no room for second thoughts. Remove the single-night window and urgency evaporates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Self-respect vs compassion conflict is dramatized in each surgical choice: saving the tail restores compassion, posting confession restores self-respect. Friction peaks when the healed yet colorless creature can no longer attract donations—she must choose integrity over continued rescue. Cost is visible on page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Shimmering stillness begins with impossible color shifts in severed tail and ends with quiet green blink—tone modulates from spectacle to chastened calm. The shift charges the final image, making the stillness feel earned rather than static. Central to resonance; removal would flatten emotional aftereffect.</comment>
