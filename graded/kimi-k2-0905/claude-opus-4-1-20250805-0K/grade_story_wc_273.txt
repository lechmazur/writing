<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tracker’s “serene anger” and years-long obsession give her a sharp, consistent through-line; the micro-choices—spilling ink, decoding wind-scraped sand, letting the camp dissolve—are character-specific and advance knowledge. Interiority stays concrete (“time stretched like taffy”) rather than clinical. The final shift from rage to understanding is foreshadowed and costs her the safety of certainty, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—ink, drone, wind patterns layering—then tightens through fractal complexity until the closing crystallization lands (“consciousness was never separate from time”). Anchors arrive by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost; persistent constraint (she abandons the camp, merges with the mystery) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wind-sculpted tents, ink that un-spills, and drone resting on her shoulder function as micro-setting objects that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory economy is high—visual, tactile, temporal—filtered through her tracker bias. Spatial choreography stays clean as she kneels, stands, disappears into her work. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map why crisis distorts time—signals in paragraph 1 and deepens via each fractal pattern. One meaningful tightening: the ink’s final cascade forces the recognition that consciousness and time are one, foreclosing her old hunt-&-capture stance. Cost is felt: she gives up empirical certainty and merges with the phenomenon. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of ephemeral patterns rather than assertion: perception in extremis rewrites physics. The disappearing ink reprises as both method and metaphor, reweighted at closure. No tidy moral—just the unsettling fusion of mind and chronology. Emotional aftereffect lingers in the reader’s own sense of stretched seconds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight maintains tracker’s idiosyncratic perceptual signature—quantum foam, gravitational fluctuations—without head-hop. Rhythm accelerates with fractal density, then breathes into the final crystalline sentence. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Distinctive syntactic repeats (“consciously wild,” “ephemeral patterns”) are pattern-taught and payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers image, time-theory, and emotional charge. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay internally coherent (“ink reversing into nothingness”). Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long, elastic clauses to the staccato of totality ending. Final paragraph achieves Charged Poise without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of hard-SF temporal theory with lyric wild-tracking feels fresh and inevitable. Eclipse-as-trigger is familiar, but ink-rewind fractals as map of consciousness-time entanglement is non-obvious. Risky second-person shimmer (“she began to disappear into her work”) pays off by turning the tracker into her own quarry. Specificity of salvaged military drone retooled for chronal recon anchors plausibility.</comment>
