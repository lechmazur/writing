<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Miran’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic tasting of epochs, her body as kiln-fired conduit—but the decisive “subsuming” choice arrives with only a single preparatory tremor; the cost (she will ‘cook the grief tomorrow’) is projected, not yet embodied on-page, so the renunciation feels slightly future-conditional rather than fully paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (taste-memories, coral eyes) and tightens through each pool-touch; closure earns Charged Poise as the water clears and the stars “shine without sorrow,” a conceptual re-pricing that lets us feel the fortress’s history rewired inside her. One micro-drag: “unspoken dream” anchor arrives ~140 w, just past orientation safe-zone, but the delay is purposeful and later repaid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Desert-rain topography, spiral fossil ridges, and coral architecture are tactile, choice-bearing environments: the exact tidal-pool geometry later dictates the ritual geometry of her palms; the post-rain firmament supplies the final mirror that reweights the mood. Micro-setting (scarred fingertips, sandstorm gut) doubles as tool and terrain, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will she metabolize the fortress’s grief or walk away—tightens once: the plunge of both palms onto the largest pool. That act forecloses retreat and visibly exhausts her (“body heavy with purpose”), but because the communal payoff (tomorrow’s feast) is off-page, the price is slightly less visceral than the 8.8 band demands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme of transmuting calcified regret into shared nourishment emerges through salt-and-sorrow palate imagery rather than lecture; the final line’s “sounded like forgiveness” offers resonant non-literal answer. No tidy moral, only the earned inversion from exile-flavored bread to acceptance-flavored feast.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, desert-worn, rhythmically controlled (“brittle on the surface, flexible at the core” enacts its own meaning). Perceptual signature is consistent—she maps epochs onto taste buds, constellations onto brine—without ever slipping into explanatory filler. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; lyric elision (“hours passed, or perhaps minutes”) is pattern-taught and paid off in temporal vertigo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence propulsion is high—each clause adds new sensory or historical layer; metaphors stay coherent (tidal pool as eye, coral as tuning fork). One scaffold hiccup: “stored remorse” is repeated verbatim three times; trim one instance would sharpen. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb bloat; final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Central conceit—chef who tastes geologic trauma—feels fresh and is followed to its logical cultural alchemy. Coral-pavilion reveal beneath dunes re-enchants familiar drowned-city trope via palate metaphysics. Stakes stay intimate (one woman’s gut vs. centuries of grief) rather than world-ending, resisting template gigantism.</comment>
