<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Arbiter’s chilly, aphoristic voice is consistent and specific; every observation carries a scalpel of moral relativism. Marcus’s grief is rendered through tactile detail (the empty mirror shard, the crack in his “designer uncertainty”) rather than labels. The final micro-choice—Marcus left holding the shard that now reflects “gray spaces”—visibly costs him his last illusion of simplicity, earning the beat. Minor deduction: the Arbiter’s competence never wobbles, so we see no blind-spot-driven mistake, muting the full sting of tragic credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A tight two-shard arc (arrival → departure) with causal linkage: the daughter’s suicide → Marcus’s summons → Arbiter’s reframing → Marcus left with irreversible nuance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam forces the hollow shard to show “gray spaces,” reweighting the rule-set of moral perception. Cost is legible: Marcus’s shield of “expensive doubt” is pierced, foreclosing the comfort of absolutes. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity; no artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse lamp, wind-chimes, and mirror shard function as micro-setting: each constrains the Arbiter’s method and literally reframes light/reflection at the end. October wind and dawn color are filtered through the Arbiter’s professional eye—weather as moral instrument, not postcard. Spatial choreography is clean: bodies track from balcony to interior to door without drift. The shard’s final reflective flip charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Marcus’s need to understand why certainty killed his daughter—tightens once when the Arbiter forces him to own the simplification he sold her. Escalation is conceptual: each revealed ethical shade (tax shelters, safety violations) shrinks Marcus’s available self-exculpation. No physical reversals, but the wind-chime “minor key” cadence signals the deepening. Cost is visible: Marcus forfeits the protective story he paid the Arbiter to confirm, leaving him exposed to perpetual gray.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—“protection through complexity rather than simplicity”—emerges from the concrete parable of a mirror that only reflects once the beam hits. Subtext lives in gestures: Marcus clutching the shard like a emptied award, the Arbiter packing “questions written on rice paper” (a literalization of moral fragility). No final-paragraph sermon; the last image of ships “navigating by feel” reweights the premise without assertion. The hollow shard’s evolution from prop to verdict embodies the concept, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is knife-sharp, aphoristic, and profession-specific: “conscience for hire,” “designer uncertainty.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short, declarative verdicts mimic lighthouse flashes. No dialogue convergence; Marcus’s few lines carry subtext of evasion vs. need. Perceptual signature is consistent: wind-chime music read as moral data, dawn light as ethical spectrum. Elision (three weeks of predecessor’s absence) is taught early and paid off in the Arbiter’s transient replacement status, never breaking causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver occupation, mood, and world-rule (“They call us Arbiters, though ‘conscience for hire’ sounds more honest”). Metaphors are clean—lighthouse beam “casting judgment” remains physically accurate. No synonym loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts are surgical. Minor purple alert in “moral fog” and “absolute darkness,” but imagery justifies itself through repetition at closure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato diagnoses to the final long sentence that lets dawn in.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “conscience-for-hire” angle freshens the familiar grief-recriminations scene; the hollow mirror shard as an anti-reflective fragment of shattered self-image is a specific, non-obvious invention. Wind-chimes transmuted into oracular data is a lovely risk that pays off. Premise stays conceptually honest: no late rule inventions, no tidy redemption. Slight deduction: lighthouse + grief + wealthy sinner risks trope overlap; the specificity of the shard and chime almost but not fully transform the template.</comment>
