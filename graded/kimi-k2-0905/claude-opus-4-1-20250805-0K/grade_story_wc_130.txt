<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Morrow’s gently-inventive meticulousness is embodied in months of phosphorescent mapping; her interior contradiction—yearning for Elias yet accepting his transformation—drives the climax choice to leave the eyes. The renunciation costs her the tactile mentor she sought, paid in the final image of “absence… another form of presence.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chipped mosaic equation reweights loss as a solvable continuum, visible cost is the glass eyes relinquished. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—fungal rings, drop-intervals, apple-light patterns accumulate to the final equation. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cavern orchard constrains every move: mineral darkness dictates nocturnal timing, limestone water feeds memory-laden apples, stalactite drip sets the sub-audible hum that signals activation. The mosaic stepping stone’s chipped constellations are the literal interface for the equation—remove it and the climax collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she recover Elias?”—tightens when glass eyes reveal he is already present as math; option to extract him is foreclosed. Price paid: she abandons the eyes, accepting translucent mentorship. Escalation is textural intensification of fungal light-rings; agency is placement decision that triggers revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific images—chipped mosaic = emotional progression, glass eyes = sight beyond flesh—never sermonizes. Final reconfiguration: loss is a state-change, not deletion. Ambiguity is purposeful; counter-reading (she deludes herself) remains plausible yet does not deflate resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Morrow’s perceptual filter—“mathematics of emotion” lexicon feels organic to a conjurer-scholar. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“Loss… never absolute when properly calculated” (short clause as stakes crystallize). No head-hopping; glass-eye vision marked by typographic shift (“through the glass eyes, she saw…”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet lucid—“eternal twilight beneath dripping stalactites” does triple scene-setting work. No loops; each sentence advances image or equation. Figurative control holds through climax: “spreading ripples of bioluminescent fungi” keeps physical logic consistent. Minor register lift in “conceptual mathematics” fits POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: taxidermist glass eyes as emotional telescopes, loss recast as soluble equation in underground orchard. Conceptual risk—mentor becomes fungal geometry—pays off through prior pattern of mineral math on mosaic. Specificity of “chipped joy, sorrow, longing, release” prevents abstraction from drifting into gimmick.</comment>
