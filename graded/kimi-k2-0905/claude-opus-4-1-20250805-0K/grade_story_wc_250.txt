<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s silence is credibly rooted in vocation rather than pathology, and her “spiralingly calm” body language shows contradictory impulses (stillness vs. kinetic shutter work). Thomas’s grief is embodied through posture and dockside vigil, not diagnostic labels. The hand-off of the dental mirror is a micro-choice that crystallizes her value hierarchy—service over self—and costs her the tool that earlier enabled her teaching. Relationship-as-crucible is light because Thomas remains largely recipient, not co-agent, but his visible tear-tracked departure shows altered state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Thomas leaves lighter, Mira stays in charged poise, cost felt in the surrendered mirror and her resumed silent watch. Causal chain holds—because she withholds speech and instead manipulates light/shadow, therefore Thomas re-interprets his unfinished goodbye. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold loop: “each one a secret finally spoken in the language of light” repeats the lesson already dramatized; minor, does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Cobalt dock, rain-puddle mirror, and shuttered canal house constrain every beat: the puddles host star reflections, the shutters are the physical tool Mira wields to teach. Dental mirror doubles as micro-setting and charged object; its final surrender reweights the closing image. Sensory economy is strict—only star-glint, wet planks, creaking wood—mirroring Thomas’s narrowed grief attention. No world-rule inconsistency; spatial choreography clean as Mira circles, kneels, opens/closes shutters in trackable sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake = Thomas’s need to finish his unspoken goodbye; secondary = Mira’s vocational need to teach without words. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each new shutter pattern adds star-images that deepen his reinterpretation of silence as sufficient speech. One meaningful tightening when she opens the final shutter and he begins to cry—cost is emotional release, not external loss. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as a sufficient language of love, darkness as the necessary canvas for memory-light. Subtext resides in gesture—handing over the mirror = handing over the right to speak with light. Final image of reflected stars floating seaward reweights earlier shutter lessons into cosmic scale. No moralizing line; avoids sentimentality by keeping Thomas’s sob wordless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close to Mira’s silent perception; perceptual signature favors spirals, water-flow, star-glint—consistent with her “spiralingly calm” trait. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on rhythmic, imagistic syntax: “like water circling a drain in reverse, gathering rather than dispersing.” Filter verbs minimal; when used (“she understood”) they anchor silent epistemology. Compression taught early (“some truths could only be taught through silence”) and paid off in mirror surrender.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long cadence for canal descriptions, staccato for shutter snaps. Metaphors are few but precise—mirror as lighthouse—no mixed-vehicle clutter. One paraphrase loop near end: “darkness teaches us to treasure light” restates Thomas’s insight; minor. No scaffold sentences; high information density—each sentence advances image or emotional pivot. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—mute canal guardian teaching grief therapy via light patterns—is non-obvious synthesis of caretaker trope with optical pedagogy. Dental mirror repurposed as portable planetarium feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk of preciousness is present but controlled by concrete shutter mechanics and withheld authorial commentary. Transformation test passes: if guardian spoke or used flashlight, whole resonance collapses.</comment>
