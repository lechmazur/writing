<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her hands tremble, she ‘understood with the clarity…of a possibility just born’—and her puzzle-solver identity drives every micro-choice. Yet the decisive moment (planting the seed) is cushioned by passive wonder rather than a visible internal fork; we see awe, not a costly renunciation or risk. The final smile is earned but light on felt price, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: seed → coordinates → planting → space cloaks itself. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words). Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: ‘she wasn’t just safeguarding space…she was innovating space itself,’ reweighting the premise with visible conceptual cost. The only drag is a soft mid-scene lull where reflection slightly outruns new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook-pocket is richly filtered through Mira’s puzzle-designer eye—its ‘orthogonal’ geometry, mis-aligning surveyors’ tools, becomes a living trap. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: hot seed, whispering paper, soil that ‘pulses.’ This micro-setting directly constrains the final tactic—obfuscation through spatial paradox—so it charges the closure image and meets the 9- gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wild negative space—locks in early and tightens when council plans threaten. Agency sits with Mira: she commits the seed, the space begins its self-camouflage. Cost is implied not visceral: developers will fail, yet she pays no tangible personal loss on the page. Sufficient escalation for this length, but a sharper tangible price would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: innovation needs unmapped margins. The corpse-flower–as–metaphor mutates from stench to ‘scent of hidden possibilities,’ reweighting the idea without a sermon. Final image of ‘flowing…secrets’ leaves resonant ambiguity. No tidy moral, but the conceptual payoff is slightly intellectual rather than gut-punch emotional, keeping it just under the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Mira’s puzzle-logic perception; diction is precise, tactile, quietly lyrical (‘storm-born silence,’ ‘orthogonal approaches’). Rhythm flexes from short declarative beats to longer sinuous lines mirroring the brook’s cadence. No head-hop, no filter overload; voice stays modest yet confident, and the prose teaches its slight elevation early—paid off in the final cosmic shuffle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence layers motive, world rule, or sensory hook. Figurative control is tight—‘moonlight filtered through willows’ grounds later spatial paradox. No synonym loops, no scaffold clutter. One mixed metaphor—‘electric, waiting, dense with unspoken change’—is forgivable and doesn’t touch closure. Final line earns its hush without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-fantasy with escape-room epistemology; the living puzzle-space feels genuinely new. Titanum seed as obfuscation seed, developers’ instruments failing via paradox—specific, non-obvious mechanics. Risk is high (magical realism in 700 words) yet coherence never breaks. Transformation test failed: only this protagonist‐seed‐space combo works. Minor dock for slight conceptual chill keeps it sub-9.5.</comment>
