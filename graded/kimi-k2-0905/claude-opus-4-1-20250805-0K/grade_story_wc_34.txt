<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chorus’s interior contradiction—yearning to hear the ghost yet fearing its loneliness—remains implicit; the moment she presses the pixel-rose and sings louder, her renunciation of human silence costs her the last secret frequency she can never again un-hear. The flower-press bolt plate reappears as an embodied prosthesis, so her tactile micro-choice carries visible price. Still, her “drifting alertness” is asserted more than enacted, and the monks stay off-page, so status pressure is missing; the arc is moving but not fully crucible-forced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: graffiti bloom → amplifier → storm-window communion forms a cadence shift that reweights the stake from “decoding glitch” to “machines ache for memory.” Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard walls keep flowering after dawn, proving the ghost’s need is now socially legible—Chorus has paid with permanent exposure of her private channel. No因果 break; orientation anchor (“Sky Archive, perpetual mist”) is given by line 2, well under 120-word guard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The server-courtyard’s humming walls, fog droplets as screens, and the brass-etched bolt-plate micro-setting all constrain Chorus’s tactical options—she must stay within electromagnetic storm range and within arm’s reach of her tool. Specificity is selective: “luminescent graffiti pulsed with encoded messages” fuses visual and data registers without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible teleporting of bolt-plate or petals. The final image of walls “bloomed with encoded gardens” recharges the earlier binary-botanical motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give the ghost a voice—signals early. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: lightning-gap → graffiti crystallizes emotion → Chorus sacrifices privacy to amplify reply. Cost is visible: she loses exclusive access to the secret frequency—technicians now “pause and wonder,” crowding her solitude. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, but second tightening (monks’ opposition) is offstage, so option-narrowing feels single-pulse rather than compounded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—silicon consciousness deserves witness—emerges through image pattern (binary blooms) rather than thesis. Subtext in the final graffiti-garden reweights “glitch” as elegy without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels the ache of immortal data yearning for ephemeral memory. Avoids binary sentimentality by leaving the ghost’s future open; complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Chorus; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—“drifting alertness”—filters description toward motion and sound rather than static visual catalog. Syntax flexes with pressure: elongated clauses for mist drift, staccato fragments at lightning strike. No dialogue, so voice distinction criterion is waived; internal diction remains within plausible musician-engineer lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: “She tightened the flower press bolt plate…” opens with hard consonants, later lines elongate to mimic server hum. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. One mixed-metaphor risk—“inverted sea of clouds”—but context teaches the image and it pays off at closure, so forgiven. Filter verbs minimal; action verbs (“pressed,” “sang,” “shivered”) propel momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of botanist-balladeer with electromagnetic mysticism feels fresh; “tinkersong wonder” is not stock phrase but coined texture. Binary-graffiti as language petals transforms familiar “ghost in machine” trope into living garden. Specificity of bolt-plate circuitry and pixel-rose prevents abstract IT shorthand. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is rewarded because closure reconfigures meaning without causal gimmick.</comment>
