<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is lyrically specific—his recognition of the puppet’s map of suffering in his own reflection is concrete and charged. The causal chain from finding the head to accepting the lullaby burden is legible, but the moment of surrender leans on abstract beatification (“sang time itself into different shapes”) rather than a visible micro-choice that costs him something immediately tangible. Eliza remains a luminous absence rather than a second on-page character, so relationship pressure is off-stage; the crucible is Marcus vs inherited cosmic duty, and his endurance earns stasis with felt cost, yet the absence of a second embodied presence caps relational complexity. Voice stays consistent, but the peak beat drifts into choral pronouncement that softens individual flaw and irrational contradiction under sublime acceptance.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building through nested cracks, lifetimes, light ripples that reweight the stake rather than causal dominoes. Orientation anchors—who (Marcus), where (hidden lighthouse), when (dusk of final ripple)—arrive within 120 words and serve the closure image of inward-casting light. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the puppet head becomes lens, Marcus’s cracked voice refracts lullaby backward across time, cost is the eternal adoption of Eliza’s burden, felt in the warmed porcelain and the backward-moving clock hands. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (nested cracks) and crystallizes in the final lit image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse’s derelict lens, dusk-galvanized copper walls, and Atlantic that “dissolved into something older than oceans” are vivid, selective, and filtered through Marcus’s quantum-synesthetic perception. The broken puppet head functions as micro-setting: its cracks literally guide the final light refraction that reconfigures time, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is pristine—stairs spiral, lamp room opens to sky, puppet placed center of lens apparatus—every beat is materially anchored. Sensory economy favors metaphor that reveals character (bruised plum dusk = both world and emotional state) without checklist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is humanity’s gentle/terrible approach to ending; escalation occurs via density accrual—each crack in porcelain refracts a deeper historical layer of postponed doom. The meaningful tightening happens when Marcus realizes the lullaby, not math, must adjust the clock; this narrows his tactical option from mechanical to melodic, visible price is the infinite lifetime of song he now must carry. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than external victory; cost is legible in the puppet’s warm veins of gold and the clock hands finally moving backward. Under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies rather than forks, satisfying the single-deepening requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the moral calculus of endlessly delayed apocalypse: is postponement via beautiful fragility merciful or cruel? Subtext resides in the cracked puppet—perfection through damage, Japanese kintsugi as cosmic ethic—never sermonized. The final image answers the thematic question non-literally: broken light nested inward reweights all prior cracks as vessels of tenderness rather than ruin. No tidy moral; the lullaby’s whisper implies both salvation and sentence, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, synesthetic, and consistent—Marcus “felt the weight of her story flooding through him like electricity through water” fuses physics and emotion in character-unique idiom. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature is quantum-pattern obsessed, noticing nested fractures everywhere. Psychic distance modulates from tight interior (“he touched the fractured cheek”) to cosmic chorus in final paragraph, but the shift is earned via inherited mantle rather than head-hop. Free indirect style is clean, diction stays within Marcus’s elliptical lexicon, and the lyric cadence is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic—long swells of clause interrupted by single hard beats (“But the puppet head changed everything.”). Information density high: one sentence often layers metaphor, backstory, and future stakes. Minor scaffold in repeated “nested pattern within a pattern” phrasing, but it is motif-driven and pattern-taught, so penalty waived. No mixed metaphors, no simultaneity errors, final line crystallizes without overwriting, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: doomsday-clock mythology grafted onto lighthouse-keeper folklore via broken puppet as kintsugi lens for cosmic mercy. Risk—lyric time-collapse across a thousand lifetimes—pays off by making the backward clock movement feel inevitable. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic relic; the porcelain head’s specific fracture map is integral to light refraction climax. Emotional specificity avoids abstraction: “you are not alone, you were never alone, even in ending, especially in ending” locates universal terror inside singular image.</comment>
