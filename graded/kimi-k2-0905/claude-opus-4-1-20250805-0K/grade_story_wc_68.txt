<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s abrasive calm and solitary vigilante-scholar persona is vivid, but the interior contradiction—his yearning for an ally—only surfaces in the final beat; earlier his motives stay static, so the pivot to acceptance feels mildly under-cooked. The woman’s sudden disclosure of covert truth-keeping is believable because her grandfather anecdote supplies a concrete cue, yet her emotional stakes remain externally summarized. Closure choice (“Show me your method”) is legible and earned, but the cost is more conceptual than embodied; we don’t feel his body or voice crack in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens dominates: every beat turns on because/therefore links—cog → accusation → journal offer → alliance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 100 words; no penalty. Single-scene arc lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the two historians descend together, foreclosing Marcus’s solitary stance; cost is the surrender of absolute truth monopoly. No plot amnesia; chronometer lore stays consistent. Meets 9+ quick test: closure carries conceptual cost and persistent constraint (now shared guardianship of sediment-hidden truth).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sunken plaza, sewer tunnel, and barnacled statues are tactile and immediately filter through Marcus’s scavenger gaze. Water depth and marble textures constrain movement and metaphor—truth stratified like sediment. The chronometer cog doubles as micro-setting and tool, its brass edges “worn smooth” by actual use; it charges the final handshake. Spatial choreography holds: entrances, case placement, descent track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control of historical truth—tightens when Marcus realizes the university already knows the forbidden narrative; his option to keep exposing reports collapses, replaced by shared subversion. Agency stays active: he confronts, rejects, then chooses collaboration. Cost is loss of moral high ground and solitude. Escalation is single but meaningful; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through sediment metaphor: history as accreted, manipulable layers rather than fixed record. No explicit thesis statement; final image of two figures “descending deeper” reweights the premise—truth must be buried first to survive. Subtext in dialogue (“We’re preserving history” / “You’re inventing it”) carries status duel without overt declaration. Complexity acknowledged: both sides partially right, no moral symmetry forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person POV locked to Marcus; perceptual signature—bitter erudition, marine decay imagery, mechanical precision—stays distinct. Syntax tightens under pressure: shorter clauses when journal is offered. No filter-verb clutter. Dialogue indirection works: woman’s “We know” lands as silent admission of institutional complicity. Voice modulates from sneering contempt to guarded alliance without losing abrasive core.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, metaphor disciplined: “barnacles creep across marble statues through green-tinted water” fuses sight and moral decay in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes new complicity. No overwritten beats; technical detail (escapement, gear ratios) accurate and motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-plague drowned city is familiar terrain, but the inversion—citizens sank their own technology to quarantine infection—feels freshly non-obvious. Chronometer cog as both proof and navigation tool synthesizes theme and plot elegantly. Risk taken: static sewer meet-cute turns into epistemological romance; gamble pays off. Specificity of patched diving gear, electrical tape, waterproofed journal keeps world lived-in rather than abstract.</comment>
