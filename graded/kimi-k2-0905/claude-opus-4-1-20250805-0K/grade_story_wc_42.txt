<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ezra’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the dome glass, the tuning-fork memory—but the “reluctant guardian” motive is declared, not dramatized; she never resists or debates the role, so the turn from repairer to keeper feels pre-granted rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory thread (spinning hand, singing cables, leaf-fall note) layers density until the backward spin rewinds tension, landing a Charged Poise with conceptual cost—the station now literally tethered by photographed time-threads. The cost is felt in the final image, but the early causality (“clock started when first tremor hit”) is asserted, not shown, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lunar-observatory glass, carbon cables, and maple-leaf-tuned fork are specific, tactile, and protagonist-filtered; the fork’s “whisper-soft percussion” constrains the final fix and recharges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible positions—though Earth’s cloud layer vs. stars could use one beat of distance anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent the station’s temporal unspooling—tightens via sensory escalation: whine → blur → backward spin. One meaningful intensification is sufficient, and the protagonist’s agency (camera re-focus, fork strike) directly alters the waveform of tension; cost is conceptual (she must stay, archiving gaps) but not viscerally felt on her body, capping the upper band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of owning moments versus the necessity of tending their passage. The “luminous ache” refrain risks echo-like statement, yet it’s saved by the final image—her reflection overlaying Earth—where the ache is visualized as horizon-curve, not labeled, giving non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is poetically compressed yet coherent: “silver blur, a circle of light” teaches the pattern early; cadence mirrors temporal distortion without syntactic monotony. Perceptual signature—mechanic’s precision meeting aurora-hunter’s awe—remains consistent; no filter-verb clusters or register drift in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer sensory data without scaffold loops. High information density: “capturing not light, but duration—the space between moments” does triple duty (world-rule, camera mod, thematic premise). One mixed-metaphor risk—“threads of time loose from their weave” beside “temporal eddy”—but clarity survives; no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>The “camera that photographs duration” and “maple-leaf tuning fork in vacuum” synthesize fresh angles on time-and-memory tropes; the concept feels specific to this voice and setting. Risk is present—lyric SF can tilt precious—but the restraint of ending on mirrored reflection rather than explode-everything twist keeps it earned, not gimmicky.</comment>
