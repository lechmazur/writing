<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her “gift as a fault-tolerant oracle” is shown through embodied sensation, not label-speak. The contradictory impulse to stay vs. descend is held in scene, and her final choice to smudge her own signature crystallizes a hierarchy of values (truth vs. exposure) with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; her micro-choices (sleeping in closet, drawing in pencil) reveal motive under pressure. Earned renunciation feels inevitable yet wounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the smudged drawing taped to the margin reweights the entire premise—official knowledge vs. lived contradiction—with undeniable social/epistemic cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each hidden illustration adds density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—her body as “second, wiser heart”—shapes the final quiet act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mountain station functions as micro-setting: the magnetometer’s needle and condensation-curled paper directly constrain her choices. Sensory triangulation (thin air, frost, condensation) mirrors internal altitude-sickness of truth. Aurora as environment touches the final image, charging it. No spatial contradictions; tools (barometer, anemometer) are handled tactilely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the flowers’ existence vs. official disclosure—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: realizing prior keeper also hid drawings, tightening her solitary complicity. Cost is felt: she forfeits official record, accepts perpetual marginal life. Escalation is accumulative: each discovered illustration raises the price of silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge that survives only in margins, fault-tolerance as ethical stance. Final image of smudged signature offers non-literal answer—truth preserved by self-erasure. No moralizing; insight arises from specific act of drawing under aurora light. Ambiguity lingers: is secrecy noble or complicit? Complexity embraced.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“swaying like prayer flags”) and paid off in aurora’s “intimate sorrow.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira’s oracle-sight rendered as altitude sickness, electromagnetic sorrow. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs (“she could feel”) are voice-motivated, not clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for aurora descent, clipped fragments during calibration. No loops or scaffold; information dense—“her body’s knowledge” does triple duty. Metaphors coherent (aurora as grief made visible). Minor register lift (“magnetosphere”) justified by station context. Final line weighted exactly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—flowers blooming only during magnetic storms—feels fresh yet inevitable. Oracle who tolerates contradiction is non-stock; hiding botanical illustrations as resistance is specific. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens intimacy without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swap names/places and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
