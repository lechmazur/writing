<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s grief-soaked precision and the moment she smears charcoal straight onto cave crystal both feel earned; the memory gift is more label than lived constraint until the final beat, so the flaw doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken lock’s “getting out” reweights the entire premise and carries visible cost in the irreversible wall drawing; causal chain (note → cave → painting → second painting → draw) holds without gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Crystal humidity mixing with charcoal under fingernails turns the cave wall into both canvas and constraint; the cadmium-yellow splash on purple quartz is a single sensory hook that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape the safety of perfect memory—tightens once when the second painting commands “Create”; the price (a drawing she can’t perfectly recall) is legible, but external pressure stays static, not escalating again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the sisterly argument about memory vs. forgetting; the final wall-image reweights that debate without moralizing, letting auroral sorrow carry the aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Lyra’s perceptual filter—“charcoal dust beneath fingernails had become permanent” is a sentence only this narrator could own; no head-hop or register drift under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; only one scaffold loop (“Hours passed, or perhaps minutes”) slows momentum, and it’s outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The memory-artist who must forget to create is fresh; the crystal cave as studio-in-reverse transforms a grief-recovery trope into specific, irreversible gesture.</comment>
