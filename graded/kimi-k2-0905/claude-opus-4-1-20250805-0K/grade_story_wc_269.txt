<comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete and sensorily anchored; the tapping habit, diary fragments, and reflected face build a consistent perceptual signature. Contradictory impulses—scientific duty vs. ancestral pull—coexist in scene, powering the final dive. The cost is felt: she jettisons the atlas page and moors herself to a transformed world, foreclosing a safe return. Only minor hedge: “determined eyes” skirts cliché, but the embodied rhythm pattern compensates.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the station’s descent reweights the premise—Mooreton never drowned, it transmuted—with visible cost (anchoring system lowered, no way back). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tapping + coral imagery tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: each tap beat accumulates evidence that lets her risk the dive. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (17 m above hillside, bleached reef) land by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Station floor panels, ventilation breeze, and coral-as-architecture constrain her choice to dive; environment literally shapes the final image. Sensory hierarchy (glass sings, metal hollow) is filtered through POV bias, not tourist catalogue. Micro-setting—the torn atlas page—functions as portable anchor whose eventual discard charges the closure. World rules stay internally consistent: transformed town = coral skeleton, no late physics cheats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover why some paths disappear”—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation. One meaningful deepening: coral shifts from “death” to “transcription,” narrowing her options to diving or perpetual drift. Cost is legible: she sacrifices professional distance and physical safety when she lowers the station. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulate—“periodically eternal,” calcium silence, rhythm memory—never sermonized. Final image of her face superimposed on coral city reweights grandmother’s diary without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: is she joining or being consumed by the transformed town? Insight is earned through tactile pattern recognition, not abstract assertion. Subtext in the tapping: code vs. heartbeat, science vs. ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical: precise instruments (pH, salinity) braided with mythic cadence (“white as funeral bones”). Perceptual signature—tapping tonality—remains character-specific under pressure. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression (“seventeen meters above what the torn atlas page claimed was solid ground”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences perform world-fact, emotional charge, and metaphor (“reef blazed with color, before the great bleaching, before the waters rose”). Rhythm varies: long accumulative clauses build to short decisive fragments at dive moment. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line is taut, read-aloud cadence that echoes opening tapping without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate grief re-imagined as metamorphic archive rather than apocalypse. Coral-as-city transcends eco-elegy by turning loss into unreadable architecture, an idea that feels inevitable only after the final image. Risk taken in quiet lyric descent pays off by reconfiguring reader’s own map of loss. No recognizable template or stock trope; specificity of tapping code and grandmother diary anchors originality.</comment>
