<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip thermo-sensitivity, the fossil’s warmth, her micro-choice to drift closer to the alien heat. The contradiction between scientific duty and unnameable awe is embodied, not declared. However, the final shift from “speak for” to “teach others to hear” is asserted rather than dramatized, softening the cost. Still, her embodied dread and curiosity carry the scene; the flaw is minor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each chamber layers thermal history until the alien pattern breaks the lattice. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kira’s map-making goal is repriced from solo translation to communal pedagogy, cost legible in the fossil’s disintegration. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (cave, tide, fossil). No causal contradictions; ellipsis between human and post-human tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The limestone cave system is活得： “breathed with each tide,” thermal strata as readable archives. The fossil and harness function as micro-setting, constraining every drift and scan. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—temperature gradients dominate visual detail. Final image of “conscious darkness” recharges the cave as sentient archive, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she map the post-human emotion without losing her own compass—tightens when the alien signature overwrites human strata. Escalation is textural: each chamber adds thermal density until the unreadable color breaks pattern. Cost is visible: fossil crumbles, her exclusive sense is sacrificed to communal teaching. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: archival grief, the ethics of translating what you can’t own. Subtext lives in temperature itself—warmth as both comfort and colonization. Final reconfiguration avoids moral—her new role is implied, not preached. Fossil-to-dust image reweights “transitional object” from comfort to expendable tool, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “taste temperature variations down to a thousandth of a degree” is precise yet sensuous. Syntax lengthens during drift, compresses at fossil crumble, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays thermo-centric. Register never slips into lecture; even abstract “conscious darkness” is anchored in tactile cold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The caves had changed during the Sleep” compresses 200 years without stall. Metaphors are coherent—thermal “constellations” extend to alien “colors” without mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Minor cadence repetition (“Kira… floated… drifted”) but occurs early, not at closure, so caps at 8.5 not 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cli-fi, xenolinguistics, and emotional paleontology—fresh yet inevitable. Thermal emotionography is not gimmick; it rewrites what “archive” means. Risk in second-person cave consciousness pays off when closure demands communal pedagogy. The synthesis feels post-human without losing human longing; no template echoes detected.</comment>
