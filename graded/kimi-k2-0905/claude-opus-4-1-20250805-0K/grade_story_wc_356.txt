<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. olfactory revulsion—stays embodied and scene-locked; her “trembling fingers” on the seed, later “breathing deeply” into the bloom, trace a credible arc. Micro-choices (sketching, dawn-dew watering) are character-specific and accumulate to the Earned Stasis of enduring the stench as initiation. No secondary character applies pressure, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. The only drag is a faint therapy-speak whiff (“she understood: this was her test”) that slightly flattens the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the village sways with the flower’s stench while Mira, rooted in new stillness, breathes the reek—cost is visceral. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed→sketch→soil→bloom layers density until the final image reweights “serenity within motion.” Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“High in the canopy…”) and never drifts. No meaningful lens ambiguity or artifact at the closing beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The treetop village is not backdrop but lived-in kinetic constraint: swaying bridges, lightning-scorched soil, dew-filled web cups—all handled in goal-directed motion. Micro-setting (the suspended garden pot) literally bears the corpse-flower and is charged in the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: olfactory channel dominates, visual stays mist-filtered. Only minus: “morning mist…like steam from a witch’s cauldron” is a stock simile that briefly drifts into generic fantasy boilerplate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove mastery of “undercurrent of wisdom” via blooming a corpse-flower—is signaled early and tightened when the first shoot appears; success requires enduring the horrific odor as visible cost. Agency is present in every dew-collection and sketch; the final stance crystallizes when she inhales the stench rather than fleeing. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ecological and olfactory. Cost is unmistakable on the page, meeting 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: stillness-in-motion is enacted by village, plant, and apprentice alike. The wrapping-paper palimpsest of ancestral sketches becomes the quiet answer—wisdom accrues by layering attention, not seizing it. No moralizing, no thesis shout; the final breath of rot re-prices “stench” into initiation. Resonant reconfiguration lands because every prior beat (swaying, sketching, scent-tracking) feeds the closing image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a hush-mist cadence that modulates under pressure: short percussive clauses during shoot emergence, elongated sway-sentences at bloom. Perceptual signature is smell-first, paint-palette precise: “putrid-sweet promise” is both accurate and character-bound. No dialogue, so no register-clash risk. Single POV remains stable; no head-hop. The faint template-cadence in “She watered it with dew…when the world balanced…” is the lone hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “dew collected from spider webs at dawn” packs time, method, and ritual). No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay within physical logic (“village swayed…like a living thing” is coherent). Two near-miss mixed metaphors (“tide’s thought” / “sap beneath bark”) appear mid-story but do not infect closure; they nick the ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: corpse-flower apprenticeship + arboreal sway-village + olfactory genius is not a trope stack but a single organism. The ancestral wrapping-paper journal transforms real botany into lived folklore without exoticizing. Risk—using stench as spiritual rite—pays off because the cost is inhaled on the page. Not quite 9 because the bloom climax is foreshadowed so cleanly that surprise is moderate; inevitability slightly outweighs revelation.</comment>
