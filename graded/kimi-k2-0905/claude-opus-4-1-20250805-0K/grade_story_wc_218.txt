<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority stays concrete—her trembling hand on the pillar, the tumor as live antenna—yet the diary-voice sometimes slips into abstract thesis (“the caretaker’s role is to die at the correct frequency”). The contradiction between her systematic precision and bodily fragility is dramatized, but the final readiness feels slightly accelerated; causality is intact, cost visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the six-month sentence flips from death warrant to appointment, felt cost inscribed in the phosphorescing pillars. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of copper lattice and mineral light reweights the stake. One shard, no orientation drift; the hum in the stone is the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Temple orchard fuses with Mira’s body—copper against bark, tumor against stone—so the setting literally channels her final choice. Living stone pillars return as the glowing mineral interface; environment constrains the closure image. Sensory hierarchy obediently narrows to electromagnetic vibration under dying perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate or lose the council—tightens when each coil forecloses human resort blueprints. Escalation operates by accretion: every copper wrap increases density of meaning until the orchard shudders into new rhythm. Cost is legible: her life-span becomes the conduit, no other option remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies translation emerges through mineral light and root syntax, never lectured. Final image reweights “remodel” from concrete to perceptual without moralizing. The diary’s pressed leaves carry silent echo of prior caretakers, letting ambiguity linger—will the trustees hear or bulldoze?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice owns scientific precision blended with coastal weathering—“salt spray on a windless day” sets perceptual signature. Compression in “die at the correct frequency” is earned by prior copper mathematics; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates from methodical coil placement to the final shudder, cadence mirroring electromagnetic swell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear clean; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density high—copper mechanics, mineral glow, tumor antenna packed without scaffold. One mixed metaphor “salt spray on a windless day” is vivid enough to pass. No loops, no filter stacks; final third remains artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—dying caretaker becomes living modem for tree-stone parliament—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Copper-as-translation and tumor-as-frequency avoid stock eco-fantasy. Risk in merging neuroscience with animist geology pays off because specifics (spiral direction, tension levels) stay granular. Transformation test fails if Mira ≠ dying, proving necessity.</comment>
