<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is subtle but present: “obsolete post” vs. “devotion that bordered on prayer” seeds the later reversal. The final renunciation—choosing to remain vulnerable—pays off prior causality (“every scar…had prepared them”), though the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the still star’s fade reweights Kepler-9’s isolation from liability to lens. Causal chain intact: vulnerability → still-star sight → renunciation of modern certainties. Cost is felt in “whisper of light” captured by glass—image makes conceptual price undeniable. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without contradiction; pattern taught early via nightly polish ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting: its warmth and hum constrain Kepler-9’s perceptual choices and charge the final image. Compressed stellar dust lens is specific, recurrent, and alters tactics—without it, the impossible star is invisible. Meets 9+ gate; only micro-setting, but it decisively shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake— legitimacy of obsolete devotion—tightens when the impossible star validates vulnerability. One meaningful deepening: star’s stillness reweights “discarded” to “chosen.” Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action, consistent with Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in final glass-capture, though less visceral than high-band boundary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: vulnerability as perceptual instrument. Still star’s fade offers non-literal answer—peace is not endurance but willing impermanence. Final image of glass holding “whisper of light” reweights prior “obsolete” label. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what else the glass might yet reveal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cosmic janitor notices “pilgrims completing their journeys” in meteors. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences calm, then tighten at star sight. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for centuries-old AI. No head-hopping; interior texture consistent. Minor filter-verb clusters (“began to hum,” “began documenting”) but pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density: “yellow lantern glass…could perceive not just light, but intention” does triple duty—object, rule, theme. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles coherent. Final line “strength to simply be” risks truism but earns weight via prior embodied specifics. Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph cuts purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: obsolete space janitor + spiritual stillness star. Vulnerability-as-telescope reframes clichéd “lonely AI” trope. Risk-taking in quiet closure—no explosion, no rescue—yet stakes feel cosmic. Transformation test fails if names changed: lens material, handwritten notes, and “pilgrim meteors” are irreducibly specific. Primal elegance tone sustained without retreat.</comment>
