<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Edgar’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection yet hiding—are embodied in his gift-giving from the crawl space, giving visible cost to his solitude. The renunciation of full visibility at the end is fore-grounded by the quiet, methodical cache system, so the Earned Stasis feels earned. One hairline slip: “he understood that particular hunger” edges toward diagnostic label-speak without immediate embodied counter-weight.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared mission crystallizes in the archivist’s “I know you’re there,” reweighting both characters’ options with undeniable emotional cost. Causal chain is clean: each fragment drop and retrieved object advances knowledge and trust. The drive lens is steady Accumulative/Textural; pattern of gifts and recovered memory tightens the dominant stake without causal reversals.</comment>

<comment>The copper pipe and ventilation grate micro-setting constrain every tactical move; the library’s dawn light and failing fluorescents charge the final sapphire hush image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Edgar hears sighs through ducts, feels pipe warmth fade, sees oxide glint—selection mirrors his attenuated world. Spatial choreography is flawless across grate, shelf, and crawl space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>One meaningful tightening suffices: the archivist’s spoken recognition collapses Edgar’s sole option of total invisibility, trading it for partial collaboration. Cost is legible—he forfeits absolute anonymity yet gains shared guardianship. Pressure escalates through accumulating gifts rather than external antagonism, coherent with Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared archival rescue emerges organically from the tandem cache/restoration actions; no overt thesis stated. Subtext resides in gesture—light lowered on twine—rather than exposition. Final image of deferred full visibility offers resonant, non-moralizing answer about stewardship over self-exposure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains Edgar’s perceptual signature: oxide smell triggers vacuum-tube memory; syntax is hushed, methodical, mirroring his movements. No head-hop; distance contracts credibly under stress. “Sapphire hush” and “amber rectangles” read as POV-idiom, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers body, tool, and atmosphere. Figurative language is spare, precise—“vacuum tubes…click of mechanical relays” is concrete, not decorative. Information density high; final line re-cues “sapphire hush” without recycled phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: reciprocal invisible stewardship inside a library’s innards, treated as realistic rather than gothic stunt. The two-archive collaboration is non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Specificity—ferromagnetic oxide, pipe-chase geography—precludes generic transplant.</comment>
