<comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—“chill seep through her skin,” “smiled, her work complete”—and her climb is a credible micro-choice chain. The contradiction between mischievous child-turned-artist and deliberate insurgent is implied but not fully dramatized in-scene; we’re told rather than shown the instant she risks capture. Because the stakes leap from whispered line to systemic uprising without an on-page beat that tests her resolve, the final stance feels slightly over-calibrated. Still, the embodied sensory detail and the cost of permanent echo keep her above the safety middle.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the ossuary becomes an irreversible amplifier, costing the Silencers their monopoly and Kira her safety. Causal logic holds—because she climbs and speaks, the chamber’s memory is seeded—though the off-page prisoner chorus is an ellipsis that could weaken causality in a longer piece. Orientation is anchored by word 50; the three-hour clock is invoked early and tightens the shard. The single-scene default is met; no prop teleport or knowledge breach.</comment>

<comment>The bone towers function as both landscape and tool: handholds, resonance chamber, and acoustic prism constrain every tactic. Mist and canyon acoustics are filtered through Kira’s artist ear—she notices harmonics, not geology—satisfying the POV-bias test. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, distances, and sound paths track cleanly. The pale spire reappears in the final image, reweighted from accusation to transmitter, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—shatter the monopoly on truth—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each refracted poem. The tightening beat is the moment Kira speaks the first line into the tower; that live utterance forecloses stealth and ignites the acoustic contagion. Cost is visible: once the chamber remembers, erasure would require demolishing the tower—an undeniable social price. Agency remains hers; the off-page chorus is an extension, not a luck event.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through the acoustic metaphor: truth as light through water, multiplication inevitable. No character moralizes; the final line lets the image of bending light carry the repricing. The canyon’s shift from ossuary to chorus reweights “forgiveness” from Silencer currency to communal memory—complex, non-tidy. Subtext of reclaiming bones as voice is earned by the opening tactile contact and the final pulse of the spire.</comment>

<comment>Perceptual signature is strong—artist’s synesthetic ear, “words are prisms”—maintained in diction and metaphor. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for misty awe, staccato for bootsteps. Filter verbs are minimal; only one “she felt” appears and is justified by tactile cold. No head-hop; interiority stays strictly Kira. Non-standard grammar is absent; voice remains clean yet textured.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “The forged hush… broke apart like ice in spring” compresses acoustic physics and seasonal thaw in one clause. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—light, water, bone, echo—without purple swell. One mixed image (“flame through dry kindling” for sound) is minor enough not to dull the closure. Final line lands with imagistic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bone-tower ossuary as truth-prism is a fresh synthesis; not a stock dystopia gadget. The inversion of silence-weapon into multiplicity-instrument grows organically from Kira’s childhood acoustic play, making the payoff feel inevitable. Risk is taken: systemic uprising compressed into a single speaker’s utterance, yet the canyon’s acoustic logic justifies the scale leap. Specificity of “handholds carved by previous prisoners” prevents abstract anywhere-setting.</comment>
