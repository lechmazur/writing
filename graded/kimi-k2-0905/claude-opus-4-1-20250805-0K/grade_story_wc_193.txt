<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—bitter remembrance of the scheme versus wonder at the farm—are alive in-scene; the bolt-turn micro-choice visibly costs her old identity and forecloses retreat. The “virtuously mischievous” tilt shows only in the final quip, not in earlier stakes, keeping her short of full complexity. Still, embodied emotion (palm on cold bolt, laugh as “pure music”) and the earned shift from filtered victim to capstone creator satisfy the 9− band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: turning the bolt rewrites the pyramid from scam to筛选, felt cost is legible (“she’d been climbing toward light all along”). Causal lens holds—each glitch message tightens the “therefore” toward the counter-clockwise act. The Orientation Test is met by word 80; no ambiguity at exit. Minor slack: Dr. Chen’s off-page invitation is told, not dramatized, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The farm is not backdrop but tool: bioluminescent pressure literally forges diamonds, constraining her tactic of “dancing with pressure.” Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—she notes cold metal, fungal stars, drifting spores—while spatial choreography stays crisp. The submarine bolt re-anchors repeatedly, acting as micro-setting that charges the final image. One tiny physics wobble: “shadows dance backwards” is impossible light logic, but it is brief and thematic, not choice-breaking.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute failure into value—signals early and tightens through each glitch message; the final bolt-turn narrows options to zero except ascent. Cost is visible: she pays with her survivor identity, now crystallized into literal glowing diamonds. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each promise-spore increases density until the pattern break of counter-clockwise turn. Luck complicates (messages) but does not resolve, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: “every scheme that tried to break her had only been teaching her to shine” is an image, not a maxim. The bolt–pressure–diamond motif reweights from souvenir to capstone, tying personal fraud to cosmic forge. Subtext lives in gesture (palm on metal, laugh timbre). Final line avoids tidy moral, offering Charged Poise where cost is the irreversible rewrite of her past.</comment>

<comment>Perceptual signature is strong: Marina’s crypto-scarred diction favors financial metaphors (“quantum multiplication protocols,” “exponential returns”) even for fungi. Rhythm tightens under pressure—single-clause pulses during convergence. Glitch texts get telegraphic compression, cleanly distinct from narrative flow. No head-hopping; distance stays mid-deep consistent. A hairline register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” moment is allowable lyric heightening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “promises drifted through the air like snow made of light” fuses two jobs (visual + metaphor). No synonym loops; sentence openings vary. Figurative language clusters only at climax, but pattern is taught early (“each fungal cap a tiny star”), so qualifies as payoff rather than overwrite. One participle simultaneity hiccup—“watching how it cast shadows that seemed to reveal”—does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The crypto-pyramid-to-actual-diamond transformation is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; failure-as-filter is earned, not asserted. Risky speculative frame (parallel texts, concept-physics) stays coherent because rule is taught early and closure pays off. Specificity of bolt-as-key and mushroom-farm-as-forge prevents template drift. Final inversion—“you were learning to be the peak”—feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
