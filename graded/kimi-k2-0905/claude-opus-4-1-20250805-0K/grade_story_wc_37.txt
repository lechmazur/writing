<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied grief in the pewter-bark touch, contradictory ache for a dawn she hates to remember—but her decisions stay reactive; she “begins with a whisper” rather than choosing a bold new tactic. The communal turn is lovely, yet her agency is diluted into choral passivity; the cost we feel is collective, not personally compounded. She earns the ending only as conduit, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each layered memory/song thickens the weave until the cadence shift of “woven dawn” re-prices reality. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the mica window glows with generated, not reflected, light—undeniable social cost: they must sing tomorrow and forever. One soft spot: the inciting lack-of-dawn is stated, not dramatized, so the before/after snap is slightly less tactile than the final re-weighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mirror-world physics obey dream-logic consistent inside the piece: lightless greenhouse, iron lattices that ring like bells, mica that answers to memory-frequency. The greenhouse itself acts as micro-setting/tool: its iron frame vibrates under song, forcing the communal stance. Tiny bobble—“endless night” never clarifies temperature, hunger, bodily urgency—but sensory hierarchy stays narrowed to touch and sound, so the lapse is minor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reignite dawn—signals early; pressure escalates by accretion: each recalled fragment tightens the song-weave, foreclosing solitude as a live option. Escalation turns on participation, not external antagonist; the price is future perpetual labor (“tomorrow they would need to sing again”). That cost is legible, though mild; could be sharper if one singer’s refusal risked actual loss mid-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific communal rituals (bread, fireflies, dew on silk) rather than thesis—it’s the shared anticipation, not “community” as slogan. Final image of self-generated dawn reconfigures the concept: light becomes an ethical debt rather than gift. One near-moral line—“salvation…would come from remembering”—is saved by the paragraph’s earthy catalogue that follows. Ambiguity remains: is this utopia or eternal choir-prison? That tension lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception: “scattered pearls from a broken necklace.” Filter verbs are minimal; syntax grows paratactic under song-crescendo, mirroring breathless choir. No head-hop; choral voices stay exterior, reported. Register can tilt precious (“swaddle emptiness itself”) but remains coherent to fairy-tale mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is music itself; sentence length swells and contracts with hymn cadence. Occasional metaphor density in three successive lines (“maracas filled with dead seeds,” “swaddle emptiness,” “husks rattled”) flirts with overwriting, but pattern matches ritual excess so stays purposeful. Zero loops, no synonym churn. Pronoun and prop tracking clean; greenhouse framework returns exactly as resonating bell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fantasy of manually woven dawn avoids obvious allegory; inversion—community creates physics—feels fresh. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation works; no late twist, but the re-pricing is non-obvious. Specificity of “baker kneading before cockcrow” rescues prompt concept from generic “light” trope. Could edge higher if one world-rule contradiction had threatened to unravel their song, testing ingenuity under pressure.</comment>
