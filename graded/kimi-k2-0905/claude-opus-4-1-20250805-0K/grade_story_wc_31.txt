<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlow’s synesthetic gift and Elena-loss drive feel lived-in; the hotel-key habit and lantern-tending anchor her body in scene. However, the decisive “I accept” moment is announced more than dramatized—no micro-choice visibly costs her anything in the final beat, so the arc tilts toward declaration. Interiority stays concrete, but the beat that should pay the emotional invoice is summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky lanterns reweight Marlow’s reality and foreclose hiding. Causality holds—Elena’s journal triggers the vow—but the vow itself is not tested by an on-page obstacle; the cost is conceptual (exposure) rather than felt. Orientation is clean: hatch-to-deck geography is trackable. Under Accumulative lens, the final image reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ cost test at surface level, but the lack of a tangible price keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drowned library is tactile—ankle-deep brine, pulp spines, tilted deck—and the brass lantern confines Marlow’s reach, charging the final key-raise. Micro-setting (hotel key tag against collarbone) recurs and constrains the ritual. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but POV bias is sharp. The 9+ gate is met: the lantern/tool and submerged hull together shape the closing gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the color of sound—signposts early; the journal discovery tightens once. Yet pressure plateaus after that single deepening; no new obstacle complicates the vow. The cost is conceptual (revealing the Luminous) rather than tactical, satisfying Accumulative escalation but lacking a visible price that alters next moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden perception emerges through Elena’s journal and the lantern ritual, never sermonized. The color-of-sound quest reweights from personal curiosity to communal revelation, but the final line (“our real work begins now”) drifts toward meta commentary, slightly thinning resonance. Still, ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marlow’s synesthetic filter; diction (“meteor hush,” “copper and jade” notes) is idiosyncratic without purple overload. Syntax mirrors her flux—long cadences for drift, fragments for shock. No dialogue to distort. POV modesty holds: she infers Elena’s presence, never claims omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but metaphor density crests in the climax (“concentric rings of deep violet”) without pattern payoff, risking momentary swirl. One paraphrase loop: “lanterns rise / lanterns ascent” idea repeats. Otherwise clean syntax, strong verbs, zero typos. Artifact stays below closure-break threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic lamplighters in a half-sunken ship-library is inherently fresh; the hotel key as synesthetic tuning fork pushes it further. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off in a resonant final image rather than twist. Tropes (lost sister, secret society) are reanimated through sensory world-logic. Conceptual integrity intact: the story commits to its metaphysics without late cheats.</comment>
