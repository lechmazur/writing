<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. the orchard’s warning—stay active in-scene; the apple bite crystallizes a fused identity whose cost is felt in the ash that remains. Interiority is concrete (“dusky resolve settling into her bones”), not therapeutic. The keeper’s single line of dialogue is enough to register external pressure; no head-count clutter. Only the “fiercely gentle revolution” tag edges toward label-speak, keeping it just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elena’s destiny is unfinished, therefore Mara descends; because she burns the card, therefore the orchard offers fusion; because she bites, the card turns to ash—visible cost that forecloses return. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves closure, so waiver applies. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the ash shape rewrites the rule-set. One micro-turn (realizing the card was self-burned) tightens options exactly where needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bone-woven roots literally constrain reach and posture during the apple pluck; the phosphorescent fruit’s warmth is the final image that recharges the burned-card motif. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Mara notices baker, mother, dancer bones because she seeks Elena’s story. Spatial choreography is clean: steps → corridor → deepest chamber → climb out. Environment shapes tactics and charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“patch the soul without erasing self”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the keeper’s warning. Escalation is causal: each new corridor narrows escape options until only fusion remains. The apple bite pays a visible price (card ash) that permanently alters her revolution tactics. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal is needed under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fusion act: destiny is negotiable love-debt, not property. Subtext lives in gesture—ash settling into “something new” speaks without moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: revolution now carries orchard-ghost cost. Only the keeper’s “reckless belief” line flirts with thematic echo, barely keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “half-lit corridors brightened with each step” mirrors internal shift. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short beats at the bite. No head-hopping; keeper’s voice is external stimulus only. Distinct rhythmic control and dusky lexical register hold to the last ash-shaped sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative vehicles stay coherent (veins, cathedral, sediment). One mixed metaphor—“reckless belief that destiny could be negotiated with love”—is earned by prior causality and does not blur closure. High information density with purposeful paragraph cuts propels the ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Catacomb-orchard of bone-fed apples trading unfinished fates is a fresh, fully committed conceit. The burned Fool card repurposes tarot as self-inflicted wound, not prophecy. Fusion of two women’s destinies into a third revolutionary path transforms both “fixer” and “ghost” tropes. Risky premise lands with coherent emotional cost, meriting the bonus.</comment>
