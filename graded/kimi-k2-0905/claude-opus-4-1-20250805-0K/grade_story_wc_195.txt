<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aldric’s solitude-isolation and latent hunger for language are viscerally embodied; his decision to speak the oath feels inevitable yet costly. Interiority stays concrete—armor “dissolving” into possibility, blood-seeds sprouting—so transformation is felt, not declared. The only drag: we never see the contradiction that once kept him silent; the renunciation is pure surrender, not a visible clash of values. Still, the wooden hand he clasp charges every later image with the price of leaving human form.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a lucid Conceptual Repricing: the greenhouse walls crack open to “unmade light,” Aldric becomes guardian of latent worlds, and the cost—his human solidity—glints in the final image of blood-turned-trees. Causal links hold: marionette program → oath → puppets wake → reality layers unsnap; each hinge is on-page. Orientation is swift (who/where/when in first 90 words) and the Accumulative/Textural lens thickens until the final membrane-breach reweights all prior imagery. One minor wobble: the “three centuries ago” snap is told not shown, but it only backdrops, never breaks, the present causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse-as-body: every surface breathes—glass is “permeable membrane,” obsidian floor drinks starlight—so setting actively squeezes Aldric toward surrender. The silver trees and marionettes share origin wood, turning environment into recursive tool that later sprouts from his own blood; this闭环 lifts the scene above postcard grandeur. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: knight notices armor catching phosphorescence, tastes copper-snow, never catalogues for tourist sake. Spatial choreography stays clean—hand-off with puppet, seeds hit floor, walls crack—anchoring the surreal in tactile geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—possibility vs. human form—signals early via “pages… demanded he remember language.” Escalation is accumulative: each tree he passes whispers new formulae, tightening the lure; the oath beat narrows choice to speak or remain exiled; taking the puppet’s hand severs the last human option. Cost is visible—armor dissolves, blood seeds new trees—and forecloses return; the illumination that floods in is “of unmade things,” a lived price, not abstract victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of inhabiting potential before it collapses into choice; no character moralizes this. The returning image of silver wood—first in trees, then in puppets, finally sprouting from Aldric’s veins—reweights the orchard as both cradle and grave of possibility. Subtext lives in gesture: the puppet bow is an acknowledgement that guardian is now kin to tool. Final line (“waiting to be born”) offers resonant ambiguity—creation or captivity—without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aldric’s perceptual grammar: “feeling the cold iron give way to something older” is a knight’s tactile metric. Syntax lengthens under wonder, then fractures into staccato clicks of wooden feet, mirroring pulse. Diction stays credible—“phosphorescent glow,” “liquid starlight”—never drifts into academic overload. No head-hop; even marionette agency is filtered through Aldric’s dawning recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with escalation: long, liquid sentences in orchard rows contract to clipped “He took the puppet’s hand.” Metaphors are coherent—armor dissolving into “necessity of its existence” keeps abstraction tethered to physical stakes. No synonym loops; “possibility” accrues new modifiers each appearance, avoiding repetition fatigue. One hairline slip—“shivering bliss” approaches oxymoron cliché, but the embodied cost (splinters, blood-seeds) grounds it before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines knight-errant, alchemy, and puppet-theatre into a fresh synthesis: the marionettes are not spooky props but living calculus-trees’ offspring. The notion that reality-weaving is taught by a forgotten puppet script is non-obvious yet feels inevitable once the shared silver wood is revealed. Risk—letting hero become translucent quantum-guardian—pays off by making the greenhouse’s night literally pregnant with futures. Specific detail (“alphabet that predated human speech”) keeps concept from drifting into generic mysticism.</comment>
