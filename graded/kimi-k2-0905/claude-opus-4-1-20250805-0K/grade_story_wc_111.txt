<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marta’s contradictory impulses—tending a “dismal 2.1” garden while hoarding cracked marbles—are dramatized in scene, not summarised. Her micro-choice to press a fresh, sharp marble into the girl’s palm crystallises her hierarchy of values: propagate deceitful hope over measurable truth. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; the “bloom-rot” smile is an embodied, idiosyncratic image. Cost is visible: every new crack in the marble collection is a scar she both cherishes and cannot stop accumulating.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the maze “laughing” reweights the entire luck-index premise without exposition. Causal chain holds: because Marta lies to plants, they survive; because she gifts the lie, the girl leaves with altered tactics. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 50 words; no disorientation. Persistent constraint—Ministry scanners—shapes every tactic; cost is felt when inspector capitulates. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: accumulation of cracked marbles tightens meaning until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden maze is not backdrop; its copper-wire spiral physically commemorates victories and constrains Marta’s ritual path. Body-as-setting appears in “gnarled fingers,” tactile handling of marbles, and the act of polishing—objects that charge the final gift. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound: she hears hedgerows “whisper,” feels cracks “sharp,” ignores visual panorama. Weather is absent by deliberate selectivity—this is a woman who listens to leaves, not skies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—prove gardens can outwit measured luck—is signalled in paragraph two. Escalation is accretive: each polished marble is a micro-victory that deepens the pattern rather than reverses it. Agency visible when Marta selects the newest, sharpest marble to gift; this forecloses her keeping it, a tiny but felt price. Cost legible: the more she gives away cracked truths, the closer she edges toward running out of protective lies.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—lies that enable life—emerges through image and act, never thesis: cracked marbles, copper spirals, roses blooming at 2.1. Final instruction “Tell your seedling it’s a mighty oak” reweights earlier deceits into transferable ethic. Subtext in silence: Marta never claims luck is fake, only demonstrates it. Emotional after-effect is complex awe rather than moral decree; reader left wondering if society needs more beautiful liars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays strictly inside Marta’s perceptual filter: hedgerows “whisper secrets only she could understand.” Syntax grows vine-like—long, looping sentences that mirror maze paths, then tighten into short imperatives when she gifts the marble. No head-hopping; inspector’s POV is rendered only as external gesture and dialogue filtered through Marta. Diction remains horticultural, weathered, never drifts into Ministry jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: calm garden stroll yields longer sentences; gift moment snaps to monosyllables. Figurative language is spare—one “lightning-crack” simile, one “bloom-rot” oxymoron—each charged with closure weight. No synonym loops; “marble,” “crack,” “lie” recur only when meaning accrues. Every sentence advances knowledge or image; zero filter-verb clusters in high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luck-index premise is fresh angle on eternal hope-vs-fate debate; cracked marbles as lie-records invert usual “flawless orb” symbol. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—garden-maze specificity is integral. Risk in quiet ending pays off: no rebellion, only contagious deceit. Final inflection non-obvious yet inevitable: gifting the lie perpetuates the system rather than smashing it—an ethical twist that lingers.</comment>
