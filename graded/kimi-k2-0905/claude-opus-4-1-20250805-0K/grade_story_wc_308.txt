<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Yula’s centuries-long vigil is rendered through concrete micro-choices—pressing the arrowhead to her sternum, reading vulture spirals—so her Earned Stasis feels paid for. Interiority stays embodied (“weathered resolve unbroken”) rather than abstract. The only lack is an on-page contradiction that shows what sitting still costs her body or mind in this final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echo, dust, and bird pattern tightens until the 300-year-old pulse returns and reweights meaning. Closure is the Charged Poise of that echo meeting her whisper—“I am still here”—with visible temporal cost. No因果 breaks; all memory access is anchored to present stimuli (arrowhead warmth, vulture rhythm).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bone towers, arrowhead engravings, and flock intervals form a micro-setting that actively constrains her navigation tactic; their acoustic library enables the final resonance. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (she notices sound decay patterns, not visual panorama). Canyon operates as both memory palace and instrument; removal would collapse story logic.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“learn to navigate without moving”—faces one meaningful tightening when the wandering pulse syncs with her heartbeat, proving stillness works. Cost is the 300-year erosion of self into dust layer; this felt price is legible in her weathered whisper. No external antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and acoustic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of journey = motion; wisdom arrives via sediment, not mileage. The returning echo re-prices the concept of navigation itself. No moralizing—final image is silence after whisper, letting the paradox resonate. Ambiguity remains: is she transcendent or fossilized?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; syntax mirrors acoustic recursion (“spiral,” “echo,” “return”). Diction stays within archaic observer lexicon—no corporate register slips. Perceptual signature is birdsong-as-notation, maintained under pressure. Compression (“layered dust coated her shoulders like a second skin”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence. Information density high—each sentence layers time, body, tool, sound. Metaphors are coherent (dust = skin, pulse = ghost) and never mixed. Final line lands with percussive monosyllables that echo canyon acoustics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stone-skimming as temporal navigation, bone towers as sonic libraries, vultures as notation—none feel grafted. Conceptual risk (300-year stillness) is fully committed to and pays off. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; the canyon’s acoustic logic is irreplaceable.</comment>
