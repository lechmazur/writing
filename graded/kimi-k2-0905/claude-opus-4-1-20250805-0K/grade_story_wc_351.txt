<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Vera’s contradictory engineer-vs-seer impulses are dramatized in her tactile micro-choices—tracing cracks, injecting neurotransmitters—culminating in the earned renunciation of normal perception. The visible cost (tremoring consciousness, dawn exile) scales to length and is causally hinged to the mirror’s Fibonacci cuts. Interiority stays concrete (“tasted the metallic fear”) and avoids label-speak. Voice remains single, so relationship bullets are correctly waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure lands cleanly: the dawn carry-out reweights all prior fragments into her neurons—an unmistakable Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (“the canyon released her reluctantly”). Orientation is anchored by word 60; no late ambiguity. The Fibonacci mirror pattern is taught early and repaid in the final image, satisfying pattern payoff waiver. One minor loop: “abandoned dreams” is repeated four times; paraphrase penalty −0.2 prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mirror’s Fibonacci shard-as-setting constrains every subsequent beat and literally charges the final image when she “packed the mirror fragments.” Moonlight on canyon walls is filtered through Vera’s engineering retina, narrowing to helical shadows that guide her scalpel—selective, POV-driven. Sensory hierarchy is obeyed: metallic taste under stress, star-gleam in quiet beats. World rules stay consistent (no physics breaks); spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she crouches, climbs, packs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—excavate abandoned dreams—signals in para 1 and tightens when each injection narrows her future options (irreversible neural rewiring). The periscope’s entangled memories act as escalating pressure: every cracked segment forecloses normal cognition. Cost is visceral: tremoring body, altered time-sense, dawn exile. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as unfinished civilizational code—emerges from Vera’s tactile struggle rather than thesis. The final image (museum of interrupted futures inside her) offers non-literal, resonant answer. No closing moral stated; “abandoned dreams” refrain is thematic texture, not echo. Subtext operates in mirror-gleam silences and the taste of someone else’s fear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Vera; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is engineer-helix: cracks read as “neural pathways,” moonlight as “silver spirals.” Syntax elongates under drug reverie, contracts during tremor—rhythmic control serves pressure. No dialogue to judge; free-indirect cleanly fused. Purposeful elision (“years studying”) is taught early and paid off at carry-out.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and plot work—“broken periscope mirror catching fragments of stars” simultaneously sets object, stakes, and cosmic scale. Rhythm breathes: long anaphoric cadence under moonlight, staccato tremor beats under injection. No mixed metaphors; Fibonacci/helix vehicles stay coherent. Minor synonym loop “abandoned dreams” repeated four times; −0.2 keeps sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fibonacci-cracked submarine periscope as memory-fossil is a fresh synthesis; no familiar template echoed. Concept of neural self-rewiring to read military regret is non-obvious and pursued to conceptual cost. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens rather than obscures closure. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming specificity.</comment>
