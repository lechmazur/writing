<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marlene’s contradictory impulses—protecting fugitives while documenting them—are dramatized through the ash ritual and mask gesture; her final stride through the portrait crystallizes renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“she knew better”) and embodied (porcelain edges press skin). The burned-record ash and inherited mask tie flaw to tactic, making her complicity inevitable. Choice to scatter Thomas rather than preserve him is earned by earlier pattern of ephemeral absolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marlene’s walk-through erases both portrait and promise, reweighting the gallery’s mirage with undeniable conceptual cost (“illusion of transformation, false promise”). Accumulative lens holds: each ash portrait is a repeating unit whose demolition at the end tightens the stake. Orientation is clean—gallery, borderland gray-zone, night—by line 4. Persistent constraint (ventilation system) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gallery’s contested-border rule-set directly enables the fugitive pipeline and Marlene’s double agency; the marble floor becomes the screen on which both art and evidence vanish. Micro-objects—porcelain mask, rocking-chair cadence—constrain timing and ritual. Harsh track lighting and ash grains ground sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography remains coherent as boots later grind ash into grain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—temporary safety versus ultimate exposure—tightens when Marlene scatters the portrait rather than preserve it, foreclosing her own redemption. Escalation is accumulative: each completed portrait increases institutional attention (sirens approach). Cost is visible: Thomas dies mid-portrait, his last breath lost between shadow and highlight. Agency is renunciation; she could hide but instead obliterates evidence under officers’ boots.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated vanishings: art as absolution, record as indictment, safety as fleeting mirage. Subtext resides in silence—never telling subjects the complete truth—and in the final image of ash ground into marble. No moralizing; the reweighting is felt when mask meets scattered face. Emotional aftereffect is sober awe at complicity’s elegance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person omni-Accretive voice is stable, with painterly perceptual signature: “each grain fell exactly where she intended.” Rhythmic control accelerates toward final scatter, then contracts into single declarative line. Diction stays within lexicon of artisan (“negative space,” “ventilation system”). No head-hopping; exterior officers remain opaque, preserving Marlene’s lens. Syntax mirrors ritual cadence without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: ash as burned records performs double duty—medium and evidence—within single image. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances Stakes, Setting, or Character. Metaphor vehicles stay consistent (ash=time, mask=legacy). Rhythm breathes between portrait completion and incoming sirens. Minor −0.2 for “shattered porcelain shards” redundancy; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—borderless gallery where art erases fugitives—feels fresh yet inevitable. Porcelain war-mask repurposed as template fuses history and craft. Final re-pricing of safety-as-mirage is non-obvious synthesis of portrait and indictment. Risk in quiet ending pays off through charged stasis. Could swap mask for another heirloom, so −0.3 for partial swappability.</comment>
