<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Margot’s interiority is sharp—her dry aside to the falcon, the instinctive pocketing of the phrasebook, the micro-choice to trust the inspector all read as particular to her. Yet the “subtly confident” trait is asserted more than embodied; we see competence but not the visible cost of that confidence under threat. The final alliance lands cleanly, but the emotional contradiction between obsession and risk is sketched rather than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: empty message tube → condensation epiphany → decision to share. The closure beat—“I can show you where the rivers begin”—pays off the polyglot’s breadcrumb trail with a concrete, irreversible offer; the cost is the surrender of sole ownership of her discovery. Orientation is secure within 120 words; the inspector’s arrival is coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, satisfying situational lens rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost asymmetry on wings, cataract-eye lake, rusted desk acreage: every visual is filtered through Margot’s cartographer gaze and guides her next cognitive leap. The outpost itself—groaning metal, condensation on glass—functions as micro-setting that literally supplies the watershed map, constraining her revelation and later her choice to collaborate. Sensory hierarchy stays disciplined; cold is tactile, sound is wind-groan, no tourist catalog. Final image of the lake “keeping its secrets” recharges the opening frost pattern, earning the high band.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exclusive knowledge of the subglacial rivers—is signaled by word three (“empty”) and tightens when official eyes arrive. The single meaningful turn: secrecy → shared risk; the price is immediate and legible—she hands over the phrasebook, losing informational monopoly. Pressure stays coherent under situational lens; no false escalation loops. Could edge higher if the inspector’s threat felt sharper on the page, but the foreclosed option is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of buried flow—knowledge, water, language—emerges from patterned particulars rather than statement. The polyglot’s dog-eared “genesis” lexicon and the condensation dendrites reweight each other without authorial gloss. Final image of two people spreading charts over rust while ice waits outside offers a quiet conceptual repricing: spring may come, but only through collective risk. No moralizing, only charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Margot; perceptual signature—measurement metaphors, dry understatement, attention to asymmetry—remains consistent. Syntax breathes with her cognition: long sentence for map-overlay, fragment for decision. No head-hop; inspector’s interior is opaque, read only through weathered features and quiet line. Voice modulates under pressure: humor thins, diction tightens, yet never breaks cartographer precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; every paragraph advances stakes or image. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“cataract eye” lake, “herald’s gesture” from the falcon—no mixed-metaphor clutter. One paraphrase loop detected (“worried tranquility” echoed twice) but it occurs early and does not touch closure. Final line cadence mirrors opening frost pattern, earning high-band ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Combines glacial eco-SF, linguistic archaeology, and cloak-and-dagger in a synthesis that feels inevitable once revealed. The condensation-as-map device is fresh, low-tech, and specific to this world; removing it collapses the plot. Risk is taken—quiet epiphany instead of action set-piece—yet coherence is preserved. Not quite 9+ only because the inspector’s entrance leans on fortunate timing, slightly dampening boldness.</comment>
