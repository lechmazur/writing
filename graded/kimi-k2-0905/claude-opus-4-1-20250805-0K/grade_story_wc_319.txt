<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The guardian’s slow thaw from feral to almost-human is embodied in every beat: the click-growl, the bare feet that leave no frost-prints, the tears she forgot she could shed. Interior contradiction is live—she both loathes and clings to the pendant that keeps her exile vivid. The final micro-choice—handing over the pendant instead of clinging to it—pays the cost of her earned return and is seeded by every prior moment of homesick ache. Voice convergence at the end is acceptable because the scholar’s words are filtered through the guardian’s resumed capacity for language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the thawing garden and the first voluntary step into uncertainty reconfigure both exile and rescue in one image. Causality holds—pendant → recognition → codex → transfer → step; each beat tightens the option set under an Accumulative lens. The cost is palpable in the final line: “luminous uncertainty” names the price of leaving the frozen stasis she has become. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3 and re-anchored at the shard break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen fountain with the cracked cherub, the mist that swallows footprints, the sideways-only shelf—these are not backdrop but tools that constrain movement and perception. The pendant’s obsidian weight and the frost that “crunches like broken glass” return in the final thaw, recharging the same sensory register. Micro-setting qualifies: the pendant itself is the portal and the prison key; its cold against her sternum is the physical seat of exile. Environment directly shapes the climax—garden thaws only when the pendant is relinquished.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape versus incorporation into frozen exile—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through each sensory freeze. One meaningful tightening: the scholar’s arrival narrows the guardian’s options to act/respond rather than merely endure. Cost is visible—she pays with the pendant, her last tether to origin, to enable the crossing. Agency is present yet quiet (endurance, recognition, transfer); the lens is Accumulative, so causal reversals are not required, but the pressure of perpetual winter accumulates to the breaking thaw.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: exile literalized as winter inside the body, rescue as the risk of re-humanization. The boundaries of light motif reweights at closure—light no longer bars but dissolves borders. No moralizing; the final image answers the thematic question—can one leave the wilderness without losing the self?—with the non-literal act of stepping into unmapped illumination. Subtext lives in gesture: handing over the pendant is both surrender and reclamation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is thick with cold: syntax lengthens and clots during reflective passages, then fractures into single-clause beats under pressure (“She waited one last heartbeat…then stepped”). Perceptual signature is acute—light is drunk, frost is audible, words are “foreign architecture.” No head-hopping; scholar’s dialogue is external only, filtered through guardian perception. Compression in the final paragraph mirrors thaw: sentences shorten, warmth returns to diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, pressure, or interior shift. Metaphors are spare, never stacked: “obsidian surface drinking light” is the only figurative reach in the climax beat and it lands clean. Information density high—one line slips setting, body, and history: “bare feet…crunched like broken glass beneath her, the same frost that had grown inside her ribs.” Rhythm accelerates across the final paragraph, propelling the step into uncertainty without a single adverbial hedge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen-monastery-as-exile is familiar, but the inversion that the guardian becomes the garden’s skeleton and eyes feels fresh and specific. Pendant as both anchor and key transforms the usual talisman trope into a reversible portal. The “boundaries of light” concept re-prices familiar inter-dimensional travel as a perceptual rather than mechanical problem. Risk is taken in the quiet, lyric climax—no battle, only a single step—but coherence remains intact.</comment>
