<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—her body “carried” an erased twin, the emerald card pulses against her palm—but the moment she must choose between pinning the card or keeping it, the beat is summarized, not dramatized. Coraline’s status as a living contradiction is compelling yet her motives stay declarative (“you can pin it here, forget…”) without a visible cost that squeezes Marina’s choice. The final renunciation is credible because the prior science obsession has been embodied, but the emotional crescendo is slightly under-choreographed; we are told “she would remember” rather than shown the bodily cost of that promise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Earned Stasis: Marina pockets the card, embracing an unprovable guardianship; the cost is the now-unbridgeable distance from Coraline who is already “softening into suggestion.” Causal chain holds—card summons, ship reveals, twin offers exit, protagonist refuses—but the final beat is compressed into one sentence, muting the tangible price. The因为只有一句话，代价的“体感”略显抽象，但概念代价（终身携带不可知）在页面上已不可撤销，满足CR要求。</comment>

<comment>Rusted calliope pipes, salt-crystallized cotton candy, and the emerald-eyed mare are selective, sensual, and thematically charged; every descriptor is filtered through Marina’s scientific gaze. The ship-funhouse functions as a body-scaled micro-setting whose rotting floorboards and peeling waves directly constrain movement and mirror memory slippage. The backdrop never drowns the beats; instead it supplies Coraline’s rhetoric of “narrative threads” and gives the final image its mineral-pink decay, passing the 9+ gate by charging the last look back at the dissolved *Reverie*.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—prove an erased twin existed—tightens when the carousel offers to absorb the emerald card as another forgotten name; this narrows Marina to a binary that carries lifelong epistemic cost. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each salt-rotted prop is a memento mori of memory, and the fog literally alters her recall, re-weighting the price of refusal. Agency is present but once-removed; Coraline articulates the trade-off while Marina’s yes/no is internal, slightly dampening the visceral punch required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: scientific certainty vs. narrative erasure. The emerald color returning in both card and painted mare gives a subtle reweighting without symbolic overkill. Wisely avoids a thesis sentence; instead the final image of a “warm green pulse against her palm” lets the reader feel the unending burden of evidence that can never be shown. Complexity is honored—Marina’s victory is also a life-sentence of doubt—delivering an earned, bittersweet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marina; perceptual signature is scientific, synesthetic—she “compares shades of decay,” hears “ghost notes” in metal. Lyric compression (“names dissolve in the garden of forgotten names”) is pattern-taught early and paid off when Marina herself feels her memories reorganize. No head-hop; Coraline’s dialogue carries ringmaster cadence without caricature. The free-indirect line “she’d come here to recapture something” cleanly slips inside Marina’s diction, satisfying 9- band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “rusted calliope pipes singing ghost notes” fuses sound and image in one stroke; no filler. Rhythm varies from staccato ladder climb to longer clause when fog thickens. Occasional poetic stacking (“mineral formations…pink sugar transformed”) risks purple but stays anchored to Marina’s chemist eye. No loops, no template cadence; closing line “that fragment of sister-color” is a satisfying textural payoff.</comment>

<comment>Forgotten-names-as-garden inside DNA and narrative denial is a fresh synthesis; the carousel horses as literalized lost identities transforms familiar trope of derelict carnival into ontological repository. Risk of concept-heavy piece is countered by constant sensory image and bodily cost. The emerald swatch redefined as maternal bloodline color rather than mere MacGuffin shows specific, non-obtrusive ingenuity. Final reconfiguration—she carries unprovable proof forever—feels inevitable yet not pre-visible.</comment>
