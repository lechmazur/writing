<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory motives—academic certainty vs. filial chaos—are palpable, but her final “smile” is an unearned therapy-speak epiphany; we never see a micro-choice that proves she accepts the cost of her father’s addiction. The stranger’s entrance feels engineered to voice the theme rather than apply pressure, so the interior turn reads diagnostic rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is loose: subway clues → library stakeout → stranger delivers thesis. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (“mathematics of contradiction had no proofs, only practice”), yet the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no forfeited job, no burned bridge, no quarter fed to the hospital slots. Orientation is clear by word 80, satisfying the waiver, but escalation is purely declarative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rainwashed library glass, mica-pane lantern fractals, and amber refractions are vividly selective, mirroring probability vs. chaos without overt symbolism. The micro-objects—lantern panes—literally overlay her equations in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting must charge closure. Quiet, economical, atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—Elena’s need to reconcile father’s gambling with her own probabilistic faith—but no live option is foreclosed; the stranger simply hands her the insight. The single “tightening” is the power cut, yet it alters nothing she does. No visible price is paid; cost remains abstract, so escalation stays mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: probability as comfort blanket vs. lived contradiction. The lantern’s refracted rainbows silently reweight the premise in the last paragraph, avoiding moralizing. The subway-philosopher conceit flirts with pseudo-profundity, but the ending image is spare enough to let ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s mathematically tinged perception; diction—“equations she’d never solve,” “pretty lies mathematicians told themselves”—is character-specific and rhythmic. One micro-POV slip: “probably feeding quarters” drifts into father’s off-stage interior; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught via “rainbows that danced across her equations,” paid off in closure. Clean mechanics, high density, no scaffolding—each line advances atmosphere or interiority.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “underground mathematics society” graffiti trail is a fresh twist on secret-message trope; it fuses academic satire with urban folklore. Clover melancholy tone and mica-lantern optic feel idiosyncratic and inseparable from this piece—swap the objects and the concept collapses. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
