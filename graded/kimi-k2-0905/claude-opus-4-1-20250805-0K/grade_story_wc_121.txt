<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kira’s interior contradiction—yearning for wholeness while refusing to collapse any timeline—remains vivid and embodied; the floating body and tablet’s weight externalize the split. Micro-choices (pressing the “collapse / unite” rune, finally touching stone) trace a believable arc from diffusion to integration. The elderly Kira apparition supplies externalized pressure, but because she is still Kira, the scene never becomes a true relational crucible; the stakes stay solipsistic. Cost is felt: the dusting tablet and solid footfall are tangible prices, yet the merging of selves is narrated more than dramatized, muting the ache that would push this to 8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story teaches its accretive, lyric pattern early—viaduct rebuilding itself, drop-vs-ripple interval as chronotope—and holds it cleanly to the Earned Stasis close. Causality is conceptual rather than sequential: pressing the rune triggers macro-integration, foreclosing omnipotent drift. Orientation is immediate: who/where/when locked by line 3. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “touched down…no longer needed by someone who had finally learned the difference…” The choice is irreversible and paid for by surrendered omniscience, satisfying closure under Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor hairline: “procedural generation” is named late, but the viaduct’s morphing teaches the rule earlier, so lens ambiguity waived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent moss, anti-gravity pathway, and rain-smell ground the world in sensory specificity; the viaduct’s color shift from amber to sickly green mirrors Kira’s internal decay. The tablet’s impossible mass and the procedural bridge morphology act as kinetic setting-objects that constrain tactics—floating is obligatory until integration. Spatial choreography stays crisp across the dissolve-and-rebuild mechanic. The final footfall on stone gives the environment a conclusive role, clearing the 9-micro gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—singular self vs. infinite possibility—announced in paragraph 2 and escalates via procedural bridge iterations that literally narrow her walking options. Each viaduct rebuild is a tightening under Accumulative lens: density increases, timelines collapse inward, cost becomes visceral (fragmenting consciousness). Agency resides in pressing the feared rune; that act materially forecloses omniscient dispersion. Escalation is steady rather than spiky; one meaningful deepening suffices for 750-word span.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-as-labyrinth emerges through imagistic recurrence (bridge that mirrors fears, tablet that exceeds mass) rather than thesis statement. Final image reweights “floating above life” into “truly living,” accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext carries in silence: the vanished viaduct implies acceptance of finite identity. Minor deduction for quasi-philosophical snippet “difference between floating above life and truly living it,” which edges toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Kira; perceptual signature is concrete—physics-bending weight, shifting runes—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythmic control peaks in the white-flare/dimming sequence, cadence mirroring entropic collapse. No dialogue, so no register drift. Slight overworking of gerundial openers (“Between the drop and the ripple…”) softens syntactic variety in one stretch; not severe enough to breach 8+ threshold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers external motion and internal tenor (“path behind to dissolve and reform ahead”). Metaphors stay internally coherent—bridge as labyrinth, tablet as black-hole mass. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding detected. Opening line anchors voice, closing line richens it. Micro-issues: occasional adjectival flourish (“sickly green,” “quantum foam”) but these track Kira’s lexicon; no clarity break.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Quantum-suicide / omnipresent self is familiar SF conceit, yet remix through procedural viaduct and bioluminescent stone localizes it. Inflection is the reverse of typical “multiverse liberation” trope: here, victory equals pruning possibility. Specificity of tactile tablet and anti-gravity gait makes the template fresh. Risk in lyrical compression succeeds; closure remains legible. Not quite a 9 because the emotional calculus of merging selves could probe an even sharper particular.</comment>
