<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira’s grief-driven compulsion to chase her mother is viscerally embodied (“pulse against her palm,” “weight...settle into her bones”), and the shard’s cyclical returns give a credible backbone to her expertise. Yet the leap from “I must find Mom” to “we will map the repairs” is declared, not dramatized; the interior calculus that swaps centuries of guilt into instant collaborative resolve is summarized in one beat. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent, and the final joint action carries a modest felt cost—the shard dissolves, ending its comfort—so renunciation is earned if not fully foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dissolution crystallizes a new mission and forecloses the old cycles. Causality is accumulative; each jump enlarges the unseen environmental debt until the nexus confrontation makes the cost legible, satisfying the “because/therefore” lens. No orientation debt—who/where/when are anchored by line 3. The mother-exile explanation arrives in one compressed paragraph of exposition, but it is positioned as the reveal the whole search was buying, so momentum survives. Cost is visible: the shard vanishes, their future now one of endless, un-glamorous mending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bioluminescent fungi bay and underwater hangar are sketched in two-line micro-bursts, but each variant re-weights the dominant stake by revealing another tear in reality—so setting functions as crucible not backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean: shard-to-temple, redirect, re-orient; bodies track. Sensory translations (“rust became the taste of copper bells”) are selective and POV-driven, avoiding tourist-catalog syndrome. The shard itself ultimately constrains the final choice; its dissolution recharges every prior description, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—“find Mom / decode the withheld truth”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each bay variant that exposes another quantum tear. The tightening beat comes at the nexus: discovery that map-makers themselves are the apocalypse agents, forcing an immediate tactics shift from exploration to repair. Protagonist agency drives the climax—she offers the shard and the new methodology, paying the small concrete price of its loss. Conceptual cost is large (lifelong penance), but on-page price is modest; still legible under accumulative lens and sufficient for sub-800-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: knowledge pursued for love mutates into ecological guilt, then into collaborative atonement. The green glass motif returns not as ornament but as tool-to-be-sacrificed, reweighting meaning from compass to suture. Subtext of generational complicity is carried in silence—the mother’s exhaustion, the daughter’s instant comprehension—rather than spelled out. Final image of “infinite universes waiting to be saved” offers a charged poise; no moral is declared, yet the emotional after-effect lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Kira’s synesthetic perception; no head-hop. Diction remains inside her sensory lexicon—“probability streams,” “quantum foam”—without drifting into faux-technical jargon. Rhythm accelerates into fragments during jumps (“Another redirect. The bay underwater...”) then lengthens for the maternal confrontation, mirroring emotional tempo. Mother’s one line carries harmonic overtones, a brief convergence that reads intentional rather than voice-slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: “gravity pulled sideways” packs world-rule, peril, and viewpoint in four words. Figurative language is selective; no mixed-metaphor collisions. Sentence variety is purposeful—long sensory cascade, staccato redirects—creating propulsion without algorithmic feel. One minor scaffold: “the shard had appeared cyclically...” restates the next sentence’s content; a −0.2 ding, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Parallel-universe travel is familiar turf, yet the synesthetic mapping angle and ecological penance for inter-dimensional tourism feel freshly synthesized. The shard’s cyclical spontaneous arrivals invert the usual “chosen artifact” trope by making its recurrence a liability, not a power-up. Specificity—copper-bell taste, violet whispers—anchors the concept in sensory particulars impossible to swap out generically. Risk taken: no antagonist except their own vocation; coherence holds, giving a +0.2 risk bonus within band.</comment>
