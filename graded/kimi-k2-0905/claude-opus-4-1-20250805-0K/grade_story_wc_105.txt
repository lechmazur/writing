<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—genius inventor still deaf to the one frequency she needs—drives every beat. Her embodied synesthesia (“heard it as rainfall on leaves”) and the micro-choice to fire the corroded forge anchor idiosyncratic agency. The final renunciation—accepting the double-edged sound of trust—pays off the grandfather’s cellular-tumor memory with visible cost. Only slack: the “cells divide” refrain is told, never felt in her body under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of absent sounds builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Each shard (aurora, forge, wrecks) layers negative space until the final cadence reweights “trust breaking = trust being born.” Closure lands on-page: she fits the heavier device, hears the full spectrum, forecloses vengeance. Orientation is crisp by line 3; no causal breaks; cost is tactile (“heavier despite no mass”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse, salt-corroded forge, and hull-splitting wrecks are not backdrop but pressurizing tools: the forge heats, the ships groan against the frame, the waterlogged trees limit movement. Micro-setting (forge anvil) literally brands the aid with absence. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elena’s synesthetic bias—color always arrives as sound. Spatial choreography survives the vertical descent from glass roof to pressurized chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hear the frequency of betrayal—tightens once: when the forge imprints absence, options narrow to either vengeance or acceptance. Agency is intellectual (design, imprint) not physical risk, but the cost is legible: device gains irreversible weight of collective loss. No reversals, yet the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Could edge higher if a live external pressure (e.g., hull breach) forced the final listen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: every object (wreck, tumor, forge) stores lost sound; the Insight arrives as image, not thesis—“the sound of trust breaking…indistinguishable from…trust being born.” Double-edged epiphany is earned by prior silence-collection, not asserted. Ambiguity lingers: is she healed or merely resigned? No moralizing, no echo of prompt language. Minor dock for late repeat of “cells divide” abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: color→sound synesthesia governs every description (“aurora…low thrumming”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during forge action; no head-hop. Free-indirect stays inside Elena’s diction—“drowning hands,” “overripe fruit.” Compression (“eternal Arctic summer made time irrelevant”) is taught early and paid off in timeless closure. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—image, backstory, metaphor (“apple trees swayed…like drowning hands”). Rhythm modulates from lyrical cadence to staccato forge beats. No template cadence, no mixed metaphors; “cellular faith” is the only near-abstraction but saved by biological grounding. One paraphrase loop (“cells divide and renew while she worked”) keeps this from 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes climate-gothic, synesthetic hard-SF, and cellular-memory magic into an inevitable whole; no trope catalog feels checked. Risk—the entire plot is a quiet montage—pays off because closure reweights absence as presence. Specificity: salt-corroded forge, oilcloth notebooks, “precise moment a cell decides to divide differently” feel discovered, not googled. Fresh inflection: trust’s sound is a root releasing soil—image could not exist in another story.</comment>
