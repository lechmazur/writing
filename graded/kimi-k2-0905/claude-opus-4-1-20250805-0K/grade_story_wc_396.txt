<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically sketched—“shadows danced lighter” gives embodied change—but her contradictory impulses stay summary (“anger before she’d learned to weave shadows”). The keeper is atmospheric furniture; no status pressure or micro-choice from him tests her. The apple-eating moment lands as symbol, not renunciation with cost. Peacekeeper identity is asserted, never weaponized or jeopardized, so the arc feels thematic rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: mirrored glimpses build density until the apple crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is swift; no penalty. Closure reweights the premise—“bridges” refigure her shadows—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is loose (how does tasting an apple reconstitute prior violence?) yet coherent under lyric-accumulative rules taught early; no breaks, only light abstraction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orchard-warmth versus grinding ice creates immediate tactile stakes; the mirrors’ trapped futures supply micro-setting that constrains Mira’s reading choices. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and reflected light, filtered through her peacekeeper bias. Spatial choreography is clean: palm on bark, keeper emerges, vintage store interior, descent. Final image of dancing shadows reuses environment to show internal shift, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map empathy onto action”—is declared early but never materially tested; no tactical option is foreclosed by failure or price. Pressure escalates texturally via mirrored glimpses, yet Mira’s agency stays observational: she looks, understands, accepts apple. No reversal or trade-off occurs; tension plateaus rather than tightens. Closure supplies resonance, not escalation, capping score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-anomaly emerges through mirrored futures and orchard warmth, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext lives in the keeper’s silence and the merchant’s rejected reflection. Final image of “invitation” reweights shadows without sermon. Some lines flirt with thesis—“warmth generates from understanding”—but stay tied to concrete miracle, keeping abstraction tolerable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature blends noir-cool (“shadow-woven uniform”) with lyrical uplift. Syntax modulates: longer cadences for wonder, clipped fragments for pressure. No head-hopping; keeper’s dialogue carries subtext of weary foreknowledge. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb clutter. Voice feels singular and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; most sentences dual-task atmosphere and insight. Occasional poetic overlap—“impossible growth and mirrors full of healing glimpses”—slips toward stacked modifiers but never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Metaphors stay coherent within orchard/optic domain. Clean copy; minor hyphenation choices acceptable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Empathy orchard above arctic ice is fresh synthesis; mirrors that show futures of forgiveness reframe standard prophecy trope. Merchant’s shattered crystal repurposed as distributed conscience is elegant inversion. Conceptual risk—peace forged through passive ingestion—could feel pat, but text sells it via accumulative lyric pattern. Specificity of copper-apple taste and shadow-bridge image prevents generic uplift.</comment>
