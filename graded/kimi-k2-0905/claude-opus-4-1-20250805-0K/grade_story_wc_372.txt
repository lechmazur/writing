<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her numbing fingers, the taste of frost, the way she whispers into the “quartz hush.” The micro-choice to pocket the 9.7 child’s slide and later the founder’s slide shows a hierarchy of values under pressure. The closing vow “I promise to begin again” is earned: her meticulous cataloguing has already foreclosed the option to save every slide, and the cost is the avalanche of loss she feels as the library falls. Only the mild “therapeutic” echo in “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion” keeps this from 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story’s density of luminous slides and rising temperature reweights the stake—what can be carried when everything melts. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elara’s final vow explodes the scale of the founder’s slide, reconfiguring the archive from perfect preservation to selective, living memory. Cost is legible in the image of her clutching one glass square while thousands “dissolve as warmth crept in.” Causality holds: every slide she rejects is a because that sharpens the final therefore—she can only save what blazes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen library is not backdrop; its temperature is a timer that deletes options in real time. The glass slides function as micro-setting—handled, weighed, and ultimately weaponized when the founder’s slide projects heat that should destroy yet instead crowns the chosen. Spatial choreography is clean: vault edges warm first, older rows flicker, Elara moves methodically inward. The “quartz hush” and crystallizing breath are sensory filters particular to a woman who has breathed this air for three centuries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how many vows can outrun obliteration—tightens each time Elara’s calipers click. The meaningful turn arrives when the unmeasurable slide appears: it forces her to abandon the metric hierarchy she trusted and embrace subjective, singular value. Temperature-rise supplies visible price: every rejected slide liquefies, altering later tactics—she accelerates, fingers fumbling, satchel limited to fifty. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues. The escalation is a density curve of light lost, not external villainy, perfectly aligned with the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not volume but intensity; curation is also genocide. The luminous vow concept re-prices itself—from salvation of all to salvation of the brightest, then to the vow that promises to remember the forgotten. Subtext lives in gesture: the way other slides “bow” toward the founder’s projection wordlessly argues that collective memory needs a living custodian. The final image of one woman falling through clouds with a single blazing slide offers a non-literal answer: archives die, carriers don’t.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside Elara’s perceptual signature—frost patterns, prayer-bell footsteps, the taste of quartz hush. No head-hop. Diction—“cataloguing,” “luminous frequency,” “preservation satchel”—is shaped by three centuries of occupational obsession. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She moved faster now, ice cracking beneath her feet” propels. The only POV drift is the half-sentence explanation of the founder’s intent, but it is brief and immediately re-anchored in Elara’s gasp, so distance control remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the scene: long frost-laden clauses for calm, staccato fragments as vault warms—“Not enough.” No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is spare and precise—“warmth seeping from the walls like blood from stone”—one simile, high impact, no muddle. Information density is high: “6.3 on her scale” does double duty (world-rule + emotional verdict). Zero paraphrase loops. Final line “a quartz hush that would echo in Elara's dreams forever” lands as earned resonance, not ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The merging of dying promise + magic lantern slide + spectral library is a fresh synthesis; no close precedents in genre or lit-fic. The inversion—cold preserves light, warmth destroys—reverses physics to emotional truth. The concept that vows have measurable “frequency of intention” is a non-obvious mechanic that charges the climax. Risk is taken in the quiet ending (no heroic salvage of the building) yet coherence remains. Specificity of detail—label worn away, calipers gauging luminosity—grounds the fantastical in tactile process.</comment>
