<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s shift from bunker‐bred claustrophobia to aerial expansion is embodied in micro-choices—pressing glass, uncorking vials, dancing under inverted gravity—each one tethered to the porcelain doll’s pulse. The contradiction between inherited fear and hunger for open silence drives every beat; her final vial for her father shows cost scaled to length. Interiority stays concrete, never slips into label-speak. Only absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible untested, capping the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Conceptual Repricing: the act of bottling “gilded quiet” reweights safety from compression to expansion, with the father-vial as visible, felt cost. Causal lens holds: doll crack → tendril → harvest → reformed doll forecloses return to bunker logic. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleport or amnesia. One 40-min clock, one inversion, one tightening—sufficient for 700-word span.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The trellis, doll, and inversion itself function as micro-setting: golden lattice dictates mobility during gravity flip, doll’s hollow sets the silence-garden’s root, clouds-as-inverted-mountains steer Mira’s vertigo. Each environmental detail is filtered through her bunker-trained attention—selective, tactile, goal-driven. No static postcard filler; every sense note (honey-copper hush, frost-whispers) changes tactical possibility. Setting thus constrains choice and charges the final vial image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture a different flavor of quiet”—tightens once: inversion opens the harvest window, then narrows as gravity re-asserts. Agency sits entirely with Mira: she chooses to fill vials, dances, decides to bring one to father; luck only complicates. Cost is dramatized: porcelain fracture is irreversible, satchel weight literal, father’s bunker path foregone. One meaningful turn sufficient; could edge higher if a mid-inversion obstacle forced a trade-off beyond time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: safety re-defined from bunker contraction to aerial sprawl. Subtext lives in gesture—hand on glass, doll warmth, vial weight—never in exposition. Final image of bottled starlight handed downward reweights premise, offering non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity intact—father’s fear neither mocked nor erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is concrete, selective, bunker-versus-sky diction. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed pre-inversion, lyric elongation during tendril bloom—then re-grounds. No head-hop; doll “pulses” focalized through her palm. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries rhythm without drumbeat pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “clouds drift below like inverted mountains” does three jobs in seven words. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“silence as presence...silence as...”) but it pays off pattern, so waived. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motif—no scaffold cuts needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—silence-harvesting sky-trellis during gravity inversion—feels fresh yet inevitable. Porcelain doll blooming sound-garden transforms familiar “magic object” into atmospheric engine. Emotional specificity (bunker vs. breathing) prevents abstract nowhere setting. Synthesis of airborne hostel and molecular inversion is non-obvious yet causally integrated; risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
