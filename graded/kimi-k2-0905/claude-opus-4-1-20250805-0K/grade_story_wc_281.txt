<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s embodied interiority is vivid—her skin registers David’s wonder as gooseflesh, anchoring the shift from skeptic to participant. The willowglass smile, however, is named more than dramatized; we never see it crack under strain. David’s skepticism softens too smoothly: one immersion and his doubt melts without residual cost. The final stance is earned, but the emotional middle could carry more friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the studio becomes a public conduit, the geode’s light corridors reweight “empathy” from idea to lived architecture. The causal spine holds—crushed pill → visible lattice → David’s goose-bumped conversion—each beat tightening options until the final image forecloses retreat. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the last line: “pathways…waiting to be illuminated” signals perpetual responsibility, not triumph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Light itself is the setting; muscovite dust and projector beams give tangible edges to a black-box studio. Micro-setting succeeds—the geode shard functions as portable architecture, constraining every angle of light and thus every subsequent choice. Sensory economy is tight; only visual and haptic channels are needed. One slip: “fractally precise” is used twice without variance, dulling the texture at peak.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove hidden pathways exist—arrives early and tightens once: David must step inside the lattice or remain an outsider. Agency sits with Maya throughout; crushing the pill is the irreversible beat that raises the cost of failure (public humiliation if the lattice collapses). No external antagonist needed; internal risk of seeming delusional supplies pressure. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: empathy as literal infrastructure rather than moral slogan. Subtext resides in gesture—David’s hand finding hers inside projected walls—showing connection becomes physical architecture. The recalled-pill critique of pharma profiteering is slipped in as one causal spark, not lecture. Final image reweights “pathways” from metaphor to maintenance duty, leaving aftertaste of stewardship rather than miracle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Narrative voice stays close-third to Maya, filtering scientific lexicon through tactile bias (“dendrites of possibility branching through space”). Rhythm compresses under pressure—short clauses when lattice stabilizes, then elongates as David steps inside. No head-hopping; David’s awe is externalized through Maya’s skin response. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” in narration) momentarily breaks POV lexicon, but only once.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do two jobs (action + image). One paraphrase loop: “pathways that were already there” echoed in closing line without new spin, costing −0.2. Metaphors stay physically coherent—light corridors don’t violate optics established. Filter-verb tally low; only two “she felt” in 700 words. Final line avoids explain-everything trap, ends on image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise marries muscovite conductivity to neural empathy—a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable after the lab accident. “Telepathy pill” trope is rescued from sci-fi cliché by reframing it as reveal, not enablement. Risk taken: no antagonist, no reverse. Willowglass hope could have been gimmick but bends without breaking under pressure of public proof. Specificity of mineral physics grounds the speculative leap.</comment>
