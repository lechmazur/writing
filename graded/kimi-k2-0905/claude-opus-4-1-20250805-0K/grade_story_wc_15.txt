<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Calla’s interior contradiction—poet-turned-weaver who clings to a drowned past while stitching an impossible future—remains vivid and embodied. The “phantom stitches” and salt-stiff fingers show emotion without label-speak. Yet her final smile arrives with no fresh micro-choice on the page; the cost of her endurance is told (“visible as petroglyphs”) rather than dramatized, blunting the Earned Stasis. Still, her flawed, obsessive lens feels individual, not templated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sleepwalk layers a spiral path that reweights the stake—threading ruin into reverence—until the final image crystallizes Charged Poise. Closure is on-page: the painted children colonize the canyon wall, undeniable conceptual cost (“permanent as petroglyphs, ephemeral as tide”). One causality wobble: the plate’s sudden animation is not prepped by any tactile cue earlier, a micro-teleport, but it pays off within the lyric pattern so the waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Red sandstone, barnacled petroglyphs, and salt-bleached illustration plate act as micro-setting that constrains each stitch Calla can or cannot make. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and color—cool sandstone, bleeding pigments—mirroring her haptic obsession. Spatial choreography stays clean across the spiral overlap zone; no floating bodies. The canyon’s “breathing” rule (tide pools in desert stone) is learned through action, not lecture, and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the broken world be re-stitched—signals early and tightens via each night’s new overlap narrowing her allowed thread-routes. Agency is rhythmic attention rather than explosive act: she forfeits sleep and safety to sew, a visible price (“drowsiness claimed her again”). The final tightening is the plate’s children escaping onto stone, foreclosing return to the old stories. Cost is legible but not viscerally new in the last beat, holding it shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the insistent return of incompatible elements—ocean and desert, permanence and tide—rather than any moral statement. Subtext lives in gesture: her fingers keep moving while her mind drifts, suggesting creation as reflex against grief. The ending’s orchid-solace image reweights earlier motifs without labeling them, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Minor slack: “learning to breathe again” edges toward thematic echo, but the phrase is brief and image-driven enough to avoid full penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught from line one (“fingers still moving in phantom stitches”) and held to the final em-dash cadence. Diction stays within a poet-weaver’s lexicon—nautilus, petroglyphs, succulents—without thesaurus drift. Rhythm modulates: long tidal sentences swell, then cut back to fragments (“She smiled”). No head-hopping; single POV remains locked to Calla’s perceptual bias. The only micro-slip: one “bleeding impossible hues” moment of stacked modifiers, but it lands inside a taught lyric burst and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “barnacles grew on petroglyphs” packs world-rule, time-depth, and sensate detail in six words. No paraphrase loops; each image advances spiral or tide logic. One mixed-metaphor risk: “orchids—rare, delicate, and impossibly alive” beside “dried blood and hope”—but the clash is purposeful, charging the final oxymoron. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“pierced the air,” “colonize”) propel motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned-labyrinth premise fuses climate fabulism with mythic weaving, a synthesis that feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. Risk—sleepwalk cartography producing real tapestry—pays off in the final image without gimmickry. Specificity anchors novelty: nautilus-spiral overlays, salt-bleached illustration plate, “orchid solace” as color-tone. No trope recycling; even the “world learning to breathe again” avoids apotheosis cliché by growing from Calla’s lung-like stitches.</comment>
