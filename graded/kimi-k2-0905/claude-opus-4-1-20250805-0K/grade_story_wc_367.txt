<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—“inhaling stardust and exhaling possibility”—but her contradictory impulses stay poetic rather than operational under pressure. The mirror-twin moment hints at self-conflict yet never forces a micro-choice that costs her anything. Emotional embodiment is strong; motivation crystal-clear; still, the closure beat is a lyrical summation, not a renunciation with felt price, so the arc feels suspended rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each ship’s arrival tightens the pattern and reweights the dominant stake—reality’s own navigation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse lens reverses, birthing a new dawn-rule; cost is legible—“the universe steering itself through her voice.” Causality is poetic, not mechanical, but holds under the lyric pattern taught early. Minor waver: orientation anchors (who/where) are implied, not stated by 120 words, yet the disorientation pays off at closure, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick functions as micro-setting: its internal geometry steers every beat and is charged in the final image. Emerald walls, spiral stairs, and harvested starlight are tactile, POV-filtered, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean—bare feet know grooves, ships dock at the base. Environment actively constrains tactics; lighthouse becomes cosmic sextant, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reality’s safe passage—signals early and deepens with each ship’s oddity. Agency is performative: laughter steers, but the price is abstract (universe speaking through her) rather than personal loss. Escalation is pattern-based: inverse ship creates standing wave that reverses lens—tightening via image, not option foreclosure. Cost is conceptual, visible in the reversed light; meets 8.8+ threshold but lacks visceral jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring navigation metaphor—maps obsolete, reality self-steering. Final image of stars rearranging into unborn languages reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in headline ghosts (“DAWN POSTPONED INDEFINITELY”) is sharp. Avoids overt thesis, but slight drift toward meta-commentary in “understanding her true purpose” keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush, tidal, consistent in diction and rhythm—“laughter echoing across dark waters.” Compression is taught early: stacked participles mimic light angles; payoff in reversed lens. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Lexicon stays within nautical-occult register; perceptual signature is unmistakably Mira’s. Minor cadence loops (“laugh...laughter...laughing”) are pattern-driven, not artifact, and serve the standing-wave climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—image + physics rule—maintaining momentum. Figurative density is high but patterned and paid off. No paraphrase loops; metaphor logic stays coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif cleanly. One mixed metaphor—“angles that shouldn’t exist”—is fleeting; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: total internal reflection as cosmic midwifery. Newspaper headlines from unborn futures, dawn that forgot to break, and inverse-twin storm-herald feel inevitable yet unborrowed. Risk in lyric physics pays off: closure image would collapse if any element replaced. Minor proximity echo to “lighthouse as portal” trope is transformed through glass-geometry rule-set.</comment>
