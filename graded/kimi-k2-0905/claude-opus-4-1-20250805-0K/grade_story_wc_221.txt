<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her palm on the compass rose, the warmth pulsing, the taffy image of stretched time—yet the contradiction between loneliness and saviorhood stays mostly summarized, not dramatized with on-page micro-choices that risk or cost her. The final “she continued sketching” crystallizes her stance, but the jump from curse to compass feels more declarative than earned by visible beats of sacrifice. Still, within 800 words the arc from isolation to lighthouse is credible and specific to her sensory world.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene orientation is immediate: crystalline walls, void where stars were, gilded compass rose all land within 50 words. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each return to the compass re-weights meaning, culminating in the rice-paper map that literally guides crewmates home. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her endurance becomes the station’s new Polaris—whose cost is felt in her perpetual solitude. No teleporting props; every image is recalled and transformed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observation deck is rendered through Kira’s navigator’s eye—void swallowing starlight, recycled air carrying grandmother’s voice, gold that “remembers photons.” Micro-setting (compass rose) literally constrains her choices: touching it stretches others, so she must keep touching. Spatial choreography stays clean as she presses paper to metal and watches crew drift toward her. Final image recharges the deck itself as living constellation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Kira turn her curse into a navigational tool for the lost? Pressure tightens exactly once: when she realizes the compass + sketching can become a star-map that re-orients broken time. No reversals, but the deepening is decisive—she forfeits personal rescue to become the fixed point. Cost is visible: perpetual temporal solitude while others follow her map home.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: navigation is relational, not directional—home is the fixed point you become for others. Subtext operates through the grandmother’s sky-sketches reframed as temporal maps. Final image reweights “true north” from external sky to internal stance, resisting moralizing. Silence and gold as echoing memory create quiet but undeniable emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly lashed to Kira’s navigator diction: “taffy across hours,” “photons remembered in gold.” Rhythm swells and compresses with her pulses of insight; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice never converges. Grandmother’s idiom is filtered through Kira’s memory, maintaining single perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary from short crystalline fragments to longer lyric sweeps without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors are disciplined—void, taffy, lighthouse—each re-used only after taught. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “echoed silence.” High density: one sentence often handles sensory detail, emotional state, and world rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: time-stretching as literal cartography, grief-sketches as spatiotemporal coordinates, compass rose as pacemaker for a station. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Conceptual integrity never retreats into hand-waving. Specific detail—rice paper from Earth, gold that remembers light—grounds the speculative frame. Transformation test passes: swap names and the emotional/navigational engine collapses.</comment>
