<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-rooted refusal and its gradual erosion under Mira’s pressure are cleanly embodied; the contradictory impulses (protect the past vs. save the eyes) coexist in-scene. The final choice to mend is credibly earned by the orchard’s living proof that rigidity fails. Micro-choices—touching the ribbon, laughing at the “wrong” bag—reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is present but lightly felt; the emotional price could cut deeper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: breached contract → cathedral overgrown → eyes dying → granddaughter’s demand → mender returns → mends. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the vow itself is the price paid, legible in the ribbon hand-off. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props. One minor softness: the “forgotten” tools appear without prior cue, but the line “no accidents” retrofits motivation.</comment>

<comment>The suspended orchard physically constrains every move—ladder climb, branch perch, refracted light—and charges the final image of mended eyes glowing through blossoms. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: Elara notices scent of rot, weight of fruit, chill of crystal. Spatial choreography is exact; no floating bodies. The cathedral’s transformation is learned through action, not exposition. Environment directly mirrors internal shift: rigidity replaced by fruitful hybrid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the quartz eyes or let the guild’s legacy die—is signaled early and tightens once: refusal → acceptance after witnessing decay. The reversal is protagonist-driven, cost visible in the symbolic surrender of the vow. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues. Could escalate further if a single eye shattered during mending to raise stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation through adaptation, not purity. The deciduous vow motif reweights at closure—what falls fertilizes new growth. Subtext resides in gesture: ribbon transfer = acceptance of hybrid future. No moralizing; complexity intact. Final image of glowing eyes through blossom refracts the thematic answer without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is aged, tactile, metaphor-rich (“roots threading like determined fingers”). Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action. Dialogue carries subtext: Mira’s “You’re late” masks fear. No head-hopping; register consistent. Distinctive rhythmic control—no template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences perform double duty (action + metaphor). Figurative language is selective, never clotted. One paraphrase loop: “no accidents in a mender’s life, only patterns…” restates prior line. Otherwise clean. Opening and closing lines are sharp; final sentence lands with cadenced satisfaction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Crystal-eye orchard grafted onto ruined cathedral feels fresh, not stitched. Transformation of religious space into living grove literalizes the theme without allegorical heavy-hand. Risk taken: healing crystals as fruit, yet internal logic holds. Specificity of tools (tuning fork, moon tears) prevents generic fantasy drift. Would break if transplanted to another setting.</comment>
