<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession with “structural linguistics” is particular and embodied; her tactile handling of the seal and the kettle shows a hierarchy of values (knowledge > social ease). Marcus’s admission about his grandmother externalizes the internal contradiction and forces the relationship’s state change. The final “Teach me” is earned: her past loneliness (unsent letters) makes the risk of sharing her gift legible. Minor slip: “patiently nimble” is repeated as label rather than shown in a fresh micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: meteor shower ➝ rooftop meeting ➝ seal exchange ➝ joint covenant. Closure is a Charged Poise—partnerhood crystallized with the seal literally warming Marcus’s palm, a felt cost for both isolation and secrecy. The 120-word anchor is met: rooftop, meteor shower, two characters, 1887 cornerstone memory cue. One hairline slip: “agreed upon lies” is explicitly thematized mid-paragraph, slightly blunting subtext.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The rooftop garden functions as micro-setting: meteor glare off porcelain, groaning chair echoing fire escape, shifting weight of the building itself—all constrain their intimacy and echo the theme of permeable shelter. Brass seal in palm and steam from chipped cup supply tactile specificity that sharpens the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: Marcus appears at garden edge, accepts seal without teleport. Environment (meteor shower, building murmur) is filtered through Elara’s academic sensorium, never tourist-catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elara share her secretive avocation—surfaces early. Escalation occurs when Marcus admits his grandmother’s gift, tightening the dyad from neighborly ritual to co-conspirators. Cost is legible: secrecy pact forfeits her solitary refuge, foreshadowed by unsent letters. Agency lies in her decision to teach; coincidence (meteor timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: human structures as consoling fictions is embodied in the building’s midnight recitation and the seal’s inscription *Veritas Structura*. Final image—seal passed, rooftop vigil becoming joint classroom—reweights “lies” into shared language rather than solitary obsession. No overt moralizing; resonance carried by brass warmth against meteor cold. Subtext in dialogue (“What did it say?”) carries intimacy more than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—Akkadian memory, wax scent, frequency metaphors—never leaks into Marcus’s interior. Syntax lengthens with academic precision then shortens under emotional surge (“Teach me”). Dialogue idiom distinct: Marcus’s gentle interrogation vs Elara’s lecturer cadence. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor stack (“meteor trails…silver threads…void of understanding”) is patterned early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses mirror Elara’s scholarly mind, then staccato “Teach me” hits apex. No paraphrase loops; each line advances image or stakes. “Cornerstone remembers” personification is consistent with premise. Minor overwrite: “celestial display seemed almost mundane” could compress, but does not touch closure. Final paragraph cadence recapitulates opening meteor image, tightening coil.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—buildings speak in forgotten dialects—feels fresh yet inevitable given Elara’s profession and the seal’s inscription. Mythic meteor shower + architectural eavesdropping synthesizes romance with conceptual SF. Specificity of 1887 wet mortar palm-print anchors the magic in material history. Risk of quiet, relationship-focused ending pays off via Charged Poise rather than spectacle.</comment>
