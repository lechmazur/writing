<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s nervous laser-clicking and spatial mapping feel specific; the late epiphany about Chen is credible because the mushrooms literalize her walled-off habit. Interiority stays concrete, but the final phone call is a micro-choice whose cost is only asserted (“learned to let the light pass”) rather than dramatized on the page, capping the arc just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mushrooms’ quantum bridges rewire both farm security and Maya’s emotional stance, cost visible in the dropped laser. Causal chain holds—laser anomaly → discovery → reflection → call—under a Hybrid lens that ends in Accumulative reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by word 50; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm is evoked with selective sensory detail (“soft blue-green light that seemed to breathe”) and functions as micro-setting: the permeable membranes and quantum tunnels directly enable the climax. Laser pointer and mushrooms act as handled objects that constrain choice; the final image of “light pass through” recharges the membrane motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Maya’s need to breach her own walls—tightens once when the mushrooms expose literal gaps in space; escalation is accumulative: each laser pass deepens the pattern until personal application becomes inevitable. Cost is legible (abandoning isolation) but understated; the phone call is the single visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme of permeability emerges from fungal physics rather than assertion; the quiet-wildfire metaphor accrues new charge when boundaries become bridges. Subtext stays in gesture (dropping the laser), avoiding final moral; resonance is palpable but not revelatory enough for 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-person limited maintains clean focalization; perceptual signature is anchored in professional optics vocabulary and embodied nervous tic (laser thumb). Rhythm modulates with discovery—longer sentences swell, then shorten at the call. No dialogue to test, hence no voice convergence issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “constellation beneath the earth” and “quiet wildfire” deliver texture without purple drift. One template cadence (“She’d dismissed it then…”) and a minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to breathe”) are present but do not obscure closure; loops are absent, momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fungal quantum entanglement as metaphor for emotional permeability is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the mushrooms’ biological wormholes grow organically from farm logistics rather than gimmick. Risky concept committed to fully, payoff feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes of prior stories.</comment>
