<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, cracked laugh, charcoal-stained choices. The contradiction between needing to paint truth and watching faces fracture is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final self-portrait across tarot cards earns its cost: she renounces the old single-image art with visible grief. Only the “three faces” shorthand flirts with label-speak, keeping her just outside the 9 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam resurrects, casting impossible shadows that reweight the entire rule-set. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each surreal detail (glass falling upward, walls breathing inward) layers density until the final image crystallizes the new seeing. Cost is legible in the phrase “luminous with grief for her old way of seeing.” No因果 breaks; the broken box and drifting faces teach the pattern early and pay off at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library is no postcard: salt-stained belly, dead-beacon charcoal, splintered tarot lacquer all constrain action—she sketches with the only available charcoal, climbs the only spiral that exists. The setting literally collapses inward to force her re-seeing. Micro-setting (the cracked card box) becomes the canvas that charges the final image. One hairline slip: “far below” is the only spatial cue to the sea, slightly under-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she still paint truth once reality fragments?—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens through Accumulative pattern: each impossible perception (faces sliding, glass rising, walls pressing) deepens the cost of continuing the old art. The final charcoal strokes on tarot cards foreclose the single-image option; the resurrected beam is not rescue but confirmation of the new, higher-cost path. One visible price: she abandons the mayor-portrait career on the page.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: brokenness as wholeness across dimensions. The Moon card’s split reflection and the self-portrait across cards reweight the premise—truth is multiplicity, not unity. No final moralizing; the universe “shows her everything at once,” leaving the reader to feel the ache. The concept integrates with character goal: she needs to paint again, but now must embrace necessary fragmentation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, synesthetic, salted: “dust-breathing books,” “cracked like a mirror that had seen too many futures.” Perceptual signature stays consistent—she notices edges, angles, pigment-behaviors. Compression taught early (“glass fell upward, tinkling like chimes”) licenses later ellipses. No head-hopping; rhetorical questions remain in her idiom of frustrated seeing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are controlled—The Tower growing roots reads as surreal rule, not accident. One scaffold echo: “she understood now” appears twice within five lines, a minor loop. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line “the universe answered by showing her everything at once” lands clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fractured-portrait premise feels inevitable yet fresh: cubist horror turned mystical vocation. Surreal tarot mechanics (cards show all states simultaneously) transform a familiar Gothic lighthouse into a dimensional loom. Risk—letting reality collapse without causal explanation—pays off because the Accumulative pattern is taught early and closure reweights the rule-set. Specificity of painter’s perceptual vocabulary prevents abstraction.</comment>
