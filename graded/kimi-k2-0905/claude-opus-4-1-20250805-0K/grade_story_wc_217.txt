<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet-poet identity is anchored in tactile ritual (notebook, feather, tidepool) and a credible seven-year habit; her micro-choice to help the boy re-weave the kite shows a visible cost—she pauses her own poem and risks being misunderstood. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “understanding” lands as a gentle nod rather than a contradictory impulse under fire, so the arc feels more observational than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the broken kite becomes a collaborative art project, crystallizing the “beauty in incompleteness” premise with felt cost—the boy’s loss and Mira’s surrender of her solitary stance. Accumulative lens holds: each image (feather, torn paper, light through rips) layers until the final tableau reweights the stake without causal reversal, satisfying the quiet lyric contract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon’s post-storm textures—trickling mangrove roots, tidepool spirals, light through kite tears—are filtered through Mira’s synesthetic attention and directly constrain her choice to intervene; the same torn paper later becomes the literal material for closure, so setting charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find harmony in brokenness”—tightens once when the kite snaps; Mira’s agency to reframe the wreck as art narrows her option to remain merely an observer, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping escalation just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the feather-to-kite continuum of fractured wholeness; the final notebook line offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the boy’s smile could be consolation or genuine conversion—complexity honored, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature—iridescent barbules, “symphonies in seaweed tangles”—with rhythmic, breath-paced syntax that mirrors tidal cadence; no head-hopping or register drift. The kite’s “sharp snap like a breaking heartstring” is the single allowed lyrical flourish that intensifies without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical: sentence variety, strong verbs, zero paraphrase loops; figurative density is high but patterned early, so the final “hammered gold” moment feels earned rather than ornamental. One minor scaffold—“she thought of the drake itself”—could be cut, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “broken kite as origami mentor” angle refreshes the familiar wound-beauty trope; the drake feather and kite paper form a material dialectic that feels specific to this shoreline rather than generic eco-poetry. Risk is modest—quiet lyric rather than structural audacity—but the synthesis is internally inevitable.</comment>
