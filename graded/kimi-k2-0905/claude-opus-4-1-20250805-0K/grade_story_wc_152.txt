<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s “drooling fool” disguise is a living contradiction: every cackle masks a logarithmic memory, every pricked finger a deliberate blood-code. The cost of lifelong concealment peaks when she threads literal starlight into velvet—her final act before the coup she will not live to see. Interiority stays concrete (“humming harmonizing with the eternal flame’s ancient, patient burning”) without slipping into label-speak. Only the absence of an embodied setback under final pressure keeps this just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is iron: because officers dismiss Vera, they speak; because sheembroiders, intelligence travels; because she threads the eternal flame, only resistance eyes can read tomorrow’s map. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her stitched sky reweights the empire’s possibilities while the candle’s luminous thread makes her invisible network undeniable. Persistent constraint (the flame that never dims) literally shapes the covert optics of the final chart. One meaningful tightening: Minister Crane’s “official business” warning narrows her clock to tonight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt dome, autumn bruise-light, and eternal candle are not backdrop but tool: the dome’s acoustics let Vera overhear, the candle’s angle-dependent glow is the decryption key. Micro-setting (her needle, the velvet stretched across the table) constrains every stitch-timing under surveillance eyes. Sensory hierarchy obeys her astronomer’s training—she notices star-angle before blood. Final image recharges the setting: wind rattling the dome above the silent, glowing map.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the coup—ripens invisibly; each embroidered star forecloses a regime route. Escalation is accumulative: every new conspirator snippet tightens the chart until overlay becomes coup-busting constellation. Visible price: her pricked blood literally marks the primary target, trading flesh for intel. Agency is attention—her sustained, mocked listening is the offensive move that reweights power.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of invisibility: wisdom must masquerade as folly to survive, yet that masquerade erases the sage from history. Subtext lives in silence—what officers omit between glances is the real script Vera embroiders. Final image offers non-literal answer: a glowing map ascending into autumn wind implies revolutions are stitched by the erased, not the applauded. No moral stated; the bruise-colored sky does the talking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV hovers at Vera’s shoulder, filtering every noun through her astronomer-attuned perception (“dying light like a bruise against cobalt”). Syntax stretches into embroidery rhythm—long clauses loop like thread, then snap short when surveillance nears. Dialogue indirection: Crane’s suspicion carried in dropped chart, not interrogation. No head-hop; Minister Crane’s interior is unknowable, forcing reader to share Vera’s risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Density high: one sentence can place star, encode date, and foreshadow blood. Mixed-metaphor guard waived—“threading starlight” is literalized by the candle device. Rhythm breathes with stitch-tempo; clauses tighten whenever footsteps echo. Only faint template cadence in “the stars whisper such lovely secrets” keeps this from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—hidden genius, coded embroidery—are retooled via astronomical optics and flame-based cryptography that feels internally invented. Risk: making the fool actually drool and prick flesh prevents comfortable genius worship. Synthesis fresh: spy-craft as couture astronomy. Specificity of cobalt dome + eternal candle + hemoglobin ink makes removal impossible without collapse.</comment>
