<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is rich, embodied, and consistent—her “chronological homesickness” is felt in breath on glass, shell against palm, and the spiral of fortunes. The flaw of temporal dislocation drives every micro-choice; the final endurance of conducting is earned. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Could edge 9.0 if one more concrete sacrifice were visible before the crescendo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the folded horizon crystallizes all whens, fortunes swirl, and Mei’s arms lift—cost is the irreversible surrender to non-linear time. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mirrored spirals taught early, cadence intensifies to final image. Orientation anchored by word 60 (glass spire, frozen lake, palm on window). No causal break; ellipsis of factory firing is paid off when spiral reweights memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus segment function as micro-setting that constrains—light frequencies force narrowed perception, shell chambers dictate memory mapping. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual glare, bone-level sound) mirrors POV bias. Mirror-horizon folds at closure, recharging every prior image. Minor slip: “beach that didn’t exist yet” is briefly disorienting before pattern is confirmed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—compose the unheard symphony before exhaustion collapses her temporal perch—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each fortune slip laid tightens spiral, mirror horizon folds, options narrow to one final gesture. Cost is visible in dawn that “hurt to perceive” and arms that must lift despite frost creeping through bones. Could reach 8.8 if a tangible external loss (e.g., shell cracks) accompanied the crescendo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of non-linear memory as music emerges from concrete spiral mechanics and fortune fragments; no thesis stated. Final image reweights all prior slips into orchestral snow—reader feels the conceptual cost of living every moment at once. Resists moral, invites awe. One hairline echo: “symphonies—heard and unheard” borders self-explanation, but cadence swallows it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: synesthetic perception (“frequencies beyond human hearing”) stays within Mei’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm swells with sentence elongation then fragments at crescendo, mirroring conductor’s baton. Patterned repetition of spiral and mirror is taught early and pays off. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clot; perceptual signature is singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds image or pressure. Figurative density is high but patterned—spiral, mirror, dawn, frost—so coherence holds. Internal rhyme (“hurts to perceive direct”) and syntactic inversion serve pressure, not ornament. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses fortune-cookie futurism with nautilus-fractal time; risk of gimmickry is averted by emotional specificity. Concept of “chronologically homesick” feels freshly inevitable. Temporal synesthesia as orchestral score is non-obvious synthesis. Bold lyric structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
