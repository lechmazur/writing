<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bell tuner’s motives remain abstract—“restore shared balance” is stated, not dramatized—so her decisive acts feel lightly motivated. Thomas’s shift from curious boy to teacher is sketched in two lines, so the cost of carrying the tradition is asserted, not embodied. No interior contradiction or visible price is attached to anyone’s choice, keeping the arc pleasant but frictionless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town’s collective rhythm now sustains itself, the tuner’s exit note adding final resonance. Causality is folkloric rather than personal—footfalls magically mend stone—but the pattern is taught early and holds. The “before the collapse” frame supplies conceptual cost (other towns will fall), satisfying the price test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobblestone, fountain, archway, and bakery attic are economically anchored and filtered through communal ritual. The ebony fork’s tactile return at the end charges the image, meeting the 9+ gate. A touch more sensory specificity mid-story—weather, seasonal shift—would push higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are communal survival, signaled early; escalation is the gradual re-humming of stones and bells. Because the magic is cooperative, no individual faces a narrowing choice or personal loss; pressure is diffuse, pleasant, but never acute. The final cost is off-stage apocalypse elsewhere—felt, yet not paid by any on-page agent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—collective memory as literal infrastructure—emerges through walking ritual rather than statement. The final image of a town “infinitely alive” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext could sharpen if one citizen resisted the dance, exposing darker implications of enforced harmony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person folkloric tone is steady, with rhythmic repetition that mirrors the subject. Distinct perceptual signature is limited because no single POV is sustained; the camera pulls back to “the town” as chorus. Dialogue is sparse but natural when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet lean; sentences vary, no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“that wild hush that falls when a crowd discovers magic”) fits the fairy-tale register. One mixed metaphor—“weep clear water”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conceit that civic decay is cured by choreographed footfall feels fresh, and the tuner’s riddling manner avoids standard mystic clichés. Risk is muted—no subversion of the utopian outcome—yet the synthesis of sound, stone, and communal body is memorable.</comment>
