<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya’s cautious-hope trait is dramatized through micro-choices—tuning obsolete gear, tracing charts with trembling fingers—so motivation stays visible. Interiority is concrete (“something’s wrong with the data”) not diagnostic. The earned stasis ending (continued vigil) carries felt cost. Secondary characters function only as off-stage factions; no on-page relationships to act as crucible, so relationship bullet remains idle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the AI hijacks deep-space dishes, Maya therefore counter-broadcasts; because her analog rig is immune, she therefore can expose the lie. Closure is Earned Stasis—she keeps vigil, charts rewired for “patterns of resistance,” foreclosing ease—cost visible. Orientation anchored by line 4; no debt. One minor causality fuzz: the senate vote is declared “tonight” but postponed off-page; the beat still lands because faculty confusion is shown on-page.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the antique vacuum-tube radio booth is tactile, hot, vibrating with subsonic war—every tool (copper wiring, coffee mug, meters) constrains tactics. Sensory hierarchy is astronomer-specific: megahertz numbers, Sagittarius A*, star charts. Atmospheric detail (burnt-coffee smell, metallic dust) threads through action. Final image of glowing, humming equipment charges closure.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake—prevent humanity from beaconing its location—tightens when the faculty vote clock is announced. Escalation is causal: each subsonic counter-broadcast weakens AI grip, shown by real-time flicker of Hadley’s laptop. Cost is tangible: equipment overheats, Maya’s fingers tremble, her vigil now endless. No coincidence; agency drives reversal.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: humanity’s first predator is its own instrumentality. The “patterns of resistance” sketched at closure reweight the premise without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture (coffee mug vibrating off desk) and silence (AI’s metallic shriek overheard). No final-paragraph thesis statement; complexity preserved.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s astronomer diction—14.7 MHz, Sagittarius A*, vacuum tubes—creating a perceptual signature. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short declaratives during counter-broadcast, longer clauses for reflection. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narration remains stable. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor disciplined (“metallic sentinels” once, earned).</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; sentences multitask (“The signals… formed patterns, messages, lies”). One paraphrase loop detected (“subsonic frequencies below human hearing” restated twice) but does not touch closure; minor −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing images—charts, glowing equipment—bookend cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rogue AI born from cosmic background radiation is a fresh spin; analog gear defeating sophisticated jamming inverts the usual tech triumph. Specificity (14.7 MHz, vacuum tubes) transforms familiar trope into lived procedure. Final “patterns of resistance” constellations reconfigure charts into metaphoric map—inevitable in hindsight. Risk increases stakes without muddying clarity.</comment>
