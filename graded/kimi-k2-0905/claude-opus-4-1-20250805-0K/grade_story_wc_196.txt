<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured and embodied—finger tracing dust “like braille,” button warming in palm. Contradictory impulses (obsession vs. resignation) coexist in scene, driving the micro-choice to return the button and index Walsh. Earned renunciation: he forecloses personal revelation tonight, accepting archival stewardship as cost. Minor slip: “some wounds required archaeology” drifts toward diagnostic abstraction, slightly blunting peak embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marcus’s decision to index grace rather than chase his own file reweights the premise—archaeology of kindness supersedes self-excavation. Cost is legible: he extinguishes the immediate chance at maternal truth, choosing witness over discovery. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: dust, button, marginalia accumulate until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Persistent constraint—the limited archive shift—shapes his nightly ritual and final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>File room as micro-setting constrains every move: dust motes, fluorescent glare, metallic whisper of the button dictate tempo and attention. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile/auditory—archivist’s professional bias. Spatial choreography clean: shelf → floor → palm → folder → index card, no drift. Final image of “accumulated silence” charges the entire sensory matrix, reconfiguring stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—magnifying small kindnesses—tightens when Marcus discovers Walsh’s marginal note; the choice to index rather than pursue his own file narrows options with visible forfeiture. Escalation is textural: each artifact (button, penciled “tries so hard”) adds density until renunciation feels inevitable. No coincidence; pressure coheres under accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the final “leaving the dust to resettle,” a quiet stasis that forecloses tonight’s self-search.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern of marginal kindnesses—never stated, only shown via notes, buttons, updated addresses. Final image of “repository of society’s most vulnerable histories” reweights archives from bureaucratic tomb to testament of attempted love. Subtext operates in silence: Walsh never appears, yet father-love saturates scene. Resists moralizing; complexity intact—“imperfect attempts” honored without sentimental rescue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise: dust language, braille metaphor, metallic whisper—consistent archivist sensorium. Rhythm modulates with long reflective sentences that contract at physical beats (“He sat down slowly”). No head-hop; interiority stays strictly Marcus. Compression taught early—“dust had its own language”—and paid off in final “accumulated silence.” Distinctive without obscurity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers job, motive, sensory hit (“intake form: a handwritten note on Army stationary”). No scaffold; paragraphs cut clean. Metaphors stay coherent (dust braille, spirits released) without purple drift. Minor loop: “tried to say / desperately tried to say” could pare, but doesn’t touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Foster-archive angle feels fresh—records as archaeological site of love. Dust-as-language and button inheritance offer specific, non-generic imagery. Transformation test: story collapses without archival setting and marginal-note reveal. Slight risk in quiet ending, but charged poise justifies it. Not revolutionary, yet particularized enough to linger.</comment>
