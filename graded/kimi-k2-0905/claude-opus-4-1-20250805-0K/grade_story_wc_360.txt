<comment>Mira’s interiority is vividly concrete—her “seventeen mouths” smile is a perfect embodied payoff to the accumulated personalities. The contradictory impulses (angelic halo vs. human grief) coexist inside a single beat, satisfying the 9+ test. The final renunciation—“emotion wasn’t mathematics at all”—is earned by every prior mechanical choice; the cost is the loss of any original self, legible in the same sentence. Only the slightest hedge: we never see a micro-choice that permanently forfeits a concrete external want, so the cap holds at 8.7.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared and held: each printed sheet literally “accumulates” ghost-selves, and the final CR reweights the whole premise. The decisive change—“everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts”—lands with undeniable conceptual cost and is tethered to the persistent constraint of the letterpress. Pattern is taught by line 3 and paid off in the last line; no orientation debt. Closure beat is pristine; persistent constraint (ink/plates) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<comment>The topaz workshop and dying stars are not backdrop but active machinery: each vanished star tightens the temporal frame, and the crystalline walls refract the very light that lets Mira “read” the personalities she borrows. The letterpress itself is the micro-setting that constrains every choice—type selection = identity algebra. Spatial choreography is impeccable (halo to temple, silver ink shifting to gold). The final image recharges the same refracting walls now filled with “drying sheets” that replace the constellation—environment directly charges closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve disappearing identities via print—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates as each star vanishes; the halo fragment provides the single tightening beat that forces the final insight. Cost is legible: the last star “holds on, defiant” while Mira surrenders any hope of a private self. Agency remains hers—she pulls the press lever each time—even while personalities overwhelm her. Under Accumulative lens, density of ghost-selves reaches critical mass that reweights the premise; no coincidence, pure pattern break.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through the print metaphor: identity as movable type, emotion as spacing. The closing Conceptual Repricing—“typography of absence”—offers a non-literal answer that reconfigures every prior equation image without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: the absent client is never named, yet their fracture haunts every line. No thematic echo lines; the insight is earned by the physical act of printing, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “celestial erasure,” “square root of abandonment,” “color of forgetting” all belong to Mira’s numerically haunted lexicon. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure—short staccato clauses mimic press clicks, then expand into the final sweeping realization. No filter-verb stacks; compression (“lucid turbulence”) is taught early and paid off. Voice never cracks into generic lyricism; every metaphor is tethered to ink, plates, or stars.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new information (star count, ink color, personality count). Metaphors are coherent—mathematics of emotion never contradicts typography of absence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges refracted light. Density is extreme yet propulsive; no line could be cut without losing knowledge, intention, or emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of letterpress + disappearing constellation + borrowed souls is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight: of course print would be the only ark for fading stars/selves. Risk—using a halo fragment as emotional USB drive—pays off by literalizing “angelic” presence without cliché. Fresh inflection: typography as identity algebra is a genuinely new metaphoric engine. Conceptual integrity never retreats into metaphor for its own sake; every device serves the final CR.</comment>
