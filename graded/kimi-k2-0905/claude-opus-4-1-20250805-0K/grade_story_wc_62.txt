<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—Martha’s fingers “retrace the practice cuts”—but the contradiction between fierce meditation and spectral mentorship is summarized, not dramatized in real time. The grandfather’s voice is a convenient oracle that removes genuine struggle; Martha never mis-carves or doubts aloud, so her “fiercely meditative state” feels label-only. Micro-choices (reading poems alone, touching stone) show values but cost is abstract—no blisters, no scraped knuckles, no risk of public failure—so endurance reads friction-free.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon-hidden poem reweights collective grief into shared flight, cost legible in Martha’s solitary reading. Causality is accumulative/textural; pattern of carving–poem–monarch tightens once, but the grandfather’s instructions arrive ex machina, never foreshadowed as a constraint. Orientation clean by 120 words; only one soft time jump (Sept→Oct→Nov) and it serves the migration lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s iron bones and “cool glass” act as crucible—access to monarchs dictates carving tempo, while dusk light times the final reading. Micro-setting objects (chisel, ribbon, milkweed) are handled, their states tracked; ribbon’s hidden poem is final environmental pivot. Selective sensory hierarchy—salmon sky, indigo threads—mirrors Martha’s stone-color focus without tourism. No spatial drift; seventeen families gather in believable choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>Stake—finish the Collective Memorial before monarchs leave—signals early and tightens once when “migration won’t wait.” Yet escalation is external (weather, butterflies) rather than carved error or social friction; Martha’s agency is steady pacing, not risky choice. Cost is poetic (solitude, grandfather’s departure) but not visceral—no fear of botching names, no family anger to mediate—so pressure feels atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through braided particulars: migration as metaphor for communal grief, stone as permanent flight path. Subtext lives in gesture—Mrs. Nguyen touching stone first, then child—showing transmission without statement. Final image avoids moral; poem carried south is open-ended. One near-preach moment—“grief was like butterfly migration”—is embedded in Martha’s public speech, softened by collective silence that follows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Martha’s perceptual filter: “she felt her grandfather’s presence spreading among them” keeps psychic distance tight. Syntax mirrors stone-work rhythm—long sentence, then chisel-short clause—modulating under pressure. No head-hop; ghost voice is externalized through Martha’s hearing, maintaining POV integrity. Diction stays within her craftsman lexicon; “indigo threads catching last rays” is sensory, not purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: compound sentences for meditation, fragments for chisel taps. Information density high—one sentence can set season, tool, and emotional hue. Two micro-loops: “through September…through October…” and “Neruda…Rumi…Oliver” list; both serve cadence, not clutter, so forgiven. No mixed metaphors; monarch/ribbon/stone cohere around flight-and-anchor motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of stone-carving, spectral apprenticeship, and butterfly migration feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Collective memorial ribbon border is fresh ritual object; hidden poem inside weaving is elegant reveal. Risk taken—ghost mentor—pays off thematically without breaking world rules. Familiar pandemic memorial trope is re-angled through craft process rather than public ceremony.</comment>
