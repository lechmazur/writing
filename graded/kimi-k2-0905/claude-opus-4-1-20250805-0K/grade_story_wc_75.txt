<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta’s archivist desperation is vivid—her trembling fingers, the frantic charcoal tracings, the lens pressed to stone—yet the interior contradiction is more asserted (“dread” vs “fierce tenderness”) than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The bread-initial alphabet is a lovely externalization of identity, but her decision to keep copying as the walls weep is the only on-page fork, and its cost feels scaled to the story’s lyric register rather than to her body or future. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the flaw is credible but safely museum-bound. Voice and motive stay consistent; the opera-glass POV bias is sharp.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Marta’s refusal to stop cataloguing while the grotto actively erases its own archive lands with visible cost—droplets already blur a fresco under her eye. Causal linkage holds: thaw → rosewater scent → imminent weeping → frantic copying → lens-as-legacy. The lens reappears in the final image, reweighting its earlier theatre glamour into a coffin-nail of memory. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; the museum-guide frame is taught early and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto is not postcard scenery: falling ice changes the waterfall’s pitch, mineral perfume foretells destruction, and the bakery alcove’s carbon initials constrain Marta’s urgent path. The emerald lens itself functions as micro-setting/tool, its tint literally revealing hidden pigments; its final press against stone charges the last image. Spatial choreography is clean—ice crash deeper in passage, droplets forming overhead. Sensory hierarchy is curator-specific: pigment recipes, musical notations, the cloying rosewater all filter through professional attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue of dying arts from literal dissolution—is signaled by paragraph 2 and tightens once: the moment the ceiling begins to weep, archiving becomes a race against physics. Agency is endurance/attention; the option she forecloses is rest or escape. Cost is palpable—charcoal smears, wet paper, imminent erasure—but the escalation is a single intensifying gradient rather than a reversal; therefore slightly below 8-band ceiling. No coincidence resolves; the thaw complicates, it does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: cultural memory is a loaf of bread pressed into stone, already eaten by time. The opera glass’s transformation from theatre luxury to grave-side magnifier reweights glamour into elegy. Final image—“an ending properly documented could become a beginning”—is a conceptual re-pricing that lands via the lens, not exposition. No platitudes; the displaced are honored through concrete particulars (K for Katarin who sang harvest songs) rather than abstract pieties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marta’s curator eye; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is specific: “emerald-tinted opera glass,” “recipes, poems, musical notations,” “alphabet of belonging”—all diction filtered through archival obsession. Rhythm modulates from long sensory sentences to staccato clauses under pressure (“She had perhaps hours, maybe less”). Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb clusters. Single POV so no voice convergence issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is strong: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. No synonym loops; “rosewater dread” gains menace each recurrence. One mixed-metaphor risk—“tomb of culture rather than its sanctuary”—but the antithesis is earned. Information density high: one sentence can set, characterize, and foreshadow (“the warming temperatures that opened new chambers also accelerated the deterioration”). No scaffold; final line lands with imagistic punch. Minor over-adjectiving in “sweet, cloying scent” but fits curator’s sensory precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bread-initial alphabet is a fresh, non-obvious mnemonic; displaced identity baked into edible graffiti feels inevitable yet surprising. Opera glass as portable archive tool transforms a theatrical relic into forensic instrument. Premise fuses climate-change thaw with cultural loss without sermon. Risk is quiet—lyric endurance rather than plot twist—but the stakes stay legible. Transformation test fails if lens or bread-loaf alphabet removed; specificity anchors universal.</comment>
