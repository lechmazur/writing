<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elsa’s reticence and history of solitude are shown through her skiff-handling and stone-reading, not told; the final acceptance of guardianship grows believably from these traits. The embodied chill in her bones and the steady hand on the rope give us contradiction under pressure. Ghost-Jonas is sketched only as needed, but the stacked-stone “conversation” with him earlier anchors their bond. Cost is visible: she forfeits solitary freedom to become keeper of both lamp and ghosts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: dead lamp → stone message → climb → ghost reveal → choice → re-light. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elsa assumes eternal guardianship, foreclosing her former life. The lens stays causal throughout; each beat narrows her options until she accepts the post. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Phosphorescent foam, salt-breathing stairs, and the lamp’s brass housing are tactile and filtered through Elsa’s practiced eye. The sea glass—warm, pulsing—functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice by literally “bottling safety.” Spatial choreography is flawless: dock → beach → spiral stairs → lantern room. Weather and darkness actively impede and guide her climb.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elsa take up the haunted keeper role?—is signaled in the first letter reference and tightens when the lamp is dark. The midpoint ghost reveal eliminates retreat; her choice to “tend the light” pays the price of perpetual solitude. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is on-page: she stays, they weep, she writes new stones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: solitude can be alchemy—transformed into protective light if accepted rather than feared. Subtext lives in the stacked stones and the sea glass’s warmth, never sermonized. The final image of ghost-tears becoming sea glass reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: we feel the grandeur and terror of her choice simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elsa’s perceptual orbit; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens during ascent to mimic breath, then tightens at the reveal. Diction—“dead eye,” “bottled safety”—is hers, not writerly tour-guide. Ghost dialogue is spare and goal-driven, carrying subtext of collective relief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“wound in the star-scattered sky”—and never muddies causality. Information density is high: one line often does setting, emotion, and foreshadowing. Zero loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Haunted-lighthouse tale is refreshed by the stone-code language and the notion that ghosts engineer their own replacement. Supply-captain POV is an uncommon angle that justifies immediate access. The sea-glass-as-bottled-safety twist feels inevitable once revealed. Risk is moderate but successful; no gimmickry, only specificity.</comment>
