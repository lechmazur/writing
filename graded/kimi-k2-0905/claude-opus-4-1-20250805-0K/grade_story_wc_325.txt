<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (“walls pressing inward”), drives her micro-choice to push deeper despite panic, and crystallizes in the final renunciation: she will keep returning to the drowned throat. The gold-flecked journal as surrogate heart externalizes Marcus and anchors her endurance, but the interior monologue twice drifts into abstract memorial language (“price of their connection”) that slightly dilutes embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: breached cables → phase trap → encoded water messages → Elena’s retrieval → annual vigil. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the journal against her chest reweights the stake from rescue to remembrance with visible cost (impossible extraction next tide). One minor scaffold: “she would return every year” is told, not dramatized, but the final line’s lung-image pays it off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arctic shelf, flooded corridors, phase chamber, and tide clock are all tactile and choice-limiting. The body-as-setting (Marcus suspended between states) directly charges the final image. One micro-slippage: “telecommunications cables snaked… like neural pathways” is apt but reused near-identically later; still, the cable network’s hum is kept present throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the cables silent and the team remembered—tightens when Elena realizes the phase chamber is both tomb and archive. The 40-minute tide window forces pace; retrieving the journal forecloses extraction of remains, a felt price. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence resolves anything. Escalation is single but sufficient for 800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the invisible: digital ghosts, drowned names, unpaid cost of global chatter. Subtext in the final image—breathing Arctic air “like a prayer”—re-prices connectivity as lung-capacity of grief. No moralizing; the silence speaks. The gold flecks shift from ornament to relic, reweighting memory without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Diction is compressed, maritime, and tech-tinged (“rebreather hissing,” “fiber-optic veins”). Syntax lengthens underwater, shortens on surfacing, mirroring pressure. No dialogue, so voice must carry interiority; it does, though two filter verbs (“she understood”) momentarily soften immediacy. Perceptual signature—sonar pings, amber preservative light—stays consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with depth: long sentences in descent, staccato ascent. Metaphors are precise (“corridors like a throat swallowing her backward”) and rarely repeated. One near-loop: “she would return every year… she would stand witness” could be compressed, but it falls outside the closure beat. No mixed metaphors; technical terms accurate. Opening and final lines anchor and release cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusing Arctic cable horror with phase-transition ghost-writing feels fresh; the digital parasite that eats signal is never over-explained. The gold-flecked journal as both map and reliquary turns a static prompt object into living evidence. Risk is high—quiet ending, no monster reveal—but the stance commits. Specificity of “grandmother’s restoration workshop” roots the gold in lived lineage, not quirk.</comment>
