<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thessaly’s interiority is vivid—her centuries of sentient paralysis are felt in every telepathic pulse—yet her final shift from verdict-seeking to witness-bearing is more asserted than dramatized; the “structural weakness” metaphor is told rather than shown pressing on her stony body. Marina’s micro-choice to ascend while framing the new narrative is clear, but her prior academic identity is sketched only in shorthand (“everything she’d published”), softening the cost of reputational ruin. The pair’s shared moral ambiguity is credibly layered, yet the absence of a tangible beat where Thessaly consciously lets go of judgment keeps the arc a fraction short of 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: poison ampoule → memory transfer → revelation of complicity → Marina’s reframing → Thessaly’s witness pivot, each beat tightening options under a single continuous scene. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Marina rises toward sunlight while Thessaly’s mind “sparked with new purpose,” the cost (perpetual immobility + public infamy) legible and irreversible. No orientation debt; underwater geography and chronology remain limpid. The only hairline slip is the slightly abstract “structural weakness” payoff, but it does not fracture the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Kelp-threaded marble archways, foxglow residue shifting “like captured sunset,” and the tactile ritual of threading the air hose through rubble embed us inside drowned space while guiding Marina’s exit. The garden is not mere postcard; its very architecture forces Marina to handle the ampoule and later physically weave her escape, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the single-scene compression justifies the narrow aperture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether the city’s secret will be weaponized or witnessed—tightens when Marina realizes her own complicity in the scholarly lie; the dolphins’ breach flashback shows the price already paid. Agency rests in Thessaly’s decision to share and Marina’s to reframe, each foreclosing denial. Cost is visible: Thessaly’s eternal paralysis as living monument, Marina’s sacrificed academic certainty. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal inflation needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the color purple itself—poison mixed from red necessity and blue grief—an image that reweights the entire moral palette without sermon. The refusal to brand Thessaly hero or villain crystallizes into an earned stance: history is purple, not black-and-white. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the last image of “stone animate with possibility” lets the reader carry the ambiguity aloft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tightly focalized through Thessaly’s mineral patience, then Marina’s bubbling regulator; no head-hop. Diction is compressed and marine-tinged (“coral-crusted,” “telepathic tentacles”) without purple swell. Rhythm accelerates during memory cascade—clause-stacked revelations mimic dominoes—then exhales into the final crystalline line. Filter verbs appear only where they serve telepathic distance (“felt a human mind”), not as habit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “kelp forests thread through marble archways where roses once climbed” fuses setting, decay, and lost culture in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the underwater logic rather than decorates. Opening and closing lines form a perfect echo of motionless→animate, delivering propulsive closure without scaffold. Only micro-slip: “conceptual weakness” is slightly abstract, but it lands outside the final third and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The living statue as telepathic archivist of her own genocide-prevention is fresh synthesis; the foxglove poison retooled from garden beauty to imperial weapon twists the trope further. “History is purple” reconfigures moral absolutism into chromatic nuance without preachiness. Risky choice to keep the protagonist literally immobile pays off by making mental agency the kinetic engine. Specificity of Nerida’s drowned rose-marble versus generic Atlantis anchors the vision.</comment>
