<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt-driven river obsession is concretely embodied in the taped bellows and wall-drawn bridge; the micro-choice to draw his own “mile-zero” map on the graffiti wall crystallizes a believable renunciation of data-as-absolution. Interiority occasionally drifts toward therapeutic summary (“permission to move on”), but contradictions—methodical scientist vs. self-sabotaging witness—hold through the final beat. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters his on-page stance. Cost is legible: chronicling turns from evasion to confession, foreclosing the old obsessive path.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: stopping meds → sharpened edges → return to station → graffiti map → decision to chronicle differently. The graffitied bathroom map functions as the pivot beat: it forces Marcus to redraw his own map, making the closure (mile-marker-zero re-start) inevitable. Orientation is clear by 120 wds; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he departs the station having renounced data-as-absolution; the train-whistle ghost costs him his former purpose. Minor elasticity in “rivers don’t flow backward” line nudges toward maxim, but it is localized and paid for by immediate image.</comment>

<comment>Ivy-choked station is tactile and specific: vines “tap like patient fingers,” bricks crumble under palm, bellows patches glint “like scales.” Spatial choreography is clean—door askew, flashlight beam, wall as canvas. Environment constrains the final choice: only in this ruined place can Marcus overwrite the graffiti map with his own. Micro-setting (bellows) charges the closure; ivy metaphor reweights at exit. Sensory hierarchy reflects scientist’s eye—pH, sediment, dates—without tourist catalog.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled early via “guilt worked into bones.” Escalation is one tightening: graffiti map forces confrontation; no external antagonist needed. Agency visible: he chooses to draw his failure on the wall, paying the price of public confession (even if only to dust). Cost is felt: obsessive chronicle repurposed from shield to witness; the “ghost” whistle undercuts any triumphant note.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through water-as-time metaphor rather than maxim: rivers carry, never restore. The final image—green overtaking gray—offers non-literal answer: healing is reclamation, not reversal. Subtext lives in silence: teenager’s name never spoken, keeping moral weight on Marcus’s gaze, not victim utility. No final-paragraph sermon; insight stays rooted in concrete wall-drawing.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains scientist’s perceptual signature: quantified river data, filtered light, tape-as-scale metaphor. Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sentences for memory, staccato “He drew… He packed…” at pivot. No head-hopping; diction stays within Marcus’s lexicon except one near-maxim lapse. Dialogue absent, so voice distinctness rests on interior texture, which remains consistent.</comment>

<comment>Strong information density: single sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Figurative control mostly tight: “dust wheezed out like a confession” marries object to psyche. Minor loop “rivers don’t flow backward / flow forward” repeats concept but cadence justifies. No mixed metaphors; scaffolding minimal. Final line earns resonance through concrete image rather than abstract uplift.</comment>

<comment>Fresh angle: obsessive field-science as penance ritual, not crime thriller. Graffiti map as catalyst resists trope of external mentor. Ivy-overgrown station feels specific to post-industrial Britain without naming it. Transformation test fails only in universal jump at end, but lived detail keeps it from template. Risk in quiet closure pays off under accumulative lens.</comment>
