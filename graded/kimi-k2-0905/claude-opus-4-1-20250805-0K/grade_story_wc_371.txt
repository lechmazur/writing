<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila’s sustained, embodied noticing—illegal plantings, bread-trail, upward shadows—keeps contradiction alive in-scene; her final micro-choice to accept seeds with “varieties that don’t exist yet” crystallizes her ministry without therapeutic self-labeling. Interiority stays concrete, sensuous, cost-bearing. Only minor flattening: the grandmother’s exposition slightly outsources pressure, muting crucible heat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lila’s acceptance of impossible seeds reweights her “cursed awareness” into vocation, cost felt in the phrase “wouldn’t exist unless planted by someone who understood that reality was negotiable.” Accumulative lens holds: each anomalous image (bread, tea house, birds) layers density until the final crystallization; no teleporting props or causality breaks. Orientation anchor (who/where) secure by line 3; lens taught early and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard functions as micro-setting: every verb of gardening (“tucked beneath the jasmine vines she’d planted illegally”) fuses body, tool, and terrain, constraining trespass and granting covert access. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—rosemary scent, waxed paper warmth—never tourist catalog. Final image of tea house flickering “between being and not-being” charges the closing poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether attention to the impossible is madness or ministry—tightens when bread uncloaks into memories, forcing Lila to own her gift. One clear escalation beat suffices; cost legible in her decision to plant seeds that may never sprout, foreclosing ordinary safety. Pressure stays accumulative/textural; no reversal, yet deepening satisfies lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particular anomalies rather than thesis: sacred persistence inside ordinary decay. Final image of bread tasting “of forgiveness and time” offers non-literal answer—absolution is attention paid repeatedly, not doctrine. No moralizing, no echo phrases; ambiguity lingers about what varieties will grow, keeping complexity alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: “shadows that fell upward on certain afternoons.” Syntax modulates—long breathless clauses for wonder, abrupt fragments for recognition. Grandmother’s diction slightly converges with Lila’s, but brief convergence at closure reads intentional; internal texture remains coherent. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. High density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, world rule, and emotional charge (“bread…still warm, smelling of rosemary and time”). One paraphrase loop—“hidden gardens…without permission” / “planted without permission” −0.2. Otherwise no scaffold, no mixed metaphor; closure line clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of guerrilla gardening + ghost bread + negotiable reality yields a fresh angle on magical realism; tropes feel re-rooted in horticultural activism. Risk in letting tea house appear late is earned because gardens “gave it permission to grow,” making anomaly feel inevitable, not gimmick. Specificity of “midnight lettuce and moon radishes” anchors universals in lived detail.</comment>
