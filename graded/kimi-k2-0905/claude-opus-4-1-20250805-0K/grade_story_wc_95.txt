<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—brass fingers ‘click’, angles ‘suggest’—and her lost-arm backstory is anchored to present micro-gesture. Status duel with Reeves is crisp, but the philosophical stakes stay cerebral; no bodily risk or tangible forfeiture is felt at closure, so renunciation cost is only conceptual. Still, contradictory impulses (code vs. revolt) coexist in-scene, not in summary, meeting the 9+ threshold for impulse-in-scene even if price is oblique.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sewing-card angle → invitation → verbal fence → light-traced sundial that reconfigures alliance. Closure is Charged Poise: the completed angle-pattern forecloses open hostility while exposing their conspiracy to the reader; conceptual cost (future danger) is legible in ‘promise’ and ‘secrets’. Orientation anchored by ~120 words; no disorientation. Meets 9+ cost test, but slight late abstraction in ‘truth might find its way’ keeps it just sub-exceptional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass atrium, brook, and mechanical arm act as micro-settings: reflected light supplies the code-medium, brook’s whisper masks subversion, brass arm literally writes the conspiracy in light. Spatial choreography is clean—Reeves paces, Marlowe remains seated, card angles tracked. One minor slip: ‘eastern wall’ is the only compass cue, not reused, but does not affect choice. Tool (arm) and recurring object (card) charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can encoded dissent survive Academy dogma?—is signaled early. Escalation is intellectual: each syllogistic thrust sharpens the angle-code, narrowing options from debate to covert alliance. No tangible price on-page (no expulsion or broken arm), so cost stays conceptual; thus just shy of 8.5. Agency resides in their decision to keep fencing as code, foreclosing open revolt, satisfying causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of ‘angles’ shifting from geometry to rebellion to jazz improvisation. No explicit thesis; final ‘promise’ image lets reader weigh cognition vs. authority. Subtext in diplomatic compliments (“I see you’ve decoded my invitation”) carries collusion. Complexity—destruction of certainty as creative act—is honored, not resolved into moral. Minor dock for abstract final line, but resonance holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Marlowe’s perceptual filter: brass clicks, light ‘scatters like a prism’, her diction is tactile-mathematical. Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments when angles are traced. No head-hopping; Reeves’ thoughts stay opaque, read through gesture. Distinct rhythmic signature in parallel openings (“If knowledge…then wisdom…”) that mimic fencing cadence. Compression and elision taught early (“angles were eloquent”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High info-density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphor, and concept—“glass atrium caught morning light like a prism, scattering rainbows across the brook”. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops. Metaphors stay coherent (light = code = weapon). Paragraph cuts test passed; each chunk advances stance or code-layer. Minor register lift toward “epistemological doubt” but justified by academic POV and not in peak beat. Closure line clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—philosophical fencing via sundial angles—is fresh yet grounded in character need. Transformation test: could not swap setting or code-object without collapsing logic. Synthesis of Plato’s cave + jazz + steampunk limb feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk taken with abstract stakes pays off through sensory encoding. No obvious literary echo. Slight deduction for “philosophical duel” trope recently mined by Arkady & others, but angle-code rescues novelty.</comment>
