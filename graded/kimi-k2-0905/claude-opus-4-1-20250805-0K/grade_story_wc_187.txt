<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is textured—her “preemptively nostalgic” stance is lived, not labelled—but the only micro-choice that costs her anything is the final inscription; until then she mostly observes. The contradiction between her archivist training and the impulse to invent memories is hinted yet never weaponised in a scene-level decision. Because no second character shares the forecourt, status/relationship pressure is absent, so the crucible is purely introspective. The endurance of writing is credible, but the lack of an earlier fork or visible trade-off keeps the arc just shy of higher tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing: the act of communal inscription reweights the premise—identity will now be actively invented rather than retrieved, and the cost is the permanent loss of an authentic past. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each crystal memory thickens the texture until Lyra’s quill-glow supplies the decisive shift. Orientation is secure—who/where/when is anchored by line 3 and re-anchored at the forecourt entrance. No meaningful escalation beat occurs before the final inscription, but the closure is legible and felt under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, crystal pillars, and lightning-veined fog-stone are rendered through Lyra’s selective attention—she notes distances, temperatures, the quill’s glow—so setting constrains movement and supplies the only usable resource (crystal memory). The “shadow lengths at monuments” micro-setting is taught early and re-illuminated in the ending image, charging the final inscription with ancestral witness. Sensory economy is strong: three senses per beat maximum, always filtered through her archivist priorities. One minor slip—“silent theatre” is a touch generic—barely dulls the edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will they retain a human identity?—is signalled early and tightens once: the realisation that they must conjecture rather than recover. That single deepening is sufficient for lyric-accumulative drive, but it arrives late (≈70 % mark) and costs are conceptual rather than visceral. No option is foreclosed on-page except the abstract loss of an “authentic” past, so the price is felt but not dramatised through a lost object or relationship. Pressure is coherent; a second micro-turn would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: the story asks whether manufactured memory can sustain identity, and the final inscription offers a non-literal answer—yes, if the community continually performs it. The refrain of “pre-emptive nostalgia” evolves from mood to method, reweighting the central question at closure. No moral is asserted; the reader is left holding the paradox. The abstraction is saved from vagueness by the concrete crystals and quill-trails that embody the idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distilled—archival, cool, yet lyrically pitched (“alabaster seas,” “crystal whispering forecourt”). Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, compresses during lightning flashes, mirroring the storm’s rhythm. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perception is strictly Lyra’s. A single over-ornate phrase (“silent theatre”) is negligible against otherwise surgical diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The fog had solidified three days ago” delivers world-state, clock, and menace in nine words. Metaphors are few, consistent, and physics-coherent; no mixed vehicles. Paragraph cuts land on perceptual pivots, propelling rather than pausing. One paraphrase loop (“memories… memory” inside four lines) is too minor to ding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fog-stone premise is fresh, yet the memory-crystal archive echoes familiar tropes; the synthesis feels specific rather than revolutionary. The notion of “pre-emptive nostalgia” as civic duty is the stand-out inflection. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence remains high. A sharper personal stake (loss of her own past, not humanity’s) would have pushed originality higher.</comment>
