<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s vocation and solitude are credibly particularized; the glass-disc-as-emotional-tuning-fork gives embodied, character-specific interiority without label-speak. Yet his stakes plateau: he “waits” for the same call each night, so no higher-stakes choice or visible cost crystallizes—the ending merely restates the ritual. The interior contradiction (lonely yet addicted to distance) is declared, not dramatized in a beat that risks real loss. Closure is Charged Poise, but the stance feels pre-decided, so the renunciation costs less than it could.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of wrong-number calls thickens, time loops, and the final image of perpetual waiting reweights the stake with conceptual cost—“some endings were just beginnings in disguise.” Orientation is clean by line 6 (who/where/when). The only causal drag: no fresh tightening after Eleanor’s third call; escalation plateaus rather than foreclosing an option, but the closure still lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel, rusted ladder, phantom phone bank, and glass disc function as micro-setting objects that literally constrain Marcus’s movements and supply his only tools. Sensory detail is selective (loneliest frequency of third rail, sparse fluorescent light catching rim of disc) and filtered through his technician’s ear. Spatial choreography stays consistent as he walks past booths; no impossible geography. The environment’s acoustic haunt both mirrors and enables his emotional project, charging the final harmonica note that “teaches silence how to speak.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining liminal distance while feeding on counterfeit intimacy—arrives early and stays coherent. Pressure deepens slightly with Eleanor’s creeping self-doubt (“Sometimes I think I made her up”), but Marcus neither sacrifices nor jeopardizes his ritual; options do not narrow further. Agency is mostly receptive (listening, waiting) rather than decisive, so escalation is textural (pattern intensifies) not causal. Cost is conceptual (perpetual exile) not dramatized, satisfying the lens but keeping tension in a narrow register.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of productive estrangement emerges implicitly through iterative wrong-number rituals and the glass harmonica’s “frequencies only the disconnected can hear.” Subtextual irony—caller and operator both pretending to believe the fiction—carries weight without being named. Final line’s “beautifully, necessarily lost” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights earlier images (trains, overlapping platforms) into a metaphysics of disconnection. No final-paragraph sermon; the insight is earned from specific pattern rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Marcus’s technician-perceiver idiom: rail “sings,” disc “responds,” callers “bloom.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens into clauses under electromagnetic hum, mirroring tunnel acoustics. No head-hopping; Eleanor’s interior enters only via Marcus’s interpretation. Dialogue carries subtext (“Tell me about the dream” shows he already knows the pattern). Perceptual signature—audio metaphors, maintenance diction—remains distinct and rhythmic under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density: single sentences often do setting-work and metaphoric work simultaneously (“disc had belonged to predecessor… frequencies only the disconnected could hear”). Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Occasional elevated diction (“liminal space,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly lifts POV beyond plausible operator lexicon, trimming the top band. Minor paraphrase echo (“They always did… They always did”) but not repeated enough to blur closure. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conceit—underground phone-booth network that answers only wrong-number grief calls—feels fresh and specific, transforming the trope of lonely night-shift worker into metaphysical switchboard. Harmonica disc as sonic talisman crystallizes the theme without feeling bolted on. Risk lies in quiet, recursive action, but coherence rewards the gamble. Could not swap setting or device without collapsing the story’s emotional circuitry, indicating strong conceptual integrity.</comment>
