<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—illustrating life while complicit in time-theft—drives every beat; her decision to finish the drawings rather than preserve them crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost (cracked pendant, cleared canals). Emotion stays embodied in throat-hum, pencil tremor, sprinting leap; no diagnostic self-talk. The inherited duty motivates without over-exposition; the final shift to drawing living creatures proves the arc. Secondary characters absent, so no relationship crucible—acceptable at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pendant hum → canal climb → dive through breathing gap → chamber revelation → completing drawings → time restored. Each step tightens because/therefore links; the climax physically returns stolen moments, forcing city-wide readjustment. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: canals flow normal, pendant cracked, new drawings begin—undeniable cost visible on page. Orientation anchored by 80-word mark; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop canals, temporal residue thickness, and Morteus’s architecture constrain every move; canal directionality reversal in final paragraph recharges the setting image. Micro-objects—pendant, pencil, crystalline tubes—are handled, not merely observed. Sensory hierarchy obeys illustrator’s eye: color of extinct wings, snore-ripples in water. Spatial choreography survives rooftop parkour; no floating rooms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free trapped extinctions vs keep city running—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when Marina chooses to complete rather than perpetuate the theft. One meaningful turn: the dive into the chamber irrevocably forecloses her complicity. Cost legible: pendant cracks, city loses borrowed minutes, her illustrations transform from frozen to finished. Escalation causal, not coincidental; no abstract world-saving inflation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: honoring endings > endless preservation; no character states the thesis. Final image—drawing living, present creatures—reweights earlier obsession with margins and absence. Interrupted cadence motif accrues meaning from literal skipped heartbeats to artistic refusal to finish a wing; payoff when she completes the wing. Complexity preserved: city’s comfort sacrificed, no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter—pendant hum, pencil freeze, canal shimmer—without POV drift. Syntax mirrors illustrator gaze: color, line, negative space. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Free indirect clean; no filter-verb stacks. Register consistent, poetic yet precise; no corporate intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: long liquid sentences for canal travel, staccato for chamber list of extinctions. High information density—each sentence advances image or causality; no scaffold or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (time as clay, snore-ripples) and pay off. Zero typos, tense stable, pronoun clean. No overwriting in peak beat; clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Temporal naturalist stealing final breaths from extinctions feels novel and specific; premise commits fully without late rule patches. Risk of upward-flowing canals and giant-integrated city pays off: they constrain action and image. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic thief; occupation and mythic biology are inseparable. Fresh synthesis: extinction debt as literal time currency.</comment>
