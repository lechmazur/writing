<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Maya’s interiority—honest, methodical, mortician-trained—remains concrete and particular; her simultaneous care for her father’s corpse and for the moral ledger gives her a credible, contradictory impulse under pressure. The micro-choice to cremate a pinch of ash into the ink pot crystallizes her values and forecloses easy forgiveness. Wei’s confusion-to-acceptance is sketched too swiftly, denying the scene full crucible status, so the relationship shift feels declared rather than earned. Still, Maya’s professional composure versus inherited guilt supplies enough visible cost to satisfy the 9− quick test.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Maya hands over both stolen pot and restitution envelope, condemning her father’s memory to “Everything” of love minus his crimes—conceptual cost legible in the final line. Causal chain holds: Wei’s breach is the irreversible trigger; Maya’s honesty dissolves his revenge, permitting the exchange. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. A mid-scene flashback block edges past 20 % but is anchored to present tactile cues (embalming cream, ink pot) and alters Maya’s next move, meeting BRR exception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The prep-room micro-setting is vividly specified—embalming fluid catching fluorescents like “liquid mercury,” cream worked into joints—details that constrain how long Maya can stall and where objects (ink pot, envelope) must sit. Spatial choreography stays coherent as bodies and props change hands. The environment does not charge the final image as pot and ashes already did, so the 9+ gate is missed, but selective sensory triage under mortician bias is strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to settle an unpayable ancestral debt—tightens when Maya reveals the pot holds ashes, forcing Wei into a binary: reject or accept composite restitution. Escalation is one deepening rather than multiple turns, sufficient for this length; the price (Maya forfeits relic and money, Wei forfeits revenge script) is on-page. Coincidence is absent; pressure stays coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pot’s metamorphosis: container of theft → container of apology ink → container of cremated ash, reconfiguring “mathematics of a fair trade” into acknowledgment rather than balance. Subtext operates in gesture: stitching her father’s lips while narrating his ledger of lies. Final image of “Everything” avoids overt moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity about love’s remainder after crime. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; no head-hop. Diction—“embalming fluid caught the fluorescent light like liquid mercury”—carries mortician perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences collapse into clipped summary when Wei enters, mirroring threat. Dialogue is sparse but natural; only Wei speaks, his register appropriately terse. No register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: single sentences advance plot, symbolism, and procedure simultaneously. Occasional lyric inflation—“cancer was just his body’s way of keeping honest books”—tips toward aphorism but stays character-true. No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. Pronoun and prop tracking clean; “pot” never drifts to “vase” or “jar.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mortuary prep as confession booth + immigrant restitution parable. Ink-pot-as-urn twist is unforeseeable yet inevitable given cremation motif. Risky choice to stage entire story over a corpse succeeds; specificity of mortician technique keeps premise from sliding into allegory. Derivative-premise guardrail waived.</comment>
