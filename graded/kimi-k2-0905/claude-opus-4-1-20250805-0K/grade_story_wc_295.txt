<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid (“whisper of starlight through its great dome”) and her gift is embodied in the telegram-press gesture, but the “heals with words” power is asserted, not dramatized under pressure; no contradiction or micro-choice shows cost. Hayashi functions as sounding-board only, so status/relationship crucible is idle. The ending’s shared burden is declared, not earned by visible sacrifice or renunciation—closure is conceptually resonant but personally cost-free on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: star-pulse pattern, dream sketches, and telegram relay build density toward the “ancient relay” reconfiguration. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; no orientation penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the memory card added to the atlas visibly reprices the premise—collective endurance across centuries—with conceptual cost (“the burden…became bearable”). Persistent constraint: the observatory must keep listening, foreclosing individual escape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Observatory dome, telescope brass, and V442’s pulse provide tactile micro-setting that constrains attention and guides the final gesture of pressing the telegram to the housing. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (whale-song light) and touch (yellowed paper, delicate petal) over visual catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as astronomers gather at speakers. The daylily’s one-day lifespan mirrors human comprehension, recharging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—decode the temple-star cipher—tightens when V442’s pulse matches dream symbols, foreclosing skepticism. Agency is collective witnessing rather than individual risk; cost is existential loneliness eased by shared ritual, not a tangible loss on the page. Escalation is density-driven, causal under Accumulative lens: each artifact (telegram, flower, audio) layers proof until “understanding dawned.” No visible price alters later tactics, keeping score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as intergenerational relay, beauty inseparable from transience. Daylily, variable stars, and memory card form a silent triptych of ephemeral messengers—no meta-commentary required. Final image of “memory card wrapped in paper” reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Avoids sentimentality by keeping tone austere, midnight-cold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is astronomer-poet (“orange petals translucent as stained glass”). Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for cosmic scale, clipped fragments at revelations. Only two spoken lines—naturalistic, goal-driven (“You’re still awake”). No head-hopping; internal thought cleanly formatted. Filter verbs are minimal, used for lyric distance rather than immediacy loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “starlight whisper,” “morse code written across millennia” do double duty (atmosphere + concept). No synonym loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Metaphors stay coherent—daylily/stellar pulse/one-day bloom. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” territory—but justified by Mira’s scholar mind. Final line cadence mirrors whale-song audio, earning its resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid-dream chronicle with variable-star telemetry feels fresh; trope of “ancient message in starlight” is re-seeded via archival relay rather than lone hero. Daylily as clock is specific, not quirky ornament. Collective unconscious map avoids usualChosen-One trap. Risky accumulative structure pays off in closure image. Slight deduction for echoing “we were wrong about everything” telegram trope, but overall synthesis is memorable.</comment>
