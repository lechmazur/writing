<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Margot’s interiority is textured—her mapping of dust motes, the tremor in a stranger’s handwriting—yet the climactic self-recognition leans on a single tender reveal (Theodore’s envelope) rather than a visible, costly choice. The meteorite and dust patterns externalize her shift, but the emotional price is gestured at, not enacted; still, contradictory impulses (erase vs. preserve) coexist convincingly under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “paper trail she thought she’d destroyed” is returned, reframing her past and future with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds—each attic session of omission/preservation sets up the final reweighting—though the decisive beat is off-stage (Theodore’s discovery) rather than Margot’s own action. Under Accumulative lens, pattern of dust→pigeon→music→letter tightens into resonant stasis.</comment>

<comment>Attic skylight and dust motes function as micro-setting: their swirl literally guides her cataloging method and charges the final image. Bookshop below provides class-quiet atmosphere, while 1918 letter embeds wartime stakes. Sensory hierarchy favors visual dust and tactile paper, but selective omission keeps momentum; no geography lapses. Meteorite as pocket-scale “cosmic debris” constrains her palm and symbolism simultaneously.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she trust herself to handle evidence again—tightens when her own wartime letter resurfaces, foreclosing anonymity with felt reputational cost. Escalation is accumulative: each preserved tear stain or omitted clipping incrementally reweights the risk of being known. No external antagonist, but internal pressure coheres; the final reversal is coincidental (Theodore’s possession) yet complicates rather than solves, forcing stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as curated absence/emphasis—emerges through concrete archival acts rather than thesis. Subtext resides in silence: unsent soldier songs, blank margins, unsold meteorite. Final image of “pigeons returning home” reworks earlier failure into earned continuance, avoiding moral statement. Complexity lingers: omission can be mercy or betrayal; ambiguity is purposeful, resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is bird-trainer’s—trajectories, tremors, flight paths color every notice. Syntax flexes from lyrical (“dust motes spiraled like constellations”) to catalog-precision, mirroring her shift from instinctive trainer to methodical archivist. No dialogue to distort voice. Register stays within plausible lexicon; dust-mote metaphor is taught early and repaid in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic variety supports emotional breathing; long sentences for meditative dust-mapping, clipped fragments when past trauma surfaces. Information density high—each sentence layers texture or backstory without scaffold. No mixed metaphors; “rust-red surface catching the afternoon light” is precise. Minor paraphrase loop on “paper trails could be rewritten” vs “rewritten—not through forgery” but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of pigeon courier, meteorite shard, and attic archive feels idiosyncratic rather than checklist. 1919 sheet-music-as-love-letter is fresh historical angle. Transformation test passes: swapping elements would break causal web. Risk lies in quiet accumulative structure rather than twist, but coherence rewards patience. Specificity of “notation system that converted melodies into flight patterns” prevents generic feel.</comment>
