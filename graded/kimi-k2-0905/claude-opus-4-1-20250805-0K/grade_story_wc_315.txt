<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her hand tightening on the worn parachute buckle while lying about the six-month deadline shows contradictory impulses in scene. The watcher’s burden is embodied, not labeled, and her choice to withhold then reveal real data carries felt cost. Still, the unseen voice remains a cipher; no status shift or relationship change occurs on the page, so the relational crucible is absent. The renunciation is earned, but secondary pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: static clears → stranger demands → Maya lies → drives hidden. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: “her burden had become her purpose” reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost. The six-month lie is the decisive act that forecloses corporate extraction for now; cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The arbor is not backdrop: bioluminescent moss, aerial roots, and thinning oxygen constrain every move and hide the data cache. The parachute buckle micro-setting returns as talisman in the final beat, charging the image. Selective sensory hierarchy—chemical signals, fungal networks—mirrors Maya’s scientific gaze without tourist excess. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—forest survival—tightens when the unknown caller forces Maya to choose complicity or sabotage. The seven-minute clock is announced but never tracked; tension plateaus rather than spikes. The lie about six-months is the single meaningful narrowing of options; no further escalation beat occurs. Cost is present but front-loaded, not compounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: scientific witnessing vs corporate extraction, the ethics of data ownership. Final image of “burden become purpose” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. No symbolic objects are forced; moss and buckle accrue meaning naturally. Ambiguity lingers—reader must decide if Maya’s lie saves or merely delays—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual signature—technical diction, tactile precision, vertigo metaphors. No head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens under threat; rhythm mirrors altitude breathlessness. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext: “Can you be trusted?” tests allegiance, not honesty. Voice remains distinct from corporate or activist clichés.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences perform double duty—worldbuild while advancing choice. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors stay coherent: “silence that isn’t absence but presence” fits fungal communication logic. One paraphrase loop (“growth patterns” repeated in adjacent lines) costs −0.2; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Inverted sky-forest as carbon sink is fresh; trope of corporate data theft is inverted by scientist-as-saboteur. Six-month lie as tactical delay feels non-obvious and specific to this world. Risk taken: climax is a quiet lie rather than action set-piece, yet stakes feel planetary. Transformation test passes—story collapses if setting or lie is removed.</comment>
