<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voss’s quietly enthusiastic fatalism is embodied in the tactile coin-casting ritual; her interiority stays anchored to sensory detail (“warm surface,” “metallic song”). The causal loop never lets her motives truly evolve—she is always already the decision—so the “choice” feels foreclosed rather than paid for in fresh cost. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The piece teaches its retro-causal pattern early and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: Voss realizes she is the universe’s memory-expansion seed. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—eternal casting at the end of time—so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. One tightening is sufficient; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ambered deck, foreign coins, and static bursts are concretely handled, constrain every beat, and recharge the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent (purple-white crackle, metallic resonance). No credibility slips; spatial choreography is crystal. World rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve expansion memory against collapse—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density of static bursts and coin resonance that forces her stance crystallization; cost is the eternal loop itself. One meaningful tightening suffices. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than new action, fitting the retro-causal frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of Sisyphus: endless backward planting instead of upward pushing. No moralizing; resonance is encoded in the final image of coins orbiting as galaxy traces. Ambiguity lingers—hope or futility—without confusion. The concept reweights earlier material without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, compressed but legible; patterned elision (“saw/would see/had seen”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is consistent—astronomer-sailor hybrid noticing. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Register stays within Voss’s plausible lexicon; syntax mirrors her looping cognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences avoid template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence layers metaphor, action, and concept. One mixed metaphor (“gnawed like background radiation”) but clarity intact. No loops or scaffold; final line recharges “amber” and “breathing” motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The retro-causal coin-casting oracle at entropy’s end feels inevitable yet fresh; synthesis of myth, cosmology, and numismatics is specific to this voice. Risk—elliptical time grammar—heightens meaning without obscuring closure. No trope templates; the loop is premise, not twist. Resists abstraction via tactile coins and static bursts.</comment>
