<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sarai’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. creation, restoration vs. renunciation—are dramatized through tactile tessera choices and embodied cold-heat sensations. Interiority avoids labels, instead using “strange, cold warmth” and micro-actions (kneeling, tracing) that externalize value hierarchy. The earned shift from curse to invitation feels credible because each vision is paired with an on-page micro-choice (fitting, weeping, deciding). Minor slip: the Brotherhood as off-stage antagonist reduces live interpersonal pressure, capping depth at 7.3.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stones re-inscribe her name among the divine, making mercy canon at visible social cost (“Tell the Brotherhood…”). Causal chain holds—each tessera press causes a temporal vision that rewrites present options; final refusal to restore but to remake is tightened by prior pattern. Orientation is solid within 120 words (tessera, frost, plaza). One transition (old man entrance) is cleanly handled. Drive lens is Causal throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tessera itself functions as micro-setting: its temperature, weight, and pattern shift constrain every major choice and charge the final image when it re-inscribes her name. Spatial choreography is impeccable—stone-to-stone spiral path is tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias: visual geometry, thermal paradox, mortar grit under fingernails. Shattered sky evolves from backdrop to promise-light, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Meets 9+ gate: object constrains tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether she will keep trying to restore or accept transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the stones rename her, foreclosing restoration as live option. Escalation is iterative rather than reversed: each vision deepens knowledge and raises social cost (Brotherhood hunt). Agency is present at every beat—she chooses to press, to weep, to speak the final defiance. Price is conceptual but legible: her name’s sacralization makes her a heretic target.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of mercy as aberrant creative force emerges through pattern-shift rather than assertion: the ninety-nine names literally make room for her own. Subtext operates in gesture—kneeling in ruin, cradling fragments—avoiding final moral. The ending image (“shattered sky…promise”) reweights earlier cosmic fracture into generative light. Avoids sermon; only soft echo is her spoken “mercy isn’t about purity,” which is earned by prior dramatized risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice carries perceptual signature: temperature-based metaphors (“warm coldness,” “cold warmth”) and geometric lexicon (“spiral,” “tessera,” “ninety-nine names”) cohere to Sarai’s mosaic-minded POV. Syntax compresses under vision stress—fragments like “Not physically—temporally”—without losing clarity. No dialogue contamination; old man’s line is spare, region-neutral, appropriate to scarred survivor. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, staccato for vision breaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and world data (“tessera gleamed crimson…warm despite frost”). No loops or scaffold; each clause advances. Metaphors are consistent—fire, frost, starlight—without mixed vehicles. Strong verbs (“split open,” “shepherded,” “cradling”) minimize modifiers. Final line varies paragraph length to create visual cadence and emotional exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses retrocognition with mosaic mysticism—fresh synthesis of time-magic and Islamic architectural sacred numerology. Specificity of “ninety-nine names of divine compassion” being re-patterned to include a woman radicalizes familiar post-apocalypse guilt plot. Risk taken: iterative lyric structure instead of single reversal; pays off via charged poise closure. Could not swap tessera for any macguffin—its thermal and sacred properties are irreplaceable.</comment>
