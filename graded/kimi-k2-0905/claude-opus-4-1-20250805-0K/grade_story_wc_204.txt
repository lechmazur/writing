<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Moth’s solitary perfectionism and her eventual surrender to paradox are believably rooted in her craft; the silent rupture moment forces a genuine, costly renunciation of her life’s work. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through tactile letterpress and frost images rather than abstract labels. The only thinning occurs in the multi-self epiphany, where the “every possible version” line edges toward diagnostic shorthand, slightly diluting embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library’s dissolution and Moth’s scattering rewire the rule-set of negotiable reality, with the frost-to-come as visible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly linear; the pattern is taught early via frost → whisper → print chain and holds through the final image. The compression-of-eternity beat is on-page and charged, satisfying the 9+ cost test, but a hairline slip in lens clarity at the multi-self flash keeps it just below the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is not backdrop; its floating fragility and frost-governed shelving directly constrain Moth’s choices and supply the printing method that triggers collapse. Micro-setting—letterpress, bottled whispers, crystalline apples—functions as tactile tools that charge the final page. Spatial choreography stays clean as books fall and trees chime; only the cloud-sea geography remains lightly sketched, capping the score just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve perfect order vs. surrender to infinite compression—tightens exactly once when the black-labeled bottle forces the rupture, foreclosing the filing system forever. Escalation is accumulative: each frost transcription adds density until the silence implodes the library. Cost is legible in the physical dissolution of the orchard and Moth’s self-scattering, though the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt, holding the score in the low-8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the beauty and necessity of destroying perfected systems to release new stories. Subtext resides in frost patterns and bottle darkness rather than exposition; the final frost-on-unborn-windows image reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—was annihilation salvation or loss—yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught from the first sentence; syntax mirrors the crystalline lattice Moth reads. Perceptual signature is consistent—frequencies, timbres, shades of longing—never slipping into generic fantasy cadence. Register stays within a print-craft lexicon; the one near-philosophical flourish (“eternity folded into itself like origami made of time”) is brief and image-driven, not abstract, keeping the score at the high end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent within the glass/frost/print field—no mixed vehicles. A single paraphrase loop (“whispers strained against their glass prisons to fill it” echoing earlier prison motif) is the only detectable artifact, minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—post-negotiable-reality library of bottled whispers—feels fresh yet instantly credible. Frost-as-code and printing-the-silence synthesize letterpress craft with cosmic rupture in a way that would collapse if any ingredient were swapped. Risky lyric compression pays off: the ending image scatters both self and system, achieving inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
