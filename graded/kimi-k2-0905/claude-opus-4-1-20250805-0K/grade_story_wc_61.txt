<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Keeper’s lone-sentinel premise supplies a consistent interior motive—collect starlight without fire—yet her choices never tighten; she drifts, observes, remembers, but nothing is hazarded or forfeited. The only micro-choice—pressing the gear to a dying star—recurs without altering tactics. Affective cost is asserted (“burden,” “privilege”) rather than dramatized, so the arc is static, not steeled. Still, the ethereal POV is coherent and emotionally particular, satisfying the 9- gate’s contradictory-impulse test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric CR: the gear’s endless spin reframes the earlier calculation motif into meditative acceptance of unreachability of infinity, with felt cost in the phrase “when the last star finally dimmed.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern repetition with cadence shift rather than causal chain—held cleanly through the final image. One shard spans eons but remains one contiguous window; orientation of who/when is implicit by line 3. The missing piece is a mid-story tightening that forecloses an option; without it, the escalation is emotional density only, not choice-narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nebula garden is rendered through kinetic verbs—“drifted,” “burst,” “nursing,” “cutting”—so setting acts as active loom, not backdrop. The gear and translucent body serve as micro-settings that constrain gesture; gear’s worn teeth tangibly limit calculation. Sensory hierarchy skews visual/photon, justified by light-harvest concept; missing tactile/olfactory is POV-appropriate. Spatial choreography is clear across fold-transit; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness and remembrance—signals early; pressure is existential loneliness rather than reversible jeopardy. Tightening occurs as red-giant countdown shortens to “three thousand years, perhaps four,” a temporal lensing that reframes eternity, not options. No resource is lost, no path foreclosed; the gear keeps spinning, the Keeper keeps tending. Cost is affective, not tactical, so escalation stays poetic rather than dramatic, fitting Accumulative lens but capping impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The reprise of “share light without using fire” versus fiery consumption becomes the emergent moral calculus; no authorial statement is required. Infinity as unreachable horizon is shown through the gear’s ceaseless yet futile rotation, avoiding abstraction. Final image of remembering every fallen petal reweights prior floral metaphors into elegiac archive. Theme accepts irresolution: beauty persists alongside inevitable erasure, earning quiet resonance without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively lyric-scientific: “quantum bottles,” “gravitational ripples,” “virgin starlight” compress cosmology into translucent perception. Syntax elongates then contracts, mirroring eon-long respirations; no template cadence. Psychic distance stays tightly fused to translucent sensorium; no filter-verb stacks. Register never drifts into essay; diction remains within post-physical custodian lexis. Compression like “quiet sigh of falling petals” is taught early and paid off, so lyric elision is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and launch angle; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors remain internally coherent—star as flower, gear as clock-heart—and do not collide. Information density is high: one sentence often carries visual, temporal, and emotional data. Minor over-painting in nebula description (“translucent form catching starlight like dew on spider silk”) but image is anchored to POV and does not recur at climax, so closure beat stays clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Cosmic-gardener trope is refreshed by photon ethics—non-consumptive witness—and by gear-as-prayer-wheel, not computer. Synthesis of entropy caretaker with sentimental archivist feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric time-scale compression succeeds under Accumulative lens. No close echoes of canonical sf set-pieces; voice and metaphor are idiosyncratic. Within-band bonus +0.3 for structural risk that heightens coherence.</comment>
