<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Mira’s “root-bound” trait is dramatized through her tactile handling of the clipping and her willingness to kneel and press it to the earth; the contradictory impulses—anchor vs. portal—are active in-scene. The final choice to sign the covenant is prepared by earlier causal links: her scar-reading skill, the mirror-warning, the maze-response. Cost is visible in the trembling hands and the phrase “roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing,” a charged renunciation of safety. Interiority stays concrete (“anxious elation thrumming through her veins like electricity through water”) and avoids label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s signature-in-starlight crystallizes a new covenant, reweighting time itself; the cost is the irreversible fusion of root and wing, felt in the final cadence. Causality is intact: the clipping’s warming → maze bloom → scar-cat’s-cradle → signature forms a clean because-chain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are supplied by word 34 (“The cobalt glade shimmered as dusk approached…”). No lens ambiguity; the piece ends in the same accumulative/textural mode it begins.</comment>

<comment>The glade operates as both environment and symbolic constraint: its blue grass parts only in response to the clipping, forcing Mira’s path. The maze-topiary functions as micro-setting—its knee-high hedges literally narrow her physical options toward the cat’s-cradle scar. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices texture (“waxy leaves bend but not break”) and color shifts against the failing light. Final image re-uses the cobalt glow to charge the Earned Stasis, proving the setting is not backdrop but catalyst.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</answer>
<comment>The dominant stake—“will the intersection reopen and at what cost to the anchor?”—is signaled by the mirror-edict and tightens when the maze hedges trap her knees, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful deepening: the discovery that the covenant was never broken, only eclipsed, flips the jeopardy from “repair time” to “accept irreversible fusion.” Price is legible: she signs away the possibility of remaining merely rooted. Agency is continuous; each beat is triggered by her tactile choices with the clipping.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recurring root/wing polarity rather than assertion; the final image answers the implicit question of whether fixation and flight can coexist. Subtext operates in gesture: pressing living cutting to scarred earth enacts the union of wound and growth without naming it. The cobalt/blue color motif shifts from ornament to covenant-light, reweighting prior appearances. No sermonizing; the closing smile is an image, not a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly interior; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is botanic-tactile: time is tasted through sap, scars read like braille. Syntax modulates—long lyrical sentences in calm moments, clipped fragments (“So here she stood…”) under pressure. Diction stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon yet achieves texture (“scattered sapphires,” “cat’s cradle made of light”). Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she felt the response”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: urgent enjambment during maze growth, then a caesura before the final cat’s-cradle. Metaphors are coherent—no mixed vehicles—and tied to POV expertise (gardening, scar tissue). Information density is high: “root-bound had made her the only one to notice when the future arrived early” layers backstory, causality, and theme in twelve words. Minor scaffold: “anxious elation” is repeated; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Eclipsed covenant” and “linking through scars” are fresh syntheses of quantum-multiverse and folk-plant magic, made specific through tactile gardening practice. The maze topiary as both map and key is a non-obvious object-turned-tool. Risk—collapsing future into present without explanatory exposition—pays off because the root-bound anchor premise is taught early and closure reweights it. Transformation test fails: swap clipping/hedge for generic talisman and entire causal chain collapses.</comment>
