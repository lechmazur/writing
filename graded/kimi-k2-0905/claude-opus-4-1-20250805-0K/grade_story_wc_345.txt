<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina’s altruistic drive is clear, but she never confronts an interior contradiction or price; her choices are purely beneficent, so the arc is flat. No micro-choice under duress reveals a hierarchy of values—she simply writes messages. The absence of felt cost or risk keeps her from feeling like a fully dramatized character rather than a plot-spirit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bell materializes, the orchards are networked, and the ghost’s farewell message reconfigures the community’s identity under a causal lens. The mosaic structure (five short shards) is taught by 25 % and transitions remain legible. One causal gap—how the families instantly trust anonymous chalk—is smoothed by narrative acceleration and does not rupture the final image’s cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating stone arches, crimson sky, and the brass bell are rendered with sensory economy and reappear to charge the final image. The bell’s weight and warmth constrain the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate. Occasional orchard placeholders (“millions of fruit trees”) stay generic but never stall spatial clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—save the orchards—tightens when soil samples must cross fences, foreclosing isolationist options. Escalation is linear rather than spiraling; no reversal tests Marina or the families anew after the mycologist’s reveal. Cost is collective, not personal, so pressure plateaus once cooperation begins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of communal interdependence emerges through fungal networks and fence-line erasure, never sermonized. Final chalk line “Remember” reweights the premise with conceptual cost: unity is ongoing labor. Avoids tidy moral by leaving blight pockets intact, preserving tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient floats above the mosaic without head-hopping; diction stays horticultural and restrained. Perceptual signature is communal rather than individuated, fitting the group stake. Bell’s final warmth is a deft sensory flip that rewards earlier ethereal treatment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and info-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional soft intensifiers (“despair made visible”) flirt with cliché but are isolated. Register holds steady; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Colony orchard blight is familiar SF soil, yet the ghost-as-mycelial-matchmaker angle feels fresh. Fungal diversity mapped onto social trust is a specific synthesis that would collapse if elements were swapped. Risk is moderate—ghost horticulture—but execution commits fully.</comment>
