<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s inherited guilt and complicity are credibly embodied; the moment he fingers the Portuguese carving his contradictory impulses (profit vs. shame) collide in a single micro-gesture. Interiority stays concrete, but the climactic choice to “close his business, destroy his files” is declared rather than dramatized, blunting the felt cost and keeping the change short of full earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: watch hand → terrace → driftwood map → recognition of grandfather’s betrayal → renunciation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: placing the hand among the carvings visibly forecloses the false-memory trade and reweights the family silence with social cost. One minor warp: the off-stage “someone” who arranged the carvings is never grounded, but the device serves as inciting pressure, not resolution, so causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Cobalt terrace, salt-worn wood, bruised-purple dusk—each sensory layer is filtered through Elias’s forensic gaze and keeps the shore present in every beat. The watch hand’s brass glint and the carved coordinates function as micro-setting that literally steer his discovery, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep manufacturing lies or confront the family crime—tightens the moment the coordinate map emerges. One meaningful turn: he chooses renunciation, forfeiting wealth and protection. Cost is legible in the final image of the abandoned hand; pressure escalates cleanly under the causal lens without requiring external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth’s weight versus curated forgetting—emerges through the driftwood museum and the renunciation act, never sermonized. Final image of the shore “waiting for the next person” reconfigures the stakes from private guilt to collective responsibility, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is genealogist-cold until tactile contact with wood releases sensory memory. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “sieved hush” that accrues ironic density; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language (bruised-purple sky, museum of tempered regret) is selective and never clutters the climactic beat. One paraphrase loop—“weight of withheld truth / weight of unspoken words”—costs a −0.2, but the final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The black-market genealogist who sells false pasts is fresh, and linking his trade to refugee-ship betrayal discovered via driftwood confessions is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk lies in the quiet renunciation rather than thriller confrontation; coherence remains intact, giving the piece a memorable angle on inherited guilt.</comment>
