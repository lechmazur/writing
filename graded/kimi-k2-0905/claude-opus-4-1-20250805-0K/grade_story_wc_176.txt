<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elsa’s interiority is vivid—her artisan’s fingers “find the rope’s logic intuitive,” a lovely embodiment of vocation. The contradiction between guilt over the lost wax cylinders and her new braiding-casting vocation is dramatized in micro-choices (unbraiding, casting bells) rather than summarized. The only drag is a faint therapeutic self-labeling (“she understood now what the Victorian collectors had been attempting”) that slightly dilutes raw pressure, but her flawed, grieving competence remains legible and drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the re-braided rope ready to be played, bronze bells that will “sing a single saved name forever,” and the aurora-lit sanctum melting into dawn. The cost is felt—she forfeits perfect preservation for perpetual transformation—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: each braid, card hole, and bell accumulates texture until the final image reweights “memory as transformation.” Causality is lyric rather than plot-heavy, appropriate to the 750-word lyric frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice sanctum, aurora ribbons, and the rope’s trapped frequencies are inseparable from Elsa’s choices; the melting ice walls literalize her thawing guilt and supply the water for investment casting. Micro-setting (card fragment, shed hair, bronze droplets) constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy is caster-specific: heat, tension, vibration over visual spectacle. No orientation debt; spatial choreography is clean throughout the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she redeem her failure to preserve sound—is signaled by paragraph two and tightens through each re-braiding beat. One meaningful deepening: the punched card reveals her own ancestral name, flipping preservation from abstract duty to intimate legacy. Cost is visible—she weeps frozen tears, forfeits wax nostalgia for bronze fragility—under Accumulative lens. No false escalation; coincidence (finding the card) complicates rather than saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory survives only through metamorphosis, not stasis. The bells’ irrevocable single-note future reprises the rope’s tension-memory in bronze, a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext is embedded in gesture—unbraiding as mourning, casting as forgiveness—never sermonized. Final image avoids moralizing; it crystallizes the premise rather than explaining it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Elsa’s caster perception: “technically gentle movements,” “investment material,” “lost wax logic.” Syntax is rhythmic, metallic, occasionally compressing under auroral pressure (“names like smoke”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction stays within artisan lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. The only micro-slip is one instance of “she understood now,” a faint explanatory nudge, but the perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “bronze still hummed with heat” launches with sensory contradiction; “drops of snowmelt running down like tears of relief” tightens theme to image. No synonym loops or scaffold; information density high—each sentence advances braid, bell, or guilt. Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught (casting/braiding metaphors) and paid off. Clause rhythm modulates with pressure; no algorithmic drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The sound-rope that stores frequencies in tension is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of textile acoustics and memory craft; the punched card as score for hair-braids transforms two archaic technologies into a single elegiac instrument. Risk is high—concept could collapse into gimmick—yet specificity (strand = waveform, bell = name) grounds it. Ancestral self-revelation via card holes feels inevitable in hindsight. Voice, premise, and theme cohere as a singular artistic stance; no echo of familiar scenes.</comment>
