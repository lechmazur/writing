<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s amnesiac-guilt is sharply embodied (“surgical scars still ached”), but the old woman’s motives remain abstract; her dialogue explains rather than pressures. The decisive micro-choice—stepping onto the bridge—externalizes his compassion circuitry, yet we get no interior contradiction at the moment of commitment. Secondary pressure is missing; the woman functions as oracle, not antagonist. Still, the earned cost is visible: he walks forward into perpetual debt, memory erased but empathy intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the obituaries yield coordinates, therefore Marcus descends; because memory is erased, therefore guilt without recall becomes the engine. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing labyrinth reweights his future with undeniable ethical debt. The baseball’s impossible date pays off conceptually, proving past→future fluidity and licensing the non-literal ending. One minor scaffold: “You came” is redundant stage-setting; trim 3 words and closure tightens further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Limestone steps, phosphorescent moss, and the shifting stone bridges are tactile, choice-guiding, and mirrored in Marcus’s unstable self. The underground lake is not postcard backdrop—the organisms brighten under his footfall, turning setting into responsive stakeholder. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track his descent, the toss of the baseball, and the moment the path solidifies. Micro-setting (the baseball itself) constrains the final image: proof that time can be re-written, so empathy can too.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a man who forgets his crimes still repair the damage?—is signaled by line 3. Escalation is single but meaningful: the lake reveals the labyrinth, forcing Marcus to choose self-imposed penance without hope of absolution. Cost is conceptual yet legible: he forfeits the comfort of oblivion, embracing lifelong unrequested restitution. Pressure would sharpen if one bridge briefly faded, threatening literal collapse; as is, escalation is cerebral, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: guilt survives excision of memory, and forgiveness is a solvent applied to the forgiver, not the perpetrator. Baseball and glowing paths echo this—effects outlive causes. Subtext is strongest in silence: Marcus never says “sorry,” yet the offer to shoulder unearned pain is the story’s moral reconfiguration. Only minor drift: the woman’s “humanity has lost something essential” flirts with editorial thesis; truncate and theme stays embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Marcus’s sensory filter; diction—“alien light,” “delicately robust”—bears his stunned, medicated awe. Rhythm elongates then compresses: long sentences for descent, staccato exchange in cave. No head-hop; the woman’s interior is unknowable, preserving mystery. One register slip: “neural pathways for compassion” sounds clinical report; swap to “the feel-guilty wiring they couldn’t cut” and voice stays embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is mostly clean; sentences pull double duty (“The cave mouth swallowed him whole” advances + images). Two micro-loops: “glow” recurs three times in 40 words; replace one with “shimmer.” Filter verb cluster—“he noticed,” “he could see”—could trim to direct perception. Otherwise, propulsion is high; no scaffolding, no mixed metaphors. Final image—“another ghost becoming light”—earns its lyric lift without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Memory-wiped penitent forced to reboot empathy in strangers is fresh; combining it with time-travel autograph converts trope into lived oddity. Labyrinth literalized as bioluminescent stepping-stones is visual risk that pays off. Conceptual integrity: the premise commits fully—no safety exit where Marcus suddenly remembers. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic amnesiac; the 2047 baseball and empathy-engineering detail are irreplicable. Boldness in blending sf grace-note with moral paradox lifts score.</comment>
