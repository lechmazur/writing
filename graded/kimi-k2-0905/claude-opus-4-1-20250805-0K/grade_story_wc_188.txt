<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaia’s pyrotechnic chant and tactile know-how give her a memorable signature; the moment she trades her last rocket for the slow-burn knot shows a believable hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—she “feels the crowd’s anticipation” through designer muscle-memory, not abstraction. The final choice to keep launching home-made stars is earned by every mineral she scrapes from the walls, and the cost—exposure, exhaustion, scarce fuel—is visible in the sustained flare. Secondary townsfolk remain functional, but the crucible is her resolve versus the Dimming, and that conflict tightens credibly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: because the sky is starless, the mosaic artist arranges “REMEMBER WONDER,” which therefore draws Kaia, whose know-how therefore ignites the courtyard display, foreclosing retreat. Closure lands in the sustained bloom of light that “pushed back against the darkness itself,” a Charged Poise that reprices their night with visible, conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 4; no ambiguity at the end. Persistent constraint—the absence of real stars—shapes every tactical decision and the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fortress’s breathing green stones, the map of obsolete constellations underfoot, and the phosphorescent moss all pressure the invention of new constellations; the mosaic physically guides Kaia’s path and later her color palette. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she inventories minerals, not pretty views. The kerosene rag knot’s slow chemistry counts as a micro-setting tool that dictates burn duration and thus the climax; environment materially shapes tactics, clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can wonder be self-ignited when nature quits?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Stakes tighten once: the decision to shred irreplaceable fortress tiles for pigment burns their literal history into the rockets, narrowing future options. Agency is collective but Kaia-led; cost is dramatized in the long flare that consumes both fuel and their last easy escape into darkness. Escalation is modest yet sufficient; the final display’s duration is the visible price, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: self-made light as civic courage. The shift from “Sulfur and saltpeter” to “we make our own constellations” lets motif rewire from craft to defiance. The closing image of light pushing back darkness offers a resonant, non-literal answer—no moral tagged on. Subtext in the traded knot (hope > performance) enriches but stays implicit, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person stays close to Kaia; perceptual signature—chemical recipes, burn-time rhythms—remains consistent. Chant cadence carries emotional peaks without drum-beat monotony; diction (“charcoal and stars”) feels designer-specific, not generic fantasy. Dialogue is minimal but natural: the mosaicist’s skeptic-to-hope arc surfaces in two terse lines. No head-hopping; no filter-verb clot; voice control supports pressure.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between the incantatory lists and short, percussive bursts that mirror fuse timing. Metaphors are spare and coherent—fortress “breathed green light” fits the moss/life conceit; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often layers mineral cue, color payoff, and emotional charge (“Green phosphorescence mixed with copper blue, creating colors that belonged to no natural star”). No synonym loops or template cadence; line-level craft supports rather than decorates the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines star-extinction anxiety with artisanal fireworks lore for a fresh angle; the Dimming is sketched, not over-explained, leaving conceptual space. The kerosene rag knot—an object of performance art—becomes survival technology; that functional flip feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specific mineral scavenging from their own walls turns setting into supply chain, a detail unlikely to transplant unchanged to another tale. Risk in sidelining an external antagonist pays off by focusing pressure on collective mood; bold yet coherent.</comment>
