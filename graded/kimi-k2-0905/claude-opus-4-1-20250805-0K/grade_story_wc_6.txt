<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Maya’s contradictory interior currents—inheritance of fire-hunger versus vocation of rescue—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices: packing the coin with sand, pressing it to her sternum. The final renunciation of her father’s legacy is earned by these visible, cost-carrying gestures rather than abstract assertion. Flaws (inherited hunger, potential freeze under flame) remain active; no diagnostic self-talk. Interiority stays body-anchored and profession-specific.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the talisman over her heart crystallizes a new stance with undeniable conceptual cost—she must now live the graft. Causal chain holds: sand→coin→body→stance; no off-stage resolution. Orientation clean by line 10; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of black-sand/legacy imagery tightens until final re-weighting. Cost legible in last line: “ready” carries the forfeiture of vengeance and the burden of perpetual vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Obsidian lagoon, volcanic beach, and migrating clouds are not backdrop but pressure sources: the lagoon’s “perfect stillness” contrasts her alert stance, sharpening the cost of leaving. Black sand constrains the ritual mechanics; kelp’s touch cues forgiveness beat. Spatial choreography clean—footprints erased mirror internal erasure. Setting charges final image: lagoon releases her reflection, enforcing the before/after shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she re-enact or rewire her father’s fire?—tightens once: the grafting act forecloses revenge-by-fire, chooses preservation. Pressure builds texturally: each grain of volcanic sand adds weight of memory until refusal is the only exit. Cost paid on-page: lifelong vigilance implied by talisman against sternum. No coincidence; agency is hers alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern of black-sand/fire imagery shifting from destruction to nurture; no explicit thesis. Final image of footprints erased by tide reweights premise: legacy is not denied but transformed. Subtext in kelp’s touch—soft forgiveness—carries more force than any spoken absolution. Avoids sermonizing; complexity preserved in simultaneous identity as flame-child and guardian.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is fire-reader’s: clouds as “great procession,” sand as “volcanic memory,” kelp “soft as forgiveness.” Syntax modulates—long breathless cadence during ritual, clipped “She climbed the dunes” at exit. No head-hopping; single POV held. Diction stays within lexicon of firefighter and coastal native; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: “scars can sing if you teach them the right melody” compresses theme and image. No loops; each sentence advances stance or texture. Metaphors consistent—fire, water, volcanic glass—no mixed vehicles. Final line gives rhythmic closure without template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar “arsonist’s child” trope by making the rescue ritual tactile—sand-filled coin graft—rather than psychological confession. Black-sand-as-memory is specific to this obsidian lagoon; not portable. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure rather than fire showdown; coherence maintained. Slight deduction for kelp-as-forgiveness echoing familiar nature-equals-grace device.</comment>
