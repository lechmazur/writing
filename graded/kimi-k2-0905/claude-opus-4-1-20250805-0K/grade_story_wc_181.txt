<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The curator’s temporal vertigo and recursive mission are viscerally embodied—boots click, tongue thick, she whispers “the bathroom” like a lifeline. Contradictory impulses (obedience to protocol vs surrender to paradox) coexist in-scene, but the epiphany (“inheritance isn’t linear”) is announced more than dramatized with cost, muting the final micro-choice. Still, her flaws (rationalist panic, filial reverence) actively complicate the loop rather than decorate it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Conceptual Repricing: the apple bite rewrites the rule-set with undeniable cost—she now tastes her own future memories. Causal links remain intentionally circular rather than linear, satisfying the Accumulative lens: pattern density (ledger line, shell glow, blossom up-draft) culminates in a single charged image that re-weights all prior beats. The orientation waiver is earned—deliberate disorientation pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the pistachio shell functions as portable cosmic interface; porcelain grown from bark acts as both sanctuary and control panel. Sensory hierarchy is curator-centric—magnetic click, vacuum blossom scent, star-juice taste—each detail later mirrored in the closure image. Spatial choreography is liminal by design yet internally coherent; no geography breaks under the inferred fractal logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will she write the message she already found?—tightens via recursive inevitability rather than external opposition. One meaningful deepening: the blank shell becomes a stylus for her own future carving, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is conceptual (eternal self-inheritance) rather than visceral; felt price is legible but not punishing, holding the score just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the looping image-set: inheritance as self-authored palimpsest. No moralizing—final line lets the silver juice reprice the concept. Recurrent motifs (blossoms, ledger, shell) shift meaning without feeling managed; ambiguity is productive rather than evasive. The ethical calculus (curator as both custodian and perpetrator of temporal violation) remains complex and unsettled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline—”phantom apple blossoms drifted past in the artificial atmosphere” fuses sensorium with quantum doubt. Rhythm modulates from staccato discovery (“She had no memory of writing it”) to the long breath of the final lyric sentence. Compression is purposeful—ellipses in time are taught by the opening sentence and paid off in the mirrored ending. No head-hopping; the older/younger selves function as mirrored object, not separate interiorities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often sets scene, stakes, and metaphor simultaneously. Minor scaffold in “blossoms fell upward around her, each petal a moment she had lived, would live, was living now”—three temporal paraphrases where one would suffice. Figurative language stays internally consistent (starlight juice, quantum branches) and never muddles causality. Closing sentence achieves cinematic cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Risk-taking—nonlinear orchard on asteroid, bathroom as philosophy chamber—feels inevitable rather than gimmicky because every element is tethered to inheritance logic. Synthesis of cosmic and domestic (pistachio shell as cosmic key) is specific and memorable. The recursive structure itself is the fresh inflection; removing it collapses the entire emotional arc. Familiar tropes (time loop, cryptic artifact) are transmuted through lyric compression and sensorial immediacy.</comment>
