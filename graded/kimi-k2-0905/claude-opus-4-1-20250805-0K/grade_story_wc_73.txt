<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is vivid—equations tattooed on skin, dice rolled to “give texture to the missed opportunity”—but his contradictory impulses alternate rather than clash in-scene. The promised flaw (grim optimism) is asserted more than dramatized; we never see him dare against self-interest, only ascend patiently. Cost is conceptual (eternal climb) rather than embodied, so the renunciation feels abstract. Still, the voice is idiosyncratic and consistent, keeping him individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each roll and step thickens the pattern until the closing image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—snake-eyes rupture—whose cost is legible: the staircase must confront its own origin. Orientation is swift (“Marcus held the dice…”) and the 17-billion-step loop is foreshadowed early, satisfying the waiver. Causality is thematic rather than event-driven, acceptable under this lens, but the lack of a concrete tactical trade-off keeps it just sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The staircase is sketched with spare, tactile strokes—“chip in one corner where probability itself had fractured”—and the chipped die acts as micro-setting, constraining every roll. Spatial grounding is maintained through the vertical vertigo of “above and below,” while the body’s perpetual climb steers attention to heartbeat-counting. Sensory economy favors touch and kinesthetic detail over visual catalog, matching the POV’s architect-mathematician bias. The environment is not backdrop; its recursive architecture directly shapes the tactical obsession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can Marcus force the closed system to rupture?—is signaled early and tightens via each roll that micro-fractures the die. Agency is present but attenuated: climbing and rolling are iterative, not decisive turns; the “rupture” remains prophecy until the final clause. Cost is conceptual (lifetime spent) rather than tactical loss on the page, so escalation feels atmospheric more than acute. Still, the mathematical proof that the loop equals a lifetime gives the stake a measurable pulse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: closed systems breed their own annihilation through the very imperfection they try to exile. The chipped die acts as engineered flaw, re-weighted at the end when snake-eyes promise cosmic pay-off. Subtext whispers in silence—Sarah’s off-page death is never named grief, only step-count—letting absence do emotional work. The final image reframes ascent as countdown, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight adheres to Marcus’s mathematically tinged perception; diction like “architectural certainty” and “recursive loops” stays within his lexicon. Rhythm mirrors pulse: long cumulative sentences for ascent, staccato roll-clauses for dice beats. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; immediacy is maintained. The voice never editorializes beyond what a driven architect might privately calculate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense: “probability itself had fractured” does double duty as world-rule and character scar. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances pattern or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—dice wear as entropy agent—without overwriting. Opening and closing lines book-end with the same tactile object, giving arc symmetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The infinite staircase as lifetime heartbeat-loop is a fresh inflection on the eternal-return trope, made specific through die-chip entropy. Mathematical theology turned prison feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is structural—plotless ascent—yet pressure accrues via countdown mathematics. The synthesis of thermodynamics, grief, and architecture gives the concept staying power.</comment>
