<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ezra’s “respectfully rebellious” carrier ethic is visible in his risk to carry contraband, but interiority stays generalized (“he had learned long ago…”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The bottled-storm hand-off is a single micro-choice; no alternative path is foreclosed with visible cost to him. Keeper’s entrance supplies exposition, not pressure; status shift is declared, not staged. No contradictory impulse under stress is shown, so the threshold for 7+ and 9+ quick test is missed.</comment>

<comment>Single causal through-line: illegal delivery → drones → Keeper payoff, landing a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the border rules. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 6; no penalty. Closure beat—the storm “remembers” and is carried off—pays off the coordinate set-up with conceptual cost (border can’t bottle memory). Causality is intact; still, escalation relies on one coincidence (Keeper appears) rather than tightening by Ezra’s further agency, holding the score below 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt arcade functions as micro-setting: its roof hole choreographs drone flight and the neutral-ground history sharpens the stake of illegal post. Sensory pick is selective (neon flicker, rusted drop-box, whisper rotors). The bottled storm re-illuminates the space at climax, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges final image. Could ascend higher if weather or architecture physically constrained Ezra’s tactics rather than merely mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—clandestine mail runs under partition eyes—is signaled early; pressure stays steady but flat. One meaningful tightening: Ezra places letters into drone while clutching contraband storm—if caught, both routes collapse. However, no new complication or consequence arises on-page; stakes neither intensify nor exact visible cost from him. Escalation is present but modest, adequate for length yet short of 8+ band where price must visibly reshape tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of suppressed connectivity emerges through image pattern (letters without addresses, storm that crosses borders) rather than overt thesis. Bottled storm as memory reframes partition trauma with poetic economy, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in drone ballet and “absences” manifest, inviting reader to connect postal gaps to political rupture. Final image reweights premise: some forces can’t be partitioned; resonance is earned yet slightly short of surprise needed for 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres to Ezra; perceptual signature is steady (scanner clicks, bag weight, border dusk). Syntax is controlled, rhythm varies, no head-hop. “Cobalt arcade,” “respectfully rebellious” risk slight writerly flourish yet stay within idiom of a reflective courier. Keeper’s diction converges on storyteller cadence, but the shared hush motif legitimizes the brief overlap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and imagistic; sentences carry double duty (description + world-rule). No scaffold loops, near-duplicates, or mixed metaphors. Figurative layer (“mechanical ballet,” “cobalt cathedral”) is sparse and patterned—taught early, paid off. Clause density breathes with scene tempo; opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cyber-espionage drone logistics with nostalgic arcade poetics yields fresh angle on border récit. Bottled thunderstorm as portable memory is conceptually bold yet emotionally coherent. Absence-as-address mechanic flips standard smuggling trope into lyrical postal fable. Risk stays integral; no gimmick—closure requires the exact objects and place.</comment>
