<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marion’s contradictory impulses—ritual grief vs. strategic invention—are dramatized in every beat (tuning-less prelude, frame-counting, reckless Rachmaninoff acceleration). The final choice to keep playing, forfeiting the old compass-logic of “home,” is earned by the coral-piano harmonics she alone forged. Cost is visible: Sophia returns film-wet, years thinned, and Marion’s hands tremble on the last note. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because Marion studies spliced reels, she experiments with music→magnetic pause→Sophia steps through. One meaningful escalation: the hand-condensation between frames 1847-48 forces Marion to improvise, narrowing options to “play faster or lose her.” Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the clock lurches 11:48, time resumes but under new rules—compasses point to “where home waits to be built,” not backward. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by sentence two.</comment>

<comment>Calcified coral roots, untuned piano strings, and silver emulsion dripping from shoulders are irreproducible details that also constrain action: coral conducts sound, emulsion allows transit. The broken clock’s frozen hands become the visual timestamp of loss and later the visual proof of restart. Environment literally reshapes navigation; micro-setting (piano interior, projector gate) enables the climax. Final image—stars as film perforations—recharges every prior frame metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Marion bend spacetime to recover Sophia before magnetic chaos seals the sky-road. Pressure tightens exactly once: the hand-condensation proves live presence, forcing Marion to abandon safe repertoire and risk tearing the corridor. Price is paid immediately—compasses permanently reorient, foreclosing return to old flight paths. The choice is hers; coincidence only complicates, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges refracted: refuge is not a place but an act of improvised creation. The story refuses to moralize; instead, the final image reweights “home” as an unfinished direction. Subtext lives in silent objects—clock hands, piano hammers, wet celluloid—each mutely testifying that grief can be engineered into passage. Reader leaves with the concrete after-effect of a compass needle that now spins forward, not back.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marion’s perceptual filter: “yellowed key,” “cumulus layers like inverted branches,” “silver emulsion dripping from her shoulders.” Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragmentation during the breakthrough beat, then exhales into longer clauses for reunion. No head-hopping; Sophia’s first words are external, keeping knowledge bounded. Register remains consistent—scientific precision where needed (“frames 1,847 and 1,848”) without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“needles spinning wildly before pointing toward memories” packs both physics and emotion. No mixed metaphors; coral-as-antenna and film-as-corridor obey internal logic. Final line (“stars emerged like perforations in film”) lands clean, recharging prior motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Navigation-by-regret and dirigible refugees trapped in celluloid are fresh syntheses, not stock alt-history. The magnetic storm as regret-divining rod transforms a weather trope into emotional technology. Risk—using musical harmonic resonance to open a film-reel wormhole—pays off without gimmick because groundwork (coral bones as resonant chamber) is laid early. Specificity makes the premise inseparable from this setting; swap coral for steel and the climax collapses.</comment>
