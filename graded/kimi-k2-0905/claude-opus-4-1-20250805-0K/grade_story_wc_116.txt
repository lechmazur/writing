<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically textured but homogenously calm; no contradictory impulse ever destabilises her. The eternal stance is declared, not dramatised; micro-choices are missing. Cost (“pure witness”) is asserted, not paid on-page. All emotional beats occupy the same meditative register, flattening progression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early and held; closure is a Charged Poise that prices the keeper’s eternal silence. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives ~80 words, safe. No causality break, but no tightening turn either—pressure accretes through imagistic repetition rather than narrowing option. Cost is conceptual (perpetual witness) and felt, satisfying closure gate yet remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is protagonist: book-soil, river-time, origami-map. Micro-objects (swan creases, basin, reed mat) constrain ritual action and resurface in the final reprise, passing 9+ gate. Sensory triage favours tactile and acoustic green darkness; visual data is rationed to match monkish focus. Space is stable, no geography drift; world rules (pages → soil → ferns) stay consistent and causally active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to witness without judgment”—is declared early, never seriously tested. Pressure deepens imagistically (library grows wilder, words sporulate) but keeper’s tactics unchanged; no reversal or resource loss. Agency is observational; cost is diffuse. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; meets accumulative criterion yet lacks visceral trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as compost, history as perpetual decay-renewal. Image of origami swan returning as map of becoming reweights earlier material without moral. Subtextual irony: explorers given blank paper, invited to repeat the same folding that erases answers. Final image crystallises conceptual cost without explicit thesis, satisfying resonance gate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at restrained distance; diction stays within keeper’s contemplative register. Syntax lengthens and slackens to mimic river-time, contracts slightly at explorer intrusions. No head-hop; POV remains fixed. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythmic control is consistent; no mechanical cadence detected.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but patterned; metaphors (roots through marble, phosphorescent moss) cohere within eco-catacomb logic. Minor loop: “change without judgment” phrase recurs three times without new inflection. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Sentence variety good; paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm. Closure line avoids purple excess, landing cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Chronicler-as-mycelial-librarian is fresh; origami-as-temporal-map gives conceptual twist. Tropes of forgotten cities and underground archives are familiar, but transformed through soil-books and word-spores. Risk of static meditation is taken and mostly sustained. Specificity of “cryptic folds” and “regenerative silence” lifts concept above generic post-apocalyptic archive tale.</comment>
