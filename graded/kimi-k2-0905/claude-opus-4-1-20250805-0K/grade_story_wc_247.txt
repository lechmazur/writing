<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—arthritic joints, the ache of beauty without sound—yet her contradictory impulses (clinging to silence while mapping it into form) stay mostly summary-level; the camera ritual is shown, the refusal to re-enter sound is embodied, but the pivotal turn to accept Chen’s co-creation is slightly under-motivated, arriving as tender affirmation rather than pressured choice. Chen’s quietly charismatic pull is dramatized only in one beat; her status as former interpreter is told, not tested under pressure. The cost of forty years of erasure is felt, yet the final smile feels more benediction than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty camera’s final click crystallizes a new language between silence and sight, with undeniable social cost—no audience, no sound, no film, yet music exists. Causality holds: because Maya maps silence for three years, therefore Chen can translate that map back into sign, re-configuring both women’s options. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of timestamps + clicks builds density until moonlit harbor re-weights the stake. One micro-drag: “forty years ago” backstory block arrives ~word 260, just past the 120-word orientation cushion; because the harbor moon is already anchored and the block tilts present stance (why she photographs nothing), the orientation test is waived, but the late insert nudges coherence down a tick.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is never mere postcard: moonlight carves silver paths that guide camera angles, water texture changes the quality of shadow Maya must capture, and the shoreline distance constrains how far the two women can physically walk while mapping. The vintage Leica’s weight, click, and empty chamber function as micro-setting; its mechanical resistance shapes the rhythm of every beat. Spatial choreography is immaculate—Chen steps closer mid-gesture, Maya frames her profile against water, footprints left behind—so environment and body charge the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into a shareable form—signals early and tightens when Chen offers live interpretation of the map; the option of perpetual solitary mapping is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: each imagined photograph accrues until the moonlit harbor becomes a concert hall; the cost is the public absence of sound and audience, felt every time the shutter clicks on emptiness. Agency resides in Maya’s decision to let Chen embody the map; this renunciation of pure authorship carries visible social cost—her private silence will now be seen by another. No reversal, only deepening, but the deepening reweights the stake under accumulative lens cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as generative medium, memory as collaborative art. The camera’s empty chamber reprises as both loss and instrument; the harbor’s mercury gleam becomes a staff paper for gestures. Subtext lives in sign—Chen’s hands “dancing” where sound should be—so theme stays embodied. Final image of footprints plus echo of gesture offers resonant non-literal answer: art persists as shared motion, not recorded artifact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person single POV stays tight to Maya’s perceptual bias—she clocks light texture, joint pain, the absence of sound—never venturing into Chen’s interior. Syntax mirrors her halt-and-flow rhythm: long lyrical sentences for harbor glow, staccato “Click.” for shutter. No dialogue spoken; signed lines carry indirection (“Listen with your eyes” carries gentle challenge). Register holds—no academic drift, no filter-verb stacks. Voice is distinct: “spilled mercury,” “ghost stories whispered in conservatory halls” read as Maya’s professional-aural memory, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence variety; no template cadence or synonym churn. Information density high—“vintage camera held no film—hadn't for years”—does three jobs in nine words. Metaphors are coherent: mercury = reflective dispersion, never contradicted by later imagery. One minor scaffold: “mapping silence for three years now” repeats the same fact twice inside 30 words; a −0.2 nudge. No artifacts touch closure beat; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—composer who loses hearing, tries to reverse-engineer silence back into music via empty camera—feels fresh and specific to this character. The inversion of her earlier sign-language symphonies is conceptually elegant and inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to stage the climax as dawn signing-session pays off: accumulative lyric pattern taught early. One small echo of familiar “artist forgotten by world” trope prevents 9.0, but harbor-as-concert-hall reconfigures it.</comment>
