<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—preserve Eleanor’s peace vs. expose Thomas’s erasure—coexist in the micro-choice of the codicil; the walnut-stained fingers that close around the locket embody the visible cost of that fusion. Interiority stays concrete, never abstracting into label-speak, and the final renunciation (carrying both truth and mercy) is fully earned by the prior archival sleuthing. Only the slightest emotional ventriloquism in Eleanor’s “Thank you” keeps this from a 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the covenant handed over while Mara’s hidden codicil forever couples mercy with indictment; the cost is the locket she now inherits—an unpayable weight. Causal chain holds: because Thomas burned the records, Mara regenerates, because she learns the truth, she adds the microscopic indictment, therefore the document now carries both absolution and accusation. Orientation is anchored by wisteria and jetty within 50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Wisteria perfume and amber light are not backdrop but instruments: their sweetness steeps through Mara’s lungs, guiding her decision to sweeten Eleanor’s last days while preserving bitterness for posterity. The portable ink set and locket function as micro-setting, constraining the final codicil act. Spatial choreography across the jetty is immaculate; bodies and boats stay tracked. One notch below 9 only because weather never quite turns against her choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to let erased victims stay erased—tightens once: the discovery of Thomas’s arson narrows Mara’s options from simple restoration to ethical augmentation. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues her from the dilemma. The price is immediate: she forfeits moral purity and accepts complicity in silence. A hair more visible consequence on her public reputation would have pushed this into 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: archives are battlegrounds where love and erasure coexist; the final image of two women perfumed by wisteria reweights every prior bloom as both incense and corroboration. Subtext in the locket—joy predating the fire—silently argues that happiness itself can be arson’s fuel. No moralizing, only charged particulars; the codicil’s invisible ink is the story’s true moral molecule.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mara’s perceptual signature—ink viscosity, watermark fragments, petal scent—without ever slipping into Eleanor’s head. Rhythm modulates: long clauses steep like tea when she hesitates, then snap into short strokes as the codicil is penned. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within the lexicon of a scribe who tastes tannins in the air.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—action, sensory hit, metaphor—without overcrowding: “walnut-ink stains…near-black” fuses body, tool, and moral discoloration in five words. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances. Only one mixed metaphor—“sheets of gold” atop “violet and gold” twilight—slightly blurs the water’s surface, keeping this just outside 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The archival-restoration trope is inverted: the restorer becomes co-conspirator by adding, not removing, history. The microscopic codicil is a fresh formal invention—an archive within an archive—that could not swap into another tale without collapsing the entire moral calculus. Risk taken (mercy plus indictment) pays off cleanly, turning a sentimental elder-love vignette into a stealth trial of collective memory.</comment>
