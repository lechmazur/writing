<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—tenderness for Thorne versus her own isolation—remains embodied and active; the moment she tilts the goggles to project coordinates, her micro-choice exposes value hierarchy with visible cost. Emotion is never labeled; “ice crystals danced…like suspended grief” lets body and setting speak. Final seated decoding is a credible endurance that forecloses her former blank ascent, paid for by three years of noticing. No safety-hedging; she claims the diary and the risk of future feeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Sorrow shared becomes joy discovered” reweights the entire frozen spire from mausoleum to archive. Causal lens holds—every floor-count beat is a because/therefore linkage that narrows her options until only the astrolabe quadrant remains. Cost is legible in the same instant she chooses to keep the goggles, accepting stewardship of someone else’s encoded joy. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught by floor-two coordinate glimpse pays off in final diary page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The elevator cage itself functions as micro-setting: its swaying lamp literally projects the hidden ink, constraining her next move. Frost, brass gears, and altitude are filtered through servant priorities—she notices dirt she must polish, wind that chaps skin she cannot afford to chap. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible body positions as she handles goggles in a rattling cage. Setting never décor; every ice crack is a clock tick toward the reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she claim Thorne’s hidden tenderness as her own?—tightens precisely: each floor strips warmth, forcing a earlier micro-choice to keep reading. The projected coordinates on frost are the single reversal that forecloses ignorance; after it, she must act. Cost is felt altitude sickness and the social risk of pilfering property. No escalation sprawl; one meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: encrypted grief can be decoded only by sustained, loving attention. The refrains of frost, light scatter, and diary echo without overt statement; no final moralizing paragraph. “I leave to find where wind begins” reconfigures disappearance not as escape but as generosity. Subtext is in gesture—her gloved finger tracing frost is already the answer to sorrow’s freeze.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is servant-specific: brass fixtures are “cleaned,” light bulbs “amber,” oilcloth “wrapped” like provisions she knows by touch. Rhythm modulates—short clauses during elevator lurch, longer cadence while decoding tenderness. No head-hop; single POV stays within her lexicon (“rickety cage,” “supple leather”). Free indirect style cleanly fuses “she realized” with raw sensation. Voice never editorializes beyond her plausible knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero template cadence; sentence openings vary from participle to noun to adverbial clause. Density is high: one sentence often performs setting, emotion, and causal cue (“Through the scratched glass, she glimpsed something etched inside—tiny symbols that shouldn’t exist.”). Metaphors are spare and precise—“ice cracking from its cables like breaking bones”—never stacked. No filter-verb clusters; immediacy sustained. Final line “tenderness survives” lands as earned percussion without drum-beat repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar trope—missing inventor leaves coded diary—feels fresh because the decoder is a low-status cleaner, not a plucky adventurer. Transformation test fails if Mira is swapped out; her servant gaze is what makes frost a projection screen and brass a diary index. Specific detail of “Martha’s sleeping face” in margin note personalizes the encryption logic. Risky choice to narrate entire ascent in real time pays off by making elevator the crucible, not backdrop.</comment>
