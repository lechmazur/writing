<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaspar’s guilt, self-taught re-visioning, and final forgiveness are tracked through tactile micro-choices (thread-pulling, copper offering) that externalize interior change; the contradictory impulse—self-blame vs. desire to teach again—remains active throughout. The emotional arc is specific to a tutor’s professional shame rather than generic regret, and the earned renunciation (leaving the board, accepting imperfect moves) carries visible cost in the final image. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped; headcount stays within default.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he taught the wrong defense → exile → seeks woven hush → decodes tapestry → reweights self-concept; each beat tightens options until the final renunciation forecloses self-flagellation. Orientation secured by word 80; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise as the copper piece and distant thunder crystallize new stance with felt cost (“some storms never break”). No plot amnesia, no late rule change; persistent constraint (frozen time) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen village, suspended rain, and platinum labyrinth are filtered through Kaspar’s chess-tutor eye: he reads the board as text, feels time-friction under fingers, smells ozone that never releases. The monumental pieces serve as both setting and tool—reflection surfaces that force self-recognition—meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean across one continuous scene; no visual cataloging, every detail either pressures choice (the frayed tapestry) or charges final image (copper piece left on board).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signals early; pressure escalates through each decoded thread that rewrites the frozen game, tightening the moral cost of remaining trapped in guilt. The meaningful turn occurs when Kaspar sees his student’s potential face in the queen’s surface, swapping self-blame for pedagogical responsibility; this micro-turn is causal under the inferred lens. Cost is visible: he abandons the hope of undoing the past and accepts lifelong imperfection, paid in the copper offering and the decision to walk away.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from tutor-specific particulars: teaching as a series of imperfect but improvable moves rather than absolute victory. Subtext resides in the tapestry—every pulled thread is a lesson revised, not erased. Final image of distant thunder that never breaks reweights the premise: some errors remain permanent, yet redemption lies in continued teaching. No explicit moralizing; insight is earned through tactile labor on the board/tapestry dyad.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tight to Kaspar’s perceptual signature: chess notation metaphors, tactile obsession with copper pieces, synesthetic treatment of silence as weave-able material. Diction remains within a tutor’s lexicon; rhythm accelerates during thread-pulling sequence, then lengthens into resigned cadence at exit. No dialogue, so voice distinction and quote mechanics not tested. No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat; psychic distance contracts appropriately under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (e.g.,“fidgeted productively” advances both character and plot). Metaphors are disciplined—glass-bead rain, pewter sky, woven hush—each reappears to reweight meaning rather than decorate. Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create natural read-aloud rhythm; no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Opening line anchors voice and surreal premise simultaneously; final line resolves via image that recharges earlier thunder motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chess pedagogy with time-frozen folktale feels non-obvious and specific; the platinum labyrinth is not mere spectacle but a literalized lesson plan. Fresh inflection: using tapestry repair as metaphor for curriculum revision and self-forgiveness. Risky lyric compression (suspended thunder, woven silence) pays off in closure image. Could not swap setting or premise without collapsing thematic logic; transformation is complete.</comment>
