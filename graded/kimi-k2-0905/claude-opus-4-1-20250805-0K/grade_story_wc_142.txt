<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the stone chip, the “painful clarity” of her straddling two worlds—but the turn where she suddenly “announces” the plan feels outline-like; we leap from decoding graffiti to leading a town-hall without seeing her agonize aloud or stumble. The grandmother’s stone gives her a tactile, inherited stake, yet the grandmother herself is off-stage, so the generational grief never lands as a live contradiction inside Maya. The final beat—her thumb pressed to the stone while watching boats approach—shows embodied cost, but the moment is brief and solitary, so the relational price stays thin. Still, her orderly mind is credibly used: she translates walls, forges permits, weaponizes her mainland education; the competence/flaw balance holds.</comment>

<comment>The causal spine works: graffiti warning → Maya decodes → community incorporates as heritage → developers face new legal shield. The “reorganize” pivot is legible and lands with a communal cost (nights of painting, permits, forgery). Yet the single-paragraph jump from “we reorganize tonight” to “within days the city bloomed” compresses the decisive friction; we don’t watch a single resident balk or a lawyer poke holes, so the tightening is told, not felt. Closure image—Maya at the edge, stone in hand, boats approaching—gives a Charged Poise that reweights options: they float free but the siege is ongoing; cost is implied but not yet paid on-page, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<comment>The raft city is sensuously alive: black water mirroring carnival lights, oil-drum fires, wave generators, puppet theaters that developers eye for boutique hotels. Spatial choreography stays clean—Maya moves “between platforms,” children thread booths, artists paint “every available surface.” Selective detail keeps economy: “recycled bottles and sealed drums” labels the physics without exposition. The perpetual-motion carnival functions as micro-setting that constrains tactics—its legal limbo is the loophole they weaponize—so environment materially shapes the ending.</comment>

<comment>Stakes are sharp and early: last free-floating sanctuary vs. “Deep Pockets Diving Soon.” Escalation is present—developers photograph, community pivots to heritage status—but the tightening beat is summarized rather than dramatized (no scene of first rejection, no lawyer laughing at their folk-art bylaws). The price is mostly prospective: they forfeit anonymity and invite inspection, but the reader feels future risk more than immediate loss. Still, the graffiti code itself is a credible, low-tech weapon that narrows options; the shift from passive warning to active legal incorporation is a meaningful because/therefore turn.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: cultural preservation as insurgent citizenship, folk knowledge vs. legal paper. The dual allegiance idea is never moral-tagged; instead it’s lived through Maya’s body—thumb bleeding on the stone while she wields her mainland degree. Final image of graffiti whispering “STILL FLOATING, STILL FREE” reweights the earlier warning system from desperate to triumphant without sermon. The ambiguity lingers: their shield is also a target; freedom is now legislated, not lawless—earned complexity rather than tidy victory.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Maya; perceptual signature is strong—“her orderly intuitive mind decoded instantly”—and diction stays within her educated-raft lexicon. Figurative language is disciplined: “lights like scattered prayers,” “spiral of blue dolphins,” never overwrought. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for carnival sprawl, clipped fragments for action plans. No dialogue to corrupt voice; narration carries subtext. Only minor tic: two “community”-heavy sentences in the climactic paragraph flatten cadence, but texture recovers in the final line.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense: “green paint spiraling up the lighthouse replica” does triple duty—action, color, world rule. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. A single mixed metaphor—“her dual allegiance pulled tight as rope”/“culture shock absorber”—is forgivable at 750 words and doesn’t recur. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; closing line recharges motif. Copy-clean: pronouns track, tense stable, no typos. High-band gate met; only the slight cadence dip noted above keeps it from 8+.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The floating carnival-as-city, graffiti-as-legal-code synthesis feels fresh and inevitable; the premise could have slid into eco-punk cliché but stays grounded in tactile raft life. Transformation test passes—port the plot to any generic slum and the heritage loophole collapses; the water, carnival, and stone are irreplaceable. Risk is taken: hopeful desperation refuses either violent uprising or sentimental defeat, opting for bureaucratic jujitsu. The final reprise of graffiti as both folk art and notarized testimony is a non-obvious reconfiguration that rewards hindsight.</comment>
