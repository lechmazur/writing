<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s grief and muted agency are credibly embodied; the withheld face of Elena keeps her interiority taut and fragmentary in a way that mirrors the memory vials. Only one micro-choice—returning the vials yet keeping the wildflower vial—carries visible cost, but it is a renunciation rather than an escalation, so the arc edges short of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: salt spirals, lantern flames, coffee grounds all accrue toward the cemetery dig. Closure is a Charged Poise—the retained vial and bending flame re-weight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. No causal gap; every image pays off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating headstones and gravity-ambiguous earth are sketched with ruthless economy; the dock’s lantern flames bending toward the cemetery literally steer the final image. Salt-crystal coffin and upward-drifting ashes act as micro-settings that constrain the exhume choice. Only one phrase drifts toward the generic (“gleaming silence”), not enough to mar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to reclaim or rebury excised grief—is signaled in the second paragraph and tightened when the shovel hits crystallized salt. The exhume action itself is the single meaningful escalation; options narrow to keep/break vials, with renunciation as the visible price. No second reversal, but the lens requires only one intensification at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image pattern: bent flame, spirals, upward drift all refract the question of where sorrow goes when deleted. Final lantern flames bending toward cemetery reprise the pattern with conceptual repricing—no exposition needed. Refuses moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether forgetting is mercy or theft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric compresses into a perceptual signature attuned to physics anomalies: “flames bent sideways,” “coffee grounds swirl in impossible patterns.” Syntax stays within a dock-worker’s reach while achieving rhythmic lift. No dialogue, so voice remains unchallenged by register shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; every sentence either advances the salt/flame pattern or sharpens Marina’s interior lens. High information density—“pressed wildflowers grew warm in her pocket” does three jobs in six words. Final line cadence mirrors the first beat, completing a taught spiral of its own.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The memory-extraction graveyard and whale-as-grief-magnet synthesize fresh speculative logic without exposition dumps. Specificity of “lantern lighter” profession grounds the surreal frame. Risk taken—quiet renunciation instead of explosive reclamation—pays off by reweighting rather than resolving grief.</comment>
