<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority—her calm defection from academia—feels lived-in, but the pivot from neutron-star detachment to dust mystic is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene. The final resignation carries cost, yet the emotional price is summarized (“career suicide”) rather than embodied in a visible sacrifice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visit layers butterfly-dust data that silently reweights Elena's scientific premise until she abandons it. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—her notebook sentence reweights decay as instruction—and the cost is felt in the demolition reprieve won by her non-publishable work. A single shard of reflective backstory (≤20 %) is anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance, satisfying BRR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storm-wrecked greenhouse is vivid, selective, and evolves: cracked glass drips, mold advances, seeds sprout. The butterfly dust functions as micro-setting—its accumulating patterns constrain her methodology and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as contractors and scientists arrive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s need for a non-theatrical way of knowing—tightens as each dust map undercuts her neutron-star models. Agency is present (she stops attending meetings, submits resignation), but the visible price is narrated rather than dramatized, keeping escalation slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges through particulate accumulation: knowledge via humility, not drama. The final line reweights “decay” from ruin to instruction without moralizing. Subtext resides in silent dust patterns rather than stated insight, yielding resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature—physics lexicon translated into organic observation—remains distinct. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but narration avoids filter-verb stacks and keeps diction within Elena’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm; high information density with selective, concrete nouns. One template run—“she noticed… she noticed… she noticed…”—dulls momentum mid-section; minor scaffold, not touching closure. Metaphors stay coherent and tied to physics imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star cosmology meets post-flood butterfly dust as epistemic tool. The premise is specific to this voice; risk lies in quiet accumulation rather than catastrophe, and it pays off in the reweighted final image.</comment>
