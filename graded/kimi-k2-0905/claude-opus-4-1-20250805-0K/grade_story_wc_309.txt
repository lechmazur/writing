<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s failure-then-renunciation arc is concrete: she drops the Academy medallion and steps onto mist, embodying “sacred in the simple.” Interiority stays character-specific (“she could barely manage a candleflame”), but the epiphany line “last sacred act was imperfection” veers toward thesis-statement, trimming the highest band. Still, the keystone’s weight and her laugh of recognition dramatize cost, earning the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crystalline spire → mist trail → keystone glow, each image layering density until the final “brilliant dimness” reconfigures meaning. Drop-the-medallion and mist-walk are decisive micro-turns; cost is visible in her forfeiture of sanctioned magic. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: imperfect magic is re-valued. Minor drift: “automated creation engines” logic is accepted, not probed, but pattern stays legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ice-spire, cloud-sea, and keystone are never backdrop: spire height forces the mist-walk, cloud viscosity enables footfalls, keystone roughness reweights the finale. Sensory economy is tight—frost on glass, bite of wind, luminance pools—each filtering Mira’s bias toward tactile imperfection. Spatial choreography is clean: door → step onto nothing → light trail → return. Environment, tool, and body jointly constrain every choice; final image is charged by keystone glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—authentic vs. machine-perfect creation—surfaces early and tightens when she renounces the Academy path. Single meaningful intensification: the mist-walk itself, where failure becomes agency. Cost is legible: forfeiture of credentials and risk of death. No reversal, but under Accumulative lens the pattern break (perfect machines below / imperfect glow above) reweights options sufficiently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: “imperfection as sacred” is shown via ice-flowers grown from nothing, not asserted. Final image of footprints “not quite light” reprises early “lingering luminance,” re-pricing imperfection as valuable. Subtext resides in the keystone’s roughness vs. algorithmic polish. One decorative echo—“brilliant dimness” repeated—slightly thins resonance, but ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is color- and texture-obsessed (“crystalline walls,” “rough carved surface”). Syntax swells then compresses with risk—long clauses atop spire, staccato during step outward. No dialogue, so voice rests on lyrical diction that stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor vehicles consistent (needle/silk, cloud/sea). Rhythm accelerates into mist-walk, then cadence settles on “brilliant dimness” reprise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often jobs—image, motion, theme (“Each footfall created small pools…”). Figurative layering is dense but patterned early, so closure beat avoids purple tangle. One scaffold trace: “perfect, soulless precision” and “perfect machines” near-repetition; minor. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. Final line earns its lifted register because pattern taught it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tech-creativity anxiety with archaic mist-magic is non-obvious and specific to this piece. The “keystone of garden folly” as sacred relic re-weights a banal object; ice-flowers blooming from clouds literalize the impossible without rule-breaking. Risk—quiet lyric ending—pays off by reconfiguring value, not world. Could survive only with these names, these images. Fresh angle on familiar “art vs. algorithm” debate.</comment>
