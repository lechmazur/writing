<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and character-specific—Lucia’s perception of “music written in marrow” and her bone-level listening feels singular. Contradictory impulses (longing for sound vs. fear of renewed numbness) coil inside every beat. The broken needle as talisman and the choice to keep it polished smooth dramatize a credible, costly renunciation: she accepts deafness yet re-opens feeling. No stock therapy-speak; even the epiphany is delivered as tactile image (needle catching final light) rather than label.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the needle’s polished tip crystallizes her new stance—silence embraced as living music. Causal linkage holds: because the needle scars the reversed groove, therefore vibration bypasses dead ear and rekindles sensation. The cavern, season shift, and phonograph mechanics are anchored by 120 words; no orientation debt. Cost is visible—she leaves with further-worn needle and permanently altered sensorium—felt in the final footstep rhythm.</comment>

<comment>Drum-maker cavern is not postcard scenery: its acoustic properties and residue of “a thousand stretched skins” directly enable the reversed-song experiment. Stone temperature, copper-wire jury-rig, beeswax scent are filtered through Lucia’s professional priorities (vibration, material resonance). Micro-setting (broken needle) constrains every tactical choice; final image recharges it. Spatial choreography clean—no floating props; phonograph placement at center is referenced against floor and walls.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—signaled in first paragraph and tightened when she feels “the thawing” via bone conduction. One meaningful escalation: playback switches from futile to efficacious the instant needle’s fracture creates the “filament of hush.” Cost is legible: needle wears further, acknowledging that future sessions will eventually erase the filament itself. No coincidence; all pressure sourced from her engineered reversal and the cavern’s acoustic affordance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence not as absence but as inverted music. Subtext carried in gesture—pocketing the worn needle instead of discarding it—states the thesis without exposition. Final image of autumn’s “backward recorded song” reweights season change from loss to cadence. No moralizing line; ambiguity remains (future erasure of filament looms), inviting reflection on impermanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lucia’s somatic perception: “vibrations that told her autumn was yielding” marries meteorology to proprioception. Syntax lengthens and relaxes during thaw, then contracts into short, final footstep beats—rhythmic control mirrors temperature. No head-hop; POV modesty maintained—she guesses, she infers, never claims certainty about external sound. Lexicon stays within a music teacher’s idiom (“center groove,” “natural amplification”) without jargon intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative anaphora (“each note arriving before its own birth”) gives way to clipped fragments at wind-down. Sentences perform double duty—e.g., “She felt it then—the thawing” advances story (event) and atmosphere (temperature metaphor). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines act as phonograph-couplets, circling like the stuck needle, creating purposeful circularity without algorithmic repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—deaf music teacher using backward vinyl to feel silence—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Synthesis of acoustic archaeology, bone-conduction physics, and emotional thaw is non-obvious. Risk of lyric abstraction paid off by anchoring every abstract phrase to material action (needle wear, floor vibration). Transformation test: story collapses if Lucia is not a teacher-of-children, cavern not acoustic, needle not broken—specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
