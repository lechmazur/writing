<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s skeptical profession and his decision to rebury the truth are cleanly motivated; the moment he covers the diamond again carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“his worldview tilting”), but a few stock phrases—“flawed diamond,” “broken heart”—flatten specificity. The endurance choice is earned, yet we never feel his body under fallout stress, so embodiment stays partial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each letter reconstructed tightens knowledge and forecloses the expose-everything option. Closure is a deliberate renunciation (Earned Stasis) with explicit cost—“he would tell the story differently.” Orientation anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality seam: the instant intuitive “stillness” is declared, not demonstrated, softening the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Radioactive orchard, Geiger counter, glowing apples—selective sensory triad anchors the impossible place. The ancient tree at center functions as micro-setting that literally conceals the stakes. Spatial choreography stays clean across tent/dig/tree moves. Environment directly shapes the final choice: stillpoint vs. wasteland exit. Lacks 9+ gate because no tool or body state constrains tactics at climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“expose hoax vs. preserve sanctuary”—is signaled in graf 1 and tightens when letters prove officials let millions die. One meaningful turn: reburying the letters and diamond forecloses fame, chooses hidden refuge. Cost is legible (“he would tell the story differently”), but pressure plateaus after letter 17; no new external threat escalates further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme refrains from moralizing: the cursed object becomes a blessing, the real curse human secrecy. Particulars (shredded letters, 47 m field) keep abstraction grounded. Final image of “flawed diamond holding paradise in its broken heart” reweights prior motif without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is Marcus complicit or merciful? Complexity upheld.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marcus’s perceptual filter—“clicked lazily,” “worldview tilting.” No filter-verb stacks; diction remains within a lay skeptic’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for discovery, clipped clauses for storm exit. Dialogue absent, so voice judged on interior alone; a few clichés (“crack in reality”) blunt distinctiveness under peak pressure.</comment>

<comment>Information-dense openers: “Marcus Chen picked his way… branches heavy with fruit that glowed” does three jobs in one line. No synonym loops; sentence cadence varies naturally. One mixed metaphor—“frozen lightning bolt” inside a diamond—skates by without logic break. Final paragraph avoids scaffold; each sentence advances exit motion or stakes. Clean copy throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard + radiation-neutralizing gem remixes familiar SF tropes, but grounding in document-shredding rescue gives fresh documentary impulse. Transformation test passes: story collapses without the stillpoint science. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks. Specific detail (apples heavy with glowing fruit) keeps it from sliding into generic wasteland tale.</comment>
