<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s thirty-year devotion to the dream-archive grants her instant credibility; the stone’s cross-temporal grip on her attention feels like an organic obsession rather than a plot convenience. The closing renunciation—she will “tend them through the waiting darkness”—is earned by every preceding frame of footage she has parsed. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers trailing along walls that hummed”), never drifting into label-speak. The only minor drag is the faint saintly halo that softens her edges—no visible flaw complicates her resolve on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the translucent figure presses its palm to the lens and Mira’s purpose crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost—she must spend her life curating shadows. Causality is sound: the footage comparison → pattern recognition → stone warmth → ancestral dream transfer → vocation. Mosaic structure (three temporal shards plus present) is taught by word 180 and resolves cleanly. One hairline slip: the Orientation Test is technically passed, yet “above the clouds” geography is slightly floaty until the second shard; the payoff at closure waives any penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming library’s bio-glass petals refract sunset into “colors that had no names, only feelings,” a detail that literally colors the final image. Micro-setting inside the archive room (desk, interface, prismatic light) constrains every beat of footage review. Body-as-setting appears when tears “caught the library’s prismatic light,” fusing environment and emotion. Spatial choreography is flawless across sixty years of shifting frames; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope—surfaces in paragraph one and tightens when the shadow begins its 3-frame migration. The deepening is singular but meaningful: Mira realizes the shadow has been “collecting these moments,” which reweights her task from glitch-hunt to guardian. Cost is legible: she accepts lifelong custodianship of intangible shadows, foregoing ordinary retirement. Agency is interior yet decisive; no convenient external fix intrudes.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific lineage of stone + shadow + dream-archive rather than abstract pronouncements. The final image—stone casting “its own small shadow”—performs a Conceptual Repricing that reweights all prior footage as sacred relics. Subtext breathes in silence: grandmother never speaks, yet her design rules the architecture. No reader can extract a bumper-sticker moral; the ambiguity between memory and haunting lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is precise: “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” notices refraction, trembling aurora, softly deliberate motion—details a casual visitor would miss. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“gardens that would float above cities…”) then shortens under recognition (“She gasped.”) without drumbeat monotony. Diction remains within a lifelong archivist’s lexicon; no corporate register intrudes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; paragraph lengths alternate like breath. Metaphors are sparse but exact—“dark aurora,” “glass petals”—never stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening and closing lines are mirror-polished, the latter recharging the stone’s witness motif without cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—shadows as unbound repositories of unshared dreams—is fresh, yet grounded in grandmother’s pre-tech workaround. Risky mosaic time-jumps pay off when the shadow’s path becomes the story’s spine. Transformation test fails if names/places are swapped: only this floating bloom-library could refract the ancestral blueprint. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not engineered for surprise.</comment>
