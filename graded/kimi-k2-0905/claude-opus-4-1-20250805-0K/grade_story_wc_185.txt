<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and sensorially grounded; her “weathered fingers,” selective attention to fracture lines, and the tactile extraction ritual all embody her vocation. Contradictory impulses—urgency to act versus reverence for stillness—coexist in the same beats, giving her credible tension. The final smile and “quieter heart” are quiet but earned, showing acceptance of a new coexistence rather than victory. The only limit is that her flaw (over-attunement to pattern) never visibly backfires or costs her on-page, so the arc is more discovery than reckoning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds cleanly: alien sonic assault → crack readings → ritual extraction → bloom softens the beings. The echo-stone anchors each step without teleporting or convenient lore dumps. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: silence is not imposed but revealed, and the cost is the lifetime of labor that let her read the fracture manuscript—felt when she notes her maps “would need updating.” Orientation is anchored by line 3; lens stays situational throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Harmonic caves are evoked through acoustic properties—luminescent stone, frozen pool that rings under stress—rather than visual catalog. The body-as-tool micro-setting is strong: her palm on stone, finger tracing cracks, knees on cold rock all constrain posture and timing. The bloom of hush itself functions as portable setting that re-weights the cave’s resonance in real time. Spatial choreography stays clean across kneel-lift-stand sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the caves’ acoustic balance—surfaces early and tightens when cracks spread. Single meaningful turn: extraction of silence reframes the invasion from threat to confluence. Cost is legible in her aching joints and the lifetime cartographic labor implied; no higher because the beings’ agency remains off-stage—they modulate but never choose, so the external pressure feels ambient rather than reciprocal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as active force, harmony as inclusion of opposites. The bloom’s expansion mirrors her own acceptance, giving conceptual repricing at close. Subtext lives in gesture—touching cracks instead of speaking—and in the final image of “second, quieter heart.” No moralizing line spoils the effect; the only minor slack is the slightly proverbial “quiet in the storm,” but it’s embedded in action, not tacked on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to her sensorium; no filter verbs dilute immediacy. Diction—“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “fortissimo,” “bloom of hush”—is precise to her profession yet rhythmic. Syntax lengthens during ritual, then shortens to single clauses at climax (“She stood slowly…”) mirroring breath control. No head-hop or register drift; the few Latinate terms fit a woman who reads ice manuscripts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening shape; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay acoustically coherent—sound carved paths, silence flowered—avoiding mixed vehicles. One near-scaffold: “gently luminescence pulse” could lose “gently,” but the adverb modulates the stone’s warmth and is spared. Final line lands cleanly without figurative muddle, sustaining read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses geomancy with acoustics and alien sonics—fresh synthesis rather than stock eco-fantasy. The bloom of hush as crystallized silence is a concrete, non-obvious invention that charges every beat. Risk—quiet ending where aliens learn from her—pays off because conflict was always about resonance, not conquest. Specificity of ripple-mark cartography prevents generic swap-out, making the world feel discovered, not assembled.</comment>
