<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Margot’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the lantern’s weight as “promise,” the resignation micro-choice—but the epiphany (“she understood now why she’d been drawn…”) is delivered as declarative summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, blunting the felt cost of her pivot. Jerome’s memories are channeled competently, yet his own on-page flaw/struggle is filtered through her perception, so his liberation-by-cardiac-arrest reads as poetic fiat, not earned character collapse. Still, her final stance crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible forfeiture (career, reputation), satisfying the Earned Stasis test.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean conceptual repricing: Margot’s resignation plus the lantern’s flicker reconfigure “investigator” into clandestine conductor, with social cost legible in the rain-baptism image. Causal chain holds: lantern memory → Jerome’s death → Margot’s renunciation; no teleporting props or retro-fit. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; the 120-word window is met. Drive lens is accumulative-textural: each memory layer thickens stakes until the final cadence shift reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The subway tunnel, brass lamp, and drumming rain create tactile specificity; the lamp’s evolving patina acts as micro-setting that constrains Margot’s choice to carry it out. Spatial choreography remains coherent—body at grate, crouch, climb. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound under crisis, matching investigator POV. While atmospheric, the setting does not fully charge the final image (rain is backdrop, not tool), capping at 7.9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberation from systemic control—tightens once: lantern reveals modern bondage equals historic slavery, narrowing Margot’s options to complicity or flight. Escalation is accretive: each memory layer deepens cost until resignation becomes inevitable. No off-stage resolution; coincidence only complicates (rain after drought). Visible price: pension, career, identity as investigator—paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete sequence: preventable death investigation morphs into prevention of spiritual death via underground railroad 2.0. No moralizing final paragraph; final image of rain-baptism reweights “investigator” without thesis statement. Subtext operates in lantern’s silence—its flicker answers the unasked question of what comes after resignation. Ambiguity lingers: is she savior or fugitive? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate POV remains stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is investigator-esque—cataloguing rain droplets, lantern brass, memory residue—consistent with professional gaze. Syntax grows leaner under stress: “She would keep the lantern… She emerged…” mirroring decisional clarity. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within investigator’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths contract toward climax. Information density high—single sentences deliver memory, emotion, stakes. One paraphrase loop detected: “memories that weren’t hers flooding… memories cascaded…” −0.2. Metaphors grounded (lantern as promise, rain as baptism) without strain. Clean grammar; no scaffold clutter obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses historic underground railroad with modern gig-era bondage; lantern-as-portal is fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis of preventable-death investigator becoming clandestine liberator flips trope without gimmick. Specificity: 1858 conductor, 1962 grandmother, 2023 subway worker—timeline particulars prevent generic abstraction. Risk taken: magical memory transfer accepted because pattern taught early and closure pays off.</comment>
