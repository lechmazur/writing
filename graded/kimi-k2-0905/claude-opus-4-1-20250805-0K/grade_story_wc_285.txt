<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward therapeutic abstraction (“capable of such faith”) that softens the decisive moment. Contradictory impulses appear in the coachman’s serene refusal to erase, yet the micro-choice to weave the golden thread back into her lungs is dramatized with felt cost. The woman remains an emblem rather than an individual—no interior access, no distinctive speech—so relationship crucible is absent. Endurance lands as Earned Stasis for him, lightening for her, both visible and priced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: fog density and promise sediment escalate through sensory repetition until the final cadence shift when fog lifts and river accepts. Closure is a Charged Poise—options re-weighted, cost felt in the visible release of “what had been released.” Causality is poetic but coherent: needle-work distills, woman breathes lighter, gutters stop. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. One micro-turn: offer to ease → acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog-bound crossing functions as both environment and tool: it feeds on broken vows, supplies the raw material for needle-work, and retreats only after release—charging the final image. Micro-setting (yarn needle) handled in motion, not catalogued. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile mist, metallic ticking, horse breath—filtered through Thomas’s professional attention. Spatial choreography clean: coach, planks, river, hill track logically. Weather shift causally tied to release, not decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake: can the woman leave the crossing unburdened? Pressure intensifies as fog thickens with each broken vow; single tightening beat when Thomas offers to “ease it,” forcing her visible nod—cost is the irrevocable release of betrayal sediment. Agency shared: she climbs aboard, consents; he performs the distillation. No coincidence; resolution earned under accretive lens. Price legible: fog retreats, gutters stop—silence now charged with absence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: promises are sediment until transformed by intentional labor. No thesis statement; insight is dramatized in the act of needle-work and the golden thread returned to breath. Final image—stars “newly visible”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity persists: loss and gain cohabit the same release. Subtext operates in gesture (needle in air) and environmental mirror (fog retreat). Resonance lingers as felt lightness rather than asserted wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers at lyric distance, stable throughout. Perceptual signature: Thomas notices whispered vows, sediment weight, spindrift serenity—idiosyncratic, consistent. Syntax flexes with emotional intensity: longer cadence for layering, clipped “Gloom Hill, then” to restart motion. No head-hopping; woman’s interior implied only through observable tears and nod. Dialogue minimal, natural, goal-driven. Diction stays within coachman’s plausible lexicon; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversified. High information density: “palimpsest of promises” does double descriptive-conceptual work. One mixed metaphor—“sediment… silk curtain”—but does not obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Strong verbs predominate: distills, tangles, foreclose. Final line earns cadence lift with monosyllabic clarity: “stars… newly visible.” Minor over-layering in “ambient awareness” phrase repeated twice; otherwise propulsion clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise fresh: vow-distilling coachman at spectral ferry turns sentimental trope into labor-based magic. Yarn needle as quill-like tool specific to occupation, not gimmick. Transformation test fails mildly—coachman’s serenity edges archetype of wise rustic, woman remains cipher. Risk taken in lyric accretive structure pays off in closure. Familiar fog-and-river Gothic given new rule set (promises = feedstock). Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet not overtly derivative.</comment>
