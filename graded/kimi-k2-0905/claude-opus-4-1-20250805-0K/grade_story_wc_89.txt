<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrical yet concrete; her contradictory terror and hunger to dissolve is shown through trembling hands and steady voice. The micro-choice to uncork the vial crystallizes her hierarchy of values—love over self-continuity—with visible cost. Kess remains a felt absence rather than a full second character, so relationship-as-crucible is lightly handled, but Mira’s un-becoming is credibly earned. Diagnostic label “paradoxically steady” is self-aware but brief enough to avoid full therapy-speak penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s human edges blur forever, charged by the moth-fortune image that reweights the opening cue. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—scent triggers perceptual expansion, each beast-imprint layers into the final chorus. Persistent constraint is legible: she can never again feel only one skin. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation is taught early (everbloom rules, phoenix sky) and pays off in the closing cosmic intimacy.</comment>

<comment>Everbloom orchard functions as micro-setting: perpetual blossoms become scales/feathers during the conjure, directly constraining the transformation. The vial’s spices and the moonlit petals are handled, not catalogued, anchoring sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography stays clean—fox nuzzle, wind-blown fortune—without floating bodies. Setting charges the final image when moonlight warms from fairy-tale freeze to living promise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—touch Kess’s consciousness again—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the scent dissolves Mira’s last retreat. One meaningful deepening: every beast-imprint she ever hosted turns from memory into doorway, foreclosing human-only existence. Cost is visible—skin prickling, edges blurring, fortune blanking—paid on the page. Agency is interior but active: she uncorks, surrenders, and bridges worlds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: love as frequency shift, not possession. Subtext operates through gesture—fox nuzzle, moth release—rather than assertion. The closing line reweights “cosmic intimacy” without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether bridging is gift or exile. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance arises from sensory particulars, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual dissolve; no head-hopping. Distinct lyric texture—petals becoming feathers, colors without names—mirrors her beast-whisperer bias. Rhythm accelerates into fragments during transformation, then settles into quieter cadence for reunion. Dialogue minimal but natural: Silverwhisper’s question carries subtext of guardianship, answered with paradoxical steadiness that reveals Mira’s self-awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—scales, feathers, light—teaching the metamorphosis rule. Information density high: vial contents, spice mechanics, and cosmic weave packed without scaffold. One near-loop: “permanent moon” repeated, but second use warms the image, serving reconfiguration rather than redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of phoenix lore, eternal orchard, and spice-based transmutation feels fresh yet inevitable. Beast-whisperer un-becoming inverts typical shapeshifter fantasy—power yields to dissolution. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off in moth-fortune reprise. Specificity anchors cosmos: stardust cinnamon, void-pepper prevent generic “magic spice” trope.</comment>
