<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s occupation-driven perception (the “different frequency” test) is vivid, but her interior contradiction is told rather than dramatized in real time; the endurance choice is visible yet the cost is more conceptual than felt. Still, her professional lens shapes every beat and the final renunciation is consistent with her quiet obsessiveness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stamp’s glowing marks crystallize her lifelong vocation against the re-electrified world above. Causal chain holds—blackout enables listening, listening exposes forgery pattern, time runs out—leaving a persistent constraint (she will keep diving) that reweights the premise. Minor drag: the “corporate profit” reveal is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Algae-lit water, vacuum-sealed volumes, and the brass stamp are tactile, POV-filtered, and directly constrain her method; the library’s pressure-deck architecture alters her tactics when the generators restart. Final image of pulsing algae recharging the inked truth is micro-setting perfection. One micro-slip: “municipal records 2089-2091” is a naked label—no sensory hook.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single stake—preserve authentic memory—tightens when the blackout clock and electromagnetic restart threaten erasure. Agency is continuous: each stamp strike is an irreversible act that forecloses the option to re-mark later. Cost is visible (time running out, ink limited, systems rebooting) even if the corporate culpability stays off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as a quiet, iterative resistance against erasure; the algae-ink symbiosis embodies reclaimed stillness without sermon. Final image refuses moralizing—the city’s pulse simply continues—leaving the reader to feel the repricing of silence over data. No forced motif recursion; the stamp reappears because it must, not because theme demands it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: every noun choice is filtered through a librarian’s lexicon (“vacuum-sealed,” “spine resonance,” “call-number hush”). Rhythm modulates with task urgency—longer sentences during cataloguing, clipped fragments when generators threaten. No head-hopping; compression (“she had minutes”) is taught early and paid off. Voice stays in plausible diction except one academic blip—“conceptual repricing” notion intrudes, but it’s internal, not narrated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (action + world-rule). Metaphors are spare and precise: algae glow as “dappled resolve” is the only figurative reach, earned by closure. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves by image. One near-filter stack (“she began to recognize”) is negligible under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The drowned-library+analog-verification premise is fresh; corporate-histoforge angle avoids pirate cliché. Risk choice: silence as active tool, not rebellion spectacle. Specificity of algae-wavelength ink and frequency-tuned touch elevates concept beyond steampunk veneer. Could edge higher if the corporate layer were dramatized rather than reported.</comment>
