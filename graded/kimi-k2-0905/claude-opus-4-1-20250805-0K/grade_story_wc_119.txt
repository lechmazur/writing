<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Chen’s contradictory impulses—architect of futures vs. subject of his own prophecy—surface late but are embodied in the microdot gesture and final self-fortune. Interiority is specific (“composer becomes his own music”), not label-speak, and the renunciation costs him presence on the island. Micro-choices (arranging slips, stepping into lighthouse) align with motive, though earlier beats lean on atmospheric observation. Earned stasis achieved, but cost could be sharper on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Chen’s disappearance reconfigures the island’s open-secret symphony under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern taught early—fortunes as musical notation—pays off when he writes himself out of the score. Causality holds: each slip he leaves dictates tomorrow’s fallout, so his vanishing is the final note. Cost is conceptual but legible in the blank slips and abandoned specs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Skeleton Rock is rendered through salt-stained windows, lighthouse rhythm, and cookie dead-drops; every detail is filtered by Chen’s professional eye for hidden messages. The lighthouse beam functions as both tool and metronome, constraining his writing tempo and final exit. Spatial choreography is clean: corner table to open door, no drift. Micro-setting (microdot specs) charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Chen will keep scripting others or step into his own prophecy—tightens when he pens “The composer becomes his own music.” Agency drives escalation: each fortune he plants narrows future options for the entire island. No coincidence resolves; instead, his deliberate self-fortune forecloses continued anonymity. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the blank slips left behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: authorship of fate vs. self-fate, secrecy as communal performance. Subtext lives in the lighthouse Morse and empty cookie slips—no moralizing required. Final image of blank musical notation reweights earlier “sheet music” motif without literal statement. Ambiguity lingers: did Chen escape or dissolve into his own composition?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Chen’s perceptual lens—cryptic, musical, synesthetic. Rhythm modulates with lighthouse flashes; diction (“orchestrated something different”) mirrors his composer mindset. No head-hopping; bartender and Bulgarian appear only as observed surfaces. Voice remains distinct under pressure, culminating in the lyrical final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long melodic coils to fragmentary beats, mirroring lighthouse pulses. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors—and tied to music/espionage lexicon. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Microdot, beam, and fortune slips reappear with evolving states, satisfying presence test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing fortune-cookie trope with espionage musical score feels inevitable yet fresh; no prior story combines these exact mechanics. Transformation is deep: the cookie ceases to be kitsch and becomes fate’s source code. Risky quiet exit—no shootout—paid off by conceptual reconfiguration. Specificity of CIA-issue microdot specs anchors plausibility.</comment>
