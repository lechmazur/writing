<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—hoarding legends to avoid her father’s complicity—drives every beat: the tactile search of the false wall, the engine-cut drift, the decision to dock and confront. Emotions stay embodied (“mirror-black water,” “weathered hands”) without diagnostic speak. The renunciation of globe-trotting is earned by the prior cascade of mirrored confessions and carries visible cost: she pockets the sundial for a museum, not for herself. No secondary character on deck, so status dynamics N/A; headcount stays clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the barge touches stone while Mara’s future path crystallizes—cost is the loss of her escapist vocation, legible in the final image of the sundial relinquished. Causal lens holds throughout: each “because” (finding the confession) tightens the “therefore” (go home). Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“Amsterdam’s twilight canal”), well under the 120-word ceiling. No lens ambiguity; the final silence of radio absence reweights time itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The canal’s mirror-black surface and Magere Brug lights physically constrain the barge’s drift and mirror Mara’s self-confrontation; the sundial’s brass face acts as micro-setting that charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: dying light > tactile brass > silent phone = no morning radio. Detail is economical; no tourist-catalogue clutter. The twilight scale evolves with the engine cut, forcing the silent decision beat. Weather and water are causally active, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“salvage truth from lies”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the confession letter redefines her life’s work. One meaningful deepening suffices: the moment she sees her father in van der Meer’s guilt. Cost is visceral: abandoning the chase that defined her. No antagonist needed; internal pressure coheres under causal lens. Luck merely reveals; it does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: the architecture of lies is built by its architects, not outsiders. The sundial’s shadowless face at twilight reweights “certainty” without a sermon. Final image—dock touch, museum fate—reconfigures meaning rather than stating it. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether her father will confess too.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mara’s perceptual filter: “her trained instincts,” “her fingers read surfaces like braille.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fragments as the engine cuts: “She pocketed the sundial and stood.” No dialogue, so voice contamination impossible. Diction remains within her archeological lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer sentences during drift, staccato final line. No loops or synonym churn; “mirror-black” and “serene upheaval” appear once and pay off. High density—“years of archaeological work had taught her fingers to read surfaces like braille” compresses backstory and method. Closure image is uncluttered, propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The legend-seeker who realizes she was fleeing her own home lie is fresh; the sundial-as-mirror is not a stock trope. Risk lies in quiet ending, but coherence justifies it. Transformation test fails if relocated: Amsterdam canal + Dutch merchant specifics are irreplaceable. No derivative premise penalty; East India confession angle is underused in micro-fiction.</comment>
