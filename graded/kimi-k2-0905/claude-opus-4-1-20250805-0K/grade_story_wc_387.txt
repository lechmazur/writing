<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The net-mender’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers, the pulse in her palms, the hum in the bamboo—but she never makes a micro-choice that risks anything; all action is observation or ritual repetition. The “demure audacity” is asserted, never dramatized: she never tests the villagers’ scorn, never hesitates at a knot that could lose a fisherman’s catch, never confronts the whispering stones. Because no live option is foreclosed, the Earned Stasis feels conceptual rather than paid. The solitude is atmospheric, not crucible; we admire her, but we do not feel her lose or gain a thing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held: pattern-seeking is the plot. Each paragraph adds density—firefly paths, whisk fracture, stone memory—until the final image reweights the whole. Closure is a Charged Poise: she leaves “only the faintest impression,” a conceptual cost that makes her labor both ephemeral and eternal. The orientation is anchored by word 60, so no penalty; the only drag is the middle paragraph of abstract thesis (“philosophy made tangible”) that pauses accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The parapet, rain-scent, jasmine vines, and moonlit whisk are tactile, selective, and biased to her mender-eye. The micro-setting (net in lap, bamboo tines against sky) functions as portable crucible: the whisk literally refracts the moon into “a hundred crescents,” an environmental constraint that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—firefly landing on wrist, dew underfoot. Only the village below stays postcard-distant, but that is POV-true.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove that invisible, unpaid labor holds the world—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accretion rather than external opposition. No live option narrows; she does not debate leaving, nor does any villager appear to scorn her. The tightening is purely cadential: the net completes, the whistle fades. Cost is conceptual (her anonymity), not tactical, so escalation plateaus at the threshold of the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges from iterated particulars: knot geometry = firefly flight = moon crescents = vigilance. The final image—net gleaming silver, unnamed fisherman casting tomorrow—reprises the pattern without moralizing. The insight is earned, not told: beauty exists “simply because glowing is what fireflies do.” The refusal to name her crystallizes the thesis that anonymity is the price of continuity. No motif is decorative; each recurrence construes labor as constellation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: long vowel cadences mimic tide, while hyphenated coinages (“rain-scent,” “moon paths”) feel artisanal. Perceptual signature is exact—she hears stone whispers, sees “captured stars” in bamboo tines. No head-hop, no filter verbs; psychic distance stays mid-close. The one elevated phrase—“multiplication as the essence of hidden effort”—is justified by her philosopher bent and is paid off in the fracture image.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with task: short sentences for knot-pulses, longer ones for tide-meditation. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds texture or knowledge. Metaphors stay within physical logic (firefly light “like joy remembered through sorrow”) and do not crowd the final beats. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested; the last line gives a hush consonant echo (“collection”/“impression”) that feels premeditated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>The synthesis of net-mending + celestial navigation + philosophy of labor is fresh, yet the “lonely watcher in abandoned tower” frame is familiar mythic shorthand. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure itself; it pays off, but the concept is not non-obvious. The bamboo-whisk-as-lens is the single striking inflection that prevents swapability. Overall, a luminous execution of a quiet premise rather than a radical reinvention.</question>
