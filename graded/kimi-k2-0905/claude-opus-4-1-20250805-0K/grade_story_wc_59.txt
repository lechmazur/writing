<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aldric’s gaunt frame, fevered eyes, and obsessive micro-adjustments embody a man frayed by solitude and desperation; the broken bird he coaxes into life externalises his own warped survival. His “trembling hands” and cracked voice give visceral interiority, and the renunciation implied in accepting Novo’s asymmetry lands as credible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatised in scene, and the micro-choices remain functional rather than hierarchy-revealing under life-or-death pressure; still, the arc of flawed creator / flawed creation feels individual and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—patterns of dangling, swaying, ticking, dripping—then crystallises that cadence in the final image of prince and bird sharing a broken song. Orientation is anchored by word 52, well under the 120-word threshold, and no set-up is forgotten. The hatching sequence supplies the required Decisive Change with felt cost: Aldric’s “bitter sweetness” is shown in body and image, not declared. A slight lens wobble mid-text (brief causal talk of “genetic memory”) is absorbed back into lyric pattern by closure.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The suspended palace, egg-shaped incubator of copper coils, and swaying stalactites form a micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move: Aldric must steady his hands against trembling glass, harvest condensate, and accept asymmetry because the cavern drafts warp the hatch. Selective sensory triage—metallic groan, tick-tick-tick, condensation taste—keeps the world intimate and urgent. Spatial choreography remains coherent; the city below is sketched only through its invasive sound, satisfying economy. Weather (wind gusts) affects each adjustment of the apparatus, charging stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can organic beauty be rekindled inside a mechanised void?—is signalled in paragraph two and tightens through each incremental calibration that could crack the egg. Escalation is textural: every drip of nutrient, every degree of warmth increases density until the asymmetrical hatch reweights the stake; failure and success are simultaneous, forcing earned acceptance. Aldric’s agency drives every beat; no wind or gear solves his problem. The price is legible—his songbird will never match the lost Aurelius, and the mechanical city will never fully stop—but the tightening could be sharper if one adjustment visibly foreclosed a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the recurring image of asymmetry—warped wings, broken song—arguing that imperfect genesis still counts as creation. No character lectures us; the insight is earned when Aldric names the bird “Novo” and sings alongside its fractured note. The final image of clockwork citizens hesitating in their routines conceptually reprices the premise: beauty can reboot even in circuitry. Ambiguity is preserved: we feel the cost (a species remains extinct) yet share the wonder, satisfying the call for complexity without tidy moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lyrical third-person tight to Aldric sustains a controlled psychic distance: we get inference (“hypothesizing about the nature of creation”) rather than textbook certainty. Syntax grows choppier under fatigue (“He placed the egg… His fingers danced… Days blurred”) mirroring his fevered focus, then relaxes into longer cadence for the acceptance beat. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacking; diction stays within a prince’s archaic lexicon (“metallic lament”, “avian requiem”) without purple drift. The bird’s gaze is reported as Aldric’s perception, preserving modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: varied sentence openings, strategic fragments (“Days blurred into nights…”), and no template cadence. Metaphors—palace as “forgotten ornament”, bird song as “music box missing half its pins”—are fresh, consistent with physical logic, and never stacked across high-pressure beats. Occasional elevated phrases (“bitter sweetness of the moment”) flirt with register drift but are earned by context. Information density remains high; each sentence adds sensory or tactical data. No loops, no scaffold, clean grammar and tense throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combining extinct songbird resurrection with a clockwork anti-world feels fresh, but the deeper originality lies in valuing asymmetry rather than perfect revival—an insight seeded early and paid off at closure. Details (copper-coil incubator of tears and condensate, gear citizens pausing to a broken trill) are particular to this tale; swap any component and the emotional calculus collapses. The swaying palace-as-lab converts the familiar “last man and egg” trope into vertiginous theatre. Risk in lyric fabulation is bold yet coherent, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
