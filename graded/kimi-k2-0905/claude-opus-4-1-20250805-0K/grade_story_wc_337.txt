<comment>Mira’s vocation-driven motive is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why this night is different, what personal risk she incurs—is only asserted (“whispers only she could hear”). The restored masks function as external proof of her skill, yet the story never tests her limits or forces a micro-choice that might cost her something she values; she simply completes the task. Because the restless spirits supply no counter-pressure, her characterization flattens into competence rather than crucible. The ending renunciation (“tomorrow would bring another net”) is narrated, not dramatized, so the cost feels occupational, not personal.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unraveled knot literally thickens the density of fragments on the bench until starlight fuses them into a legible closure—an Earned Stasis where the spirits settle and Mira’s inherited cycle renews. Orientation is swift (sanctuary, night, needle, net) and the prism device pays off in the final image. However, the causal driver is the net itself, not Mira’s escalating tactics; she follows its program rather than forging a path that forecloses an alternative, so the decisive change feels externally administered. The cost is present—dawn finds her alone again—but it is observed rather than felt through a prior, risk-laden choice.</comment>

<comment>Crystal walls that fracture moonlight into “ribbons of color” and starlight that funnels into “beams” are not ornamental: they provide the literal loom by which mask fragments cohere, so the setting charges the closure. The bronze needle’s worn smoothness and the hemp’s thunder-surrender are tactically specific, anchoring body and tool. Spatial choreography stays clean as fragments migrate from net to bench to circle. The harbor’s drowned history is economically evoked through sensory shorthand (“black with age and salt”), keeping exposition off-stage.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—restoring identity to the drowned—gains emotional weight but never tightens Mira’s options; each knot releases a fragment without complicating her method or raising the price of failure. The only escalation is accumulation itself: more masks, more ghosts, until the quota is met. Because the spirits pose no resistance and Mira risks no personal loss, pressure plateaus rather than peaks. The final “lucid unrest” is atmosphere, not stakes-driven tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: brokenness is not erased but rewoven into memorial, and inheritance is cyclical service. The prism sanctuary’s refracted light becomes a metaphor for narrative itself—fragments reassembled into meaning—yet the piece avoids stating this aloud. Subtext operates in gesture (needle laid like compass) and silence (gratitude “between heartbeats”). The refusal to end on triumph or tragedy lets the theme breathe, though the absence of any counter-argument keeps complexity slightly one-note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person voice carries a perceptual signature attuned to texture and ruin—“scarred fingers,” “sleeping serpent,” “jellyfish made of starlight”—without drifting into purple overload. Syntax tightens under labor: short, paratactic clauses mimic stitch-work, then elongates into luminous cadence at the reveal. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is absent, a valid choice that keeps the hush literal; the voice sustains the story’s incantation alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Each knot held a drowned sailor’s last breath” compresses myth and material into one line. Metaphors stay internally consistent—net as serpent, masks as anchors, starlight as loom—so imagery coheres rather than contradicts. Occasional elevated diction (“exhumed,” “unmoored”) momentarily lifts above the POV’s likely lexicon, but the rhythm earns it. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase drag; every sentence adds fragment, light, or silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of maritime ghost-rite with textile restoration feels fresh, and the inversion—net that once trapped now stitches—offers a non-obvious reweighting. Specificity of the 1674 storm and porcelain scale-pattern keeps the concept from sliding into generic ancestor worship. The risk of lyric accumulative structure pays off: closure is legible and earned. Slight deduction because the eternal-return frame treads familiar restorative-fantasy territory, muting surprise.</comment>
