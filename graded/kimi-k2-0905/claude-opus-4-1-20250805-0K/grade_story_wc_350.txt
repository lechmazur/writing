<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Marta’s “empathetically decisive” trait is shown, not told, when she rigs the pendulum and sings the elevators awake; her interiority stays concrete (“chest cavity vibrate”). The flaw-level slip is that her internal contradiction (risk of failure) is only skimmed—no moment where she nearly stops or doubts—so the cost feels lightweight. Still, her micro-choices drive every beat and the final stance is earned.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s acoustic bridges are materially built and the cost is the all-night labor plus the permanent alteration of the silos’ social role. Causal chain holds: weight → resonance → multilingual chords → farmers gather → cooperative future. Orientation is clean by word 80; lens is Causal throughout. No teleporting props or soft resets.</comment>

<comment>The brass weight, spiral stairs, and resonating steel skins are tactile and specific; the astronomical clock’s acoustics constrain how Marta can broadcast pitch, directly shaping tactics. Sensory hierarchy is biased to sound and vibration—perfect for a choral librarian. Prairie night and grain-elevator geography stay coherent; no spatial contradictions. Environment charges the final image when the real stars fade as the silos take over the sky’s role.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save the town from agricultural death—is signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: the first low hum that makes her chest vibrate forecloses secrecy; from then on the music is public and irreversible. Cost is visible exhaustion at dawn and the irreversible sonic occupation of private silos. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her escalating vocal risk.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language as living infrastructure, isolation versus polyglot harmony. Subtext lives in the silos’ “stored memories of abundance”—a lovely compression of agricultural trauma. Final image of the swinging weight re-prices the premise: timekeeping now belongs to the community, not the clock. avoids moralizing; the card she’ll post tomorrow is only hinted, letting the reader feel the ongoing work.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tight to Marta’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Distinct choral diction—“counterpoint,” “time signatures in the air”—matches her profession. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ascent, staccato for the first responses. No filter-verb clutter; metaphors stay physical (elevator as vocal cord). Dialogue is absent by design and the prose carries subtext successfully.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, mirroring content; sentence openings vary. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each clause adds new acoustic or emotional data. Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Opening and closing lines echo each other (“sentinel” vs “never be silent again”) without feeling framed. Minor tick: “borrowed starlight” is used twice; still, it reweights at closure so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The talking-grain-elevator conceit is fresh, yet grounded in real acoustics and prairie decay. Multilingual harmonics invert the usual “tower of Babel” trope into cooperative synthesis. Risk is high—magic realism in <800 words—but causality and emotional truth hold. Specific detail (Black Forest weight, Venus-Mercury dial) prevents abstraction; the concept could not transplant to another landscape unchanged.</comment>
