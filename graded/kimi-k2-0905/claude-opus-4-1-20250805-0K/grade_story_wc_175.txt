<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—“blushing stillness,” fingers on moth dust—and her micro-choices (knotting stems, releasing the wing) externalize the ethno-poetic mission. The story risks thematic ventriloquism by letting the butterfly “read” rather than forcing her to test her faith onstage, but her final, wordless descent shows earned renunciation. A hairline slip: “systems erased from every record” edges toward editorial aside rather than embodied belief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each knotted stem adds material density until the spiral dissolves, enacting impermanence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the monarch lifts the encoded dust, crystallizing the trade-off—knowledge is saved only by vanishing. The cost is visible in the dissolving fibers and Mira’s night descent. Orientation is anchored within 120 words via grotto coordinates and the single monarch context.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but instrument: aerial moss curtains dictate moisture life-span, crevices weep inventory for her towers, and cloud draft literally carries the message away. Micro-setting objects—luna dust, dew beads, vine tensile limits—constrain knot spacing and dissolution clock. Final image reweights the grotto as archive that erases itself. No sensory checklist; every detail answers “how long before it rots?”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: transmit erased history before species and memory vanish. Escalation is textural: each knot tightens meaning-to-material ratio while accelerating decay; tightening = shortening lifespan. No reversal, but the deepening is irreversible—once the monarch departs, the archive is airborne and the grotto begins erasing evidence. Cost is legible: her structures are “already dissolving” as she walks downhill, options shrinking in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from pattern: impermanence as the only durable historiography. Subtext sits in gesture—she places the 70-year-old wing atop fresh grass, letting obsolete and nascent ephemera overlap. Closure’s Conceptual Repricing reweights extinction: annihilation is reframed as pollen dispersal, not loss. No moralizing; final sentence leaves reader inside the interrupted cadence, resonance vibrating without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains hush-lexicon—“powdery scales,” “blushing stillness”—and syntactic breath-length mirrors Mira’s careful movements. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Perceptual signature filters geology through botanist patience: stones are “crevices that wept.” Occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral,” “ethereal”) fits esoteric realist vocation without rupture. Final sentence’s unresolved cadence teaches the reader the intended ellipsis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean: “She worked in blushing stillness” carries triple duty—atmosphere, bodily state, temporal suspension. Varied sentence cadence with strategic fragments: “The monarch would understand.” Metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent—moth dust as braille—never mixed. One micro-loop flagged: “tight knot, loose knot, absence” refrain repeats without new pressure at paragraph 3; trims 0.3. Otherwise high density, zero scaffolding, no filter-verb clot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise fuses cli-fi extinction with erased cloud culture, neither trope over-mined. Transmission via moth-wing braille is fresh micro-mechanics. Interrupted cadence as both musical and architectural form offers non-obvious linkage between art and ephemera. Risk—lyric over ethereal—paid off by grounding every abstraction in tactile craft (knot, dew, fibre snap).</comment>
