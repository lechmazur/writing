<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“knowledge lived in her bones,” “cracked her open like an egg”), and her final micro-choice—setting the sundial on the ledge—earns a credible endurance with cost. The contradiction between isolation and coexistence is dramatized, not labeled. The sole drag is the off-stage global cohort: their absence keeps relationships from becoming a crucible, so the “tribe” remains thematic backdrop rather than secondary pressure. Still, her stance crystallizes with visible forfeiture of nostalgic return.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Kira’s renunciation of nostalgic recreation is charged by the sundial’s first shadow—undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words and hold. Causality is lyric-pattern rather than strict because/therefore, but the tightening cadence from hum-to-heartbeat reweights the stake legitimately. One minor loop—“brittle” is echoed four times without fresh inflection—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Tidal Library is no postcard: its breathing walls and glass floor actively pressure Kira’s posture and attention; the brass sundial functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice. “Atomically reflective” is reused precisely to enable the closing shadow-image, charging the ending. Cloud choreography remains coherent across the single scene; no physics drift. Sensory economy favors haptic and aural detail over visual excess, matching the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens through the hum’s rising cadence; the final shadow reweights the cost from abstract to visible. Agency is interior renunciation rather than external confrontation, consistent with Accumulative lens. No swappable antagonist is required; the absence of mammoths is the irreversible constraint. The tightening is singular but meaningful; a second reversal would over-plot this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the shift in the sundial’s function: from mirror of endless past to clock of possible future—no moralizing required. The final image answers the central question (“why return?”) by re-pricing coexistence as forward-looking, not nostalgic. Subtext operates in the silence left by extinct species; the reader feels the lacuna without exposition. One soft spot: “contemporary survivors of extinction” flirts with thesis-statement, but the phrase is buried mid-story and quickly re-embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: long vowel cadences mirror tidal breathing; syntax compresses under the hum’s rise. Free indirect style stays clean (“She thought of the mammoths…”) without filter-verb bloat. Marcus’s dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (tea as peace-offering). No head-hopping; single POV holds. The repeated “brittle” is the lone tic that slightly dulls peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple: sentence length undulates like the library itself. Information density is high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and world data. No scaffold loops; “atomically reflective” is reused with purpose, not churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (sundial reflecting time, not light). Opening and closing lines are crisp bookends that re-charge the motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The extinct-species support-group premise is familiar from SFF, yet the lyric accumulative structure and tidal-library micro-setting feel fresh. The brass sundial’s inversion—from nostalgia machine to independence clock—is a non-obvious reconfiguration. Specificity (“bone needles while glaciers scraped the world clean”) anchors the conceit in bodily memory. Risk taken with quiet, interior closure pays off: the shadow’s first appearance is a subtle but unforgettable image.</comment>
