<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—engineer’s pragmatism vs. inherited matriarchal tenderness—remains concrete through tactile micro-choices (palm on stone, chain coiled, carving plans while refusing credit). The “tremble” beats crystallize her recognition that kindness must hide inside strategy; embodied cost (leaving her authorship behind) is visible. Grandmother’s dictum is the only near-slip toward label-speak, but it is dramatized within one sentence of chain-handling, forestalling deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative–lyric lens holds: each return of the breathing amphitheater reweights the stakes toward communal interdependence. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara exits, authorship erased, while carved plans persist; the cost is felt as the water will remember what people forgot. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the two-operator floodgates institutionalize collaboration, locking the town into shared maintenance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Volcanic basin, thermal-breathing stone, and brass chain form a micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical carve and measurement. Sensory hierarchy favours heat, texture, mineral scent—filtered through Mara’s surveyor gaze. Final image—star-drunk night over breathing crater—recharges earlier “stone lungs” motif, tightening the accrual. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly as she stretches the chain across the stage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can reconciliation outlive its anonymous architect?—is signaled early. Single meaningful tightening occurs when Mara decides to conceal authorship, narrowing her future to invisible service; price is her erased legacy. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence. Cost is legible in the final image as she kisses and pockets the chain, accepting anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges via water-flow imagery and hidden carvings, never sermonized. Subtext operates in silence: leaving the note with mixed resin performs the thesis without stating it. Final image reweights “stone lungs” from geological curiosity to communal heartbeat—Conceptual Repricing. No thematic echo; wisdom stays particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person intimate adopts Mara’s surveyor diction—precise verbs (“coiled,” “mapped,” “embedded”) yet heated imagery (“star-drunk,” “dappled resolve”). Rhythm breathes with amphitheater pauses; sentence length modulates to mimic water pulse. Filter verbs are voice-motivated, not intrusive. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often carries metaphor, causal cue, and emotional tilt (“carved her calculations into its stones, knowing both factions would find them separately”). Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent within geothermal logic; no mixed vehicles. Final line cadence mirrors opening inhale–exhale, satisfying pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusion of hydrological engineering with maternal cryptology feels fresh; trope of mediator transformed through anonymous inscription. Risk—quiet ending without triumphant reveal—heightens cost and is earned. Specific detail (tree-resin adhesive analysis) grounds novelty. Slight 0.1 dock because “ancient breathing amphitheater” edges familiar lyric archetype, though thermal expansion mechanic refreshes it.</comment>
