<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is textured—her refusal of rescue, the warmth of the telescope in her palms, the way she names clouds by feeling—all concrete and particular. Yet the “quietly explosive storm” never forces her to a new micro-choice; she merely observes and records, so the arc is static. The inherited obsession is shown, but no contradictory impulse collides with it on the page, so the final notation feels like continuation, not costly renunciation. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the score into the low-7 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the storm “gives its memories back,” reweighting Marcus’s thesis and Elena’s vocation. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through atmospheric memory—and the final image crystallizes that density with felt cost: she is still untethered, drifting, having forfeited solid ground. Orientation is swift; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words. One minor causality gap: the snapped cable is reported as yesterday’s event yet the gondola is already “tethered to nothing” at dawn without showing the moment of severance or its immediate consequence; because this does not touch the closure beat, the penalty stays light.</comment>

<comment>The sky gondola functions as micro-setting: its sway, cramped deck, and severed cable directly constrain Elena’s mobility and force her continued drift. Brass telescope’s changing temperature cues significance; cloud architecture supplies both sensory wonder and tactical data. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible shifts—and weather affects every beat. The telescope charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting, though the broader world (Federation, Academy) stays off-page, capping just below the top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove empty spaces remember—signals early and tightens through denser atmospheric memory, but Elena’s agency remains observational; she never risks safety or reputation to extract a new datum. The “quietly explosive storm” complicates atmosphere but does not narrow her options or exact an on-page price. Escalation is textural, not tactical; pressure accumulates yet never forces a trade-off. Sufficient for mid-6 band, but lacks visible cost that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—weather as planetary memory—emerges through concrete taxonomy of clouds by emotion and the final image of memories returning as rain, avoiding abstract assertion. Subtext operates in gesture: telescope warmth, refusal of helicopters, sketching phantom mountains. No moralizing sentence distills the insight; resonance arises from accumulated particulars. The reweighting of Marcus’s legacy into active reciprocity gives the ending conceptual cost, earning high-8 territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly aligned to Elena’s perceptual filter: “clouds drift past like thoughts made visible,” “spooled wholeness of it.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under discovery; no filter-verb clusters. Diction remains within her scientific-poetic lexicon; no corporate register drift. Voice is distinct, consistent, and modulates with emotional intensity, meriting high-8 band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering—“quietly explosive,” “ghosts of dried lakes”—is selective, never more than one per beat, and pays off in closure image. One mixed metaphor: “spooled wholeness…wrapped like thread on a bobbin” is redundant but does not obscure causality. High information density; each line advances observation or stakes. Minor scaffold in “through the lens, she could see” repeated twice; not enough to breach clarity, so holds mid-8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—atmospheric memory preserved in cloud architecture—feels fresh yet grounded in Elena’s professional gaze. Indigenous acknowledgement avoids appropriation by staying in thematic echo rather than borrowed voice. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in closure reconfiguration. No close echoes of famous scenes; transformation test fails if names change, since meteorologist’s taxonomy is integral. Slight risk bonus (+0.3) within band, placing upper-8.</comment>
