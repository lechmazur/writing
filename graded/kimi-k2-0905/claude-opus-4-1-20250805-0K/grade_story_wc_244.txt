<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sadie’s interior contradiction—glib humor vs. bone-deep loneliness—surfaces in every tactic; the moon-rock trade and phone hand-off crystallize her hierarchy of values. Marcus’s stunned passivity and instant enlistment feel credible because his desperation is shown via the vial’s illegal provenance. No stock “orphan savior” therapy-speak; her mask slips only once, and the cost is the eternal exit into rumor. The only cap: we never see her genuinely wrong-footed, so the flaw feels curated, not lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the station becomes a new node in a reciprocity economy, Marcus’s “catalyzed” stance charged with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage is tight—moon rock → rumor bait → phone activation → future network—each step shrinks Sadie’s presence to myth while enlarging Marcus’s agency. Orientation is anchored by line 10; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (monthly call) shapes tactics beyond the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-choked platform isn’t backdrop; its green cathedral acoustics amplify the illicit whispered trade and echo Sadie’s “between architecture and forest” liminality. The thermos, vial, and satellite phone function as micro-settings that constrain exchange protocols. Final image—Marcus alone on the breathing platform—recharges the station as living conduit, not relic. Specificity is irreplaceable: lunar mineral scent, illegal retirement gift, union raccoons.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Marcus’s need to matter vs. Sadie’s need to disappear—tightens when the vial is handed over, foreclosing retreat. The single meaningful intensification is the phone offer: once accepted, Marcus is locked into monthly endangerment with no off-ramp shown. Cost is legible: illegality, perpetual duty, self-exposure. Reciprocity principle complicates rather than resolves, forcing stance crystallization under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “loneliness cured by distributed, risky purpose” without any stated moral. Subtext works through gesture: the bow that is “both mocking and sincere” fuses cynicism and longing. The closing axiom—“purpose tangled up with other people’s purposes”—is earned by the preceding illegal gift, not asserted. Ambiguity lingers: Sadie’s own loneliness is untreated, proving the thesis incomplete, hence honest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays consistently at Sadie’s shoulder; perceptual signature—“desperately jocular edge she’d perfected in Mozambique”—is sharp, rhythmic, and idiosyncratic. Compression (“Everything worthwhile is technically illegal”) teaches cadence early and pays off in final grin. No head-hopping; Marcus’s interior is inferred only through external cues, preserving distance. Diction (“metallic otherness,” “Conceptual Repricing”) stays within Sadie’s savvy lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances rumor economy, characterization, or atmospheric charge. Varied sentence rhythm mirrors emotional modulation—long compound for lore, staccato for trade. Figurative language is sparse but precise: “grin sharp enough to cut glass” concentrates the entire power tilt. No register drift; technical phrases (“lunar minerals can neutralize certain toxins”) are filtered through character credibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: moon rock as social catalyst, disaster-relief ghost as anarchic matchmaker, abandoned station as green bourse for loneliness futures. Reciprocity economy is a genuinely new angle on humanitarian fiction. Risk—illegal sample, open-ended monthly peril—pays off conceptually rather than sentimentally. Transformation test fails if names changed: the ivy-rumour-moon mineral triad is irreducibly specific.</comment>
