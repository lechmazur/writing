<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s serenity is palpable in the opening beats—his fingers tracing the stick, the methodical ink-grinding—but the text keeps *telling* us he is “uncommonly serene” instead of letting the contradiction between that calm and the others’ rage tighten his interior. The final smile and brush-touch land as a credible renunciation, yet we never feel the cost of that calm cracking; the “revolutionary’s heart” stays abstract. Still, the micro-choice to stage tomorrow’s show *backwards* is character-specific and irreversible, earning the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to reverse the puppet show crystallizes Marcus’s stance and reweights the argument’s echo into future action. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each reflective block is anchored to the campfire stick or meteor hush and returns in the final image. The 120-word orientation anchor is met; radar dome, firelight, and absent collaborators are legible. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dome’s acoustic skull and broken panels are not backdrop; they bend whispers into cathedral echoes that justify Marcus’s obsession with reverberant stories. The campfire stick’s notches, ink-wash shadows, and meteor streaks function as micro-setting—objects whose changing light and weight guide his next artistic move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: diplomat-calligrapher notices ink viscosity, echo decay, meteor silence. Environment charges the final image: meteors burn soundlessly as he decides to let consequences rewrite causes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to tell trauma without becoming another voice of violence—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus chooses the backwards puppet show as ethical answer. Pressure escalates via pattern deepening: each return of stick, echo, or meteor hush adds weight to the same question rather than inventing new obstacles. The tightening is single but meaningful: the rehearsal of tomorrow’s show forecloses the collaborators’ accusatory path and stakes Marcus’s reputation among the dive-bar audience. Cost is conceptual (owning the exploiter label) rather than visceral, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the backwards puppet conceit: narrative time can redeem violence only if the teller absorbs its echo. Subtext lives in object handling—the stick’s ten-thousand-notched history versus Marcus’s single fresh brushstroke. Final meteor hush offers a non-literal answer: silence after ignition is the only ethical space left. No moral is stated; the image reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s urbane perceptual signature—calligraphy metaphors, diplomatic cadence, meteor hush lexicon. No head-hopping; collaborators exist only as vanished echoes. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses into short declaratives as he commits to the reverse show, mirroring ink-thickening tension. Voice remains distinct under pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: “meteor hush” and “cathedral echo” recur with shifting valence, taught by line three and paid off in the final sentence. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the acoustic/stellar motif. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“he’d learned,” “he began”) they compress backstory without stalling. One mixed metaphor—“skull of some ancient giant” beside “cathedral echo”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The backwards puppet-show conceit reframes trauma ethics through calligraphic shadow-play, a synthesis not seen in submission piles. The decommissioned radar dome as echo-chamber workshop is a fresh spatial correlative for narrative responsibility. Risk is high—entire conflict happens off-page, story told in reflective stillness—yet the pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity of Lakota-notched stick and ink-wash puppets prevents abstraction from drifting into gimmick.</comment>
