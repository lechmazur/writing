<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The medium’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her chest pulses against the stone, her hands remember séance burns. The contradictory impulse to protect-by-silence vs. need-to-speak is alive in every beat. Yet the moment of actual apology is slightly under-drafted; the shard does the speaking for her, muting the cost of her own vocal risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard crumbles, the unsent words are finally spoken into spirit-wind, and the mother exits the labyrinth stripped of cryptic armor. Causal chain holds: shard warmth → window-words → message released → dust. The 3-yr flashback is cleanly cued by moonlight and condensation, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mangrove labyrinth is not backdrop but pressure system: knee-deep water slows steps, roots snag, spirits sing directions. Shard-as-micro-setting constrains the final act—only its edge can etch the apology onto mist. Sensory economy is exact: brackish air, moonlight like mercury, no tourist cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she speak the apology before moonlight ends?—is signaled by line 4. Escalation is textural: each condensation window sharpens the cost of silence. The final tightening comes when she realizes the message must travel via dream, not hand; the price is surrendering control of reception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through shard-to-dust arc: protection that once channeled rain now channels truth, reframing secrecy as selfishness. Final image of dust on tide reweights prior gargoyle-guardian symbolism without moralizing. Slight softness: “fierce tenderness” is named twice; letting the final lullaby carry it would deepen subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled: compressed syntax under moonlight (“condensation rose like morning mist”) opens into longer breath when memory floods. Perceptual signature—stone pulsing, scars that aren’t dermal—stays particular. No filter-verb stacks; psychic distance stable. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” feels academic for séance mother.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence can do three jobs (“The shard grew warm in her palm. It had fallen from Notre-Dame...” anchors object, cues backstory, signals causality). Metaphors are clean and non-contradictory; no mixed vehicle. Rhythm accelerates at water-entry, slows at window-touch, matching heartbeat. Final-line dust image is taut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar mother-estrangement arc is refreshed through gargoyle-shard conduit and spirit-messengers in mangrove. Notre-Dame fragment as apology stylus feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken—lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals—pays off in charged poise, though treads close to template “letter never sent.”</comment>
