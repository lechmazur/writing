<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marta’s curator instinct is concrete—she waits on the bench, palms the locket, decides to “follow where it leads”—but the interiority stays safely empathic-curator rather than personally conflicted; the moment she stands to take Elena home is the single micro-choice that earns her arc, yet it feels more facilitative than crucible-level. The neighbors’ rapid mobilization is sketched warmly but skips any friction that would test Marta’s status or motive, so the cost lands on Elena, not on Marta herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is rock-solid: locket discovery → Jorge ID → neighborhood sleuthing → postal rescue → Elena speaks; each beat narrows the next option and the final image of Elena hanging the locket around her neck in “this home” is a clean Charged Poise that reweights the courtyard as address. The one transition (thrift store → shelter) is legible, anchored by “they walked through awakening streets,” and the mailbox backstory is seeded early, so no orientation debt accrues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The courtyard’s dawn amber, basil scent, guitar tuning, and breadcrumb sparrows are filtered through Marta’s collector gaze; the mailbox itself becomes a micro-setting that physically constrains choice—its locked mouth creates Elena’s silence and the neighbors’ later撬撬撬动. Spatial choreography is clean: bench → stairs → shelter window, bodies track without drift. The final image of the locket against the courtyard stars recharges the setting with undeniable social cost: “this address” is now communal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s voice versus systemic erasure—is signaled by her bleeding knuckles and the sealed letters; the tightening occurs when Marta decides to “show me,” shifting the quest from object-recovery to person-recovery. The price is visible: Elena’s first spoken words, “My Sofia,” carry the cost of twenty years of silence. Agency is shared across the courtyard, which slightly dilutes the personal stakes, but the communal act still forecloses the landlord’s erasure and rewrites the mailbox’s future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: discarded objects and discarded people mirror each other; the locket’s journey from thrift shelf to Elena’s neck re-prices “abandonment” into collective guardianship. The final line—“until the locked became open”—is the only overt thematic phrasing, but it is earned by the entire causal chain and carries conceptual cost: the neighborhood must now sustain the address it claimed. Subtext in Jorge’s “sandstorm calm” and Mrs. Chen’s silent descent conveys shared complicity in urban erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Marta’s perceptual signature—tarnished silver, “curator’s instinct,” thrift-store acoustics—without filter-verb clutter. Diction remains within her lexicon: “objects carried their owners’ endings,” not abstract theorizing. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Jorge’s “sandstorm calm,” Elena’s cracked “My Sofia,” each line carrying subtext of exile and return. Rhythm modulates from patient dawn description to brisk “mission control” acceleration without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences open with varied agents, avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“letters promising to return…bloomed fresh”—and never clusters into purple. One paraphrase loop appears: “objects carried their owners’ endings / Objects carried their owners’ endings” is repeated verbatim; a minor scaffold that dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise information density is high; paragraph cuts always advance knowledge or emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “object as key to erased life” trope is familiar, but the specificity of the locked mailbox as shrine and the communal postal-heist rescue feels fresh; the inversion of eviction paperwork versus handwritten letters gives the premise local bite. Risk is moderate—safe empathic uplift—but the synthesis of curator instinct and neighborhood network yields a memorable inflection. The final re-pricing of the courtyard into a forwarding address is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
