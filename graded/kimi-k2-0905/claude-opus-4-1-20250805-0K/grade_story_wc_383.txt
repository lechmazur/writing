<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the shell’s cut palm while fearing its return—are dramatized in continuous beats. The moment she chooses to dig with bare hands, the cost of reclaiming grief is made visceral and specific. One micro-choice (pressing the halves together) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: integration over anesthesia. Earned stasis lands with visible scar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the rejoined shell sings, reweighting every prior echo of “archive” and “quarantine” into a lived future. Causal linkage holds: because the buried half was hidden in calcium lattices, therefore the flood of memory arrives with undeniable cost. The final image (rainbow patterns on the scar) makes the conceptual price—she will feel grief anew every dawn—undeniable. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The velvet petals brushing ankles constrain her path, literally guiding her deeper into the maze; their perfume triggers the buried half’s location, fusing setting and plot. Micro-setting (shell edge cutting palm) functions as tactile arena. Final image of dawn-gilded petals reconfigures the garden from absorber of light to reflector—mirrors her new capacity to reflect memory rather than absorb darkness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she re-inherit quarantined grief?—is signaled by the first whispers. Mid-story tightening: choosing to dig risks re-traumatization, foreclosing the Institute’s promised peace. Cost is paid in blood from the shell edge and in the explicit line “she’d feel grief anew every dawn.” Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of “archive”: memory as architecture, not virus. Subtext whispers in the shell’s resonance—storage medium as living bone. Final image reframes scar as prism, implying pain transformed into spectrum of identity. No moral is stated; the rainbow pattern is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is material-scientific (“calcium carbonate lattices,” “metadata of extracted experiences”). Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fragments at the dig: “dirt collecting under her fingernails like inverse stars.” No head-hopping; shell’s hum is externalized sensation, not omniscient intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances memory-tech lore or emotional stakes. No scaffold loops; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Metaphors are precisely mixed only once—“inverse stars”—and serve the beat. Final line’s “memories learning to dance” is earned by prior “resonance structures” setup; no purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-therapy as physical archival science, seashell as covert backup drive. Conceptual risk—lyric techno-magic—pays off via coherent micro-mechanics (calcium lattice, resonance). Not a retread; the Institute’s quarantine language feels sui generis. Slight deduction for near-echo of “too bright to look at” phrasing.</comment>
