<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mei’s pacifist training and lone-survivor status are strongly anchored; her micro-choices (tracing tears, dosing the photo) flow from these motives. Interior contradiction is absent—she never wavers—so the “steadfast” trait stays one-note. Because the story hinges on her serene acceptance, the lack of flaw or doubt is genre-justified, yet it caps depth. Earned cost is present in her bodily release, but the absence of a competing impulse keeps the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each photograph adds density until the pattern break (dissolved image) reweights meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—shadow integration is declared complete—but the cost feels abstract, not visceral. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (drifting monastery ship) is taught and pays off in the final weightless acceptance. Still, the “never been real” rupture is told more than dramatized, muting the Decisive Change punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ship’s stitched-together hull and gravity-sensitive meditation chamber are vivid, selective, and repeatedly used to ground Mei’s movement. The dried-tear photographs function as micro-setting: their shimmer guides her needle and finally dissolves into the breach. Environmental rules (gravity fluctuates with emotion) are consistent and exploited at the climax. One cap: the broader cosmos outside the ship is never sketched, but that exceeds this scene’s needs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open shadow dimension or remain sole human—surfaces early. Pressure tightens once: the tear drop dissolves the photo, foreclosing retreat. Agency is interior (acceptance) rather than overt struggle, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (she becomes “first human complete”) but not materially felt, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme of integrating rejected shadow emerges through image-pattern (tears → darkness → wholeness) rather than exposition. Subtext is strongest in the ship’s recycled war-parts, silently arguing that violence was always structural. Final image reweights premise: dimensional barrier “never been real” = denial was the only enemy. Complexity acknowledged, but tidy Buddhist triumph slightly softens residual ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains coherent perceptual signature: Mei notices weight, shimmer, stitch-tension. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for drift, clipped fragments at breach. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk waived. Diction stays within a monk-raised adolescent’s plausible lexicon; only “conceptual repricing” phrase edges abstract, but it occurs in closing reflection where slight elevation is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors avoided—“oil on water” is single, apt. One paraphrase loop: “never been real except as humanity’s desperate attempt to deny its own nature” restates prior idea; trims −0.2. Information density high; most lines do double duty. Closure image untouched by artifact, satisfying 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of bodhisattva myth with recycled-generation-ship is fresh; shadow-dimension as literal storage of projected human violence avoids pop-culture cliché. Risky choice to make climax an interior stitching meditation pays off emotionally. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet not obvious at start. Minus: “last human born” and “AI in grandmother’s voice” are familiar tropes minimally re-inflected.</comment>
