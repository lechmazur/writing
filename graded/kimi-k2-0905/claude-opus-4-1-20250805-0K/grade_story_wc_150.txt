<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Miriam’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tremble from recognition, not fatigue; the sundial’s weight feels “both foreign and familiar.” The decision to stay and rebuild is earned by the cumulative weight of dream-returns and the literal inscription her grandmother left. The only minor slack is that her “lost faith” is asserted more than dramatized in-scene; we see her curiosity warm, but the earlier spiritual rupture is summarized. Still, the renunciation of exile life is legible and costly: she kneels and begins mapping, foreclosing the option of leaving again.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the shadow’s first sweep across the name-carved hours crystallizes the circular diaspora logic and reweights every prior image. Causality is clean—because she finds the gnomon and reads the inscription she kneels, therefore foreclosing flight. Orientation is anchored by line 8 (who, where, when). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each marriage of root and bone intensifies density until the final cadence shift. Cost is unmistakable—“Time returns all wanderers to their purpose” both honors and imprisons her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The catacomb-orchard is not backdrop but hydraulic pressure: roots “embracing skulls and femurs with equal tenderness” dictates where feet can step and where oil will be pressed. The sundial base itself functions as micro-setting, its inscribed names constraining the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Miriam notices bronze green, root tension, olive ripeness, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions as they traverse the grove. The final image of shadow crossing names recharges the setting’s living-dead fusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—returnee’s readiness to measure days not years—is signaled early via dreams and tightened when the gnomon is fitted. One meaningful deepening: the sundial reveals names instead of numbers, forcing her from observer to keeper. Agency is present—she clears soil, positions gnomon, kneels to map—each act forfeits the next train out. Cost is conceptual but legible: eternal accountability to ancestor-time. No coincidence resolves; pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens until stance crystallizes.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of departure-as-return; the orchard literalizes that death nourishes the living. No character moralizes; the inscription’s aphorism is grandmother-ghost, not author-voice. Subtext lives in gesture—Yakov’s careful steps show trust in new paths; Miriam’s kneeling accepts root-embrace as covenant. Final image reweights earlier “interrupted journeys” as necessary spirals, offering resonant ambiguity: is she freed or bound? Complexity is honored; no tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lens stays close to Miriam’s perceptual filter—she notices soil temperature, bronze weight, root topology. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“roots embracing skulls and femurs with equal tenderness”) then shortens at decision (“Help me position it”). No head-hopping; Yakov’s interiority is opaque, read only through voice warmth. Diction is earthy and biblical without caricature—“diaspora,” “ossuary,” “gnomon” feel lived-in. Rhythm modulates: languid garden sentences yield to hammer-fact inscription.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do three jobs—“ olives ripened on branches that had learned to grow through tombs” advances time, setting, theme. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is organic to orchard logic. Minor overwriting risk in “forgotten promise” opener, but it pays off thematically. Final line shadow sweep is crisp, propulsive, unadorned—lets image carry catharsis. Pronouns, tense, geography stable throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The earthquake-upturned graveyard-orchard is fresh world-logic; olive oil pressed among bones is specific and non-portable. Diaspora return via sundial names rather than numbers crystallizes circular time idea. Risk is taken—quiet lyric ending, no antagonist—but coherence stays intact. Could edge higher if Miriam’s pre-exile flaw were more concrete, but the synthesis of horticulture, death, and time feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
