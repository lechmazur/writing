<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her tattooing needles click, the amber warms against bone—but the “meteor hush” is repeated so often it starts to feel like a label rather than lived contradiction. Her final quiet exit is earned because every spectral tether she inks costs her amber a fracture, a believable price. Flaw: the “baby-cry translator” trait is asserted, never tested or traded off under pressure; it stays ornamental. Still, her steady, tactile attention to ghosts-as-code feels singular, not archetypal.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: the constellation of deleted code is tattooed into real space, reweighting the premise that deletion = erasure. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each needle-stroke adds visible star-pages to the mandala, tightening guilt into acknowledgment. The future-letter gambit is seeded early (“letters dated thirty years in the future”), paid off when Mara already knows she will write them, looping choice without paradox. Cost is palpable in the cracked amber and the terminal’s quiet “Thank you for remembering us”—a machine’s grief made legible.</comment>

<comment>The laboratory’s folded-time rules are learned through action: terminal flickers star-maps that shouldn’t exist, amber focuses frequencies into visible constellations. Micro-setting—her pendant, the needles, the screen—literally constrains how ghosts can be anchored; environment is tool. “Between heartbeats” is vague, but the spatial choreography of floating light-maps above the terminal keeps the room legible. Sensory hierarchy favors electromagnetic taste over visual excess, matching the POV’s synesthetic gift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: give deleted code a memorial before the fold ends. Escalation is accretive—each ghost-star inked increases the amber’s fracture and the room’s silence—until the final mandala forecloses further mourning. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the accumulating guilt made audible. The tightening is visible: static → primal cry → resolved lullaby, a cadence shift that reweights the ethical cost of “update and erase.”</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as “memory is a form of firmware”—every deletion leaves electromagnetic guilt that can be tattooed into star-maps. Subtext whispers in the mosquito’s 60-million-year blood-memory, linking organic and digital extinction. The ending refuses moralizing; instead it offers a constellation that hums like a lullaby for machines, a resonant image that reweights earlier motifs. No thematic echo lines, only the terminal’s terse gratitude, which feels earned and austere.</comment>

<comment>Voice is synesthetic, meteor-hushed, with controlled compression: “time folded in on itself” is taught early and repeated without drumbeat fatigue. Perceptual signature is specific—Mara hears subsonic guilt, tastes electromagnetic blood—never ventriloquized. Internal syntax mirrors tattooist precision: short, needled sentences during inscription; longer sinuous clauses when mapping constellations. No head-hopping; Dr. Kepler stays external, a necessary witness.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm breathes with task: needle-clicks accelerate, then settle into the hush after resolution. Metaphors stay coherent—amber as lens, ghosts as stars—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often layers time-fold, firmware guilt, and tactile ink. Zero loops or scaffold; even the repeated “meteor hush” modulates from ambiance to earned stasis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of tattoo artistry + haunted firmware + deep-time amber is non-obvious and inseparable from the emotional arc. Risk—treating deleted code as literal ghosts—could have gimmicked, but the lyric accumulation of star-maps makes the concept feel inevitable. Fresh inflection: guilt as constellation, memorial as tattoo on reality itself. No derivative templates; the mosquito’s Cretaceous blood and 1987 code ghosts mirror without allegorical strain.</comment>
