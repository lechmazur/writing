<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific to Marina’s light-painting gift; contradictions (aching joy, bitter-sweet seed memory) register. Micro-choice—deciding to venture deeper tomorrow—caps an arc from isolation to communal restoration; cost is the ephemeral nature of dreams. No second character on page, so status/relationship tests N/A. The “gift awakening” and “knowledge network” flood are slightly abstract, skirting diagnostic-speak, but embodied light-work keeps it from label-only abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each light-stroke adds remembered joy, density peaks in communal mural, ends with Charged Poise—Marina’s vow to continue while cradling glowing fragment; cost is the impermanence she accepts. Orientation anchors within 60 words; single-scene default met. One meaningful tightening when network activates and she shifts receiver→creator. Closure image of fragment still glowing reweights earlier stakes; no causal chain break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog-damp fresco, studio-cave, crushed apple-seed plaster provide tactile micro-setting that constrains her technique (must paint with light, not pigment). Spatial choreography clean: fragment → palms → cave walls → orchard memory. Environment mirrors internal thaw: gray cave blooms into luminous orchard. Sensory economy favors touch/taste over visual catalog, keeping detail purposeful for 725-word count.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore district’s joy—signaled early. Escalation via knowledge-network surge that turns passive vision into active obligation; cost is knowledge that the mural will fade. Agency: she chooses to display, then to continue tomorrow, accepting ephemerality. No external antagonist; internal conflict (despair vs hope) tightens once. Coincidence absent; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory as renewable light, collective art as resistance to entropy. Subtext carried in gesture—cradling fragment equals cradling community ghost. Final image of fragment still glowing offers conceptual repricing: loss itself becomes fuel. No overt thesis; avoids sentimentality by admitting transience. Ambiguity lingers—will fog return?—but stance is clear: keep painting anyway.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person deep interior stays consistent; perceptual signature filters through artist’s synesthetic palate (“taste their bitter-sweet essence”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dream-fold, staccato bursts at network surge. No dialogue, so mechanics N/A. Diction stays within plausible artist lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Voice cohesion supports accumulative cadence without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver setting, sensory, and metaphoric work (“apple blossoms materialized in gossamer strokes”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (light=honey, memory=seeds). Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” territory—but justified by artist POV. Rhythm breathes with scene temperature. Copy clean; no typos or tense drift. Final line echoes opening’s silk fold, satisfying closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Light-painting via fresco memory is fresh synthesis; reverses usual decay narrative. Knowledge-network as communal synapse avoids lone-savior trope. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative escalation rather than set-piece battle; payoff is lyrical rather than triumphal. Specificity of apple-seed plaster and fog-orchard keeps world from generic ruin. Could swap names, but core inversion (restoration through ephemeral art) remains distinctive.</comment>
