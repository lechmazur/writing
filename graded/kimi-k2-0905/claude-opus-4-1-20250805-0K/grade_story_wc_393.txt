<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza’s interior contradiction—her inherited grace versus inherited wreckage—drives every micro-choice at the bench; the final “choice to transform an apology into action” is earned through the tactile gear-turns she performs under Marcus’s witness. Thomas remains off-page yet his tremor-vs-repair contradiction is made legible in Eliza’s wrists and in the journal’s copper annotations. The only softness is a hairline slip at “maybe we deserve better,” which edges toward therapeutic self-diagnosis rather than embodied cost; this keeps it just shy of 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Thomas learned repair → therefore journal exists → therefore Eliza can act → therefore clockwork heart beats again; the Resonant Reconfiguration lands with on-page conceptual cost—“neither forgiveness nor forgetting, but something more deliberate.” Light breaking through storm clouds is seeded early and reprised at closure, reweighting the moral rule-set. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure beat untouched by any flaw.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shop itself—brass motes, frozen dancers, rice-grain gears—functions as micro-setting that literally constrains finger movement and social intimacy; removing any prop would collapse the repair beats. “Rain-slicked street” and “dissipating storm clouds” evolve across the scene, mirroring internal clearing without overt symbolism. Light as tool is introduced early, recharged at climax, and charges the final image. Meeting the 9+ gate by forcing tactical choices (light angle dictates which screw glints, hence which gear Eliza selects).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: will Eliza allow Thomas’s apology to become action? Pressure tightens once—when she decides to follow the journal’s instructions—paying the visible cost of reopening filial grief. Escalation is causal under lens: each gear placed = one increment of reopened wound. Cost is legible in the final “steady as absolution” tick, but the beat is quietly observational rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just below 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the returning heartbeat image: absolution is not a feeling but a mechanic—something you build, gear by gear. Subtext operates in silence: Marcus never preaches, Eliza never declares forgiveness; the music box speaks. Final reconfiguration (“neither forgiveness nor forgetting”) offers ambiguous wisdom anchored in the particulars of copper wire and brass dancers. No final-paragraph sermon; resonance is purely imagistic, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person psychic distance stays locked to Eliza’s perceptual signature: “vibrant hush,” “aptly deliberate precision,” “inherited grace.” Syntax mimics clockwork—nested subordinate clauses that click into main verbs. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: “Second opinions…” is both accusation and invitation. No head-hopping; Marcus’s interiority is filtered through Eliza’s reading of his gaze. Rhythmic control tightens under pressure—short percussive sentences during gear insertion, longer lyrical sweep during final melody.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise: “light… like the moment before a music box spring releases” teaches the release pattern that will recur. No register drift; religious lexicon (“absolution, grace”) stays within Marcus’s credible diction. High information density—e.g., “gears smaller than rice grains” simultaneously sizes, amazes, and stakes the repair difficulty. Closure line “sure as grace” is ear-tested perfect cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—condemned man’s apology—made specific through clockwork pedagogy and the reversal that the murderer teaches the mending. Fresh inflection: absolution recast as mechanical engineering. Risky structural choice to keep killer off-page pays off by forcing sister’s body to carry his contradiction. Specificity of antique music box trade details (wire gauge, rice-grain gears) prevents template drift. Emotional truth > surface novelty; nevertheless achieves non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
