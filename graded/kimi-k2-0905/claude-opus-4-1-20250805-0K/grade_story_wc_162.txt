<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—her finger tracing the railing grain, the 7-foot row spacing matching her father’s arm-span—but the climactic “threshold” discovery leans on abstract weather-code intuition rather than a visible choice that costs her something. The emotional stakes crest in the whispered name, yet the prior beat is summary (“she intuited the final truth”), blunting the earned turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the circle of bare earth reweights the maze from puzzle to sacred threshold, felt cost is the permanent three-degree chill. Causal lattice holds—logbook codes → turns → center—but the final beat is interior summary, not a dramatized gesture, so the lens stays Accumulative/Textural rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The wooden railing’s counter-clock grain, the 21-foot echo-distance, and the prism terrace casting rainbow shadows all constrain navigation and charge the final image. Micro-setting inside the “perfect circle” of bare soil becomes the climatic lens that reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find why the maze feels sacred—tightens when the center’s temperature differential is revealed, foreclosing the option to leave. Cost is conceptual (the ache of presence/absence) rather than visceral; escalation is textural density, not causal narrowing, so high-but-not-elite band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Theme of sacred distance emerges from corn-row metrics and atmospheric pressure rather than assertion; the final image of rainbow shadows reweights loss as bridge-building. Avoids explicit moral; one flicker of thematic echo (“necessary distance we’re always crossing”) is brief enough to escape heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is strong—spiral grain, moth-wing storm, fractured hush—syntax tightens under pressure (“featherly determined”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence; lyric compression stays legible, pattern taught early and paid off in final whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences open variedly, no template cadence runs. One density flare—“corn whispered in fractured hush, individual stalks speaking different languages of wind”—but it advances atmosphere, not clutter. Closure beat is short, clear, unmarred by scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Father-as-meteorologist who maps grief onto corn currents is fresh; weather-code logbook as labyrinth key transforms trope. Specificity of three-degree soil differential feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
