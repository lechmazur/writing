<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is specific—tactile star-chart memory, the heft of glass, circular lens-polishing motions—yet her decisive turn (glow → beacon) arrives with a whiff of inherited destiny rather than a contradiction she must swallow. The “grandfather’s cryptic words” shortcut bypasses a visible flaw that could have forced a costlier micro-choice. Still, her embodied emotion and gem-polisher craft knowledge thread cleanly through every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: dark lighthouse → dawn grotto visits → glass polishing → accidental luminescence → mist-prism beacon → communal replication. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fleet’s safe passage is paid for by Marina’s public relinquishment of secrecy and the grotto’s conversion into a public school. The “pearl of stillness” reweights the premise—guidance without combustion—while the price (permanent exposure of her hideaway) is felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Serpentine limestone, salt-slick steps, and vapor that “curls like liquid starlight” are not picturesque décor; the acoustics and mist literally convert the glass glow into a usable beacon. The grotto’s amphitheater shape is the hinge resource that lets one small lamp shepherd a fleet—setting directly enables the climax. Micro-setting rule satisfied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace the failed lighthouse—tightens once: solitary ritual becomes communal infrastructure. The meaningful deepening is the moment Marina realizes the grotto can amplify personal glow into public path; this narrows her privacy to zero and scales the tactic. Cost is visible: her secret cove becomes village property. Agency drives escalation under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete inversion of navigation: instead of a blazing tower, a soft earthbound star shared by many. The “pearl of stillness” is re-priced when stillness becomes collective motion—boats sailing safely—yet the price is Marina’s loss of solitude. No final moralizing; the fleet gliding home is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: an astronomer who “reads star charts by touch,” thinks in circular polishing strokes, and hears her own laugh transformed into “wind chimes in a soft breeze.” Syntax stays tactile and maritime, never drifts into generic lyrical uplift. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density with rhythmic variation: “The mist became her canvas” carries triple duty—sensorial, metaphorical, causal. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. The only near-purple phrase—“zephyr bloom of dawn”—is earned by prior wind imagery and pays off in the final “soft green luminescence.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gem-polishing astronomy meets coastal navigation failure; sea glass as low-tech fiber-optic. The grotto’s natural optics supplant industrial lighthouse tech without romanticizing pre-modernity—Marina teaches villagers to mass-replicate, turning craft into infrastructure. Risky structural choice (quiet communal ending instead of solo triumph) tightens rather than softens stakes.</comment>
