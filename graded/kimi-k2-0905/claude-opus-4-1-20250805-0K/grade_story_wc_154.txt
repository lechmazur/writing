<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—survivor’s guilt fused with morphine-loosened candor—grounds every micro-choice; the coral hand-off crystallizes her shift from mediator to mentor. The child’s shrewd innocence is shown, not labeled, through the cast-demanding gesture and silent acceptance of the coral. One beat of over-explained backstory (the school-hostage sentence) slightly dilates the 20 % cap, and the “lotus-hearted ache” phrase edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the misted greenhouse becomes a communal script where Maya’s earlier translator role is conceptually repriced—she now “writes” rather than brokers meaning. Causal linkage holds: because she survives and decrypts, therefore the cast becomes art and the coral changes hands, with felt cost in the phantom-shoulder twinge. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds from first pattern-teach (“shared anxieties hanging like unspoken prayers”) to final image. Persistent constraint: the coral as map-of-scars threads every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atrium’s manufactured rain and twilight glass actively reweight the stake—healing is as curated as the mist. Coral-as-micro-setting constrains the final gift; its “convolutions” mirror both neural and archipelagic routes, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy obeys medicated perception: morphine blurs edges, tightens focus on tactile ridges and humid breath. No static postcarding; every environmental detail is filtered through Maya’s body-in-recovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to turn private survival into shared language—tightens once: from decrypting cast to communal graffiti. Agency is present-tense: Maya’s decision to draw the bridge-logo directly enlarges the child’s options and forecloses her own anonymity. Cost is visible: phantom pain spikes as she writes, linking bodily damage to symbolic labor. Escalation is single-ply but sufficient for 700-word scale; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern, not pronouncement: translation migrates from battlefield parley to scar-to-scar communion. Subtext lives in silence—the child never states grief, yet her finger-clutch of coral says “replace mother.” Final image reweights “old wounds grow new wings” without sermon; the butterfly-drawings retroactively become the story’s emergent alphabet. Moral complexity intact: Maya offers no peace treaty, only a slower-growing survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Maya’s medicated sensorium: clauses elongate then fracture, mimicking drip-timed thought. Perceptual signature—“mist-clad,” “lotus-hearted”—is character-bound, not ornamental. No head-hopping; child’s interior is shown only through gesture and dialogue indirection. Dialogue is sparse but cadence-distinct: child’s accented lilt vs. Maya’s translator precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with morphine ebb—long aqueous clauses yield to staccato crayon scratches. Figurative density peaks only in the final mist-image, justified as climactic reconfiguration. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactile or social detail. One mixed metaphor—“lotus-hearted ache”—slips into therapeutic register, docking 0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshens the “wounded healer” trope by relocating it to a greenhouse ICU where the instrument of healing is a child’s plaster cast. Coral-as-map and butterfly-glyphs are non-obvious syntheses of reef biology and invented script; removal would collapse the entire symbolic economy. Risk—lyric medicated interior—pays off by making the climax an act of collaborative graffiti. No close echoes to famous scenes; Pacific micro-conflicts feel specific, not Wikipedia.</comment>
