<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV vendor feels idiosyncratic (“quantifying absence,” bottled moonlight obsession) but remains emotionally static; no interior contradiction under pressure, only tender philosophy. Child’s arrival should test him, yet he responds with practiced calm and zero personal stake—no visible cost or renunciation. “Earned stasis” is asserted, not dramatized; the shop trembles, but Merrick himself never flinches or doubts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: droplets, jars, glass apples accrete a pattern of perpetual beginning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—stories without ends—charged by the visual swap from forgetting-bottles to perpetual-beginning glow; cost is felt conceptually rather than personally. Orientation clean by 80 words; single-scene, single transition (child in/out). No causality break, but Merrick’s internal change is offstage; shop’s transformation stands in for his arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass orchard/library is lush, selective, tactile—“crystalline leaves catching fragments of cloud-light,” wisps drawn up roots. Every visual detail doubles as metaphor for narrative suspension; setting itself becomes the micro-object that re-weights at closure when jars refill with beginnings. Spatial choreography immaculate; no floating rooms. Cloud-sea and glass apples constrain mood and literal buoyancy of the shop, fulfilling 9+ gate by charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—child’s need to abolish endings—signals early; Merrick’s acceptance supplies the tightening. Pressure is situational/ritual rather than adversarial; one meaningful deepening when bottled moonlight guides the incising. Cost is paid by child (loss of closure) and by environment (shop transfigured), but Merrick feels no personal price, capping escalation legibility. Agency is Merrick’s gentle facilitation; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image-string: endings = mortality, beginnings = immortality; no explicit sermon. Subtext loaded in gesture—grandfather’s open mouth, apples filling with light. Final image of sun neither rising nor setting re-prices time itself, satisfying resonance gate. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers without confusion. One micro “thesis echo” −0.2 for child’s “maybe they never have to,” but early enough to forgive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers at poetic distance; diction glass-bright, rhythmic—“tinkled overhead,” “cloud-light from below.” Filter verbs minimal; perception skewed through Merrick’s cataloguing gaze. No dialogue contamination; child’s speech terse, believable. Compression taught early—“Clean Slates, Blank Pages, Virgin Thoughts”—paid off in final shelf swap. Occasional cadence repetition (“glass apples,” “glass branches”) reads deliberate motif rather than template.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph cuts clean; opening and closing lines anchor and echo. Metaphors stay consistent within glass/liquid/cloud lexicon—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “stories without endings become something else entirely—dreams, perhaps, or wishes, or prayers” could tighten. Filter-verb cluster absent. No artifacts in final third; closure image crystal-clear. Density high, but figurative load borderline; −0.2 for near-purple drift in droplet paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—memory apothecary in floating glass orchard—feels fresh yet inevitable. Combines antique mnemonic trade with lyric cloud-botanic setting; trope of “forgetting shop” flipped into generative act. Bottled moonlight as parole is a sharp, specific re-coinage. Conceptual integrity intact: if transplanted to mundane locale, entire fable collapses. Risk-taking (no villain, no personal loss) justified by atmospheric escalation and conceptual re-pricing at end.</comment>
