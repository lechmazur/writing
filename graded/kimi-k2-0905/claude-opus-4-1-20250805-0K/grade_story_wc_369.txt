<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-specific; Marcus’s tactile handling of the sextant and quiet reassembly embody his quiet caretaker ethos. The final renunciation—turning broken precision into grieving beacons—pays off three decades of custodial habit with visible cost: he forecloses his own legend of mechanical perfection. Emotional arithmetic stays off the nose; moon-healing is accepted as lived fact, not diagnosed. Voice stays singular and weathered, though the text flirts once with “understanding suddenly” shorthand before recovering.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus re-installs the ruined sextant to refract moonlight into lament-scored paths, crystallizing a new mandate for the labyrinth. The choice costs the instrument its original function and imprints his private grief onto public space; cost is visible in the dawn image of scarred mirrors catching first light. Causality threads cleanly—storm → broken tool → discovered etchings → reassembly → transformed maze. One micro-turn suffices; no outline-and-then sequencing. Orientation anchors by 80 words; lens (Accumulative) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storm-struck tower, ivy invasion, and moon-silver on brass are filtered through a custodian’s selective eye—details matter only if they need fixing. The deconstructed sextant becomes micro-setting: each shard directs light and later choice, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible mirror placements. Economy dominates: a single lightning flash sketches the broken dome, then exits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the labyrinth’s healing purpose—surfaces early and tightens when Marcus realizes the sextant’s fractures encode personal loss. The deepening beat is the deliberate decision to scatter its pieces, trading calibration for consolation; price is the irreversible loss of a working relic he’s tended 30 years. Escalation is Accumulative: each etched equation adds weight until grief outweighs duty to functionality. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme—grief transmuted into communal navigation—emerges through mirrored light, not axiom. Micro-notations (“She asked what trees see”) let mathematics carry private sorrow, culminating in leaf-shadow equations that invite visitors to solve for absence. The final image refrains from moral; resonance is in ivy pulse against his palm—forward growth, not back. No thematic echo or sermonizing caps the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Marcus’s perceptual register: grease under nails, moonlight as analgesic, mirror glints as syntax. Prose rhythm breathes with task—long sentences for stair descent, clipped fragments while aligning shards. No filter-verb stacks; diction is caretaker-plain yet elevated only when naming instrument parts. Voice is unmistakably his, never editorial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines pull double duty (action + metaphor) without crowding beats: “moonlight touched his weathered hands, and the familiar tingling began” advances both wound and wonder. Mixed metaphors avoided; “grief in angles and arcs” is singular and sustained. One paraphrase loop spotted (“each equation marked a specific kind of loss… the death…”)—minor, outside closure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of antique astrolabe, caretaker mythology, and moon-lit arborology feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable. The labyrinth-as-grief-processor reframes visitor frustration as algorithmic compassion—fresh without gimmick. Specificity (micro-etched diary in horizon glass) prevents trope drift. Risk in repurposing broken precision into anti-puzzle paths heightens stakes and earns the uplift.</comment>
