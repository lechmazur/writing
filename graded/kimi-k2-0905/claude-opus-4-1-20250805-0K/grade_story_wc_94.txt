<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is concrete—her steady breathing against lightning, the way deleted verses become her star-map. The “cartography of scars” obsession gives her a memorable, particular lens. Micro-choices (sliding the envelope behind the timetable, resetting the timer) externalize values and keep contradiction alive. Endurance-cost is felt: she forecloses the idea of open revolt and accepts perpetual smuggling, the price legible in dawn’s approaching routine.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: tension thickens through iterated timer cycles and photo-baths rather than causal dominoes. Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn nears, envelope re-hidden, mask still on, but the reader feels the irreversible shift—she is now the mist sliding through chains. Cost crystallizes in “words, rarefied to their essence, rose like vapor through every seal.” Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory dome, red digits, lightning rod, chemical trays—each prop is handled, not catalogued. The stormlit mountain perch constricts exits and justifies solitary rebellion; clouds become a literal veil below which censors stumble. Darkroom timer recurs, constraining every move; its final reset charges the closing image. Micro-setting rule met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve/circulate forbidden language under total surveillance. Pressure escalates by each three-minute increment and by discovery of the censored negatives; options narrow to invisibility or capture. Agency: she chooses further sublimation rather than exposure, paying with permanent self-censorship. Cost is visible—she locks the new envelope at dawn, perpetuating exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emergent theme: erasure teaches precision; absence becomes generative. No moralizing—meaning accretes through scars, vapour, masks, storms. Final image of “mist that passes through chains” non-literally answers how art survives suppression. Subtext in gesture: sliding envelope behind timetable whispers “someone will find,” turning bureaucratic debris into conduit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maya’s perceptual filter—astronomer’s vocabulary, poet’s synaesthesia (“poems written in light itself”). Rhythm flexes: elongated clauses for storm grandeur, staccato timer digits for pulse. No dialogue, so voice is pure narrative texture, consistently elevated yet believable for an internally exiled intellectual. No POV slippage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but not purple; each metaphor (star-maps, breathing between spaces) advances concept or stakes. Sentence variety avoids template cadence; opening anchors with auditory creak, closes with hushed “timer ticked on.” One paraphrase loop spotted (“storm moved on, but its electric kiss lingered”) yet it reweights atmosphere, doesn’t stall propulsion. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: astronomical darkroom as underground printing press. “Cartography of scars” flips censorship into poetic atlas; deleting authorities accidentally teach subversion. Risk lies in static scene—yet vigil rhythm and accumulating photos convert repetition into tension. Could not swap timer, envelope, or rarefaction without collapsing premise.</comment>
