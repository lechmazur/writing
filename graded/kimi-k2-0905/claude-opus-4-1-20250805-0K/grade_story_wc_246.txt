<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the mis-routed fleet vs. hunger for cosmic knowledge—are dramatized in the moment she grips the dead pen and chooses to transmit both coordinate sets. The interiority stays concrete, anchored to tactile objects (pen, starlight, alarm chime) rather than labels. Cost is legible: she knowingly preserves her error and the scientific breakthrough it birthed. The “confidently uncertain” stance is lived, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s dual broadcast keeps both timelines alive, paying the price of perpetual ontological doubt. Causal chain holds: misread pulsar → guilt → anomaly scrutiny → discovery of observer-contingent editing → choice to preserve plural histories. The anomaly’s offer and her refusal to collapse it are dramatized, not summarized. Persistent constraint—the fleet still adrift—shapes the final image.</comment>

<comment>The station chamber, osmium-iridium pen, and lensed starlight are returned to in every beat; the pen’s weight literally steadies her micro-gravity drift before the fatal keystroke. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through her interpreter priorities—wavelength gaps, biosignature ghosts—so setting guides choice. Spatial choreography is clean: anchor straps release, pen drifts, alarm chimes, she floats to the panel. Environment and tool jointly constrain the final dual transmission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she erase her mistake and the discovery it triggered?—tightens when the rescue ship enters the anomaly and begins following the “corrected” flight plan. One meaningful turn: she realizes the anomaly personalizes history, then decides not to choose. Cost is visible: she must live with the fleet’s peril and the burden of multiversal truth. Pressure escalates under causal lens because each observer’s reality literally alters navigation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of error and revelation: meaning is threshed through the very act of living with irreversible mistakes. The anomaly as cosmic editor externalizes this without allegorical shouting; the final image of “unexpected gardens” reweights the colonial seeds metaphor. No moral is preached; the reader is left to decide whether plural histories are mercy or curse. Subtext resides in the pen’s dry nib—creativity still marking the world without ink.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise yet lyric, calibrated to a scientist-poet who thinks in spectra and constellations. Diction—“selectively filtered,” “contingent relationships”—stays within her professional lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with short clauses under alarm pressure, then widens into reflective cadence for the final transmission. No filter-verb clutter; perception is immediate: “starlight catching the nib.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The bent light wasn’t just distorted—it was selectively filtered” advances both physics and theme. No paraphrase loops; each return to the pen adds new information (weight, starlight glint, final drift). Metaphors are coherent—cosmic editor, manuscript of spacetime—without mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers imagistic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The observer-contingent cosmic editor is a fresh synthesis of quantum ontologies and narrative theory, made specific through Mira’s guilt and the dried pen her grandfather once used to predict this impossible locus. Risk is taken: history becomes negotiable, yet the story lands emotional cost rather than dissolving into gimmick. The wrong seeds growing unexpected gardens reframes colonial catastrophe into uneasy hope without sentimental escape. Transformation test fails if names change—pen, anomaly, interpreter are irreducibly entwined.</comment>
