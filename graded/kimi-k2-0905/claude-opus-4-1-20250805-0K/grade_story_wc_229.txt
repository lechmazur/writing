<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority pulses with embodied contradiction—her trembling fingers on the vial yet steady voice calling Thomas, the simultaneous fury of forgiveness and the ache of wanting to touch the untouchable. The micro-choice to uncork the jasmine is concrete, character-specific, and costly: she risks confirming the town’s verdict of madness if the scent fails to summon him. Her flaw—refusing to relinquish love to death—drives every beat and compounds across the spiral stairs. The reunion is credible because her prior obsessive purification of intent has literally changed the rules of reality; the cost is that Thomas returns half-luminous, never again fully human, a living reminder that her love now cages them both in altered physics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged intention/jasmine garden explodes into sensory life at the touch of translucent fingers, reweighting love itself into a new hybrid state. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each repetition of jasmine, cork, and spiral stair thickens the texture until reality thins and the unsaid becomes matter. Causality is coherent within its own metaphysics: purification → scent → materialization. Cost is unmistakeable: Thomas’s half-corporeality and the perpetual cobalt light that will keep them border-creatures forever. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse paint peeling after merciless heat, cool stone pulse under palm, salt-crisp dawn air—selective, urgent, POV-filtered. The cork’s warmth and the jasmine molecules function as micro-setting that literally bends dimensional barriers. Spatial choreography is clean: stone → spiral stairs → lamp room; no floating bodies. The lighthouse beam’s rotation synchronizes with Thomas’s solidification, charging the final image. One minor slip—“weeks of merciless heat” floats unanchored in calendar time, but the heat-wave-break is concrete enough to pass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can purified love recall the dead without destroying either world? Pressure tightens exactly once: when Mara realizes Thomas’s protective guilt is the prison she must forgive, not fight. That revelation narrows her tactic from begging to self-exoneration, enabling the final merge. Cost is legible—Thomas’s permanent half-state—but the escalation is single-pulse; no further reversals or resource losses compound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: love’s refusal to let go can rewire physics, but the price is shared alienation from human normalcy. Jasmine shifts from nostalgic scent to literal building block of flesh, carrying the thematic weight without statement. The final image of two shadows dancing in the beacon light offers conceptual repricing: love now exists as an ongoing optical haunting, a public display of their new ontology. No sermon, only sensation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is Mara-centric: heat-crazed paint bruise-healing into gold, stone’s ancient pulse, vial warm as a living thing—metaphors rooted in keeper-body and lighthouse-body. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“trembling fingers,” “screaming tenderness”—then elongates as Thomas materializes. No head-hopping; Thomas’s voice is wind-through-leaves, filtered through Mara’s perception. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers scent, physics, memory. One metaphor overload in the opening—“bruise healing into gold”—but it teaches the later color play of cobalt/gold dawn and is paid off. No loops or synonym churn. Tense stable. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual molecules”) momentarily lifts POV diction, but the lyric scale justifies it. Closure line clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse as particle accelerator for grief, jasmine as programmable matter. Familiar trope (ghost lover) transformed through keeper-physics and intent-based cosmology. Risk taken: non-standard reality rules introduced midway, but pattern taught early via “vibrations of intent” and paid off. Specificity of cobalt paint peeling in heat wave grounds the speculative leap.</comment>
