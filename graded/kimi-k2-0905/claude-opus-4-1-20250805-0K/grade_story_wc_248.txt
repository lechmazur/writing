<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira’s arsonist past and genetic memory compel her choices, but the “volcanic tenderness” is asserted more than embodied; no tactile contradiction shows beneath pressure. The moment she touches the tapestry is strong, yet the interior shift from destroyer to keeper is summarized, not dramatized with a visible micro-choice that costs her on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each damaged artwork adds density until the tapestry reweights her identity. Closure lands with conceptual cost—she memorizes the weave, foreclosing the arsonist path—though the epiphany is slightly front-loaded in narration rather than crystallized by a final volitional act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Limestone corridor and copper air are sharply sensed; the tapestry as micro-setting constrains her next action (memorizing pattern). Spatial anchoring is late (~140 words) but serves the accumulative reveal, so orientation penalty waived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover imperishable memory—tightens when the tapestry encodes the preservation compound. One visible price: she accepts lifelong solitude above ground to guard the weave below. Escalation is steady but single-note; no secondary reversal raises the cost further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of erased civilizations versus imperishable truth emerges through textile imagery rather than exposition. The final image—truth encoded in fiber—reweights her prior fires as purification, not destruction, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct analytic-pragmatic diction (“surgically precise,” “anachronistic paper fibers”) fused with lyrical heat (“volcanic tenderness”). No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal syntax stays consistent and character-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentences carry double duty; occasional modifier stacks (“volcanic tenderness…infinitely gentle”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and matches POV. No loops or scaffold; final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist-as-curator, textile-as-memory-storage, genetically coded art-vandalism trail. Risky conceit stays conceptually coherent; specificity of fiber chemistry and UV map lifts it above allegory.</comment>
