<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory drives—documenting truth while erasing herself—are dramatized in embodied beats (the sole-tapped spellings, the thumb on a ring gesture she catalogs). Her choice to stay and “unbind memory from myth” is the earned renunciation that costs her any public vindication; the chessboard’s hollow squares externalize the price. Interiority avoids label-speak, using physical ritual to show her flattening affect under conspiracy fatigue. Voice stays individual: her taxonomy of “seconds of meaning” feels like the obsession of one who has inhaled too much smoke and cameras.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each spelled word thickens the gallery’s acoustic pattern until the final “WE REMAIN” reweights the empty king row into a conceptual tomb. Closure is Charged Poise—she forecloses testimony, accepting perpetual limbo; cost is legible in the echo that will answer her instead of any state. Orientation anchored by 120 words: “abandoned parliament,” “interregnum,” curved marble. No causality break; even the off-stage invite is a pressure increment, not resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Whispering gallery is not backdrop but physics: the dome’s acoustic arc forces Marina to whisper yet be heard, turning her footfall graffiti into a parliament no coup can dissolve. Chessboard’s absent pawns constrain her historiography—she can only crown absence. Micro-setting (her own body pacing letters) and recurring object (echo) together charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound: she catalogs angles of shoulders, not marble cherubs, because grief has trained her to read people’s exit postures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will she testify and re-enter the media crucible? Pressure tightens when the survivor arrives to “collect” her; she refuses, narrowing her future to perpetual witness in shadow. Cost is felt: she sacrifices legitimacy, embracing the “nomadic penumbra” forever. Escalation is accumulative—each spelled name layers acoustic evidence until silence itself becomes indictment; no coincidence, no reversal, just stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: history is grout between monuments, made of pawn-absences and unrehearsed gestures. Final image of “light through a wandering shadow” conceptually reweights the entire interregnum as that penumbra—neither dawn nor dusk—rendering Marina’s refusal heroic rather than hopeless. Luminous absence motif returns as the echo that keeps speaking after she stops, proving absence can be generative. No moralizing, only resonance: “Their spaces remembered them.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marina’s perceptual filter; syntax lengthens when she spells, shortens when interrupted, mimicking breath control. Diction—“nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless”—remains within the lexicon of someone who has read too many communiqués. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is integrated: “whispers traveled like ghosts of legislation.” Rhythm accelerates into the final six-word spell, then cuts to silence, teaching the acoustic payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops; each paragraph advances either spatial position, acoustic fact, or emotional cost. High density: “She moved through the curved space with practiced steps, her feet tracing letters across the marble floor: U-N-B-I-N-D” does world, habit, and symbol in one stroke. Metaphors stay consistent (acoustics = legislature of the dead). Zero typos, zero tense drift. Close flawless under read-aloud.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: crisis-actor conspiracy victim re-invented as underground archivist of micro-gestures. Chessboard with pawns removed used as historiographic tool rather than allegory. Whispering gallery repurposed into a parliament that cannot be dissolved—architecture as dissident archive. Risk—entire story is renunciation, not revelation—pays off via Charged Poise. Feels inevitable yet unwritten before now.</comment>
