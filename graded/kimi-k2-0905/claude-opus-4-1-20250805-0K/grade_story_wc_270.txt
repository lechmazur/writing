<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chen’s interiority is vivid—“the Earth’s own insurgent spirit” rising through her bones—and her micro-choice to pour the solvent is grounded in plant-whispers and embodied memory. The insurgent circle stays functional backdrop; Li’s only beat is a warning, so relationship crucible is waived. Telepathy trait is shown, not told, and the final smile carries visible cost as her eighty-year body commits to irreversible release. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ test isn’t quite met, but the portrayal is individual, flawed, and stakes-scaled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: stolen embryo → plant intel → kite formula → dissolve amber → genetic reset. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Authority control is undone on-page, soldiers’ implants fail, cost legible in empty shell and lieutenant’s dawning recognition. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One transition (dawn retrieval to present dissolve) is clean. Meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (implant loss) shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sulfur mist, hot-spring minerals, and amber’s golden shell are tactile and selective; volcanic heat guides the chemical mix. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: crouch → circle → pour → soldiers enter. The kite is micro-setting that constrains the decoding beat and returns recharged in the final updraft. Environment supplies both resource (formula) and risk (patrols), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom from implant control—is signaled early and tightened when the formula is poured: a one-way door that dissolves both amber and Authority dominance. Chen’s agency drives every beat; coincidence (finding kite) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is visible: implant sparks, empty shell, freed soldiers now vulnerable. Under causal lens, escalation narrows options exactly once—sufficient for this length—and lands price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—“tradition must evolve, not ossify”—emerges through amber cracking and kite flying, never stated. Subtext runs in plant-whispers that remember every tyranny. Final image of soaring kite reweights the opening evacuation memory with new genetic possibilities. Complexity is preserved: futures branch, no moral is sermonized, resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays latched to Chen; no head-hop. Diction—“chlorophyll and root systems,” “vegetal dreams”—is character-bound and rhythmic. Dialogue is minimal but natural: Li’s warning, lieutenant’s slow recognition carry subtext. No filter-verb stacks; psychic distance tightens under stress. Distinct perceptual signature meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. “Sulfur-scented mist… whispered” and “silk scarves in wind” are apt, not purple. Information density high: single sentence mixes insurgent circle, embryo theft, plant intel. One mixed metaphor—“heat rise through her bones like… insurgent spirit”—is minor; clarity intact. Zero loops or scaffold; closure line breathes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Combines cyber-geriatric resistance, paleobiology, and plant telepathy into an inevitable-feeling whole. Embryo-as-genetic-reset and kite-as-cipher feel fresh yet foreshadowed. Risky choice to keep climax off-stage (information release) is justified by Conceptual Repricing that reconfigures human evolution. Specificity of moss-planning revolution lifts it above eco-SF cliché.</comment>
