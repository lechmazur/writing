<comment>Mariel’s interiority is concrete—she “adjusts the dial with practiced delicacy,” “feels no fear, only a thistled calm,” and chooses to weave forbidden notes into official scores. The causal chain from grandmother’s whisper to dust-ink to tomorrow’s gala is legible, and her endurance (“luminous burden”) shows cost. Still, we get one static emotional register; no contradictory impulse in-scene complicates her steady resolve, so the arc is more mission than multifaceted character.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each new sensory layer (radio glow, dust-ink, pirate lyrics) thickens the texture until the final image reweights the premise—stories will ride sound-waves into lungs. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the same secretly luminous quality… impossible to truly extinguish” crystallizes stakes without curing them. Causality holds because every beat adds material to the same practical plan. Minor slack: the first 120 words only imply location; orientation pays off in the glow-soaked alcove image at closure, so penalty is waived.</comment>

<comment>World is built through tactile micro-details—amber-glow fingers, wax-sealed scores, dust-clouded breath—each filtered by Mariel’s copyist priorities. The ember alcove functions as micro-setting: its retained heat enables all-night ink work and metaphorically keeps narrative embers alive. Mist, radio dial, and dust return in the final sentence, charging the closure image. No external factual errors; all objects track consistently.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reignite collective imagination—arrives with the first pirate lyric and tightens when Mariel decides to “mix ambient particles… with ink,” risking discovery. One clear escalation beat: the broadcast names her (“the copyist her vigil keeps”), raising personal risk and foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (if caught, she vanishes) but not yet physically felt; hence tension is strong but not viscerally painful. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidences rescue.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulate metaphor—dust, ink, breath, sound—all carriers of narrative spores. No explicit thesis; instead, the final image of glowing radio dial reconfigures the premise: imagination is an invisible physics, not a moral choice. Subtext in pirate lyrics (“silence speaks what words suppress”) nudges musicians toward rebellion without stating it. Complexity acknowledged: the Ministry still governs tomorrow, so liberation is incremental, atmospheric, uncertain.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, precise, slightly archaic—“ember alcove,” “thistled calm,” “fox-fire burn”—yet consistent with a copyist who thinks in musical and mineral terms. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped sentences (“She switched off the radio”) for action. No dialogue to distort voice. Perceptual signature is acute—Mariel notices static crackle, grain texture, wax scent—always routed through her professional instrument, the ear. Patterned repetition (“luminous,” “dust,” “ember”) is deliberate and pays off in the closing glow.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, imagistic, high-density: one sentence often layers atmosphere, character, and plot advance (“She collected the ambient particles… on breath and sound waves”). Figurative language is selective; metaphors stay inside the thermal/light spectrum (ember, glow, foxfire) so accumulate rather than clutter. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Opening and closing sentences are ear-tested for resonance. One near-purple line—“narrative potential spreading through the concert hall”—survives because it is the stakes payload; otherwise clean.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: photochemical rebellion—musical notation + particulate ink + pirate ELF transmission—turns a familiar dystopia into a microbiological fairy-tale. Specificity sells it: ink mixed with “specially prepared” dust, wax sealed with more dust, musicians breathing narrative spores. Concept commits fully; no late rule inventions. Risk of lyric obscurity is taken but clarity holds. Transformation test fails if you swap copyist for gardener; the occupational know-how is integral.</comment>
