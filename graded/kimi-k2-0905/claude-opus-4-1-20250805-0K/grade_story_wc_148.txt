<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s hovering body and inherited shame embody the impossibility he must redeem; the journals’ discovery converts filial duty into urgent testimony, a believable pivot. Interiority stays physical—“threading his way into the corridor like smoke”—rather than abstract. The final self-naming “Marcus True-Tongue” is earned by the lattice’s proof and the hovering constraint that keeps him both prisoner and witness. Cost is visible: once the lattice records truth, escape or recant is impossible—he is locked to the story he releases.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: hidden journals → corridor breach → lattice testimony → dawn exposure. Orientation locked by sentence 4—name, prison #, reef—so salt-green plates teach the world before 120 words. Closure is decisive: the lattice absorbs the confession, irreversibly publicizing truth; Marcus’s physical impossibility becomes the very engine that lets the maze print his words. Cost lands in the final image—“the lighthouse prison had been built to contain liars. Tonight, it would finally hold the truth”—the building’s purpose flips because Marcus’s hover-body can reach the screen no warder ever could.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Copper light, salt-green brass, and scuffed fingernail trails are selective, sensory, and motive—every detail either bars escape or enables inscription. The lattice salvaged from shipwreck layers history into the wood’s grain, making setting a recording device. Micro-setting qualifies: the confessional’s carved maze is the tool that both channels and preserves voice, directly enabling closure. Spatial choreography is clean—Marcus threads, hovers, palms the screen—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clear father’s name before boat arrives—signals early and tightens with each scuff widened. Escalation causal: open door → access journals → reach lattice → confess under clock. One visible price: once testimony is carved, Marcus cannot retract; the lighthouse will display bones and words together. Agency is crystallized in the carving gesture; luck never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—truth as lived impossibility—emerges through hovering flesh and lattice wood rather than assertion. Final image reframes “boy who cried wolf” into “warden who fed children to wolves,” a conceptual repricing that flips folklore itself. Subtext operates in silence: the empty confessional has always been listening, making every prior scuff a latent testimony. No moralizing line; resonance arrives in the copper-lit lattice now glowing with rewritten public memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-fable: salt air turns brass green, copper light paints lattice—compressed, imagistic, taught in paragraph 1. Perceptual signature is Marcus’s aerial tilt: he notices floor-level scuffs from above, a bias only a hoverer would have. Rhythm swells toward testimony: longer cadence when carving, then clipped final line for crystallized stance. No head-hop; distance stable in close-third that can still note “impossibility of his existence” with ironic authority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentences layer job—world, body, metaphor—without pad: “copper light from the setting sun paint the confession booth’s lattice” carries time, color, and symbolic map in one sweep. Mixed-metaphor risk in “hover-carved itself into the wood” is brief and justified by supernatural premise. Rhythm breathes: longer image bursts tighten into single-line testimony punch. Minor scaffold: “lived” appears twice in two sentences mid-story; doesn’t obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inverts the folklore scapegoat tale by making the wolf-boy’s child the only believer of truth; fresh moral calculus. Setting-as-recording-device (lattice) repurposes maritime wreck into archive of voices, a concrete invention. Hovering as hereditary witness body literalizes “being above lies” without allegory. Risk in merging fable with ritual murder pays off because copper-light final image fuses both registers into earned mythic chill.</comment>
