<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet’s century-spanning insomnia is embodied through charcoal-scrawled walls and cracked lullabies; her renunciation of flower-grenades and embrace of “photosynthetic pain” supply a credible, visible cost. Interior contradiction is lyrically rendered yet causally thin—no single moment forces her to risk something she treasures. The final stance of perpetual teaching is Earned Stasis, but the absence of a tangible opposing pressure keeps motivation just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the postcard’s pinhole constellations become a Conceptual Repricing that reweights damage as illumination. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“calcium spirals caught echoes of centuries past”) and pays off in the closure image. The cost is palpable—“the galaxy postcard has nearly dissolved”—yet its essence now permeates the shell, foreclosing the path back to weaponized beauty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shell’s mother-of-pirl corridors, wind-tuned acoustics, and reef-shadow twilight constrain every creative act; the postcard’s fraying paper literally filters starlight to cast new constellations that charge the final image. Specificity is selective—no tourist catalog—yet tactile handling of charcoal, crystallized music, and fossilized forgiveness keeps the world lived-in. Environment materially shapes tactics and final illumination, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform pain into nutrients—tightens via accretion: each newcomer adds shrapnel-tears to the greenhouse until the shell glows with “reconciliations that glowed in the dark.” No external antagonist, but the armistice’s credibility is tested by centuries of arrivals; the price is the postcard’s dissolution and the poet’s perpetual sleepless vigil. A single meaningful deepening, not a reversal, reweights the stake with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the slow accretion of broken notes into nourishing harmony; no character moralizes. The returning postcard, first found then star-pierced, reweights “collisions can be slow waltzes” into a resonant non-literal answer: even approaching disasters become dance partners if you absorb their light. Complexity is honored—pain is not denied but metabolized—earning wisdom without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice owns reef-shadow diction, calcium-spiral syntax, and insomnia cadence that never drifts into committee prose. Patterned elision (“shyly, unstoppably”) is taught early and paid off in the final half-lullaby. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature remains singular and rhythmic under pressure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from reef-shadow compression to star-pinhole brevity; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (flower-grenades, crystallized music) advances the photosynthetic rule-set. Information density stays high without purple overload; only hairline slips keep it from 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Blossom armistice and pain-photosynthesis synthesize familiar pacifist tropes into an organic, non-oblique system where beauty literally feeds on sorrow. The gargantuan shell as eternal greenhouse, postcard as star-filter, and cracked lullabies as spores feel inevitable yet unexampled. Risk-taking—centuries-long arc in 700 words—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting the bonus.</comment>
