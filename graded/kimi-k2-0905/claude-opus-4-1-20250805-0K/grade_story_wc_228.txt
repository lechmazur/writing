<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s “intimately aloof” stance is dramatized in the first beat—she sets up away from the quay bustle—and is re-paid in the cave when solitude becomes genetic legacy. The contradiction (tender/distant) is held in embodied gesture, not label. The final micro-choice—placing her own shell—earns the grandmother’s renunciation as an inherited cost. Only the grandmother remains off-page, so status/relationship crucible is N/A; no causality break.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: placing the new shell reweights forty-three years of quay paintings as the same practice of “loving completely while letting go.” Cost is legible in the cracked mirror image and the solitary walk home carrying a secret. Causal lens dominates: wrong turn → cave discovery → shell placed. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phosphorescent algae and tide-smoothed passages are economically selected, never catalogued. The cave walls act as both archive and constraint—shelves determine where shells rest, charging the final placement. Body-as-setting appears in trembling fingers opening the journal. No spatial drift; geography remains coherent as Marina back-tracks the same path out.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to love impermanence—tightens once: the cave reveal redefines her lifelong quay ritual as the same practice. Agency is present; she chooses to walk past the harbor and later paints a new shell. Cost is conceptual but felt: she accepts perpetual solitude as the price of honoring transience. Coincidence (the wrong turn) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shell motif’s double valence—souvenir for others, relic for self—without explicit thesis. The cracked mirror re-prices “breaking” as revelation, not damage. Final image of sound-in-shell offers resonant, non-literal answer: presence-through-absence. No moralizing sentence closes the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter: “her movements both tender and distant” fuses physical and emotional distance. Syntax lengthens in reflective passages, shortens in cave discovery—rhythm mirrors attention. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within coastal painter’s lexicon. Dialogue absent; no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between susurrus cadence (“spiraling into shadow”) and crisp beats (“She pulled out her paints”). No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; vehicles stay maritime. Information density high: single sentence at mirror crack sets forty-three-year habit and present fracture. Closing shell-image compresses legacy, grief, joy into one stripe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Familiar trope—hidden ancestor archive—gains freshness via shell-as-day rather than photograph-as-day, fitting coastal painter culture. Transformation test passes: rename Marina “Jane” and setting “mountain cabin” and the shell logic collapses. Risk in lyric compression succeeds; no gimmick. Minor deduction for echo of “artist discovers secret legacy” template.</comment>
