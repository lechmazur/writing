<comment>Silas’s insomnia-born vocation and quiet mortuary competence are lived-in from line 1; every beat (hand tremor, grief-bubble dive, salt-water embalming of books) grows from the same weary spine. The final renunciation—staying below to bury civilizations so he can finally sleep—pays off every prior micro-choice and carries a felt cost: he forfeits the surface world. Interiority stays concrete (“grief-bubble diving bell” vs. therapy speak) and contradiction is constant (fear vs. compulsion). No label-only emotion; embodiment and flaw drive the plot.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is airtight: package → lens coordinates → impossible descent → library as morgue → Silas reframes lens into reverse-lighthouse that lets knowledge die. Each because/therefore hinge tightens options until the climax replaces light with shadow-sleep. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: he writes the farewell note, abdicating his prior life. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sensory selection mirrors insomnia: brine reek, humming glass, “breathable grief” bubble—every detail is filtered through undertaker bias and occupation tools. The underwater library’s spatial logic (floating books, coral mausoleums) is tactile and consistent; bodies track cleanly as Silas installs funereal architecture. Lens and salt-water rituals constrain later tactics and charge the final “shadow of earned sleep” image. No static postcard lists; each descriptor advances stakes or mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Silas find rest by giving rest—signals early and escalates via each impossible pressure increase (depth, Sleepless Librarians, centuries of unread finales). Agency remains his: he decides to descend, decides to treat books as corpses, decides to stay. The visible price is forfeiture of surface life and acceptance of perpetual under-librarian vigil; final image reweights “rest” from personal need to civilizational service. One meaningful tightening suffices; lens-as-diving-bell mechanic pays off causally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without assertion: undertaker who buries the living (knowledge) so the dead (civilizations) can sleep reframes mortality itself. Subtext inverts lighthouse trope—guiding toward darkness, not away—culminating in Conceptual Repricing where “silence bloomed like funeral flowers.” No final-paragraph sermon; resonance arises from specific salt-water rites and grief-bubble physics. Counter-reading possible: is Silas now another unread final page? Complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Silas’s perceptual filter: “accumulated sorrow… he could inhabit” is idiosyncratic diction, not generic. Compression (“time moved differently…”) is brief, taught by pattern of collapsing days, and pays off in closure stillness. No head-hopping; librarians’ collective “we’ve been waiting” is external observation only. Syntax lengthens underwater, then fragments at climax, mirroring pressure release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: “rainbow ghosts across his workspace” does triple sensory/image/foreshadow job. One metaphor cluster near lens-repair beat risks purple (“crystallized into something he could inhabit”) but pattern is taught and later echoed. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for descent, staccato for transformation climax. No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacks; high information-to-word ratio maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of undertaker craft with cosmic archival apocalypse feels inevitable yet unexampled. Lighthouse-as-prism-of-consciousness is a fresh inflection that reweights the entire genre of drowned cities. Specificity (coral mausoleums, salt-water embalming of codices) prevents abstract “dying civilization” trope from becoming generic. Risk—letting protagonist abandon surface world—pays off in Earned Stasis with undeniable cost.</comment>
