<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. aching identification with the letters—drives every tactile micro-choice (kissing the strip, tucking it into her coat). The final theft is earned: her fingers have been confessing for her all night. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is waived; her conflict with the building-as-confessor is sufficient. Embodied emotion (“tasting silver and salt”) keeps diagnostic label-speak absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she walks out carrying the strip, cost crystallized in the deliberate breach of contract (“Some things were too sacred for demolition”). Accumulative lens holds: each goodbye letter layers density until the final reweighting. Orientation anchored by 60 words; no teleporting props. Causality intact: because she feels the letters, therefore she steals the film, foreclosing her professional future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The booth’s brass, dust, and celluloid are handled, not catalogued; the northwest corner, ceiling, and floor are mapped as emotional coordinates that later justify her decision. The film strip itself functions as micro-setting—its brittleness constrains her gentle touch and motivates the theft. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s psychometric bias: temperature and taste over visuals. Spatial choreography remains coherent across her slow rotation in the booth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the letters will survive—signaled in paragraph 3. Pressure escalates by accretion: each unsent goodbye narrows her professional detachment until the single option remains: steal the strip. No coincidence; the building’s stored grief is the antagonist. Cost is legible: she forfeits her clearance report and paycheck the moment the strip disappears into her coat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—archived love demands witness—emerges from the accretion of voices, never abstract assertion. The final image of seeds waiting to bloom reweights the earlier “incubator” metaphor without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: the kiss on the film is communion, not explanation. Ambiguity remains: we do not know if Vera will ever screen the letters, only that she could not let them die.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature: Art Deco curves “catching shadows like cupped hands” is hers, not tourist décor. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences under low light, then clipped final paragraph mirroring her exit. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated within psychometric beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—one sustained metaphor of incubator/photograph chemistry that pays off in the seed-closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop spotted (“goodbye letters” restated twice in adjacent lines mid-story) but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—psychometric reader auditing a doomed projection booth—feels fresh yet inevitable. The goodbye letters embedded in celluloid transform a familiar urban-ruin story into a love-archive rescue. Risk taken: no on-screen human counterpart, yet emotional stakes stay high. Specificity of 1967 leader tape and Tuesday matinee seat anchors universals in irreplaceable detail.</comment>
