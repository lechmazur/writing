<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s pacifist identity is shown through her obsessive, tactile craft—tuning dials, archiving silences—rather than labels; her contradictory urge to “fight with frequency” gives her texture. The micro-choice to nudge the dial one last decimal place crystallizes her hierarchy of values: grandmother’s voice over civic explosion. Interiority stays concrete (“She touched the pages with reverent fingers”) and avoids therapy-speak. What keeps her from 8.8+ is the absence of a visible flaw that complicates the climax; her competence is too frictionless, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary opens with a sung note that reweights every prior silence-catalogue into an inheritance of pacifist listening. Causal chain holds—each frequency scan tightens options until only the communal hush of pre-midnight fits the lock. Orientation is secure by line 4 (“tin roof caught starlight”). Cost is legible in the final image: Mara begins transcribing, surrendering her observer stance to become transmitter, inheriting the grandmother’s ethical workload. The −0.3 penalty is for a slight late lens ambiguity: the story toys with Accumulative texture early but pivots to Causal at the end without teaching the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The workshop’s starlit tin roof and vibrating copper dials are not backdrop but instrument: their acoustic response constrains every tuning move Mara makes. Micro-setting (the diary’s brass clasp) doubles as antagonist—its resonance threshold literally blocks access until the city’s collective hush aligns. Spatial choreography is flawless; objects never teleport. The final gold-green firelight washes the pages, charging the image with conceptual cost: knowledge now demands dissemination. Slight over-description of Victorian music boxes stalls momentum for one beat, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover grandmother’s pacifist silence-archive before fireworks rupture the night. Escalation is Accumulative: each failed frequency narrows the audible field until only the civic pause remains. Agency stays tactile—every dial twist is a decision that spends time, the one non-renewable resource tonight. The tightening is meaningful, but the visible price (time passing) is generic; no prop or relationship is permanently forfeited, so the cost pulse stops just short of the 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shift in object value: clasp from barrier to bridge, silence from absence to medium of empathy. No character moralizes; the final line (“recovered transmission from a woman who’d found peace in the pauses of war”) lets the reader reprice silence itself. Subtext operates in gesture—Mara’s headphones become a confession of solitude she must abandon to share the diary. Thematic echo is avoided; “the path to empathy” appears only inside the diary, not as authorial sermon. Ambiguity lingers: will broadcasting these silences stop any actual war? The refusal to answer deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mara’s sensorium: star-coins on tin, lavender and gunpowder scent, the tremor of leather under pulse. Rhythm mirrors tuning act—long voweled sentences for sweep, staccato fragments for clicks. No head-hops. Lexicon (“amplitude,” “ceasefire,” “transmitter”) is justified by her radio-builder expertise. One filter-verb cluster (“she understood suddenly”) is permissible at epiphany; it is paid off by immediate physical reaction. Voice is distinctive, but a single overwritten line (“theatrical sincerity of new beginnings”) dips below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical without algorithmic monotony; sentence lengths swell and contract like breath. Information density is high—one sentence often does scenery, tool function, and emotional tilt (“Static crackled like distant applause”). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. The single scaffold sentence (“She would catalog this too…”) is purposeful, announcing future ethic, not filler. Minor cadence echo (“the hush of… the hush of…”) is patterned repetition that pays off in choral effect at climax, thus exempt from penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of radio-tinker, Victorian resonance lock, and communal fireworks pause is fresh, not a checklist. The insight that pacifism can weaponize frequency rather than refuse technology feels non-obvious. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, because the specificity of Tibetan bowls versus military radios is what charges the theme. Risk—using a lyric tech-explanation without exposition—succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure reprises it. Slight deduction for near-echo of “spaces between gunshots” which recalls Hemingway without full reinvention.</comment>
