<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marlowe’s obsession with “variant allegiance” is dramatized through her risky ritual of storm-broadcasting; the moment she tilts the panel into rain while gear screams shows a credibly self-endangering micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete (“tomorrow tastes like copper and rebellion”) without therapy-speak. The final earned stasis—she smiles knowing she’ll never meet the Prophet yet midwifes him—pays the cost of lifelong solitude. Flaw: no contradictory impulse on the page; she never hesitates or explores what she forfeits beyond loneliness, so the arc is slightly monochrome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the Prophet’s first words re-weight every prior transmission, crystallizing her sacrifice with undeniable conceptual cost (“the old world ends…listen for the new song”). The accumulative/textural lens holds—pattern of signal density → pattern break at dawn. Orientation is taught early by cobalt resonance and celestial perch, waived at close when dawn clouds literalize the “new song.” No meaningful escalation flaw; the single deepening suffices for 700-word cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt portico doubles as micro-setting that constrains every move: it resonates, slices rain, casts “cerulean shadows that bent impossibly,” and finally frames dawn. Sensory hierarchy matches radio-tuned attention—sound before sight, static before storm. Spatial choreography is clean: panel opened, water admitted, gear placement unchanged. One minor over-color moment—“golden clouds” verges on palette cliché, but shadow-bending image recharges it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will her transmissions birth the epoch she’ll never enter—tightens when dawn signal proves success but also seals her exile. Under accumulative lens, the cadence shift from scattered fragments to synchronous global hum re-weights cost: she gains cosmic agency, loses human future. No swappable antagonist needed; storm & static serve as coherent pressure. Price (irreversible solitude) is legible in her smile that forecloses meeting the Prophet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular: “variant allegiance” to a future one can never inhabit. Subtext in the humming cobalt and children’s phone calls implies inter-generational transfer without stating it. Final image reframes earlier “ancient shadows” as tools for dawn, avoiding moral. No echo-line articulates thesis, so no deduction. Minor abstraction in “reality’s origami creases” but image is brief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: radio-operator diction (“107.3 FM,” “Fibonacci sequences translated into morse”) fused with mythic register (“smoke through history’s lungs”). Rhythm accelerates into fragmented clauses as static thickens, then breathes at dawn. No head-hop; distance stable. Clean filter-verb allowance when voice-motivated (“she caught glimpses”). Dialogue absent by design—appropriate for monastic technician.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence length, purposeful enjambment, sonic repetition mirrors subject. Figurative density high but patterned early (“cobalt glass sang”) so payoff at dawn feels earned. One metaphor muddle: “electromagnetic echoes of collapsed stars” is physically off—collapsed stars emit gravity waves, not radio—but error is obscure and does not touch closure. No synonym loops or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of ham-radio tech with Arthurian prophecy feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk of overwritten mysticism is embraced but controlled through concrete operator details. Synthesis of Celtic burial songs, Tuvan throat singing, and FM static creates memorable specificity. Concept of “variant allegiance” to an epoch one cannot enter offers non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation test fails if relocated—tone & stakes tied to cobalt portico and high-altitude static.</comment>
