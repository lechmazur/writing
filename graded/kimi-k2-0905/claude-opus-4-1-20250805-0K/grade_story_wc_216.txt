<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s “borrowed-time” status is vivid—he registers duration as “rough sandpaper of anxiety… silk of contentment”—but his arc is almost entirely internal realization, with no micro-choice that visibly costs him. The epiphany that he must teach others is told, not dramatized; we never see him decide or renounce anything under pressure. Because the climax is summary, the emotional cost feels abstract rather than embodied. Interiority is strong, but the absence of a paid, fork-in-the-road moment caps the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reframes time from countable to tactile, and the emerald silo reappears as “lighthouse for those who could no longer navigate by numbered days.” Causality is loose—accumulative/textural lens—but the pattern is taught early and the ending reweights it. Orientation is met by word 80; no penalty. The missing beat is an on-page decision that costs Marcus now; the realization is retrospective, so the cost is conceptual rather than lived, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s “crystalline walls” and the urn fragment’s “porcelain surface etched with equations that seemed to shift and breathe” are tactile, charged objects that constrain Marcus’s understanding and final purpose. Micro-setting dominates—no broader geography—yet the silo’s resonance and the fragment’s warmth directly shape the closing image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: touch > sight > sound, matching the POV’s synesthetic time-sense. The objects earn the 9+ gate by charging the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early—“he’d been searching for seventeen cycles”—and deepen when the fragment rewires his mission. Pressure is textural: each garage-sale ad tightens the conspiracy, but no forked choice narrows Marcus’s live options; he remains observer, not actor. Escalation is pattern-build rather than causal turn, coherent under the accumulative lens. A visible price (lost certainty, physical toll, social risk) never materializes on-page, capping the tension below the 8.0 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the shift from numeric to felt time is dramatized through texture-metaphors and the silo’s final lighthouse image, avoiding thesis statements. The garage-sale cipher is a fresh, sly critique of consumer ephemera as archival resistance. Final image reweights prior ads—“the texture is the message”—delivering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Complexity is honored: no cosy restoration of chronology, only adaptation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays cleanly inside Marcus’s synesthetic register: “sticky tar of grief,” “emerald frequency.” No filter-verb clusters; diction stays within a man who feels time as surface. Rhythm swells purposefully toward the final lighthouse cadence. Voice is distinctive enough to lift the piece to high-band territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong noun-verb pairs—“titanium shell had cracked like an egg”—and只有少数几处叠句式回环（如“time’s texture”重复两次）但均服务于累积模式，不损冲力。无混用隐喻，物理逻辑自洽。结尾句节拍减速，与认知转变同步。无模板化开句，段落长度变化有目的。接近9级，仅因中段有两处相邻句轻微同义回转（“he understood… he could feel”）扣0.2，仍保持高密清晰度。</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The garage-sale-ad-as-time-capsule conceit is brilliantly specific, turning junk commerce into clandestine chronometry. Synesthetic time-feel reframes a well-worn apocalypse into intimate phenomenology. Risky accumulative structure pays off in final lighthouse reconfiguration. Feels inevitable yet fresh in hindsight; no obvious genre templates or borrowed scenes.</comment>
