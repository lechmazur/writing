<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei’s contradictory drives—beauty-maker vs. document-destroyer—collide in the moment she lets both forgeries burn; the embodied tremor of blood on the thorn makes her renunciation kinesthetic and costly. Interiority never lectures; instead, the ink’s smell and marble’s cold keep her guilt sensory. The chain of inherited vengeance is broken by a single, irreversible micro-choice whose price (her exposed life) is legible before she climbs the stairs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lattice is flawless: because her brother forgave, therefore she refuses to forge; because the key warms, therefore the altar reveals the counter-inscription; because all forgeries become ash, therefore her authentic confession becomes the only surviving document. Each link tightens the next under a single scene, one transition (stairs-to-dawn), and a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights “treason” into truth. Closure beat lands with visible cost: her blood on the thorn and the key abandoned—persistent constraints that will shape pursuit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The translucent marble ceiling literally refracts her options—green aurora light = false seals, pearl twilight = truth—so environment dictates tactics. The dripping stalactites supply a diegetic clock that syncs with her pulse, forcing the decision before dawn. The altar’s hidden key-slot is the micro-setting that converts sanctuary from backdrop to active co-conspirator. Final image: she emerges into pearl sky—setting re-prices her prior life as forgery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—brother’s life—tightens once: from “I can save him by lying” to “I will save him by telling the truth.” The reversal is driven solely by her agency (burning the two perfected forgeries) and carries an undeniable price (her skills, safety, family legacy). No coincidence; the Emperor’s suspicion is pre-established, so the final confession merely swaps the mechanism, not the jeopardy. Cost is visible: ash on marble = career and heritage erased.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ash itself: calibrated treason mutates into calibrated honesty. The rose thorn’s centuries of blood oaths invert when her blood seals a confession instead of a lie. No final moral—just the image of aurora fading to pearl, implying that truth is also a spectrum. Subtextual irony: the only authentic document she ever produces is her own destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined; “aurora’s green dance” and “inkstone had served her dual life” compress two worlds into one sensory line. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fragments as the lamp flares—“ash that settled like snow”—mirroring her exhalation of guilt. No head-hopping; focalization stays latched to Mei’s calligrapher’s eye, noticing brush-strokes in stalactites. Register never drifts into academic; diction remains within a craftsman’s poetic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence either advances stakes or re-images the marble/aurora interface. Metaphors are coherent—“water finding new channels” foreshadows the confession rerouting history. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are kinetic (“pressed,” “drew,” “climbed”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges “pearl twilight” motif. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates across the burn-beat, then slows into dawn egress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Forged-document thriller meets aurora-lit sanctuary: fresh synthesis. The “key with no lock” trope is transformed into a literal marble cipher that catalyzes thematic inversion. Risky reliance on lyric accumulation pays off because closure image is unmistakable. Specificity of calligrapher’s tools and Confucian blood-oath thorn keeps it from feeling like generic fantasy.</comment>
