<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s veteran calm and micro-adjustments feel lived-in; his own back-story is efficiently seeded through the vial and late confession, giving the passenger’s arc a credible mirror. The woman’s shift from rigid to receptive is tracked through embodied detail (knuckles, shoulders, breathing) rather than labels. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc leans more instructive than internally torn, but the final smile is proportionate and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as “Earned Stasis”: Marcus’s quiet navigation forecloses his own isolation model and gifts the passenger a usable silence; cost is felt in the admission “I was once a passenger too.” Causal linkage holds: every terrace modulation is because-of atmospheric pressure read through the vial, therefore gondola speed changes. Orientation is immediate; world-rules (sound refraction, vial reliability) are taught early and pay off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Drifting prism terrace” is never dumped; we learn it piece-by-piece via Marcus’s practiced ear and cable tension, anchoring spatial logic inside action. Sensory hierarchy obeys occupation: sound angles matter more than visuals, aligning with acoustic-tourism premise. The storm glass vial and humming cables function as micro-setting, directly constraining his minute tilts; without them the final cadence dissolves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes—deliver silence that comforts rather than attacks—are declared early and tightened through each acoustic pocket; passenger’s shallow breathing supplies live feedback. One meaningful deepening occurs at Mirror Gallery where delayed echo reframes prior fear into lullaby. Cost is present but gentle: Marcus exposes his own past vulnerability; passenger risks trusting a stranger’s sound-craft. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: silence as curated presence, not void. Subtext lives in gesture—tilt of gondola, slowed breath—never in thesis statements. The train-whistle echo returning as lullaby offers a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: peace is learned attunement, not escape.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax is calm, metric, mirroring a gondolier’s rhythm; occasional lyric lift (“vaulting hush”) is earned by established acoustic metaphors. Dialogue is minimal but modulated: Marcus’s first question is calibrated to “barely disturb the air,” showing professional POV filtering. No filter-verb clusters; prose breathes with scene cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density—each sentence handles sound physics, emotional tracking, and world detail simultaneously. Metaphors are consistent (light-bending, sound-bending) without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected (“silence isn’t absence. It’s presence...”) but it serves instructor function and is paid off by echo reveal. Rhythm varies: longer sentences for drift, clipped fragments for pressure shifts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Acoustic tourism via floating glass terraces feels fresh; premise is more than ornament, generating plot beats. Storm-glass-as-barometer and sound-delay platforms are specific enough to resist generic swap. Emotional core—teaching silence—avores cliched noise = bad / silence = good binary by showing silence can also overwhelm. Slight risk in lyric instruction mode, but specificity of terraces keeps it from sliding into self-help allegory.</comment>
