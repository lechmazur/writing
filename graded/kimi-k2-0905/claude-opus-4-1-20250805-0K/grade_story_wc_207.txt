<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s motives—petrichor collector, psychometry seeker, granddaughter—interlock cleanly and drive every micro-choice; her refusal to step through the wall in the final beat crystallizes a hierarchy of values that has been embodied, not declared. Interiority is tactile and mineral-damp, never diagnostic: “her collection vials clinking softly against her hip” is both body and identity. The compass vision sequence dramatizes contradictory impulses (stay/surrender) in-scene, not in summary. Cost is visible: she climbs out “breathing factory dust,” vial warm, path foreclosed—Earned Stasis with limestone breath still in her lungs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the lagoon wall shimmers, the vial is full, and the option to follow Hartley remains open but priced—cost is legible in the compass’s wild spin and the factory dust she re-inhales. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of scent → memory → portal is taught by 25 % and tightens once when the lagoon glow intensifies. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“limestone cliffs”) and never falters. No causal reversals are required; the single deepening (petrichor from “not quite Earth”) reweights the dominant stake. Persistent constraint: the vial she carries is now radioactive with impossible rain—this object will shape future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is not backdrop; its phosphorescent algae dictates the only light Vera sees and therefore what she can decide (“mirror-still surface” vs. “shimmering wall”). Spatial choreography is exact: descent → narrow throat → sudden chamber → kneel → fill vial; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy is collector-biased: scent > sight > touch; the air is “mineral dampness,” the vial “warm against her chest,” the rain-memory “cosmic.” Factory-above / cave-below polarity lends social context to her eccentric profession without exposition. The lagoon’s glow literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access trans-dimensional petrichor—tightens once when the compass spins and the wall begins to shimmer, narrowing her options to stay or go. Agency is preserved: she chooses to sample first, preparing rather than fleeing, so the cost is deferred but felt (the warm vial). No antagonist is needed; the environment is the pressure engine. The refusal to pass through is a credible endurance that forecloses nothing cheaply—she trades immediate transcendence for knowledge, a visible price for a “sensibly eccentric” mind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific stakes of collection vs. surrender; “where explanations fail” is never sloganized but enacted when language breaks against the scent of alien rain. The final image of Vera breathing “factory dust and ordinary air” reweights the premise: the mundane is now the threshold, not the opposite of transcendence. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader cannot tell if she’s braver or more cowardly for waiting, and the story refuses to judge. No moral is declared; the vial’s warmth is the only argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, sentences lengthening like stalactites, then compressing under pressure (“She uncorked a vial with trembling fingers”). Diction stays within a collector-naturalist lexicon—phosphorescent, psychometry, petrichor—never drifting into purple. Perceptual signature is scent-first: “limestone held their breath,” “earth’s whispers,” “cosmic rain,” all filtered through Vera’s trained nose. No dialogue, so compression and rhythm carry subtext; the final sentence’s moonlit emergence reads as exhale after held breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean despite lyricism: no filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“stone throat,” “frozen rain”—each image sustains physical logic. Information density is high; single sentences deliver setting, motive, and sensory hit (“She had waited three months for the textile factory above to finally close…”). Clause variation keeps momentum; no template cadence detected. Copy-clean: tense stable, pronouns unambiguous, opening and final lines frame and resolve by image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—petrichor as inter-dimensional key—feels fresh yet inevitable given the collector’s vocation; no prior story combines scent-mining, psychometry, and portal refusal in limestone caves. Risk is taken by refusing the portal in the finale, yet the story trusts the reader to feel the cost of patience. Specific detail anchors novelty: Hartley expedition of 1892, factory timeline, phosphorescent algae species. Transformation test fails—this plot needs Vera’s exact nose and vial; swap any element and the shimmer collapses. Slight deduction for echo of “thin places” trope, but cave-as-hinge is re-geologized through scent science.</comment>
