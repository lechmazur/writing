<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's involuntary honesty and her motivation to protect the bees are clear and embodied; her micro-choice to broadcast the confession costs her the secrecy she cherishes. Interiority stays specific ("the words tasted wrong"). The final renunciation—stepping into the open as thief-savior—carries visible cost. Secondary citizens are more witness than crucible, so relationship pressure is light, but her single-POV arc meets the length-appropriate standard.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → drone death → secret apiary → confession. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when). Closure is a Decisive Change: Mira publicly claims the theft and the bees, foreclosing anonymity with city-wide witness. Felt cost is explicit: "I’m a thief and a liar… I suppose I’m just a thief." No teleporting props; lacquer box and honeycomb are causally linked throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tower, glass chamber, and lacquer box are tactile, specific, and pressure the choices: the tower’s siphoned electricity keeps the chamber alive; the box’s warmth cues the reveal. Sensory detail is selective ("copper coils still warm", "wings catching the dusk light"). The chamber constrains the final broadcast—without it, no evidence—satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean up 700 steps and back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the last bees and the city’s food chain—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when Mira realizes the drones are dead and her secret is now the only pollinator path; her broadcast closes every escape route. Cost is legible: loss of secrecy, potential prosecution. Agency drives every beat; no coincidences resolve. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: artificial vs. natural pollination, honesty as sting before healing. The final image—bees indifferent to human drama—reweights the premise: survival is smaller and larger than politics. No moralizing sermon; the "sweetness" idea returns as honey-thick confession without authorial thesis. Ambiguity lingers: will city forgive her? Complexity earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptions; no head-hop. Voice is textured: "nectar-sweet evening air", "broken promises" feels like her poetic idiom, not writerly flourish. Syntax modulates with heart-rate—short clauses during climb, longer during revelation. Dialogue minimal but natural; citizen speech is plain counterpoint. No filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean, varied rhythm; no template cadence or loops. Metaphors ("wings… liquid gold") are sparse, coherent, and serve moment. Information density high—one sentence often does two jobs: "The lightning that the tower collected hadn’t just powered the city—she’d been siphoning traces…" No overwriting in peak beats. Proofing clean. Opening and final lines are crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bee-apocalypse meets honesty curse. Lightning tower as secret apiary is novel and inevitable in hindsight. Trope of last-natural-hive is transformed through siphoned utility power and toll-booth theft. Risk—public confession of crime—heightens stakes without gimmick. Specificity (lacquer box warmth, drone corpses) keeps concept from abstraction. Vision feels singular, not prompt-chopped.</comment>
