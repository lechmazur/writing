<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s endurance as “voice in the darkness” is credibly rooted in her flood trauma and grandmother relic; the renunciation to stay is felt. Interior contradiction—longing to migrate vs duty to guide—is dramatized, not told. Micro-choices (bracing the bronze foot against crank while whispering star-paths) embody hierarchy of values. Flaw (waning-strength) complicates every physical beat; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: broken hydraulics → manual crank → midnight calls → brother rescue attempt; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation anchors (who=patchwork navigator, where=starlit signal station, when=post-flood night) land before 120 words. Closure is Earned Stasis: she abjures migration, cost = perpetual exile as lighthouse keeper; bronze warmth on lap makes price visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting pressure is live: immobilized radio array forces hand-cranking; poisoned corridor dictates nocturnal timing; waning moon saps strength. Bronze censer foot operates as micro-setting/tool hybrid—its weight, patina, inherited prayer constrain each crank. Sensory triage (metallic scrape, satellite shadow, sulfur stench) filters through POV bias. Final image of bronze held like “living thing” reweights prior temple lore.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shepherd the reverse migrants vs personal pull home—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation: each call increases jeopardy (child, brother at sulfur fields) while her waning strength lowers capacity. Tightening: third call forces her to confess she once walked the lethal path, narrowing advice to lived truth. Cost legible: perpetual exile + bodily depletion; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific paradox: Earth’s dying soil genetically summons its refugees to die on ancestral ground. Subtext in salt-in-pocket trick, satellite-shadow evasion—folk wisdom against techno-collapse. No moralizing; final line offers quiet vow, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: her guidance may still fail, keeping tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Marina’s synesthetic perception; diction (“patchwork navigator,” “geography of loss”) is idiosyncratic yet coherent. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she could hardly lift”) not obscuring. Compression taught early (“sewn herself back together”) pays off in final “stitched together from loss and duty.” Dialogue sparse, natural under radio static.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: “bronze foot…anchor her while she worked” performs three jobs—prop, character anchor, metaphor. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for fatigue, staccato for call-and-response. No mixed metaphors; figurals (“cells sang with terrible longing”) are singular and apt. Zero loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reverse migration as genetic homing device is fresh twist on cli-fi exodus. Combining ham-radio folk navigation with inherited temple bronze marries tech and spirit without kitsch. Risk of lyric ellipsis accepted and paid off in coherent closure. Specificity of sulfur fields, salt trick, satellite shadows prevents generic dystopia repaint.</comment>
