<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kessa’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the cracked Threshold and the hunger to understand rather than atone—are dramatized in trembling fingers, driftwood markers, and the risky new song. Interiority stays concrete (“seed of light settled warm behind her sternum”) and avoids therapeutic self-labeling. The micro-choice to play the braiding song instead of the sealing song visibly costs her the safety of inherited dogma and earns the translucent figure’s trust, completing an earned shift from guardian to bridge-maker. No second character is on-page, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the solitary focus holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the seed-of-light gift reweights the guardianship premise—threshold becomes doorway—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior but coherent: because she failed, therefore she experiments; because she experiments, therefore she receives the seed. Driftwood markers, canyon hush, and flute notes accumulate into a cadence shift that crystallizes new cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Thunder-echo range,” “Kessa uncased”), satisfying the early-anchor rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The range’s “avalanchingly quiet” silence is not backdrop but antagonist—it swallows echo and forces her into visual markers and tactile flute vibration. Driftwood pieces function as micro-setting: they constrain her return path and later become the message system to the Other Place. The shimmering air at the canyon floor is sketched with one precise contradiction (“heat waves in winter”) that immediately guides her song choice. Final image—the mountains’ whispered benediction—recharges the opening silence with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—harvest insight from her own failure—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when she swaps sealing song for braiding song, trading safety for unknown contact. Escalation is accumulative: each note increases inter-world permeability until the translucent figure appears, narrowing her option to retreat. Cost is visible: she accepts the seed behind her sternum, a permanent alteration that “finally, truly” begins her keeper role. No coincidence resolves the beat; her agency alone reconfigures the threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of wall vs. weave: the flute was “a choreographer’s baton,” not a trowel. Subtext lives in gesture—the figure points at driftwood, wordlessly validating her mapped safe line. No character voices the moral; the final image of doorway-threshold is a resonant non-literal answer. The seed’s placement behind the sternum physically embeds the thematic cost inside her body.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate locks to Kessa’s perceptual signature—sound swallowed, gold threads seen peripherally, silence as presence. Syntax mirrors mounting pressure: longer sentences while climbing, clipped fragments during the weave. No dialogue appears, so naturalism tests are waived. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“gauze,” “baton,” “braiding”) and avoids academic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose carries high density: one sentence does setting, backstory, and emotional charge (“The mountains remembered her failure in their avalanchingly quiet way”). Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“avalanchingly quiet” recurs with payoff—avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each driftwood mention advances spatial or symbolic work. Final line achieves echo without repetition fatigue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise flips standard portal-guardian trope into collaborative choreography; the gilded reed flute as dance-master’s baton feels specific and non-obvious. Risk is taken—solitary scene, lyric silence, no villain—yet coherence holds. The driftwood-message mechanic is a fresh micro-invention that could not swap out without breaking logic. Transformation test: replace mountains with desert and the silence-echo mechanic collapses, confirming locale-locked originality.</comment>
