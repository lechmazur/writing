<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile communion with the lamp burner, the angle-tilt ritual—but the “fractal weaver” gift is asserted more than dramatized; we see beautiful outputs, not the moment-to-moment struggle of splitting/reforming that would reveal contradictory impulses. The collected weights are poetic, yet no micro-choice shows her wavering between adding one more burden versus hurling one away, so the renunciation at the end feels pre-destined rather than earned under pressure. The 17 g of brass is a lovely specificity, but its heaviness is told (“grew heavier each time”) rather than felt through a tremor, sweat, or dropped stitch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the crystallized fractal re-weights her world, making the cost of staying legible (“some prisons we weave ourselves”). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern intensify until meaning reconfigures—and the final image satisfies that lens. Orientation is swift: bronze grotto, starlight, snowmelt seams all appear by line 3. One causality hiccup: “objects remembered their purposes” is asserted rather than shown (the burner warms without fuel), a micro-break but not fatal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The bronze grotto is not backdrop but acoustic chamber: its oxidation patterns and recursive walls literally shape her weavings and trap the sound of whale-song hush. Micro-setting rule satisfied—grotto vertices and starlight angle constrain her bodily orientation and thus the success of the calcifying pattern. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices chill metal, suspended droplets, shingled hush, all filtered through a woman who once cleaned kerosene soot. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no teleporting props.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—collecting versus releasing the weight of burdens—arrives early (“each pattern she wove was a burden made visible”). Escalation is textural: each added calcified rib thickens the silence until the walls themselves begin to sing, tightening the acoustic pressure. No visible price is extracted on the page (she loses no blood, drops no stitch, forfeits no escape route), so the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it from the 8.8+ band. Still, the final image narrows her options: she will wake and begin again, the cycle now legibly a prison.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the accumulation of sorrow becomes its own architecture, and architecture becomes fate. The whale-bone reverie offers a non-literal answer—she holds “the weight of weightlessness itself,” a paradox that re-prisons and frees. No moral is stated; the lamp burner’s cooling in her palm is the quiet verdict. Minor abstraction drag in “burden of mountains dreaming” keeps it just shy of 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is relentlessly particular: “shingled hush of overlapping dimensions,” “prehistoric patience,” “seventeen grams of oxidized brass”—diction precise, rhythm tidal like the breathing ribs. Perceptual signature is fractal: every observation shards into smaller reflections, mirroring her gift. No dialogue, so no register clash; no head-hopping; tense stable. Under peak pressure the syntax compresses—“Seventeen grams, plus the weight of starlight on bronze, plus the burden of knowing”—without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; each sentence layer-adds like the calcifying fractal itself. Occasional modifier stacks (“something between mathematics and mourning”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful to the textural lens. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase pair: “almost solid, almost real” could fuse to “nearly tangible,” a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit—sorrow has literal grams and can be knit into recursive bronze ribs—is non-obvious and fully committed to; no excerpt could swap “fractal” for “tapestry” without collapse. The lighthouse-keeper riff could have been derivative but is transformed through her father’s mis-belief about light pushing dark. Risk lies in the lyric stasis, yet it heightens rather than obscures the prison effect. Fresh inflection: the grotto itself accumulates centuries of other weavers’ weights, turning setting into co-author.</comment>
