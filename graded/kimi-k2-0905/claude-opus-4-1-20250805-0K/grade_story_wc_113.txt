<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s solitary obsession is credibly rooted in grief and vocation; his micro-choice to wade chest-deep and hold the impossible note shows a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete—“hummed the melody silently, his throat moving without sound”—and avoids label-speak. The endurance cost (wet clothes vs. dry program at close) is felt, though the change is more mystical than psychological; still, the renunciation of safety satisfies Earned Stasis under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The water-damaged program as developing photograph is a clean, magical-realist engine; each bleed is a because-step that reveals new notation, tightening options toward the shared closure. Orientation is secured within 70 words and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is stable. The final image—restored program signed by both centuries—delivers Conceptual Repricing with visible cost (Marcus’s通宵 transcription, the flooded pit now drained of its magic).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flooded pit, lantern reflections, and floating violin case create tactile micro-setting that constrains every move—Marcus must play with instrument aloft, the water itself becomes resonator. Sensory hierarchy is violinist-specific: acoustics, bow weight, ink bleed. The final dry program is a re-weighted object that could only exist after immersion; setting directly charges the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“finish her unfinished note”—is signaled early and tightens through each revealed staff line; the price is legible: Marcus risks drowning and institutional scorn. Agency is continuous: he returns nightly, memorizes, then plays. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but the final harmonic that sustains after bow leaves string is a visible cost that narrows future options—he can never again hear silence here as empty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of liminal conversation between eras emerges via recurring “in-between space” imagery rather than thesis statement; the program’s dissolution literalizes the idea that destruction enables transmission. The restored dual-signature page reweights heritage as collaboration, not nostalgia. No moral is declared—meaning crystallizes in the object’s impossible material state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Marcus’s violinist sensorium—pitch, bow pressure, ink pools—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and compresses with bow strokes (“held it as long as his arm could sustain”). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The lyric elision “wordless conversation” is taught early and paid off in the silent final note that still sounds—closure remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Sentences vary from short breaths to swelling crescendos; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“violin case floating like a patient dog” condenses loyalty and buoyancy. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. Information density is high: one sentence often performs sensory grounding, character choice, and premise reinforcement. Copy is clean; “water-damaged” hyphen once, consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flooded orchestra pit as darkroom for ghost notation is a fresh synthesis of music, photography, and haunting; trope of unfinished spirit is inverted—she needs performance, not revenge. Specificity of 1892 program ink chemistry and violin waterproof shell grounds the magic. Risk is taken and paid: the supernatural duet could have collapsed into whimsy, but the final tangible artifact earns belief.</comment>
