<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral and embodied—every nerve, angle, and gram of the mask is felt. The shift from recorded pain to reciprocal mercy is credibly traced through micro-calculations and the final kneel. The child beat is thin—no reciprocal gesture or resistance—so the relational crucible never fully ignites. Still, Lyra’s hierarchy of values is legible and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the inverted strap-motion becomes the story’s new mathematics, foreclosing victimhood with felt cost. Causal chain holds—each remembered trauma-response seeds the reciprocal motion that ends the piece. Orientation is immediate; UV forest and Coalition exile are anchored by word 60. One transition (station → forest) is legible and patterned. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory data and pattern repetition reweight meaning; no contradiction at exit.</comment>

<comment>The UV forest is not backdrop; its Fibonacci moss supplies the literal footing for Lyra’s first free step and the child’s lesson. Pewter strap functions as micro-setting—its 47 g mass and pressure-map constrain every cranial angle until the inversion releases them. Spatial choreography is immaculate: vertebrae announce positions, distances to the child are calculated for safety. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she convert measured pain into a mathematics of mercy—tightens once: the strap’s removal narrows options from survival-calculation to teaching. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure escalates through sensory overload and the choice to approach the child. Cost is visible: the exact pull of 17 facial muscles now signals freedom, not flinch. Agency is present but single-turn; still sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of quantified cruelty into quantified care—no moral is stated; the child’s widened eyes carry it. The mathematics metaphor accumulates from nerve-data, strap-grams, and moss-spirals, then re-prices at the final smile. Ambiguity lingers: mercy may be only another algorithm. No thematic echo sentence mars the exit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-sharp: wavelengths, angles, and grams filter every observation. Syntax lengthens under anesthesia-daze, then tightens into stepped calculations, mirroring cognitive thaw. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. The lyric register stays within an enhanced intelligence officer’s plausible lexicon. Final sentence’s muscular count is both clinical and liberating—voice modulates without breaking.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long hypnotic sentences for emergence, staccato clauses for data-points. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or numeric information. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“drowning in reverse” is earned. One mixed vehicle: “geometry of survival” borders abstraction, but is immediately grounded in 23° shoulder angle—minor slip, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The inversion of enhanced interrogation tech into a pedagogy of healing feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. UV forest as exile for “surplus perception” is a fresh spatialization of trauma. Mathematics-as-compassion is a conceptual re-pricing that grows from concrete numeric beats, not a grafted metaphor. Risky lyric density is sustained without clarity loss—freshness is earned, not decorative.</comment>
