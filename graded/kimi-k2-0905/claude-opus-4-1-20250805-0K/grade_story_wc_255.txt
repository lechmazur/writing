<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s color-blind perception drives every negotiation; her “gray” reading of Enzo’s tremor and the reed tongue trade is concrete, embodied, and costly. The flower-code micro-choices visibly tighten his grief and reopen contact with his daughter, earning the reunion. Interiority stays particular to her synesthetic seeing; no diagnostic labels. Only minor cap: we never feel a moment where her flaw nearly costs her the deal—risk stays intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard sculpture sings and the father–daughter embrace reweights all prior trades. Cost is legible in the exposed, once-burned letters and the audible reed—an artifact that now calls the estranged child home. Causal chain holds: flower syntax → confession → sculpture → return. One clean transition (courtyard to gate) is taught early; orientation anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass kiln heat, dew-weighted chrysanthemum petals, and the shard-caught light of the destroyed bank are filtered through Mira’s tone-based sight, making setting an active constraint—Enzo’s “clear glass” rule emerges from it. Spatial choreography is immaculate: herbs shift, reed placed, gate arrangement tracked. The courtyard itself becomes the tool that mediates reunion. Micro-setting (reed tongue inside glass) literally shapes the final sound that lures the daughter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can broken things be made to speak again?—tightens when Mira wagers the reed tongue against courtyard access. One meaningful deepening: Enzo’s hands shake at music-hall gray, revealing the stakes are his daughter, not glass. Agency stays with Mira; her flower rearrangement forces the confession. Cost is visible (burned letters, exposed shame) but feels mid-scene; the final sculpture’s song is wind-driven, not a fresh choice, keeping it shy of 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: imperfection as vocation—only shattered glass and a cracked reed can sing. Subtext is carried in gesture (Enzo’s twitch toward the reed) and floral syntax rather than exposition. Final image reweights “destruction” into instrument, achieving CR. No moralizing, only resonance. Minor abstraction: “the phoenix revealed what was already broken” leans toward thesis, but it is earned by the concrete reed-in-glass payoff seconds later.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Mira; perceptual signature—tone-before-color—remains consistent and specific. Diction (“innocently cunning,” “gray in infinite shades”) is anchored in her idiom. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Enzo’s single “Papa?” line carries generation of ache. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens into the reed’s note. Rhythm modulates: longer, painterly sentences for observation, staccato exchanges for trade. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” registers academic but occurs outside text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. No loops or scaffold; “gray” recurs with shifting nuance, not churn. Metaphors (glass catching light like sound) stay coherent and physically grounded. Opening and closing lines echo through the reed’s song, creating cadence closure. Micro-issues: two adjectives (“ innocently cunning”) could be one, but the compression fits the 740-word economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blind painter × floriography × post-phoenix barter economy feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The reed tongue as both keepsake and sound-source transforms a random relic into a working instrument of reunion. Risk in structure—lyric accretion rather than showdown—pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes; the flower-code negotiation is new. Specific detail (concertina reed gauge, morning-glory = affection) anchors originality in lived craft.</comment>
