<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s tremor evolves from nervous tic to necessary resonance, giving her body a dramatic arc; the interior contradiction (fear vs hunger for wonder) is concrete and embodied. Mentor-loss grief is filtered through present ritual action rather than summary. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she accepts perpetual jittery service as living bridge—Earned Stasis with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pendant discovery → aurora test → mentor reveal → vocation rewrite. Orientation clean by word 80; each cause tightens options until final renunciation. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration: “her hands still shook… but now she understood the tremor differently” reweights prior motif with conceptual cost. Lens = Causal; no contradiction at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ridgeway and pendant function as micro-setting that literally constrains choice—only this place + this tremor unlocks Convergence. Sensory hierarchy favors magnetic pulse, crystal vibration, light ribbons; details are filtered through courier’s risk-calibrated attention. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she ascends, tests, descends. Final image of pendant catching last aurora light recharges setting motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she survive the test and find Corvin—signaled in para 1. Escalation: pendant vibrates → ghosts appear → mentor located → vocational rewrite. Tightening beat is luminous figure’s touch that floods her with knowledge, narrowing option to lifelong bridge-duty. Cost is perpetual bodily tremor and exile from normal courier anonymity—visible price legible at end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges nondidactically: wonder is not inherited but practiced, a bodily discipline across time. Subtext carried in pendant’s shift from archaeological cargo to living antenna. Final image reweights “routine” vs “revelation” without sermon. Ambiguity preserved: transcendence may be hallucination, but choice is real—complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“dragonfly-wing”, “gossamer robes”) mirrors her artifact-trained eye. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during Convergence, then lengthens at dawn—intention cadence shift. No head-hopping; knowledge bounds respected. Voice distinct from mentor’s reported voice via earthy courier idiom vs scholarly quotes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Figurative language present but not stacked in peak beats; mixed metaphor screened—vehicles stay airborne/light-based. No synonym churn; “tremor”/“resonance” recur with purposeful escalation. Information density high: one sentence often conveys place, stakes, sensory hit. Closure image crisp, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of hard-SF auroral physics with spiritual transcendence feels fresh; courier trope repurposed as shamanic vocation. Mentor disappearance solved by ontological upgrade, not corpse retrieval—avoids cliché. Object resonance keyed to biological tremor is specific, not generic “chosen one.” Risk of lyric exposition paid off by causal closure. Conceptual integrity intact; no retreat to safe ambiguity.</comment>
