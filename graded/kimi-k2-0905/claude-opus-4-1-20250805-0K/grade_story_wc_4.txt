<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s calm-observer stance is consistent, yet she never faces a hard micro-choice that visibly costs her; the decisive pivot to “complete the work” is stated, not dramatized under pressure. Interiority leans scenic rather than embodied, so the spiral-making feels communal, not personally crucible-tested. The lack of a visible personal stake or flaw keeps the arc safely illustrative rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pattern is Accumulative/Textural: photo-spiral density mounts, then cadence shifts when townspeople re-enact the arcs. Closure lands as Charged Poise—human spiral amid lavender, camera click crystallizing generations of grief into shared artifact. Cost is conceptual (loss of ruin + public exposure) but felt through collective breath, not individual price; still, lens holds and image reweights prior material. Orientation is clean; causality is associative, not tight “because” chains, acceptable underAccumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and rusted factory recur with sensory economy; scent and color constrain mood and staging. Micro-setting rules: the factory ruins determine deadline, lavender dictates bodily arrangement. Final image—people forming spiral among blooming stalks—recharges earlier photo arcs, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains legible despite large head-count.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save memory site from erasure; pressure is external (council deadline) but protagonist agency stays curatorial—planning exhibition, not blocking bulldozers. Escalation is soft: photos accumulate meaning, then collective recreation deepens rather than narrows options. No visible personal cost or foreclosed path for Elara keeps tension communal and illustrative. Enough for Accumulative tightening, but lacks a palpable trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of communal healing emerges through spiral imagery and generational re-enactment, never sermonized. Subtext resides in bodies forming living mandalas—healing performed, not declared. Final camera click reframes grief as shared art, offering resonant non-literal answer. Complexity acknowledged: factory poison acknowledged, redemption partial, ambiguity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays fixed on Elara with perceptual signature—maps read as grief, leather feels like river stones. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences for history, shorter beats for dawn choreography. No dialogue to test, but narrative diction keeps lyrical lift consistent with earnest whimsy. Filter verbs minimal; compression taught early (“as vines climb”) and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; metaphors mostly organic but occasional stack (“industrial hardness from their bones”) edges purple. No loops or paraphrase stalls; information density high. Closure line keeps clarity and image-propulsion. Minor over-writing in lavender-as-balm passages prevents 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of industrial ruin + iterative photo-spiral + communal re-enactment feels fresh, not trope-reliant. Conceptual risk in accumulative structure holds under Accumulative lens. Specificity of lavender field as healing canvas grounds novelty. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty; transformation test passed—story collapses if setting or spiral device removed.</comment>
