<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt and self-doubt are credibly embodied—his empty flask, the “useless” compass, the exact count of poles marking his penance—yet the interior contradiction is told more than dramatized in the moment of decision (“Perhaps being broken didn’t mean being worthless” is an abstract epiphany). Sarah functions mainly as empathetic mirror rather than pressure source, so relationship-as-crucible is weak. The final micro-choice—to teach pole-navigation—earns its place and forecloses retreat, but the cost is only asserted, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Marcus’s public offer to teach is a visible Decisive Change that reframes the compass from shame-token to teaching tool; the compass’s “useless needle catching light” supplies felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 50 words. Causality is linear but safe; no single beat tightens pressure—grief simply erodes until Marcus opts out of isolation. The rescue-memory stakes are declared but never tested in present scene, so escalation is modest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Coastal kayak launch and numbered utility poles are tactile, lived-in, and guide actual navigation decisions; brass compass tarnish and salt-spray stains provide sensory specificity without checklist excess. Fog lifting mirrors internal shift but avoids overt symbolism. Spatial choreography across pole-count is immaculate. Environment does not charge the final image (poles are backdrop to offer of coffee), so 8.8 cap applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Marcus re-enter relationship with the sea without repeating fatal error?—is signaled early. Pressure is steady but flat: each pole passed marks incremental self-forgiveness rather than narrowing options; the seal cameo supplies gentle external affirmation instead of risk. No tangible consequence jeopardizes the present outing, so cost is retrospective (27 deaths) rather than immediate. Closure reweights meaning but does not escalate stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—broken tools and people can still point toward meaning—emerges through compass reprise rather than explicit statement, resisting moralising. Subtext in Sarah’s wave and coffee offer carries shared survivor kinship neatly. Final image of “unconventional constellation” reweights prior motifs with quiet resonance. Some thematic phrasing (“perhaps broken things can still point...”) flirts with Echo but stays character-internal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Marcus’s salty, guilt-tinged perception; diction like “soldiers marking time” and “brass surface tarnished” feels weather-beaten and character-specific. Rhythm breathes with paddle strokes and pole counts, mirroring slow coastal cadence. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and carries subtext of mutual recognition. No head-hopping or register drift; compass and flask function as extensions of POV memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, varied, and mostly propulsive; sentence lengths modulate to mimic paddle rhythm. Occasional softeners—“perhaps,” “maybe,” “just a short paddle”—don’t stall momentum but cumulatively dilute peak beats. No mixed metaphors, synonym loops, or heavy scaffold. Final paragraph’s “learning to swim in shallower water” is fresh image that recharges prior guilt-sea metaphor without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Rehabilitating a defunct nautical compass into a metaphor for imperfect mentorship is fresh, but the overall “guilt-ridden mariner finds humble new purpose” arc is familiar. Utility-pole navigation system offers a concrete, specific innovation that grows organically from setting. Emotional specificity of counting poles as penance keeps it from feeling generic. Story takes modest formal risks; quiet ending trusts image, achieving modest lift but not full surprise.</comment>
