<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—her need to stay vs. her need to leave the capital—are dramatized through the micro-choice of returning to the plant; embodied emotion (“her breath visible,” “voice echoing”) grounds her grief without label-speak. The final act of handing a warm sphere to strangers crystallizes her renunciation of solitary artistry for communal healing, the cost legible in the torch’s dying blue. No second character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is waived; the interior arc alone drives the closure under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marina’s torch-light invites others to seed the zone with questions, reconfiguring the plant from reactor to sanctuary; the conceptual cost—perpetual exposure risk—is undeniable in the cracked bookmark’s shadow. The accumulative pattern (ice → water → glass → light) tightens once when the couple arrives; every sphere laid on dead consoles is a beat that reframes safety as crafted, not given. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The control-room-as-studio is rendered through tactile specifics: glass shards swept with “deliberate ceremony,” ice water pooling over toppled warning signs. The bookmark’s cracked leather and the torch’s blue heart constrain Marina’s choices—she must work slowly, one breath at a time, or the glass fractures. Micro-setting (the emergency shutdown button) charges the final image when a sphere rests there, trading catastrophe for second chances. Environmental mirroring (ice surrendering to warmth) tracks the heart’s thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crafting containers for unasked questions in a poisoned zone—is signaled early; escalation is accumulative: each sphere laid on a dead console increases the density of fragile testimony. The arrival of the couple tightens the pattern into shared risk; the torch’s flame becomes the last light in the exclusion zone, forcing Marina to externalize her art. Cost is visible: she forfeits ownership of her questions, inviting strangers to seed the reactor with their fears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of containment: nuclear vessels once held uranium, now glass spheres hold human uncertainty. Subtext resides in silence—the empty chairs “once held engineers” yet witness the new ritual. The thawing heart is repriced: safety is not a state but an ongoing craft; the final image of light in darkness offers no moral, only a charged invitation. No thematic echo or moralizing caps the piece.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter: “glass remembers heat” is idiosyncratic, not encyclopedic. Self-narration (“See how the dust rises”) is motivated by her need to master panic through ritual; cadence slows during sphere rotation, accelerates when footsteps intrude. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior diction remains within her artisan lexicon. Prose rhythm mirrors glasswork—long breath-like sentences, then sharp crystalline fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“blue at its heart, like hope itself”) without crowding high-pressure beats. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges torch-light motif. Strong verbs—“swept,” “gather,” “breathes”—replace modifiers. No register drift; technical terms (radiation, exclusion zone) are accurate and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses glassblowing with nuclear exclusion zone—non-obvious synthesis. Thawing heart is literal (ice dripping) and conceptual (community re-entry), avoiding allegory. Risk of sentimental “art heals” is undercut by lingering rad-signs and cracked bookmark—containment is always partial. Final image of strangers writing questions inside warm glass feels inevitable yet fresh; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
