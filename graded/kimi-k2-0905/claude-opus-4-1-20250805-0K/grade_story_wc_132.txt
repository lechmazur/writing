<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his fingernails greening, veins rooting—yet his contradictory impulse (scientist’s control vs. participation) remains stated rather than dramatized in a single visible beat. The final surrender is earned, but the cost is more announced (“no longer fully human”) than felt through embodied contradiction. Still, the perceptual signature is strong and flaws stay clear of the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each rain-soaked image layers density until the merging leaf reconfigures meaning. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—“something necessarily in between”—with visible cost (his dissolved palm). No orientation debt; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and rain act as micro-setting: the glowing moss conducts electricity that enables the final merge, charging the last image. Sensory detail is selective (glistening leaf, sparking moss) and filtered through Marcus’s botanist gaze. Meets 9+ gate; only minor over-description of gravel droplets keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand by becoming”—is signaled early and tightens when the leaf dissolves into flesh, foreclosing the safe-observer option. Escalation is accumulative: each plant anomaly raises the cost of continued detachment. Price is visible (green nails, root-veins) but the final beat could sharpen the physical forfeiture instead of stating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of participation-over-study emerges through the merging leaf image rather than exposition. Grandmother’s “circuitous sincerity” reweights at closure when Marcus realizes she literally meant inheritance-as-transformation. Subtext in moss conducting ancient electricity is lovely; minor late “understood now” line edges toward thematic echo but stops short of overt moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains botanist diction—“cellular structure,” “prehistoric fronds”—without violating Marcus’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: calm observation yields to shorter clauses as transformation accelerates. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct throughout. Final sentence cadence crystallizes the hybrid stance cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with the storm: longer horticultural sentences contract into clipped sensory fragments as the merge begins. No loops or scaffold; each image does dual work (leaf as object and omen). Figurative language stays within physical logic—“watercolor on wet paper” precisely captures dissolution. Closure line is clean, propulsive, artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Plant-body hybrid is fresh, yet “storm awakens ancient nursery” nods to eco-horror templates; specificity of linden vein-repatterning and moss bio-conductivity lifts it above trope. Risk-taking—protagonist literally dissolves—pays off through earned image rather than shock. Could push grandmother’s voice into one concrete shard for extra bite, but still feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
