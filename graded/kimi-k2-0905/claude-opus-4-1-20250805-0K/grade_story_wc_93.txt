<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yann’s interiority is specific—she feels the dust warm against her hip, sees time three beats ahead—and her curse complicates every motion. The micro-choice to scatter the dust anyway, knowing the outcome, shows contradictory impulses in scene. The final shift from receiver to transmitter of the pattern is earned, though the grandmother’s last-breath exposition feels conveniently packaged. Still, the cost of living each moment twice is kept palpable to the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early via the aurora-as-borrowed-dawn and holds: each stone added thickens density rather than triggers causal turns. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Yann’s new pattern crystallizes her future apprentice’s burden while the aurora acknowledges the covenant. Cost is legible in the line “living each moment twice—never certain which experience was real,” a constraint that persists past the final image. One soft spot: the grandmother’s whispered cheat-sheet is a late-injected rule, but it is paid off immediately and does not break pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal bluff is never described for postcard beauty; instead, the painted stones and aurora ribbons become tools that literally guide eel-motion and memory. The environment constrains: only this bluff, this pattern, this dust can host the covenant. Spatial choreography is flawless—stones, dust, aurora, water, and Yann’s body track cleanly across the beat. The final image reuses the aurora’s “borrowed dawn” to reconfigure the stake, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Yann remain passive witness or become active keeper—tightens when she chooses to place stones for a future apprentice, trading immediate certainty for generational responsibility. The tightening is textural: each stone adds weight to her inherited burden rather than alters external options. The cost is conceptual but visible: she accepts perpetual double-vision (“living each moment twice”) without release. No external antagonist is needed; frictionless time itself supplies the coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme emerges as the human need to create pattern in a world that has shed resistance; no character moralizes this. The sacred patterns remain non-literal, reweighted at closure when Yann flips from decoder to author. Subtext lives in gesture: scattering dust she already saw herself scatter is both surrender and defiance. The final aurora pulse offers resonant reconfiguration without stating a moral, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person narration keeps a tight psychic distance that never exceeds Yann’s sensory field. Syntax is controlled: long sentences for spiraling eel-motion, fragment-like bursts for precognitive hits (“three heartbeats forward”). Diction stays within a herder’s lexicon—no academic intrusion. The voice is distinctive enough that the closing covenant line could belong to no other narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Metaphors (“serpents of green light,” “living equations”) are kept to singular appearances and do not stack. Information density is high: one sentence often layers stone-placement, mythic memory, and bodily sensation. The only hairline slip is “friction failed” repeated twice in close proximity, but it occurs early and does not dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Frictionless physics as emotional metaphor is not new, but the synthesis with eel herding, precognitive curse, and Fibonacci-etched ancestor promise feels inevitable in hindsight. The inversion that eels are not livestock but guardians of entropy reversal grows organically from established detail. Risk is taken: the climax is a quiet pattern-drawing rather than explosive reversal, yet it heightens meaning. Specificity of “collapsed star dust gathered where friction first failed” anchors the concept in irreplaceable material.</comment>
