<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s reluctant endurance is embodied in the walnut hand-off: a concrete micro-choice that costs her the very freedom she craves. Interiority stays specific—her “graceless beauty” of motion, the exact frost countdown—never sliding into label-speak. The contradiction between wanting escape and choosing to stay is held in scene, not summarized, and the final renunciation is earned because the seed’s absence would collapse the valley. Only the father/daughter relationship remains functional rather than crucible, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara watches the walnut leave, foreclosing her own exit with visible cost (“tomorrow she’d be free” becomes tonight she stays). Causal chain holds—seed gone → labyrinth anchored → villages saved—under a single contiguous scene. Orientation is clean by line 5; the one reflective block (blueprint burning) is anchored to present action and tilts her tactics. No teleporting props or soft resets; the frost clock tightens options exactly as promised.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The copper-winged birds, temperature gauge, and frost-slick stone are filtered through Mara’s utilitarian eye—every detail either pressures choice (three-hour clock) or supplies resource (luminous path). Inverted orchard and mechanical sentinels constrain motion and charge the final image: giving away the seed keeps the valley rooted. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies track through corridors without drift. Micro-setting (walnut worn smooth) doubles as emotional anchor, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep labyrinth intact by surrendering personal freedom—tightens once: walnut leaves, option vanishes. Pressure escalates under causal lens: frost countdown → travelers arrive → seed handed off → Mara’s path sealed. No coincidence; mechanical birds complicate but do not resolve. Cost is legible on-page (“tomorrow she’d be free” retracted), though a second intermediate tightening beat could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: caretaking as self-imposed curse, inverted growth as mirror of sacrifice. Subtext sits in the walnut—ordinary seed carrying the weight of an entire valley—reweighted when the child plants it “upward, toward sun,” reversing Mara’s downward orchard. No moralizing; the final image of frost sealing the labyrinth crystallizes cost without commentary. Ambiguity lingers: is salvation or futility the last word? That uncertainty feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: precise times, tactile walnut, “graceless beauty” of motion. Syntax mirrors her efficiency—lean, tactile, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven (“Follow the light I leave behind”). No head-hop or register drift; even the birds’ gears click through her ears. Voice modulates under pressure: shorter clauses as frost approaches, sustaining rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—copper wings catching amber light—never overwrought. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; “graceless beauty” recurs with purpose. Opening and closing lines book-end the arc with mirror imagery (light paths vs. sealing frost). A single participle opener (“checking the temperature gauge”) is sequential and clear.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Inverted trees, mechanical birds, and path-forging by non-touch impressions synthesize into a fresh mythic logic that feels inevitable. The walnut-as-anchor and blueprint-as-geological-keystone reframe ecological caretaking as personal prison. Risk-taking—graceless beauty, inverted growth—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if swapped: the specific orchard curse and seed mechanics are irreplaceable. No close genre echoes; the piece stands as a singular stance.</comment>
