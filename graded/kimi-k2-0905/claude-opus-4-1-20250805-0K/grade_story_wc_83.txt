<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amira’s grief-rooted hunt is palpable; every micro-choice (pressing the geode, risking security) is tethered to the loss of her sister’s wedding party. Interiority is concrete: “Physics demanded it.” The final smile under arrest crystallizes her values—data freed, future reclaimed—so the renunciation is earned and costly. Only a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she felt… bleak exhilaration”) keeps this from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: sister’s death → geode as recorder → observatory scan → data theft → future release. The 40-minute breaker window is the tightening screw; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “tomorrow’s stolen dreams would find new dreamers” reweights the world’s rule-set. Cost is legible—career smashed, arrest imminent—so lens and closure cohere.</comment>

<comment>The geode itself functions as micro-setting: mass in palm, warm pulse at climax, its crystalline lattice the literal recording medium. Observatory elevation is keyed to plot—thin boundary, thinner oversight—and anchors the “three kilometers above Earth” line. Spatial choreography stays clean across scanner station, deck windows, arriving guards. No environment charges the final image quite like the geode, satisfying 9- gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped potential—signals on page 1. Tightening is the cooling countdown; option foreclosure occurs when security bolts slam, forcing the upload gamble. Agency stays with Amira; cost (arrest, data confiscation risk) is visible. Escalation could be sharper if the breaker threat had one earlier hiccup, but pressure suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific loss: wedding laughter turned quantum interference. No moralizing—insight stays inside the geode’s glow, the final line offering a non-literal answer: “remembered how to hope.” Subtext of reclaimed futures lands without sermon, satisfying 9+ resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Amira’s physicist ear: “perturbation readings,” “probability clouds.” Syntax accelerates under countdown: short declaratives mimic heart-rate. No head-hop; Dr. Chen’s dialogue carries subtext of complicity. Only a few filter verbs ("she felt") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>High density: “crystalline interior catching the observatory’s sterile light” does triple duty (object, mood, foreshadow). Rhythm breathes—long sentence for grief, staccato for guards. No mixed metaphors, no loops. Final glow is an earned image, not purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drone-strike grief meets quantum after-life of unlived futures. Elevation-as-thin-boundary avoids cliché because the physics is motivated by observatory tech. Risk of “consciousness clouds” pays off via data upload beat. Without the geode-recorder premise the entire arc collapses—irreplaceable.</comment>
