<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s quiet, methodical persona is vividly rendered through her cataloguing rituals and the embodied moment of lifting the echo-jar to amber light. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-talk—and her final smile feels earned because the spiral of buttons and the black-to-gold sand shift are causally linked to her minute-by-minute choices. The flaw: she never risks a visible loss (no button refused, no hourglass dropped) so the cost is conceptual rather than felt, capping her at the threshold of the 8-band.</comment>

<comment>The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early—buttons → hourglasses → prophecy—and the spiral completion delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: prophecy becomes garden, sand turns gold. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“beneath the cliffs”) and closure image (echo spreading into stone) reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Slight deduction: the “truth unravels” turn is told more than dramatized, softening the immediacy of the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The amber warehouse is not backdrop but tool: walls that catch light like frozen honey also refract the final echo, directly enabling the reconfiguration. Micro-setting (the black-sand hourglass) constrains every action Mara takes; spatial choreography is clean as she moves from shelf to floor spiral. One hairline slip: the canyon echo’s physics is lyrically impossible, but the piece signals its own rule-break at intro, so credibility holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep possibility fluid vs. let prophecy harden—is signaled by line 3 and intensifies when the black hourglass refuses to empty. The spiral-building beat narrows options: once buttons lock into pattern, failure would petrify futures. Cost is conceptual (prophecy lost, garden gained) rather than tactile, keeping the escalation just shy of the high-band gate that demands a felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning accrues from buttons as atomized human moments, sand as pulverized dreams, echo as communal yearning. The final image of “infinite garden” re-prices the entire premise—destiny is not destination but soil—achieving resonance through concrete particulars. No moralizing paragraph; the silence itself speaks the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: resin walls “catch and hold light like frozen honey,” buttons “sing their particular note.” Syntax lengthens during cataloguing, then fragments at the echo release, mirroring tension. No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat; diction stays within her hushed curator register even at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with action—long sentences for archival calm, clipped fragments for echo release. Metaphors stay coherent (sand = dreams, echo = possibility) and never crowd a single beat. One minor scaffold: “shared wisdom” is repeated three times in final third; though thematic, the churn dilutes impact. Still, closure image remains luminous and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The conceit of catalogued lost buttons as prophecy ingredients feels fresh, and the hourglass-never-empties rule is transformed into a garden that never sets. Risk—lyric time, impossible echo—pays off by making the final reconfiguration legible. Slight sense that the “prophecy ←→ possibility” inversion is becoming a micro-genre; the piece’s specificity keeps it from cliché.</comment>
