<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s quietly-driven obsession is credibly rooted in the inherited postcards, and her decision to paint the pavilion at night is a concrete micro-choice that costs her sleep and social life; the interior contradiction between public artist and secret keeper is shown, not told. The final renunciation—leaving the postcards for the next initiate—carries visible emotional cost and is earned by the year-long obsession. However, the absence of any second on-page character keeps relational pressure off the page, so the crucible is purely internal; this is acceptable at this length but caps the score below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early via the layered postcards and holds through the final image of snow settling on copper; each seasonal layer adds density rather than causal turns, and the closure is a Charged Poise: Mara’s walk-away leaves the secret poised for transmission. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. The cost is felt in her phosphorescent-stained fingertips and the pavilion’s winter lock-up. A hairline slip: “the dawning hush between seasons” is abstractly stated rather than imaged, slightly dulling the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, copper roof, and snow-on-snow details are selective and body-scaled; the postcards function as micro-setting that constrains every brushstroke. Weather and season evolve causally, tightening the commission’s deadline and finally sealing the pavilion. The cathedral window glass is mentioned but never physically handled on-stage, so it does not quite charge the final image, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the postcards’ obsession—tightens once when Mara realizes they are instructions, not records; this deepening reweights her year of night-work as initiation rather than research, with the cost of stained fingers and missed daylight life. No external antagonist or reversal is needed under the accumulative lens. The price is visible but not irreversible, so the escalation is solid, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: secrecy as tender inheritance, beauty that refuses daylight scrutiny. The final image of snow-covered copper reconfigures the opening dusk light, re-pricing the whole year as seed-time for future artists. No moral is stated; the reader is left holding the secret. One abstract phrase (“the tenderness of hidden things”) is the only near-moral, softening the resonance a notch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays consistently inside Mara’s perceptual filter; syntax lengthens and softens under nocturnal calm, then shortens at the winter lock-up. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The lyric cadence of “petals that caught moonlight like memories” is patterned early and paid off in the final snow-on-petal mirroring, justifying the poetic lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean of loops and scaffold; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “She layered her pigments with the same careful attention she’d observed in the postcards” simultaneously advances action and reprises motif). One mixed metaphor—“summer and darkness in equal measure”—is minor, resolved by context. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the night-work sequences and tightens at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The hidden-in-plain-sight lineage of night-flower art feels fresh; the inversion of postcards as instruction-manual rather than nostalgia is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. The risk of a quiet, almost plotless year-long arc is bold and pays off through accumulating texture. Minor deduction for echoing the familiar “artist transmitting secret beauty” trope without subverting it further.</comment>
