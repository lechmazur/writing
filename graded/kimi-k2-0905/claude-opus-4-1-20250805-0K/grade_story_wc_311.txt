<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—“hollow ache,” “shapeless grief”—and the naming of monsters embodies emotion. The central contradiction (save lover ⇒ be erased) is vivid, yet the sacrifice is told, not shown mid-scene, so the renunciation feels slightly pre-loaded rather than earned in the moment. Micro-choices are present (fold atlas, descend stairs) but low-pressure; still, the coat-to-page tactile loop keeps her flaw alive. No safety-hedging; loneliness is left raw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: she tucks the now-named monsters back into her coat, crystallizing her perpetual vigil with felt cost—“eternal voyage.” Causality holds: predecessor recordings → naming ritual → diminished fear; the atlas page, once decorative, becomes the tool that reweights her stance. One soft pinch: the “tomorrow she would record” beat edges past the 800-word curtain, slightly diluting immediacy, but the final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory dome, brass instruments, and fading sun are filtered through her grief-tuned perception; each sensory pick is motive-driven. Micro-setting is the atlas page itself—handled, folded, lit—constraining her ritual choice and charging the final image. Place-name economy (“the coast”) stays vague, but spatial choreography inside the tower is clean and bodies track. Weather-light alignment literally enables the crystallization beat, fusing scene tech with stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is survival of selfhood inside endless duty; pressure tightens when sunlight gives substance to her fears, forcing the naming that forecloses retreat into anonymity. Escalation is accumulative/textural—density of light, ink, memory—rather than causal reversal; one meaningful deepening suffices. Cost is visible: the named monsters evaporate but her “eternal voyage” is re-caged, Atlas page now a constant reminder of what she can’t escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: “giving names to nameless fears” migrates from map marginalia to psychological survival strategy. Subtext operates in silence—she never speaks his name, letting coastal imagery carry the erasure. No moralizing; the final image of sea-whisper offers resonant non-literal answer to sacrifice’s echo. Complexity preserved: love saved him, yet the cost is her endless invisible labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Vocabulary stays within reaper’s plausible lexicon (“psychopomps,” “celestial mechanics”) yet crafts a distinct funereal cadence. Perceptual signature sharp: she hears “phrases tremble in the air,” sees sky painted “in bruises.” No dialogue, hence no convergence issue; internal texture coherent. Compression in final paragraph accelerates rhythm without syntactic monotony, supporting descent into night-bell duty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for dusk contemplation, fragments (“I name you Absence”) for ritual beat. Mixed metaphors (“sky in bruises,” “wax cylinders contained…hollow ache”) stay coherent because emotional through-line is consistent. Minor scaffold: “She thought of him sometimes” could be tighter, but it advances knowledge. No loops or synonym churn; information is dense without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Freshened trope: reaper-as-atlas-cartographer personalizes cosmic job. Sea-monsters-as-interior-fears is not new, but linking their crystallization to scattered sunlight inside an observatory yields specific alchemy. Risk of lyric renunciation ending is embraced, paid off by charged poise. Could edge higher if coastal/observatory tech detail were more irreplaceably woven, but the synthesis feels genuinely authored.</comment>
