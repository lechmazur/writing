<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—archivist detachment vs. mentor urgency—surface in her bodily pacing and ledger-closing gesture; Kess’s grief sharpens through lunge/shoulder touch. Both micro-choices alter their relational state, but the mother remains off-page, so the full cost is filtered through Elara’s exposition rather than dramatized mother–daughter crucible. Still, the earned moment of forward walk supplies credible stance shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: spiral-reading → reversal code → forward walk. Closure is Charged Poise: the ledger snap and “save yourself” reconfigure future options with implicit cost of impending danger. One minor scaffold: “before she betrayed you” is summary retro-patch, not in-scene dramatized betrayal, but it doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shard-glass and tea-cup function as micro-setting that constrains every beat; dust-speckled light and marble footstep sound anchor immediacy. Playground swing exterior re-enters at closure to mirror stasis, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean—no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing exile—declared by word 120; spiral-geometry tightens option space, visible price is “when your turn comes,” foreshadowing shared risk. Escalation is single but sufficient under Causal lens; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through annotation praxis rather than statement; final “every exile is reversible” reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in Kess’s finger-trace shows acceptance better than exposition could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter (“rust on iron laugh,” “heel-click” tick); no head-hop. Distinct diction for Kess (“Stop dangling hope like a weapon”) vs. Elara’s archivist cadence. Compression in “three weeks since…” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Two minor scaffold phrases: “deliberate care” echoes “deliberate gesture” three sentences prior; “shadow twisted…purposefully now” is faint synonym loop. Figurative language is sparse, controlled, never muddles closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar “mirror exile” trope is refreshed by tea-leaf cryptography and annotation-as-revolution; shard-mirror archive feels idiosyncratic, not checklist quirky. Risk in backward-walk tick pays off as forward final image—transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
