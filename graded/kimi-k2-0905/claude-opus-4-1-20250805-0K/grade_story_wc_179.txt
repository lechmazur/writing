<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Marcus’s scheming pacifism is vividly embodied—his “three moves ahead” smile, the deliberate choice to weaponize silence and memory rather than violence. Interior contradiction flickers when he touches the sanctuary wall and adds this transformation to its memory, showing both strategist and monk. The Magistrate’s arc is equally embodied: grip loosens on box, tears fall without sound, proving the pacifist scheme worked. Cost is felt: the broken pin stays broken—no forced repair, only acceptance—so renunciation lands with tangible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because the box is broken, therefore Marcus can use it as teaching tool; because the Magistrate touches it, therefore his cellular memory rewires. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—soundless weep with broken pin charging the image, undeniable conceptual cost (violence lineage can end). Orientation anchors by word 40 (who, where, when). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (silence, touch-as-speech). Persistent constraint: the pin will never be repaired, yet will “sing again” only through changed song—price shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting dominates: the music box and the sanctuary’s silence constrain every choice. Sensory selection narrows to touch and intention—no sound, only cellular memory transmitted through fingers. The broken pin catches “light that shouldn’t exist,” anchoring rules of this liminal space. Final image recharges object: box cradled like child, silence now voluntary rather than imposed—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can inherited rage be released before it kills the child? Tightening occurs when Magistrate’s touch rewires his own memory—option to stay angry foreclosed by visceral felt cost (son’s fever breaks only if father lets go). Agency is Marcus’s scheme executed through surrender rather than force. Coincidence absent; all pressure internal. Price legible: Magistrate weeps soundlessly, armor now irrelevant—tactics altered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: violence is a melody we inherit but can choose to stop humming. Subtext carried in gesture—grip loosening, box cradled—never sermonized. Final image reweights premise: broken pin + silence = new song, no moral stated. Resonance lingers in reader’s body as after-echo of unheard music.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate locks to Marcus; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—“reality bent like water around stones,” “cellular memory in metal’s marrow”—distinctive, consistent. Compression taught early: “communication flowed through touch and intention alone.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences during memory transfer, staccato as grip loosens. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy preserved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passed: cadence shifts mirror emotional beats. Information density high—single sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “He pressed his palm… feeling the building’s memory… every transformed heart”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within liquid/soundless domain. Zero loops or synonym churn. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “adding this transformation to its endless memory.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—silent monastery where touch replaces speech and broken objects teach peace—is non-obvious synthesis of familiar tropes. Risky choice to evacuate sound pays off: reader feels absence as pressure. Cellular memory as literal mechanic could read gimmick, but grounded in tactile detail and emotional stakes. Final reweighting—broken pin becomes instrument of grace—feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
