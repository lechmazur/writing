<comment>Mae’s longing is embodied (taste of copper heartbreak, shallow-held breaths) and her micro-choice to uncork the vial is credibly costly—she empties her archive of solitude. Yet the ghost-woman’s sudden appearance and instruction feel externally imposed, softening the sense that Mae’s contradictory impulses drive the final surrender. Interiority stays concrete, but the epiphany (“she understood then why she’d been chosen”) edges close to meta-diagnosis at the very beat that should feel self-discovered. Still, the renunciation lands with visible loss and her breathing pattern remains a consistent, character-specific flaw.

<comment>Closure is cleanly achieved: the camera opened, images released, repository fed—an earned stasis that forecloses her former practice yet charges the world. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each photograph, breath, and bloom accretes until the cadence shift dissolves them into the violet door. Causality holds because the breathing pattern she learned from the inherited memory literally unlocks the arch; no coincidence resolves the crux. Cost is legible in the final image—“empty and full simultaneously”—but the instruction delivered by the ghost rather than discovered through trial keeps this a hairline below 9.

<comment>The twilight viaduct, wisteria, and brass-bound camera create a tactile micro-setting that constrains movement to one arch and dictates the breathing tempo. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a photographer notices inverted light, salt crystallised on glass, purple petals as “sparks.” The compressed-starlight door evolves logically from the camera’s ground-glass image—tool becomes portal—so the final image is charged by the environment itself. Occasional soft phrases (“like a prayer written in stone”) flirt with familiar grandeur, but most metaphors are specific to bridges, blooms, and lenses.

<comment>The dominant stake—will Mae relinquish her hoarded loneliness to feed the world’s orphaned loves?—is clear early and tightens when the tear on the lens makes retreat impossible. One meaningful deepening occurs: giving, not taking, redefines her art. Agency is present yet partly delegated; the ghost’s directive narrows options more than Mae’s own experimentation. Price is felt (her archive vanishes), but because the ghost voices the moral calculus, the escalation feels half-external.

<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: unexpressed affection is not waste but latent energy the world can someday metabolise. The camera-as-offering subtly reconfigures photography from extraction to donation; no character articulates this thesis. Subtext lives in gesture—opening the camera back instead of snapping a final shot. The closing line (“everything would be different”) lands as conceptual repricing rather than moral, inviting reflection on every unseen photo we own.

<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: light is “phosphorescent,” memory arrives as “copper on the tongue,” breath becomes metronome. Syntax tightens under pressure—clusters of monosyllables when the door appears. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated. No head-hop; the ghost’s dialogue is filtered through Mae’s understanding. Minor register spikes (“repository of unused love”) risk loftiness but stay within a spiritually-curious lexicon.

<comment>Rhythm breathes with the scene—long sentences for twilight hush, staccato for spark eruptions. Information density high: one sentence can paint bloom-time, reveal camera function, and foreshadow sacrifice. No loops, no mixed metaphors; “ribbons of light like silk scarves underwater” keeps physics coherent. A single scaffold-ish phrase (“the healing began not with taking…”) is justified by its parallelism with prior repetitions of giving.

<comment>Pilgrim-of-sparks concept feels fresh because it literalises emotional static as visible motes only the bereaved can see. Repository-of-unclaimed-kisses reframes typical ghost-story tropes into cosmic composting. Risk is taken—lyric camera-as-prayer—but the internal logic holds and the final image is inevitable in hindsight. Could edge higher if the ghost’s era and identity were even more singularly etched, preventing any swap with a generic spirit.
