<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—oath vs. truth—drives every micro-choice; the heat-ink letter embodies embodied emotion and stakes. The cascade-failure choice carries visible cost (career, life, world-order). One slip: “terrible peace” flirts with label-speak, blunting peak embodiment a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: letter → biometric cascade → cooling sabotage → global release; each beat tightens because/therefore links. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with irreversible cost (vault thaw, her arrest). Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props or causal amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minus-196° vault, titanium harmonics, snow above—details filter through Vera’s archivist gaze and constrain tactics (gloves, scanners, cascade failure). The letter-window reprise at the end recharges the fogged glass image, crystallizing the new world. One tiny lapse: “forty feet” feels précised rather than perceived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—release vs. protect contraband truths—tightens when biometric delays shrink her window and cooling sabotage locks the choice. Upload bar vs. security timer creates visible price. Escalation is causal, not repetitive; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: archived silence vs. living conversation. The fading letter image reweights “unspoken conversation” without moralizing. No thematic echo phrases; final snow-covered silence is Conceptual Repricing—truth now audible under fresh quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Vera’s perceptual bias—cataloguing cold, noticing ink fade, hearing alarms as “crystalline.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, tightens during breach; no head-hop. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” lexicon in narration feels slightly above her idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry triple duty (snow/foreboding/mirroring). Mixed metaphors avoided; “harmonics that the building's AI interpreted” keeps physics coherent. Minor scaffold: “every frozen document would begin its programmed release” repeats prior beat; no loops near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cryogenic National Archives as panopticon of forbidden climate history feels fresh; Damascus manuscripts linking ancient climate collapse to modern censorship is non-obvious synthesis. Risk—system-wide thaw—heightens stakes without gimmick. Could swap Syria for another lost library, but the climate angle locks uniqueness.</comment>
