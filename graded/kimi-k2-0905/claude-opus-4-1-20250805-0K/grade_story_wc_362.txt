<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is concrete—her tactile communion with the prism and the quartz anchors her as a sensory mystic. Contradictory impulses (yearning for proof vs. fear of ridicule) are implied but never dramatized on-page, so the “earned cost” feels second-hand. Her final micro-choice—photographing the frost before it vanishes—crystallizes a life’s work, yet the beat is summarized not embodied, muting the visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a crisp Conceptual Repricing: frost patterns make emotion-to-matter translation visible, undeniable. Causal chain holds: prism angle→ frost lexicon→ camera click; each step tightens options until the last image reweights her life’s quest. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory evidence, not because/therefore reversals—and the pattern is taught by 25 % mark. Cost is felt as evaporating frost, but the beat is compressed into half-sentence; a hair more embodied pause would push it to 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Mist-laden quartz arbor is evoked through sound (humming), temperature (warmth vs. frost), and refracted color; these details guide the camera angle choice. Micro-setting—the prism in her palm—literally reconfigures light and stakes. Spatial choreography stays clean: altar centrality, pillar distance, sun angle all track. Final frost map is the setting evolving with event, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove emotion-imprint science—tightens once: frost lexicon appears, live option is “document now or lose forever.” Escalation is textural (density of sensory proof) rather than causal reversal; sufficient for this length. Cost is legible—frost will melt, reputation still teeters—though stated more than viscerally felt. Agency sits in the camera click; luck is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the porous border between mind and matter. Subtext is carried by frost patterns rather than exposition; “truthful lies” re-priced into simple truth in final image. No moralizing sentence clogs the end. Minor abstraction in “every assumption…shattered” dips below pure image, keeping it from 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors tactile and optical detail congruent with a mystic. Syntax flexes from lyric (“crystallized breath”) to precise (“electromagnetic fluctuations”), miricking pressure shifts. No dialogue, so voice remains uncontaminated. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she felt,” “she saw”) inside a sensual epistemology.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with paragraph variety; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective, never floods a high-pressure beat. Minor scaffolding: two adjacent “she’d spent / she’d documented” openers could compress. Information density high—each sentence layers science, memory, and image. No artifact touches the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Emotion-imprint premise is familiar; the frost-lexicon visual translation and quartz-arbor acoustics supply fresh sensory angle. Risk is taken in lyric compression rather than plot surprise, but coherence holds. Specific family chain (grandma→mother→Vera) prevents swap-out test failure. Final frost map feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
