<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but abstract—feelings are named (“ambered hush,” “mildly obsessed”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses act in-scene; the oracle only watches and whispers. The final smile is a micro-choice, yet its cost is conceptual, not felt. Enough for credible endurance, but not for 8+.

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each star-dimming flake adds density toward a map of absence. Closure is a quiet CR—the night is endless process, not endpoint—felt cost is the lifetime already spent. Orientation clear by line 4; no causality break. Lacks one tightening beat that would foreclose a live option; hence stays below 8.8.

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort, crumbling parapet, and flaking booklet are tactile, specific, and filter through the oracle’s monk-like attention. Weather and ruin directly shape her access to the sky and her isolation. Final image of descending worn steps echoes the booklet’s disintegration, charging the closure. Meets 9- gate: setting constrains her vigil and recharges the ending.

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—complete the map before the last star dies—is signaled early. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: star fades, pages flake, but no forked choice narrows options. Escalation is accretive density, not causal turn; cost is cumulative time, not a fresh forfeiture. Sufficient for short-form, but lacks visible price that alters next move.

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mapping absence becomes a metaphor for learning patience in loss. No explicit thesis; final smile reweights the premise—endless night is teacher, not doom. Resonant ambiguity lingers: is obsession salvation or self-burial? Achieves emotional aftereffect without sentimentality.

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, oracle-voice: archaic diction (“marbled hush,” “ambered hush”) is consistent and pattern-taught early. Rhythm swells and subsides like breath, mirroring tide and star-pulse. No dialogue, so no voice collision. Filter verbs are rare; perception stays concrete. Minor lexical inflation (“excruciating, beautiful patience”) keeps it sub-9.

</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph lengths mimic waves. Metaphors are mixed once (“ambered hush like resin” vs. “marbled hush”) but coherent within oracle consciousness. No loops or scaffold; density high—each line layers sky, booklet, body. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fading-star cartography of silence is fresh; inverse astronomy intrigues. Oracle as archivist of void flips usual prophecy trope. Risk is quietness, not spectacle; coherence holds. Could swap “pebble-shore” title for any littoral name without loss—slight generic tint keeps sub-8.5.
