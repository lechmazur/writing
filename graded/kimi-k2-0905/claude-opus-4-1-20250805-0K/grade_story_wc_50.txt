<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s occupation and temperament are vividly fused—her locksmith’s habit of “never focusing directly” mirrors her method of reverse-engineering time itself. Interior contradiction is present yet mild: she wants to repair yet chooses to document malfunction, a renunciation that costs her full mastery of the device. The decision is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping her just shy of the 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Earned Stasis: Mara forecloses repair in favor of perfect documentation, a refusal that reweights the premise—wonder is preserved by mapping its escape, not its capture. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mirrored observations thickens until the final image (“blueprint of malfunction”) reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality break; orientation anchors within 120 words; persistent constraint (the timer’s self-healing via echoes) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble cavern, mirrored angles, and wounded-season timetable are specific, sensory, and purposeful; the cave’s acoustic shift at noon literally changes Mara’s workflow. The timer itself functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid, constraining her only indirect observation. Final image of the device left “in its marble cradle” recharges the cradle motif, meeting the 9+ gate test. Minor reserve: environment could have bitten back more violently to push her decision cost into the felt register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can wonder be bottled without breaking time?—is signaled early and tightens through each reflection angle. Escalation is textural: density of temporal anomalies increases until documentation becomes the only viable stance, foreclosing direct repair. Cost is conceptual but legible: Mara abandons mastery for witness, trading control for reverence. Missing a visceral price (bleeding cut, lost tool) keeps it just below 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: preservation through fracture, knowledge through surrender. No explicit thesis; final image of “wonder leaking through cracks” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide if Mara’s archive is triumph or defeat. Resonance is concrete: the cellar of ordinary repairs will now hum with unspoken marvel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: locksmith’s diction of tumblers, springs, calibrations; syntax coils and releases like the mechanism she studies. Compression is taught early—“watching its reflection revealed its functional past”—and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Minor template cadence in “She would... she would...” futures near end nudges it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; metaphor count high but patterned (mirrors, light, echoes) so density penalty waived. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Single mixed metaphor—“cradle of marble” beside “frozen lightning”—is forgiven under lyric license. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Temporal lock that harvests not images but slivers of actual time is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risk—lyric, indirect, almost plotless—pays off because pressure accumulates through perceptual mechanics rather than events. Inevitable in hindsight: of course a locksmith would pick time’s lock by watching its reflection. Conceptual integrity absolute: story never retreats into metaphoric safety.</comment>
