<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s “sanely eccentric” tag is shown—he alphabetizes dreams yet maps impossible staircases—but interiority stays general (“he felt closest to understanding”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in real time; the grandmother memory is delivered in two expository blocks rather than testing present pressure. The final beat is a quiet recognition, not a choice that forecloses a path; cost is conceptual, not personally felt. Meets base credibility, but the lack of embodied conflict under pressure keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Marcus sees the library as infinite folded memory, paying with the scarf’s further unraveling—cost is legible in the final image. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; architecture rules are taught early and paid off. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated motifs (scarf, hyperbolic curves, Borges) tighten the emotional texture rather than cause-and-effect. One scaffold loop—“the place where stories live wasn’t a location but a topology” appears twice with near-identical wording—deducts 0.2, holding the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The library’s non-Euclidean geometry is continuously filtered through Marcus’s map-making gaze; shelves “breathe like lungs” and aisle seven-and-a-half appears only in peripheral vision, constraining how patrons move and how Marcus guides them. Sensory selection favors texture (smell of old paper, warmth of silk) over cataloguing. Grandmother’s handwriting in a posthumous book provides a micro-setting object that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean—scarf catching on shelf, staircase ascended—tracking body-to-environment relation without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find the place where stories live”—is signaled early; pressure is atmospheric, tightening through repeated returns to the scarf and the library’s shifting shelves. No external antagonist or resource loss; escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than narrowing options. The final vision reweights meaning but costs Marcus nothing tangible beyond another thread loosened. Under Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices, yet the absence of a trade-off or visible price keeps the score below 7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: analog memory versus digital preservation, memory as curved space. Subtext operates through the scarf’s fraying and the marginalia that violates chronology—no explicit thesis stated. Final image reconfigures the premise without moralizing: stories live in the continuous deformation of remembering. One minor echo of prompt language (“the place where stories live”) is embedded mid-story, not in closing paragraph, so no thematic-echo penalty applies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual lens: numbers whispered, frequency only he hears. Syntax is rhythmic, slightly elevated, matching a librarian who thinks in topologies: “equations bloomed into verse.” Occasional compression (“sanely eccentric”) is justified by character repute. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative diction remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet efficient; most sentences carry dual duty of image and theme. One paraphrase loop noted in Q2; otherwise no redundant scaffolding. Mixed metaphors avoided; “shelves breathing like lungs” extends the library-as-organism motif cleanly. Filter verbs minimal; strong nouns/verbs dominate. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No artifacts in closure beat; high-band gate remains open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Borges-tinged infinite library with hyperbolic-memory topology feels fresh and specific to this voice. Grandmother’s scarf as both portal and analog decay object transforms familiar heirloom trope. Risk of non-Euclidean architecture is taken without gimmickry; pattern is taught early and closure repays it. Derivative premise guardrail waived because lived detail (marginalia in impossible handwriting) localizes the concept.</comment>
