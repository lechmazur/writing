<comment>Mira’s interiority is consistently concrete—fingertips tingling with “forgotten memories,” moss erupting from her touch—yet her contradictory impulses (duty to report vs. urge to build cairns) remain stated rather than enacted in a single observable beat. The final transformation is foreshadowed by lineage and leaf-letters, so the cost feels legible, but the moment of irrevocable change is summarized rather than dramatized with a visible micro-choice. Still, her perceptual signature (sorting by “size, shimmer, and song”) is character-specific and threads every paragraph, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost but not quite.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s new role is crystallized in the image of moss spreading wherever she touches, a living signature that reweights every prior seed-sorted syllable. The cost is unmistakable—her eyes now hold “depths that hadn’t existed before,” foreclosing an ordinary life. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the moonstone speck → cairn building → leaf-letters → interpretive gift layers density until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Ashen Skyborne Arbor is evoked through kinetic sensory filters—petrified branches “like bridges of bone,” roots that “drank from clouds”—and the micro-setting of Mira’s workbench becomes a crucible when moss fractals erupt across it, directly constraining her future choices. Every detail is filtered through her professional attention to “size, shimmer, and song,” so the world rules are learned by action, not exposition. The final image of moss colonizing ash-gray bark recharges the opening palette, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mira heed duty or follow the illicit moonstone call—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when leaf-letters form warnings that only her cairns can answer. One meaningful deepening occurs: the moment she “laughed, and moss began growing,” a visible price that reweights her prior sorting ritual. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal, but under the Accumulative lens the density of leaf-letters + moonstone + moss fractals suffices. Cost is on-page (irreversible somatic change), though a second beat of external resistance would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between memory and ascent: regional folklore is not quoted but performed—every seed-cairn is a silent argument against forgetting. Subtext operates in gesture (the cairns are never named as “messages,” yet they are), and the final mossy delight offers a non-literal answer to the central question of whether the trees should return earthward. No moralizing, no thematic echo; the reader is left to weigh the cost of translation. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet disciplined: “gravity’s rebellious children,” “syllables of the world’s first language”—metaphors are fresh, never purple, and the cadence modulates with Mira’s rising euphoria. Perceptual signature is consistent—she hears seeds sing, sees veins as letters—without drifting into committee voice. No dialogue, so no contamination risk. Patterned elision (e.g., the moment of actual report-versus-cairn decision is elided) is taught early and paid off in the moss explosion, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable; each sentence at least doubles duty (worldbuild + character filter). No loops or template cadence; occasional alliterative runs (“bridges of bone… bark whispered”) feel purposive rather than algorithmic. One near-mixed metaphor—“moonstone dust rang like a bell made of starlight”—is forgiven because the physical logic (tingle → sound) holds. Final line “decoder of gravity’s rebellious children” lands with crisp resonance, recharging prior arboreal imagery without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The inverse ascension of trees refusing earth, the seed-sorting monk who translating their leaf-mail, and the mossy delight as somatic price synthesize into a premise that feels inevitable yet uncannily fresh. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversals, and it pays off in the charged final image. No recognizable trope templates or famous-scene echoes; the regional folklore is invented yet lived-in. Transformation test fails—story collapses if you swap “seeds” for coins or “arbor” for a library—confirming high specificity.</comment>
