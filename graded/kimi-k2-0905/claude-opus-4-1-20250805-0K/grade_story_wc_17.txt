<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s inherited perception is concrete—she palms the wall, photographs brittle pages, adds her own whisper—so the “sensitively perceptive” trait keeps turning into physical choices. Interiority stays specific to her craft: she “feels for the subtle vibrations,” not abstract grief. The final notebook placement is a micro-choice that accepts lifelong solitude; cost is legible. Yet the diary entry she reads gives her knowledge faster than it costs her anything, so the beat feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira sets her notebook beside Voss’s, crystallizing her new role as the next link in an endless chain; the image carries felt cost because she exits into “green passages that had become the world’s new architecture,” i.e., permanent exile. Causal chain holds: negative strip → Voss map → hidden microphones → extraction → new archive. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. One soft spot: the strip’s discovery “yesterday” is off-stage; still, the strip immediately steers every subsequent move, so causality never breaks.</comment>

<comment>Ivy is not backdrop—it narrows the corridor, forces her to “brush aside curtains of leaves,” muffles and channels sound, and finally swallows the exterior world. The half-burned diaries in the fireplace provide tactile, smell-rich interaction; she photographs before touching, a lived-in professional reflex. Temperature shifts from cool stone to evening wind track elapsed time. The limestone’s molecular “dream” re-weights the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is preservation of human acoustic memory against green erasure; pressure tightens when she realizes Voss already started the work and the ivy is absolute. One meaningful escalation: discovery that walls themselves are “a library” forces her to switch from solitary cartography to becoming curator-collaborator with the dead; the turn costs immediacy—she spends “hours” extracting echoes, accepting perpetual isolation. No coincidence resolves; the strip leads, but never hands her an easy win. Cost (endless solitude) is legible in the final sentence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as communal endurance rather than individual ownership—emerges through action: she doesn’t declare it, she shelves her own notebook beside Voss’s. Subtext in Voss’s line “They dream of purpose” quietly re-prices Mira’s lonely calling from burden to covenant. No moralizing paragraph; the last line lets ivy whisper instead of spelling meaning. The negative’s return from chemistry-lab ruin to archive seed implies science and art alike refuse to die, giving the reader an open after-image rather than a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perceptual filter: vibrations against her palm, molecular dreams, ivy acoustics. Syntax lengthens during extraction (“conversations about love and loss…”) to mimic trance, then shortens at exit, mirroring fatigue. No filter-verb stacks; “she felt” is avoided—vibrations are “cool stone” under skin. Voice never drifts into eco-essay diction; even “climate shifts” arrives through personal legacy, not editorial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long clause for ivy takeover, staccato for diary fragments. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“brittle as autumn leaves” fits burnt paper and world decay. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensorial or causal information. One micro-scaffold: “She photographed each one before touching them, knowing they might crumble” could trim to “She photographed before touching; they might crumble,” but the slight padding never recurs and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The echo-cartographer premise is fresh, yet immediately intuitive: walls as tapestries of absorbed sound. Combining analog film, half-burned paper, and vegetal reclamation synthesizes retro-tech and eco-SF without exposition dumps. Risky choice to make climax an act of shelving one’s own notebook pays off—quiet, irreversible, memorable. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic scavenger; the specificity of acoustic archaeology drives every beat.</comment>
