<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Margot’s interior contradiction—burned yet still clinging to agency—stays alive in every beat: the pocketed pillbox feels heavy, the cliff’s ice cuts her palm, the folder’s weight is measured against three fugitive years. Each micro-choice (climb, read snow-code, pocket both pillboxes) externalizes her hierarchy of values without label-speak. The final line “no longer burned but forged” crystallizes Earned Stasis: she accepts permanent exile as the price of relevance. Only the handshake-like phrasing “unused courage” flirts with abstraction, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pillbox → coordinates → bluff → snow-codes → Viktor’s reveal → acceptance. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“Zephyr Bluff”), well inside the 120-word safety window. The closure beat—“forged”—delivers conceptual cost: she trades country for conscience, a price legible in the twin pillboxes she now carries. Minor ellipsis: we never see her actually open the folder, yet the beat still lands because the object’s weight is dramatized through her grip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cliff performs as micro-setting: ice-crusted Cyrillic dictates her path, melting雪-codes mirror the burning of her identity, and the dissipating mist literalizes her new visibility. Weather and rock constrain footwear, line of sight, and tactical retreat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—“silver hush” is auditory suppression first, poetic second. One hairline slip: “the whole broken machinery of nations” edges toward aerial abstraction, but it is brief and immediately re-grounded in descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the mole or remain ghosted—tightens once: the folder’s appearance collapses her trilemma (run forever, suicide via morphine, or fight back) into a single active path. Escalation is causal: each snow-code cluster narrows her tactical options until the final choice is the only one left that preserves agency. Cost is visible: the melting雪-codes erase her trail, literalizing irreversibility. The price isconceptual rather than visceral, but still felt—she can never return to pre-burn anonymity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of re-forging identity through betrayal emerges without moralizing: the pillbox’s return, the folder’s weight, and the melting雪-codes form a silent triad that reweights “fixing what’s broken” as self-transformation rather than restitution. Subtext operates in objects, not speeches—Viktor’s apology is cut short by gesture. Final image of descent reframes spring tilt from renewal to annealing. One soft echo—“the whole broken machinery of nations”—leans toward editorial assertion, capping the score just below exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Margot’s perceptual filter: “silver hush” is auditory suppression, “engraved pillbox” is tactile guilt, “handwriting in tiny scratches” is visual proof of loyalty. Syntax mirrors mountaineer breathlessness—clauses shorten on the climb, lengthen during the reveal. No head-hopping; Viktor’s interior is surfaced only through what Margot can see (gesture, voice timbre). One clause—“the world spread out…fixable”—leans omniscient, but the sentence immediately re-anchors via her foot choosing the next ledge, preserving distance control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “swallowing sound and sight in its silver hush” performs atmosphere while foreshadowing sensory erasure. No synonym churn; “mist,” “hush,” and “silver” recur only when they re-weight meaning at closure. Metaphor remains physically coherent—mist as living thing does not violate world logic. One template cadence appears—“three years…” anaphora—but it is purposefully cadenced for heartbeat effect and is paid off in the final line’s “forged,” justifying its retention.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Snow-code as dead-drop is fresh espionage tradecraft; melting medium supplies natural self-wipe. The “unused courage” trope is familiar, but the story redeems it by literalizing the storage location as a cliff face she must physically descend. Conceptual risk: quiet ending replaces gunplay with ethical choice; this amplifies rather than hedges stakes. Overall, the synthesis of geological and emotional annealing feels inevitable in hindsight, though not radically unprecedented.</comment>
