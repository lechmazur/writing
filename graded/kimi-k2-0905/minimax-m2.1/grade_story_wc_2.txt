<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maren’s grief and “uncertainly certain” trait generate clear motive; the irony of fixer of dead clocks vs. her frozen personal clock is vivid. Still, she only observes, walks, descends—no on-page choice that changes anything; agency is deferred to whatever she finds below. Closure is pending, so no earned cost yet. Characterization stout but incomplete until she acts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure is classic single-scene descent: letter → greenhouse → stairwell; causality is sequential, not tightening. Stakes declared (compass, Elias) but no reversal or cost paid in these 266 words; ending is pure threshold. Closure therefore “Charged Poise” at best—valid but fragile. Orientation clean, transitions clean; escalation missing keeps it shy of 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass, rust, leaves, mineral dampness—each filtered through Maren’s restorer eye; sensory economy is good. “Iron frame rusted to the color of dried blood” is specific and stakes the mood. Greenhouse and stairwell track spatially; no clutter. Yet nothing in the environment yet forces a tactical choice; description is evocative but not yet instrumental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover compass → recover Elias) is signaled early; pressure is one-directional descent. No active opposition or trade-off surfaces in-scene; danger is only atmospheric. The beat advances location, not jeopardy. Sufficient for a 6-plus, but no tightening/ narrowing of options keeps it from 7-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of certainty vs. chaos is embedded in occupation and self-description; compass as lost axis of order is implicit but not yet repriced. Subtext is present (she fixes dead time while her own waits) but no culminating reweighting yet. Potential strong, but must pay off later.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third close feels intimate, tactile, steady psychic distance. Diction—“uncertainly certain,” “broken-clock tinkerer”—is character-locked and rhythmic. No dialogue, hence no voice clash; prose itself becomes her voice. Clean, purposeful, near 8-level control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs, concrete nouns, almost no scaffolding; rhythm modulates with descent. One minor echo: “neglected greenhouse” twice in three lines. Otherwise lean and propulsive; metaphors consistent (rust = dried blood) and apt for POV. Line-level craft solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Clock-restorer + lost compass gives fresh spin on grief-recovery quest; subterranean waterfall under ruined greenhouse is memorable image combo. Yet narrative arc so far is conventional mystery descent—needs later twist to feel transformative. Ingredients original; plot motion still familiar.</comment>
