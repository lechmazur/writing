<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—gossamer sheets, gold leaf on cuffs—and her grief for her 师傅 is embodied in the hush of the greenhouse tunnels. The final decision to write the unspoken words is earned by the map journey and the visual proof of his gilded letters. Yet the stakes of her own silence (what she personally risks by speaking) stay abstract; we see her inherit the task more than struggle with it. A sharper contradiction inside her—fear of toxic air vs fear of dishonesty—would have pushed this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the candlelit room becomes a garden again because Mira chooses to write, reweighting the premise that candor can still grow. The zinc plate’s coordinates trigger the journey; the shredded map supplies causal steps; the “lost conversations” wall supplies visible cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of hidden/gilded words thickens until the final image crystallizes meaning. One minor looseness: the plate’s secondary etching is revealed by a quick tilt to flame, a micro-convenience that slightly dulls the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The toxic-amber sky, zinc plate worn to “metal memory,” and succulents surviving on “memory of water” are selective, sensory, and filtered through Mira’s calligrapher eye. Greenhouse tunnels and collapsed halls provide spatial pressure that funnels her to the letter-room. The plate itself acts as micro-setting/tool, constraining the final inscription choice. Only the city’s vertical scale remains slightly vague, keeping this just under exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mira recover the words honesty cost and pay that cost herself? Each map fragment raises the price of proceeding deeper into derelict zones. The moment she chooses to write with her own gold leaf tightens the stake—she now risks sharing her 师傅’s fate. The escalation is single-curve but coherent; a more explicit obstacle (air toxicity flare, physical weakness) would have made the price visceral and pushed higher.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—candor as survival—emerges through the gilded letters, the wilting 师傅, and the unsent wall, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: Mira’s fingers on corroded type, gold catching candlelight like “small suns.” The final image of a garden of silence grown from speech refuses a moral, offering Charged Poise instead. A hair less resonance because Mira’s own prior self-censorship is only implied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual signature—letters “beneath her fingers,” sky “churned amber,” gold leaf turning cuffs into suns. Syntax lengthens during discovery, then compresses as she begins to write, mirroring breath. No head-hop; diction remains within her craft-born lexicon. One microscopic filter slip: “she understood then” could be shaved to pure image, but voice holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description, metaphor, and emotional advance woven without scaffold. Rhythm breathes: long inhalations of setting, quick exhalations of action. Metaphors stay consistent (garden, metal memory, suns of gold) and avoid muddle. Only a single paraphrase loop (“growing upward, growing inward, growing truthful”) risks cadence redundancy, but it reads intentional to accrual design.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing post-climate-collapse greenhouse city with calligraphic treasure hunt feels fresh; the “postal plate as breadcrumb” is a lovely repurposing of obsolete tech. Turning undelivered mail into a literal subterranean garden reframes a familiar trope of lost letters. Specificity—gold leaf cuffs, zinc memory—prevents generic slip. Concept does not explode genre but executes its synthesis with conviction and sensory exactitude.</comment>
