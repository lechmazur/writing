<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mood-rich interiority but no contradictory impulse under pressure; keeper never doubts or wavers, so the “accidental” trait feels declared, not dramatized. Final stance reprises earlier beat without new cost. Voice distinctive yet emotionally static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: laughing herald alone holds knowledge of three ships saved, cost of eternal solitude felt in “burden and gift.” Accumulative/textural lens holds—pattern of laughter → light → refraction → safe passage tightens once. Orientation clear by 120 w. Causality soft (no turn, only deepening) but coherent under lyric design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass wick and emerald panes act as micro-setting that constraints method; star-caught light refracts through keeper’s palm, guiding ships. Sensory hierarchy tuned to keeper’s ritual priorities. Spatial choreography clean; lighthouse interior tracked stair by stair. Environment charges final image—green blaze smiles back at horizon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake early: guide three unseen ships safely. Pressure escalates by density—each ship materializing tightens the ritual demand—but no lived option is foreclosed; keeper never risks failure or personal loss. Cost abstract (eternal vigilance) rather than tactile on page. Meets single-deepening rule for lyric mode yet lacks visible price that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of accidental creation emerges through recurrent refraction motif: yesterday’s shadows become tomorrow’s dawn. No explicit moral; resonance carried by final image of sky smiling back. Ambiguity lingers—laughter as benediction or curse—anchored in specific glass-light ritual. Could climb higher if cost were sharpened on page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains distinct storm-herald idiom: thunder laughter, velvet-case light. Syntax waxes and wanes with keeper’s breath-like cadence; no head-hopping. Controlled psychic distance; diction never exceeds keeper’s mythic register. Purposeful repetition (“laughed again”) teaches pattern and pays off in final echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lush but selective metaphor; no mixed vehicles. Occasional modifier stacks (“fragile and essential all at once”) slow propulsion yet serve incantatory rhythm. Information density high; each sentence advances ritual or stakes. Zero loops, no scaffold. Read-aloud ear test passes—varied sentence lengths mirror keeper’s breathing focus.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of lighthouse keeper, star-captured wick, and accidental prophecy feels fresh; refractive guidance via internal reflection is non-obvious magical tech. Post-newspaper age offers quiet world-loss frame without exposition dump. Risky lyric structure commits fully and lands cleanly. Could edge higher with stronger tangible cost.</comment>
