<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mina’s interiority is concrete and character-specific (the cinnamon/woodsmoke memory lands without cliché); the decision to heft her own stone crystallizes a credible internal shift with visible cost. The researcher’s “backwards aging” remains a label—never embodied or tested under pressure—so his contradiction is asserted, not dramatized. Because the decisive change is hers alone, the story squeaks past the 9+ gate, but the mentor’s lack of micro-choice keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the ripple pattern and held to the end; the final image of Mina pitching her own stone delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, where, when legible), and each sensory ring tightens the texture rather than stalls momentum. No causal breaks or teleporting props; the withheld revelation is paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Environment and object interleave: the floating platform limits movement, the pond’s surface acts as mirror/timer, and the sycamore hush supplies acoustic texture that modulates with each ripple. Sensory hierarchy skews to Mina’s bias—smell of grandmother’s kitchen arrives as intrusive memory, not checklist. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and distances track across the single scene. The grotto is named but never tactilely inhabited, a minor missed constraint that keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn vanishing by enduring delay”—is signaled early and deepens through each ripple; the fourth circle forces a stance crystallization that forecloses passive watching. Cost is legible: Mina relinquishes her expectation of being taught and accepts lifelong apprenticeship. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but the pattern break at ring four satisfies the lens. Persistent constraint (she must keep throwing stones) is implied, not nailed to the final image, so it stops short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the pedagogy of withheld revelation; no character moralizes. The cinnamon memory and future-vision reweight “vanishing” as recursive return, not escape. Ambiguity is coherent— reader can read vanishing as death, memory, or enlightenment without authorial nudge. Final image avoids sermon; the stone arcs back into the water, re-pricing the premise with quiet inevitability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mina’s perceptual filter; diction (“sycamore hush,” “smooth as worry”) is specific without purple drift. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for waiting, clipped fragments when memory intrudes. Compression is purposeful—“the researcher had no other name that mattered”—and pattern-taught early. No head-hopping or register drift; voice under peak stress retains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with near-zero scaffolding; only one paraphrase loop (“each circle born from the last, all of them traveling outward”) survives cut test. Metaphors stay consistent to water/wood registers; no mixed vehicles. High information density without clutter. One filter-verb cluster (“she watched… she saw… she understood”) appears mid-scene but does not infect the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “learn by withholding” structure flips the usual mentor trope; ripple-as-curriculum feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails—names could change without altering arc—but the sensory specificity of cinnamon/woodsmoke and the backwards-aging hook supply enough particularity. Risk is moderate, not bold; still, the synthesis of meditation manual and speculative mentor story avoids gimmickry.</comment>
