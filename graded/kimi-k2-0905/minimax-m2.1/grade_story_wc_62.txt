<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—wanting to dismiss the “spectral mentorship” yet yielding to its ritual—plays out in embodied micro-choices (leaving tools, unrolling ribbon, speaking the poem aloud). Each action is charged by a visible cost: the admission that her chisels alone can’t carry grief, handing the labor of memory over to hands she once denied. The final renunciation of words in favor of handed-down gesture is earned and irreversible, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon’s last whisper reweights stone from monument to way-station, costing her the safety of rational disbelief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every imagistic loop (glass, migration, ribbon) thickens until the cadence shift at “this is enough” crystallizes new rules for her craft. Cost is legible in the final line—“patient and eternal”—where eternity is now a negotiated burden, not a promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse glass, monarch-stained sky, and moss-covered table function as micro-setting that constrains her choice to speak the poem aloud—humidity carries sound, glass holds ghosts. Sensory hierarchy obeys a carver’s eye: texture of moss, color of rust, squeak of flagstone. Spatial choreography stays clean as she moves from pane to table to threshold, each position tightening the ritual. No 9.0 because the estate’s broader geography remains vague, but that vagueness never affects the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—how to shape communal grief—tightens when the butterfly cloud ascends, forcing her public utterance of the ribbon poem. The ascent is not coincidence but ecological deadline; refusal would leave her outside the collective motion. Cost is visible: she forfeits the privacy of silent carving and accepts the spectral audience as co-witnesses. Agency is Accumulative: each loop of glass, poem, and wingbeat layers pressure until speech is the only release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the migrating image: grief is not anchored stone but weather that moves through a town like painted ladies. Subtext lives in unspoken family dinner absences—empty chairs that taught her to trade poems like bread. The final image of “hands that hold grief like stone” reweights stone from permanence to passage, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the ghosts may be hallucination, but the communal ritual is real either way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: a carver’s tactile diction—“whispering silk,” “drumming stillness,” “thundering calm”—remains grounded in stone and glass. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short clauses at butterfly lift, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; internal voice never leaks into editorial certainty. Filter verbs are sparse and earned (“seemed to emanate”) where perception itself is tentative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Varied sentence rhythm supports breathless ascent: cumulative clauses stack like wingbeats, then cut to three-word shard “this is enough.” Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass “rusting into autumn,” humidity that “carries sound”—no mixed vehicles. Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges “hands … patient and eternal.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: graveyard artisan meets lepidopterist ghost-mentor via heirloom ribbon poems. The premise reframes cemetery craft as living migration—stone not terminus but temporary roost. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced yet disciplined: every floral phrase earns its keep by reappearing in the final reweighting. Specificity of trade detail (chisels “waiting like old friends”) prevents generic grief template.</comment>
