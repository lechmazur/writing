<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s “bright attentiveness” is shown through concrete pattern-reading choices that escalate stakes; the final decision to leave the door open is earned by her prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority stays specific (“she understood then why the case had come to her”) without therapy-speak. Flaw—no embodied contradiction in the final beat; the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping at 7.9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of 47s and song-echoes tightens until the reveal that Yuki is “distributed.” Closure is a Charged Poise—Maren chooses to trace deletion rather than restore, reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost. One transition (archive → old subdirectory) is clean; orientation anchored by word 84. No causal break, but final cost is abstract, not felt on the body, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Server-farm hum, frozen profiles, and looping 47-second song fragments create a lived-in micro-setting that directly constrains Maren’s listening choices. Patch constellation recharges final image. Selective sensory triage—sound over sight—mirrors her attentional bias. Environment could have sharpened one tactile obstacle to push her choice further; hence 8.1, not 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find what deleted means”—tightens as each 47 recurrence eliminates the “coincidence” option. Agency is intellectual (decoding, scrolling, choosing to leave door open) rather than physical; cost is conceptual but legible. No secondary reversal; one meaningful deepening suffices. Persistent constraint (company oversight) is implied, not dramatized on page, holding below 8.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of digital afterlife vs corporate erasure emerges through song-echoes and 47-pattern without moralizing. Final image of “door left open” reweights prior silence into ethical stance. Subtext in patch constellation and song loops is coherent. Avoids explicit thesis, but resonance is more cerebral than emotional, capping at 8.3.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Maren’s perceptual filter—“bright attentive” diction, rhythmic repetition of “echo of forgotten songs,” no head-hop. Syntax mirrors pattern-recognition mind: clauses stack like data strata. One register lift into “commercially undesirable” is brief and motive-aligned. Distinct voice sustained under pressure; closure line keeps cadence control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: “digital ghost images” does world + emotion in three words. No synonym loops or template cadences. Metaphors stay coherent (“silence that echoed louder”). Minor filter verb cluster (“she noticed,” “she understood”) in explanatory beats but never in peak image. Final sentence is clean; no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cold-case noir with server-farm afterlife feels fresh; patch constellation and 47-loop are specific inventions, not stock tropes. Conceptual risk—distributed consciousness as archival haunting—commits fully. Could push further if corporate lie had leaked into one sensory anomaly Maren can’t un-hear. Synthesis is memorable but not yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
