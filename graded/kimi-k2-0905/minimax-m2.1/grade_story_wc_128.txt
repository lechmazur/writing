<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s “whimsically attentive” broker mind shows once—spotting the locket symbolism—but her decision to search the library is lightly motivated; the final gift exchange crystallizes a gentle internal shift with cost (she now carries the annotated program), satisfying the 9+ test for a quiet renunciation of detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the envelope mis-delivery tightens pattern until the midnight gift reweights “invisible labor.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maren’s private ritual expands—cost is felt in the annotated program she accepts. One scaffold: “walking home…already planning” states the change already shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Starlit library hull, salt-jasmine air, and the domed skylight supply concrete, selective detail filtered through Maren’s tide-eye. The locket photo acts as micro-setting that charges the final exchange; environment quietly guides her stay until midnight. Could use one tactile library prop to push past 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“attention to invisible threads”—is signaled early; pressure deepens as each artifact (envelope, photo, program) reweights that stake. No reversal, but one meaningful tightening at midnight when she accepts the annotated program, foreclosing her former neutrality with visible social cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unseen labor emerges through objects (locket, program annotations) rather than exposition. Final image reconfigures Maren’s private lighthouse ritual without moralizing. Slight cap because thematic question is stable but not complexly ambiguous; resonance is tender yet single-note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s maritime perceptual signature—“reading the tides,” “freight weights against moon phases.” Rhythm modulates from languid stroll to hushed library cadence. One filter-verb cluster (“found herself walking,” “found a single page”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical density is purposeful and taught early; no mixed metaphors. Scaffolding limited to one explanatory clause (“she understood immediately”). High information density: net-mender grandmother, shipping-error backstory, lighthouse ritual all woven in two sentences. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized options”) barely drifts from POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh angle: cargo broker who maps emotional freight instead of containers. Locket-photo trigger is familiar, but pairing with music-copyist invisible labor feels specific. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric accumulation rather than twist—yet coherence and voice distinction lift it above template.</comment>
