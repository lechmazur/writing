<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The coachman’s motives—language-keeper, seed-bearer, ferryman of ends—cohere in the single gesture of planting a pod; the smile at “first green thread” shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete via reef-rib touch and gull-cry translation; no label-speak. Yet the arc is renunciation-to-hope rather than contradiction-in-scene; the only inner friction is memory vs future, told more than tested under live pressure. Still, the endurance forecloses despair and is legible, satisfying the earned-stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “first green thread” rewrites the battlefield’s meaning and carries conceptual cost—the coachman’s life-work now complete. Causal chain holds: because he hears treaty-calls → plants memory-seeds → reef answers. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“edge of the jetty”). One minor soft spot: the fertilisation spell succeeds without resistance or micro-failure, so tension plateaus rather than tightens in the final third; enough cost is felt to keep the lens intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bleached reef-ribs and narrowing jetty planks tactilely guide kneeling/planting choices; twilight shift from rose to purple mirrors rising possibility. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—bird-call Latin, salt-tang mud, pod-grain against palm. Environment directly supplies the planting medium and the first-response mirror; no postcard sweep. Constraint on choice is present, but the reef’s skeletal scale could be even more intimately threaded through the last beat to reach the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can memory out-argue extinction?”—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is Accumulative: each seeded pod thickens the submerged concord until the pattern breaks surface. The birds’ hush and green thread provide the single meaningful tightening. Cost is conceptual (last ferryman spends final currency of knowledge) rather than tangible, keeping pressure legible but not viscerally acute; still sufficient for this lyric frame.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through image-pattern: dead tongue, seed-memory, drowned city-whisper converging on resurrection without moralising. Subtle dialectic—human culpability vs biotic persistence—remains open; no final sentence sermon. Final image reweights “narrow vastness” from spatial loneliness to germinal horizon. Particulars (pod, reef, bird treaty) carry the idea, not abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance; syntax lengthens like tidal breath, then contracts at green-thread payoff. Diction stays within a weathered ferryman’s lexicon yet lifts to liturgical cadence for the spell, signalling code-switching without leaving POV. No filter-verb clutter; perception is auditory-tactile (“grain of it against his palm”). Voice is singular, sustained, and teaches its own compressed elisions early; payoff is lucid.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Figurative density is high but patterned (reef = beast ribs, pods = arguments) and charges closure. One mixed metaphor (“submerged concord of treaty between life and death”) is forgiven because the phrase is re-prised and re-defined by the green thread. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; information density strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing post-collapse ecofiction with psychopomp ferryman is fresh; seed-as-vocabulary-of-the-dead converts restoration trope into linguistic ritual. Risk of lyric stasis is offset by tangible planting gesture. Specificity of “three wars” pods and bleached reef keeps it from generic cli-fi. Transformation feels inevitable yet not derivative; no famous scene echoes.</comment>
