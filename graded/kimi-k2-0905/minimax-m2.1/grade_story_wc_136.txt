<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aria’s “analytically artistic” lens is dramatized in every beat—she decodes cracks, weighs geometric against poetic readings, and finally wields the ticket punch on her own silence. The interior contradiction (fear vs certainty) stays embodied, not labeled, and the final spoken truth costs her the protective myth of dispassionate observer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal spine of mentor-dare → arrow-cracks → fortress → self-punch holds without gaps; each micro-choice narrows the path to the station. Closure lands as Decisive Change: the unspoken truth is perforated into public air, foreclosing her former silence with visible shimmer-cost. The drive lens is Causal, intact to the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Body, tool, and fog function as micro-setting: the phantom punch’s weight shifts from heirloom to stylus; the mist vault literally lowers visibility, corralling her steps; star-smudges mirror the fading of external maps and the sharpening of internal ones. Environment constrains navigation and charges the final confession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the fortress or remain voiceless”—is signaled early and tightens when the arrows recalculate underfoot, forcing her to risk vocalization. The punch’s warming and the cracks’ steerage create escalating micro-costs that culminate in public self-exposure. One meaningful tightening suffices; agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of mapping: external cartography collapses into internal inscription. The final shimmer-perforation reweights all prior arrows as invitations to self-revelation, offering resonant ambiguity—no moral, only the cost of spoken vulnerability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Aria’s perceptual filter: surgical noticing, poetic leaps, synesthetic star-smudges. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under stress (“trembling certainty”). Syntax mirrors her mind—long analytical clauses cut by imagistic fragments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold; only two near-adjacent “mist” nouns echo. Metaphors stay coherent (stars as punched velvet), rhythm modulates with discovery, and no filter-verb clusters dull immediacy. Clean enough for 9-band, minor lexical repeats keep it just shy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “fortress of unspoken truths” as an abandoned train station whose pillars are cracked by withheld confessions is a fresh synthesis; the phantom punch that perforates air instead of cardstock weaponizes a nostalgic object into a stylus of disclosure. Risky premise pays off because every beat obeys the invented physics of silence-made-stone.</comment>
