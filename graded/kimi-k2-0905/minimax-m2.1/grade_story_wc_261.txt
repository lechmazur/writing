<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is richly embodied—cold stone on palm, scarred hands against plaster—and her contradictory impulses (guilt vs. need to remember) play out in concrete micro-choices like crawling into the tunnel and pressing her prints to his. The final beat of earned stasis—accepting the scars as love, not shame—pays off the telepathic ivy cue and coffee-ring backstory. A hairline slip: the moment she “realizes it was an accident” is declared rather than dramatized, keeping it just under 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hourglass finishes, frost melts, and Maya’s stance toward her scars flips with undeniable emotional cost (“more awake than she had ever been”). Causal chain holds—hourglass triggers plant memory → tunnel → brother’s prints → reparative recognition—each beat tightening options under the Accumulative lens. One tiny causal gap: the tunnel entrance appears without prior setup, but the coffee-cup chronology retrofits motivation cleanly. Meets 9+ cost test on the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tower basement, frost-rimmed hourglass, and plaster handprints are tactile, selective, and steer choice—she descends because the tunnel opens, she aligns her scars because the prints are 3-D. Dawn light and meteor hush function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no drifting geography. Just shy of 9 because the ivy telepathy rule is introduced late and doesn’t constrain physical action earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“open wounds to close them”—is signaled in grandmother’s note and escalates as each artifact (hourglass, coffee rings, prints) forces Maya to trade denial for memory. One meaningful tightening: pressing scarred palms to brother’s prints forecloses escape and crystallizes cost. Pressure is accumulative/textural rather than adversarial, fitting the lens. Could use a slightly sharper external risk beat to reach 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “miracles arriving only when we are ready” emerges through frost melting on the hourglass and the meteor streak—images, not exposition. Subtext lives in coffee rings as temporal grief-records and in scars reframed as love-marks. Final meteor hush reweights all prior cold/light imagery without moralizing. Achieves CR-level repricing of grief itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a lyrical yet grounded idiom—“world held its breath like a child waiting for a thunderclap”—that stays within Maya’s perceptual range. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for anesthesia haze, clipped phrases for tunnel crawl. No head-hopping; telepathic ivy is still filtered through her sensory crack-up. One clause drifts toward editorial (“displaced miracle of her survival”) but overall voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action + atmosphere—without scaffold: “frost slowly migrate across the surface as the sand began its descent.” Metaphors are clean, mixed only once (“puzzle piece she had been holding upside down”). Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Minor elevation in register on “conceptual repricing of grief” is earned by context. Closure image is uncluttered and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines plant telepathy, forensic coffee-ring chronology, and time-slipped hourglass into an organic whole that feels specific to this grief. Risk-taking—quiet surrealism inside realism—heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Brother’s plaster handprints as sculptural farewell is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Not quite 9 because the telepathy rule enters late and could echo earlier for fuller integration.</comment>
