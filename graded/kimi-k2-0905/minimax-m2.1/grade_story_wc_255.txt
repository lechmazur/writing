<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—her need to pass the reed-tongue gift forward while guarding her color-blind sight—shows in embodied micro-choices (placing the petal beside his burned hand). The apprentice’s want-to-see is dramatized through silent deciphering, not label-speak. Cost is legible: she permanently yields her talisman, he kneels into a new vocation. Yet the “innocently cunning” trait is stated once and never tested under pressure; the glassblower stays a scenic backdrop, supplying no secondary pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed-tongue transfer crystallizes a before/after for both youths and reweights the courtyard as a site of awakenings. Causal chain holds: because Mira traded paintings for the reed, therefore she can now trade it again to awaken the apprentice; because he deciphers the leaf spiral, therefore he kneels—legible cost in the surrender of the object and the burn-calloused hand that accepts it. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of flawed glass + leaf arrangements grows until the final fusion image. Minor slack: “phoenix rose” frame is poetic but unfelt; no constraint or price flows from the cosmic event into the intimate beat, keeping closure local rather than world-touched.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory economy—heat-rosy furnace air, reed tongue worn “smooth,” cracked vessels that “bled” color—keeps paragraphs tight. The courtyard’s discarded-glass pile functions as micro-setting: its sharp angles literally guide Mira’s palette choices and the final mixed-material arrangement. Spatial choreography clean; apprentice moves from bench to kneel without impossible jumps. For 9+ gate: the blue shard placed beside the petal does constrain the apprentice’s final perception and charges the image, satisfying the object-as-setting test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the apprentice awaken to imperfect beauty?—is signaled when he first studies her leaf spiral. One meaningful deepening: the reed-tongue gift moves from private relic to shared covenant, narrowing options—she can’t retrieve it, he must now act. Agency sits with Mira’s micro-arrangements; cost is felt in surrender of her talisman. Pressure stays internal/relational; no external antagonist needed, but escalation is gentle—would welcome one sharper beat where misreading a leaf pattern risks tangible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: imperfection as transferable gift. Subtext lives in the apprentice’s burned hands cradling fragile petals—beauty earned through bodily cost. The final image (glass shard + petal) offers conceptual repricing: flaw becomes part of the language itself. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about what songs the apprentice will now “play” with his new sight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hugs Mira’s color-blind perception—shadow, texture, form—without filtering. Syntax grows leaner at the gift hand-off: “She placed it in his palm.” Apprentice’s dialogue is minimal, colloquial, goal-driven: “You’re speaking to me... What does it mean?”—serves discovery rather than exposition. No head-hopping; glassblower remains external, as he should. Voice distinction strong enough for 9-band aspirant; tiny register lift in “bartered awakenings” feels authored, not character-bound, keeping it just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences open with participles only when action is simultaneous. High density: “colors that had bled together in ways he hadn’t intended” does double duty—world rule + foreshadowing Mira’s sight. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. One mixed metaphor: “understanding blooming across his features like the first color a colorblind person might ever truly perceive” – “blooming” + vision metaphor slightly muddled but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so −0.2. Otherwise clean propulsion to final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blind painter + plant cryptography + glass discard heap creates a stakes logic specific to this page. Trope of “mute girl teaches boy to see” is inverted—she is not healing or romantic, she is bartering forward an economic chain of sight. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in final image. Could edge higher if the cosmic phoenix frame were more than decorative atmosphere.</comment>
