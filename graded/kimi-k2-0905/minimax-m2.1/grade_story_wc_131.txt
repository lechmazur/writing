<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s “methodical kindness” is embodied in tactile pipe-reading and the tape-reverie; the maternal voice implants a concrete micro-choice—pass the message—whose cost (invisible labor stays invisible) is felt. Interiority stays specific to her sensorial world; no diagnostic labels. The final smile registers earned stasis: she renounces ever being seen, doubling down on unseen custodianship. Only minor withholding: we get no contradictory impulse that might momentarily tempt her toward revelation, so depth stops just short of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (sapphire hush, pipe whispers, tape fragment) deepens the dominant stake—unseen custodianship—until the mother’s voice reweights Maren’s vocation as transmission. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “she exists not to be seen but to help the lost find their way” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. Pattern taught early (“unseen work matters”) pays off without causality breaks. Orientation anchored by word 70; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library infrastructure doubles as character: pipe chases dictate movement, floorboard creaks steer solitude, outage re-colors light to sapphire. Micro-setting (tape fragment) constrains the final ethical choice—transmit rather than keep. Selective sensory hierarchy (touch, vibration, muffled voice) mirrors Maren’s vocation. Could edge higher if one environmental detail recoiled on her physically—cold burn, metal cut—to embody cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain unseen yet useful—tightens when the tape offers a chance to speak: keep it (invisibility intact) or pass it (visibility through proxy). Passing the message forecloses any future claim to authorship, a felt price under the Accumulative lens. Pressure escalates by density, not reversal: each remembered instruction intensifies the obligation to custodianship. One more beat of risk (what if tape is erased by delay?) would push 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: love travels best when sender vanishes. Subtext lives in gesture—cradling “not debris but a covenant”—and in the irony that disappearance is the only visibility that counts. Maternal voice reprises at closure, reweighting unseen labor as trans-temporal parenting. No moralizing line mars the resonance; ambiguity (will the child ever hear?) lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s shoulder, filtering every noun through her tactile lexicon—“infrastructure’s language,” “magnetic ribbon.” Syntax lengthens during discovery then compresses at the smile, mirroring breath. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within custodial register. One head-hop attempt—“a student who has been struggling finds the answer”—is brief, forgivable, and serves the conceptual reprice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose sustains lyric density without purple drift: “sapphire hush,” “colonized its substance” remain exact. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Rhythm modulates from long clause (opening) to staccato final line, propelling closure. Metaphors stay coherent; only minor scaffold—“she has found…what she has always been searching for”—could be trimmed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “hidden guardian” trope is inverted: custodian’s triumph is deeper burial, not rescue. Fusion of ferromagnetic relic with maternal time-capsule feels fresh and specific to this library’s veins. Risk-taking lies in lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist, and it pays off. Conceptual commitment never wavers; no retreat to easy sentiment.</comment>
