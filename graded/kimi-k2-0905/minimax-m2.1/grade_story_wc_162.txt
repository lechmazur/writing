<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her shift from passive drift to deliberate crossing is embodied in palm-on-wood micro-choices. The “featherly determined” trait remains label-only until the final step; a single wobble under pressure would have pushed this to 9. Cost is felt in the lost intuitive tether to her mother, but the renunciation is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: butterfly effect → loss of intuition → logbook cue → grain-reading → terrace drift → crossing. Each beat tightens options; the final step collapses distance with earned inevitability. Closure is a Charged Poise image—mother with compass—reweighting every prior threshold. Cost is palpable: the old atmospheric intuition is gone, payment for the new map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prism terrace as micro-setting constrains every action—light fractures, boards record pressure, drift carries her to shore. Grain pattern becomes a legible archive that makes the crossing possible; wood remembers so Elara can decide. anchoring is late (~150 words) but disorientation is taught early and pays off at closure, so Orientation Test is waived. Final image of “diagram drawn in new weather” crystallizes both sky and village as mutable text.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she cross the sacred threshold—signals on first page and escalates through each decoded pattern. One meaningful tightening: realization that drift is directional collapses curiosity into irrevocable step. Agency is decision, not confrontation; cost is the permanent loss of her old atmospheric intuition. Coincidence (terrace happens to follow flight path) complicates rather than rescues, feeding the sense of fated logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “every boundary is a doorway” but resists stating; it accrues through corn mazes, weather codes, and pressure maps in wood. Final image of compass pointing toward transformation offers non-literal answer to sacred threshold question. No moralizing, only crystallized choice. Ambiguity lingers: will the new atmospheric rules someday erase this map too?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Elara’s perceptual filter—“featherly,” “prism light,” “crooked rivers of grain.” Syntax mirrors her drift: long reflective sentences that suddenly contract at the crossing. No dialogue, so voice remains pure, rhythmic, and uncompressed. Patterned diction (“necessary distances,” “sacred threshold”) is taught early and reprised with shifted weight at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths swell and contract with emotional temperature. Information density high—each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed metaphor (“diagram drawn in the new weather”) is minor. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; wood grain analysis is concrete, not abstract. Peak beat—the step off the terrace—uses spare, unadorned diction that lets the cost land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological butterfly effect re-cast as mother-daughter cartography of thresholds. Corn mazes + pilot logbooks + wood grain memory feels idiosyncratic, inevitable, not grafted. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in Charged Poise ending. Could drop 0.3 if “featherly determined” had been more than a coinage, but the whole texture is memorably singular.</comment>
