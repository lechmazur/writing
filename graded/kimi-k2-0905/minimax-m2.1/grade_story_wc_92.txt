<comment>Elara’s calmly inventive trait is stated repeatedly but only shown in one mechanical beat—rotating the quill to the sundial angles; no contradictory impulse or visible cost accompanies it, so the “inventive” tag feels ornamental rather than lived. Interiority drifts into explanatory summary (“her motivation crystallized”) instead of embodied tension, and the final decision to transmit the revolution is declared, not dramatized with a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cradle-of-sparks network is now active, reweighting the regime’s control; cost is conceptual (regime vulnerability) rather than personal, acceptable under CR. Causal chain is thin—blackout → quill resonance → parchment → decision—but each step is legible under a Hybrid lens; the missing beat is any on-page obstacle or risk that tightens options before the final commitment.</comment>

<comment>Fort, courtyard, and sundial are sketched with selective sensory strokes; twilight blackout narrows perception to amber glow and shadow, guiding what Elara notices. The half-painted sundial functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the quill’s alignment, thus charging the final image; spatial choreography stays clean across her kneel-trace-rotate sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ignite silent revolution—is signaled late (~200 words in) and never faces an on-page test or trade-off; escalation is a single linear step rather than a tightening. No credible price is dramatized: Elara risks nothing tangible (job, life, ally) in the moment of commitment, so the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of encoded resistance through overlooked artifacts emerges organically from sundial and quill; the regime’s erasure of history is shown via half-painted numerals rather than told. Final image refrains from moralizing, but thematic resonance is muted because the personal cost to Elara is not made legible—she walks away unscathed and untested.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is calm-attentive, filtering scene through geometric pattern recognition. No dialogue to test voice distinction; prose rhythm is steady, slightly elevated (“luminous fort,” “cradle of sparks”) but stays within Elara’s educated lexicon without drifting into purple.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid with varied sentence lengths; opening sentence anchors stakes and atmosphere efficiently. No loops or scaffold; occasional adjective stacks (“faint amber glow,” “harsh white glare”) are purposeful for tonal contrast. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or mechanism—keeping momentum despite reflective lulls.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The “coded sundial + quill key” combo freshens the familiar secret-message trope; integrating blackout as the window of opportunity gives regime-erosion angle. Specificity of bronze resonance and geometric angles feels particular rather than generic spy fare. Risk is moderate—no structural experimentation—but the synthesis is cleanly executed.</comment>
