<comment>Mira’s interiority is character-specific—orthogonal puzzles, brook-side vigils, seed vigilance—yet her contradictions remain summarized rather than enacted in-scene. No micro-choice visibly forks her path; the shift from commercial pressure to seed-patience is declared, not dramatized. Cost is felt, but only in reflective paraphrase (“commercial pressure mounting”) rather than an on-page forfeiture. The seed functions as thematic mirror, not crucible that forces a costly decision.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seed stillness and room iterations accumulate until perception is re-weighted. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the hush of things about to bloom”—with conceptual cost (radical patience over monetized speed), legible on the final page. Orientation anchors within 120 words; single transition from storm to porch is clean, no spatial drift. No causal break, though escalation is more tonal accretion than tightening of options.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory economy: moonlight fracturing across water, eaves drip as “small revelation,” cool brook mist—all filtered through Mira’s puzzle-designer attention. Micro-setting (seed pot, water sound) constrains her nightly stance and ultimately charges the closing image of latent bloom. No exposition dumps; world-rules (seed needs highland cool) learned through action. Spatial choreography never drifts; bodies and props stay anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protecting innovative space against market homogeneity—signaled early, revisited reflectively. Escalation is rhetorical (critics, investors, devotees) rather than an on-page event that forecloses an option; no scene of actual sponsorship walk-out or financial penalty. Seed’s stillness deepens theme but does not tighten external pressure; tension remains conceptual. Cost is diffuse—commercial pressure “mounting” off-stage—so the tightening needed for 8+ bands is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: innovation as cultivation of unknowable bloom-time, resisted against instant-profit monoculture. Subtext sits in seed silence, moonlit water, “storm-born silence”—no overt thesis statements. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Conceptual Repricing lands—time itself becomes the uncommodifiable cost—inviting reflection beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature—orthogonal causality, puzzle hierarchy distrust—pervades every observation. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences under brook hush, shorter percussive clauses when storm is recalled. No head-hopping; diction (“origami nightmares,” “possibility spaces”) stays within her designer lexicon. Read-aloud ear test passes; syntactic variety supports thematic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: lines often do double duty (“moonlight fracture” paints seed + internal state). Figurative language is restrained; only two metaphors per beat, no purple accretion. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. One scaffold-like phrase—“that particular kind of storm-born silence”—but it serves as taught pattern and is paid off at end, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “mysterious seed” frame is re-animated through escape-room designer POV and orthogonal design philosophy. Corpse-flower choice yokes stench-fame to patience-theme, a fresh inflection. Risk-taking in structure—lyric accretion versus causal plot—pays off in conceptual closure. Synthesis feels inevitable: seed stillness reframed as anti-commercial temporality.</comment>
