<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s jittery courier trait is embodied early and re-anchored in trembling hands; the pendant beat shows micro-choice that tilts confidence. Interiority stays concrete, though the final shift to “steady and certain” is asserted more than dramatized. Still, contradictory impulses (grief vs. forward motion) coexist in-scene, and the renunciation of old self-doubt carries visible cost under the aurora closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s vibration reweights Elara’s vocation from relic carrier to wonder-seeder, cost legible in the lone descent. Causal lens holds—each beat (climb, reveal, vibration, visitation) tightens options until the mentor’s dissolve forecloses reunion and crystallizes legacy. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “a hundred deliveries, a hundred ordinary handoffs” could compress.</comment>

<comment>Frost-needled pines, dragonfly-wing veins, and aurora shimmer are filtered through courier eyes, constraining when she lifts the pendant into the light. Cold, wind, and altitude act on body and choice; the overlook supplies the vantage that makes valley lights become “fallen stars,” charging the final image. Micro-setting (pendant as handheld cosmos) directly enables the sympathetic vibration beat. Slight over-adjectival frost glitter, but density serves the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—extend wonder rather than hoard memory—signals early via incomplete handoffs. Tightening occurs when pendant wings move: option of passive remembrance foreclosed, active germination required. Cost is felt: mentor dissolves, leaving Elara alone with new vocation. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image chain: courier weight → pendant vibration → aurora echo → seeding wonder. No explicit thesis; final “germinate something” is invitation, not moral. Subtext in Mira’s fade: absence as catalyst, not wound. Ambiguity lingers—what “wonder” looks like remains unspoken, forcing reader germination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “jittery,” “breath fog and scattered,” “questions dissolved into something warmer.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under decision. No head-hopping; aurora-visit reads as externalized interior event. Distinct courier idiom: “relic courier,” “handoffs,” “germinate”—no generic fantasy diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative clauses build awe, then single-clause cuts (“She tucked the pendant back”) propel descent. No loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“roots of something waiting to break through soil” paired with winged pendant—barely grazes coherence. Line density high; each sentence advances image or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Takes familiar mentor-ghost trope but re-tools it as legacy-tech: pendant as encounter-extender, not memory-preserver. Aurora-as-portal risks cliché yet justifies via sympathetic vibration rule seeded early. Risk taken: no antagonist, no chase, pure interior escalation—paid off by resonant closure. Specificity of courier trade and frost-ridge micro-setting keeps it from generic fantasy pastiche.</comment>
