<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation and temperament are vivid; her micro-choices (knotting rescue lattice, timing the seventeen-minute rest) embody the “esoteric realist” label. Interior contradiction is light—she wavers only in the shift from preservation to interruption—so the arc feels more competent than crucible-tested. Still, the renunciation of monument-building for fragile shelter is earned and costs her three days’ labor, satisfying the closure gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fragility (grotto, vine lattice, monarch, histories) intensifies until the final stillness reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; closure beat—“She would build them again tomorrow”—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost. One causality hairline: the monarch’s recognition of the moth-wing angle is poetic but not rigorously motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto’s suspended garden and evaporative ferns constrain every action—moisture dictates vine pliability, wind holes dictate lattice placement. The moth wing operates as micro-setting/template, literally shaping the rescue knot. Final image of orange dissolving into gray recharges both setting and theme, meeting the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguard overlooked histories via transient marks—tightens when gust destroys the lattice, forcing improvisation that risks total failure. One meaningful deepening: from cataloguing stasis to active interruption of migration disaster. Cost is the broken lattice itself and the future labor of rebuilding; price is legible, though secondary moral stakes (species extinction vs. human memory) remain more asserted than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: impermanence as the only durable witness. Subtext resides in gesture—knotting as historiography, seventeen-minute stillness as monument. Final image reframes earlier cataloguing into iterated caretaking without moral sermon. One minor echo: “histories demanded silence to be heard” borders thesis-statement, but is early and quickly grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, filtering perception through Elara’s taxonomic precision. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under gust, mirroring monarch flight. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on diction control; “blushing stillness,” “esoteric realist” read as intentional idiom, not intrusion. Patterned elision (no species names, no geological dates) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Rhythmic variety supports breath and urgency; figurative density stays under 25% in crisis beats, avoiding muddle. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“cadence,” “taxonomy”) slightly exceeds rugged field-worker lexicon, but consistency and payoff in closure waive higher penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lepidopterist rescue with historiography feels fresh; trope of “last butterfly” is transformed through esoteric signal-craft and grandmother-data. Risk in micro-scale stakes (one insect, one lattice) is embraced rather than inflated, producing quiet universality. Slight overlap with eco-elegy canon, but specificity of moth-wing template and volcanic grotto distinguishes.</comment>
