<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured (“desperately jocular” under duress), the midnight promise is a credible renunciation with social cost, and the logistician’s flaw—evasion of intimacy—drives the closing choice. Micro-choices (offering the recipe chain, accepting the stay) align with motive; only the woman remains a thematic mirror rather than a pressure source, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: rumor → platform → trade rule → midnight vigil. Closure is Earned Stasis: the logistician’s forfeiture of flight is legible, irreversible, paid on-page (“the sound echoed… like a promise kept”). Orientation is clean by 120 words, lens stays situational/ causal hybrid, no prop or logic drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crumbling platform, shattered roof, and creeping ivy are economically filtered through exhaustion and failing light; space is legible and choices (sit, stay, listen) are physically constrained by the decrepit station. Moon-rock fragment serves as micro-setting anchor; environment mirrors internal decay without overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: the station’s liminal decay directly shapes the final vigil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape versus connection—tightens once: the trade rule forces a public, stationary vulnerability that forecloses anonymous exit. Cost is social/ existential rather than physical, but unmistakable on-page. No escalation reversals beyond the single rule, yet that suffices for 600-word scope under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Reciprocity as ancient economy emerges through action, not lecture; loneliness is reframed from private ache to tradable scarcity. Final laugh in the hollow hall reweights the ivy-draped ruin into a site of voluntary exposure—resonant without moralizing. Theme stays implicit, specific, and tied to the logistician’s renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains weary, jesting perceptual signature throughout; syntax elongates under fatigue and contracts at the reveal. No head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly slips in “they had always left before anyone could thank them.” Distinctive diction (“improbable rumor chains,” “healing happened”) sustains lyric tilt without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density—single sentences layer backstory, tone, and stakes. Occasional soft adverbials (“precisely,” “improbably”) and one stacked appositive could tighten, but no loops or mixed metaphors obscure causality. Rhythm modulates with emotional crest; final echo line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Moon-rock-as-social-catalyst and rumor-chain logistics invert familiar quid-pro-quo tales; the disaster-relief legend who barters away anonymity feels fresh. Specificity of the ivy platform and recipe-favor currency prevents generic swap. Risk in quiet stasis ending pays off under situational lens.</comment>
