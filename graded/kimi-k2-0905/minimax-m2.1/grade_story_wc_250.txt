<comment>The guardian’s nineteen-year silence is embodied through micro-choices—mirror angling, silent sitting, light-weaving—so her stillness is active, not abstract. The moment she meets the boy’s gaze, the inherited-survivor identity crystallizes with felt cost: she can never speak her own rescue aloud. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the boy’s interiority is inferred, not dramatized, so the relationship crucible is one-sided.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mirror’s last star-gift reconfigures both their stances—he sees, she endures—cost is the unbreakable silence she accepts. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of woven light tightens until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchor—“cobalt dock after rain”—arrives by line 3. No teleporting props; mirror is introduced with sister’s medical bag cue. Cost is unmistakable: “she had survived because someone had taught her to see the stars” now loops back as price she pays forward.</comment>

<comment>Dock, canal, warehouse shutters, dying streetlight—each is tactile, proximity-based, and filters through guardian’s occupational attention to reflected light. Rain-soaked cobalt planks constrain her barefoot stillness; shutter slats become optical instrument. Dental mirror functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to light/dark under pressure. No world-rule break; spatial choreography tracks cleanly as mirror angles redirect beams across canal. Cobalt dock would break logic if swapped—its color is the necessary reflective surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep the boy on the living side of the water. Tightening occurs when mirror-light patterns replace spoken suicide intervention—one shot, no second chance. Agency is attention, not speech; her refusal to break silence escalates stakes: if he misreads, death continues. Cost is legible: she forfeits ever claiming her own rescue aloud. Escalation is accumulative—each spiral widens the possibility he might choose tomorrow—rather than causal turn, fitting lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated light-weaving: silence can be a transmit/reflect medium for hope. No overt thesis—final image of “stars that had learned to wait” is conceptual repricing. Subtext resides in mirror’s angle, boy’s shoulder slope, star spirals. Ambiguity is productive: reader must decide whether light equals salvation or mere delay. Emotional aftereffect lingers as afterimage on retina. No moralizing line distills the lesson; particulars carry it.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to guardian’s perceptual signature: “water collect the last light,” “frequency of unspoken longing.” Syntax spirals like light—subordinate clauses coil, then settle. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Dental mirror vocabulary stays within ex-dental-assistant POV lexicon. Compression—“stillness was spiralingly calm”—is taught early and paid off in final spiral of light. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is preserved. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for patience, fragment-like beats for flickers.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is controlled: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Metaphors are coherent—“patient circle returning to center” extends water imagery. No mixed metaphors or conflicting vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, memory, and tactical intent. Minor scaffold: “she had learned” repeats twice in opening paragraph; second instance could trim. No synonym churn; “spiralingly” coinage is justified by voice. Closure line “stars that had learned to wait” is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—mute mentor saves suicidal teen—is inverted by making silence the active technology, not deficit. Dental mirror > star-projector is fresh instrument for empathy. Setting-specific detail: cobalt dock, canal warehouses, post-rain light are not generic anywhere. Risky choice to withhold guardian’s past until final paragraph pays off as inheritance loop. Transformation test: if mirror swapped to flashlight, entire optical grammar collapses. No derivative premise drag; synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
