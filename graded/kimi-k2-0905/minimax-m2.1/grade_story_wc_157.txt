<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s “charming rogue scholar” persona is vividly embodied—coat buttoned wrong, seventeen libraries breached, three interrogations escaped—yet the interior contradiction between performative charm and genuine terror is only asserted, not dramatized in the moment of planting. The final smile registers as earned endurance, but the micro-choice that costs her something right now is missing; hence the arc feels 90 % charged, not fully paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s invisible root becomes the first untaxable thought, reweighting the entire cognitive-currency premise. Causal chain holds—receives seed → deciphers spiral → plants at convergence → drone passes → seed stirs—each step narrows options and makes the final image inevitable. Cost is legible in the single line “the responsibility of being the charming rogue scholar…all for the privilege of planting defiance,” tying prior risk to present irrevocable act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden’s cruciform junction, kale-light cipher, and greenhouse mantises are not postcard flourishes; they constrain how Maren moves (kneels only where paths meet) and what she can carry (seed warm against thigh). The convergence literally dictates planting site, satisfying the 9+ gate that environment shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect unquantified thought—tightens once: from abstract possession of seed to irreversible burial that exposes her to overhead scanner. No second reversal is needed at this length; the single escalation suffices under causal lens. Felt cost is present but compressed into one retrospective sentence; a sharper bodily or temporal price would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogans: taxation of cognition is resisted by an act that literalizes thought as untraceable root. Final image of “water table of rebellion” reweights every prior whispered leaf and insect lookout into a subterranean network—an organic CR that avoids moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the rattle frequency free minds or merely map surveillance gaps? Complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Maren’s perceptual bias—she sees sentences in furrows, hears drone hum as tax-meter tick—creating a distinct scholarly-rogue idiom. No head-hopping; greenhouse watchers remain external, known only through her inference. Syntax flexes from long sly clauses to clipped “The drone moved on,” mirroring threat proximity without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “candidly cryptic, each furrow a sentence” compresses concept and sensory detail into one breath. Only one scaffold loop—“the particular warmth of someone who knew secrets worth dying for” echoed twice—slows momentum; otherwise every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent within botanical-espionage register; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Thought-tax” dystopia is familiar, but encoding resistance in chlorophyll-philosophy seed and bureaucracy-eating insects feels inevitable yet unforeseen. The convergence garden as living encryption machine transforms trope into lived mechanics. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final root-image; specificity makes the premise impossible to transplant to another setting without collapse.</comment>
