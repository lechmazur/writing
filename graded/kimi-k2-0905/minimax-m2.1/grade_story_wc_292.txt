<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren’s buried longing and the inherited shame/curiosity around her great-grandmother are vividly interiorised; the copper-nail habit and the micro-choice to wheedle access show contradictory impulses under pressure. The final resolve to confront erasure is causally rooted in decoded journals and felt cost (“institutional shame too great”). Missing is a second live character to act as crucible, so status pressure is off-page; still, her nervously confident stride lands a credible renunciation of silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: nail → maps → restricted archives → decoded journals → irreversible knowledge → decision to break silence. One clear transition (basement → rising to face researchers) keeps the two-shard default; orientation is anchored by word 80. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses compliance with a visible cost (“senior researchers would never permit… alternative was to perpetuate that silence”). Lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Basement archive textures—ink-stained fingers, waterlogged clumps, jet stream howling through window gaps—are selective and POV-filtered. The weather station functions as off-stage pressure source rather than tactile setting; we never see Maren move through its corridors or handle instruments, so environment does not directly constrain her final choice. Meets micro-setting bar via the copper nail that heats in her palm at the end, charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore ancestor’s legacy vs. institutional erasure—is signaled early and tightens when decoded stanzas prove the cover-up. One meaningful deepening: realisation that jet-stream disaster could have been mitigated raises personal cost to global scale. Agency is legible in the decision to confront, with persistent constraint that publication is blocked; cost is acknowledgment of career suicide. No on-page antagonist weakens tangible pressure, but internal stakes carry the beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of erased female science emerges organically from plot particulars rather than assertion; copper nail and coded stanzas reweight from family curio to systemic indictment. Final image of Maren rising with “the map she had been searching for” offers resonant non-literal answer—she steps into the role of cartographer of truth. Avoids sermonising, lets irony (disaster validates the exile) do the moral work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains consistent psychic distance; diction—“spongey dread,” “cartographic shorthand of failed explorers”—is character-specific and rhythmic. No dialogue to test, yet free-indirect compression (“she would find her footing eventually”) keeps voice confident. Figurative bursts are controlled and purposeful; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often layers external action, interior tilt, and world fact. Occasional lyrical inflation (“voice emerging from the grave with the spongey dread”) risks purple, but pattern is set early and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates into final stride. Minor paraphrase echo around “exile” terminology costs precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing climate-science cover-up with ancestral burial artifact feels fresh; reversible exile concept gives a striking twist to historical erasure. Stakes hinge on a single copper nail and coded weather log rather than familiar conspiracy tropes. Could swap in another STEM field, but jet-stream specificity and posthumous exile mechanism are memorably particular. Risk in lyric compression heightens mood without obscuring plot.</comment>
