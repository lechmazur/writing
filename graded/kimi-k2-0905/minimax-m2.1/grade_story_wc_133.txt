<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia is vividly embodied (double vision, trembling hands) and her painter’s eye justifies the synesthetic color-language. The renunciation of the brooch for the telescope crystallizes her shift from clinging to the past to seeking new perspective, with visible cost. Interiority flirts with diagnostic labels (“haggard awe”) but recovers through sensory immediacy. Motive progression is single-note—survival via meaning—yet believable within 700 words.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each water-detail layers desperation until the telescope moment reweights perception. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira’s first sleep in nineteen nights—earned by the brooch-for-vision trade; the cost is the literal warmth she gives up. Orientation is clean by line 8; transitions across the causeway are legible. One minor slack: the stranger’s arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop: rain threads literally guide her steps, and the uncovered stone pillars force the meeting. The brooch’s cold weight against her chest functions as micro-setting that constrains the final exchange. Sensory selection—silver rain, black causeway, brass telescope—mirrors her narrowing perception under sleep-loss. One hairline slip: “南方 shower” untranslated jars the otherwise seamless Anglophone texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find meaning or perish—tightens when the telescope becomes the single object that can “snap the horizon into focus,” foreclosing the brooch’s nostalgic comfort. The trade is the one meaningful escalation; no reversals are needed under the Accumulative lens. Cost is tangible: she shivers once the amber warmth is gone. Pressure plateaus after the swap; a second tightening would push this higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: artifacts outlive people, but only human attention re-enchants them. Subtext lives in the telescope’s inversion—looking forward literally lets her close her eyes. The final image of sleep beside the “ancient pillar” reframes endurance as a form of faith rather than defeat. No moral is stated; the brooch’s absence is the silent thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains synesthetic diction (“world had begun to speak in colors”) without head-hop. Rhythm contracts under fatigue—long vowels, caesuras—then sharpens through the telescope’s “crystalline focus.” The stranger’s diction is spare, a counter-rhythm that foregrounds Mira’s lyric register. Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from 5-word fragments to 28-word coils, tracking her flickering attention. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds temperature, texture, or spatial data. Figurative load is high but patterned—“silver threads,” “congregation of pools”—teaching the water-as-text motif early. One micro-tangle: “unearthed temple of human stubbornness” is overripe, yet it lands in a low-pressure beat so clarity survives.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-water-war barter of heirloom amber for a salvaged telescope feels specific, not recycled dystopia. The synesthetic insomnia-painter is a fresh inflection on the sleepless seer trope. Convergence as a physical tidal island rather than abstract nexus gives the metaphor geological weight. Risk is moderate—lyric eco-SF—but the piece commits fully, avoiding middle-ground hedging.</comment>
