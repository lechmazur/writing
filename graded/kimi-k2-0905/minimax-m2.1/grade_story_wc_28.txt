<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lysara’s retrocognitive entrapment is dramatized through soot-blackened fingers on tesserae and the looping visions that blur now/then; the boy’s muteness is shown, not labeled. The climactic transfer of “Soren” carries visible cost—her smile as ember, his iron-warmed palms—so the renaming feels earned. Interior contradiction is thin: we’re told she calls others “forgetful” but never see her chafe against that judgment in the moment. Still, the micro-choice to press the stone into his hands crystallizes her hierarchy of values and lands as credible endurance.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tessera stops shifting, the bell rings, and the cost—her permanent exile in past-bleed—remains. Causal chain holds: because she cannot save the dead, she renames the living; therefore the boy inherits an “unburnable” empathy. Orientation is swift—ash, fountain, minaret shards within 120 words. One minor elasticity: the bell’s first ring is unattributed and risks deus ex machina, but the prior paragraph’s “resurrection” primes it enough to pass.</comment>

<comment>The plaza’s scorched stone, cracked glaze, and single shaft of light are filtered through Lysara’s retrocognitive gaze, so every sensory note doubles as temporal vertigo. The tessera functions as micro-setting: its weight and fracture pattern constrain the renaming act and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, lift, press into small hands—no floating bodies. While broader city geography is vague, the plaza’s skeletal immediacy suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory versus surrender to erasure—tightens when the mosaic patterns “converge” under her thumb, forcing the transfer decision. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the looping past itself. One visible price: she forfeits the name’s protective iron to the boy, remaining alone with her visions. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for lyric flash; coincidence (the bell) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as memory-as-survival: the dead persist only when their names are re-forged into living armor. Subtext lives in gesture—her soot trace on glaze, his silent nod—never in thesis statements. Final image of ember-warmth without burning reweights “mercy” from sentiment to metallurgy, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she now emptied or completed? The story lets both readings coexist.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Lysara’s retrocognitive sensorium; diction (“tongue of the old builders, a dialect of faith and geometry”) feels specific to her vocation. Rhythm swells then stills with the tessera’s pulse, mirroring the beat of transfer. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal cadence is consistent. One clause edges toward editorial flourish—“the particular silence that follows total destruction”—yet fits the elegiac register.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The patterns spoke in the tongue of the old builders” fuses sensory, historical, and spiritual data in one stroke. Figurative density is high but patterned early, so the final “ember that could warm without burning” feels earned, not piled on. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; scaffolding is minimal. A single participle opener—“Feeling its weight settle into her palm like a verdict”—is sequential and clear.</comment>

<comment>The retrocognitive preservationist who weaponizes memory by cold-forging empathy into a child’s psyche is fresh; it inverts the usual “healing the traumatized kid” arc. Sacred renaming via fractured mosaic is a concrete, non-obvious mechanism. Risk is high—lyric compression, single symbolic object—but coherence holds. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: of course the only unburnable thing is a name tempered in loss.</comment>
