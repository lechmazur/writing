<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—Elara’s cold knees, deliberate breath-sync with earth—but the “translate heartbeats into maps” motive is stated more than dramatized in present action; we watch her enact ritual rather than feel a live heartbeat at risk now. No contradictory impulse in scene; the pattern-making proceeds flawlessly, so the final sealing feels inevitable, not costly. Micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, pressing paper) are legible but do not force a trade-off or reveal a fresh flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing spiral reweights the discarded objects and the orchard itself, with felt cost in the cold blue flame consuming the last flash-paper. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density increases until cadence shift at the seal. Orientation is taught early (“withered orchard,” “crater floor,” “subarctic twilight”) so no penalty. Persistent constraint—finite flash-paper and the cold—shapes every move; final image crystallizes meaning without explanatory gloss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the illustration plate, flash-paper, and rusted chain function as tactile geography that constrains placement and timing. Cold is not backdrop but countdown—knees ache, paper must seal before chill seeps in. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—visual starlight, tactile frost, metallic taste of rust—none feel checklist. Spatial choreography clean: objects move from satchel to spiral to center without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve/transform final heartbeat—signaled early; single meaningful tightening occurs when the last sheet is burned, foreclosing further maps. Escalation is density-driven: each discarded relic adds symbolic weight until the spiral’s glow reweights options. Cost is conceptual but legible—once the paper burns, the map is fixed, Elara’s labor complete, path foreclosed. No visible price to Elara herself (no frostbite, doubt, or resource loss), keeping it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mortality made navigable through artifact and light. No explicit thesis; final image of spiral glowing beneath dead branches offers non-literal answer to “how to end gracefully.” Subtext resides in silence—world holding breath equals collective unconscious waiting for pattern. Ambiguity lingers: does the map guide the dying or the living?—without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “patience of frost settling on stone” fuses character and world. Rhythm mirrors ritual—long sentences for sorting, staccato “she knelt” for action. Diction within POV lexicon—no corporate intrusion. Patterned repetition (“safekept starlight,” “discarded items”) is taught early and paid off in final glow. Zero head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure without breaking cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths breathe with kneeling, arranging, sealing. Information density high—each relic carries metaphoric and cartographic load without scaffold. Figurative language is coherent: frost, starlight, and mirror shards share brittle luminescence logic. Only micro-loop: “pattern” appears three times in one sentence; does not touch closure. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical cartography of grief via trash and starlight in a crater-orchard. Tropes—lonely witch, found-object art—are retooled through subarctic stillness and literal light-capture. Conceptual risk—no antagonist, no dialogue—paid off by accumulative glow. Not quite 8.8 because premise could be swapped to any melancholy maker; specificity of grandmother’s kitchen flash-paper keeps it anchored.</comment>
