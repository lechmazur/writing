<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s vocation is vivid—dream-mining grief to reconstruct a lost child—but her interiority stays at a reverent distance; we witness care (“tended flickering memories”) yet no moment where contradictory impulses collide under pressure. All micro-choices are reported rather than dramatized, so the climactic decision to “find the living relatives” feels pre-ordained, not earned through on-page risk or refusal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece lands a resonant reconfiguration: the nameless child is on the cusp of reclamation, cost felt in the melting snow globe. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than sharp-edged; because linkage is poetic (“dream-cameos painted a portrait”) rather than tactical, satisfying the Accumulative lens but blunting the decisive turn needed for 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glacial shrine, candle flicker, and dissolving globe create a micro-setting that literally houses the investigation; the melting water reappears in closure, reweighting memory’s fragility. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—borrowed starlight, salt and dark—though spatial choreography remains implied rather than tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the child’s identity—emerges early and tightens as dream fragments converge, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no moment narrows options or exacts an explicit sacrifice. The pressure plate is a gentle accretion rather than a reversible choice, keeping cost legible yet soft.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of rescued memory emerges through recurrent water-and-light imagery rather than statement; the final image of naming the child crystallizes the stakes without moralizing. Complexity is present—salvage versus letting the sea keep its dead—but ambiguity is curated rather than challenged, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, frost-bitten, consistent in diction and cadence; perceptual signature favors luminosity and dissolution without drifting into purple. Slight syntactic monotony in repeated participial phrases (“she had…”) keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences read aloud with fluid rhythm; figurative layering is dense yet purposeful, never obscuring causality. Occasional near-repetition (“she had come… she had pulled… she had glimpsed”) creates minor模板 cadence but does not stall propulsion or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dream-mining as forensic ritual feels fresh; the melted snow-globe-as-evidence reframes a sentimental object into forensic relic. Specificity of coastal dreamers and glacier shrine anchors the concept, though the emotional arc of “recover the lost child” follows a familiar lament contour.</comment>
