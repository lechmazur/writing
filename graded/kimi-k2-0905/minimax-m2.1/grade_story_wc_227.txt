<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist’s contradictory impulses—clinging to uncertainty while performing a ritual of meaning—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (pressing charm to statue, matching scars). Her arc lands as credible renunciation: she accepts permanent uncertainty as illumination, paying with the literal breath she holds while the sea waits. The final smile crystallizes Earned Stasis; no higher band because interiority occasionally drifts into lightly abstract self-diagnosis (“uncertainty was itself a form of honest magic”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the workshop’s “death” reframes into rebirth via her acceptance of uncertainty, legible in the acid sea’s retreat and her continued work. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each scar-matched memory tightens the stake until the final breath reweights everything. Orientation is swift—pressure seals, acid sea, three breaths—and the pattern holds. Cost is unmistakable: she forecloses certainty itself, tasted in blood and tears on the charm.</comment>

<comment>The hovering copper hull inches above corrosive surf functions as micro-setting: every creak and rising inch constrains her remaining breaths and choices. Selective sensory detail—smoking acid, copper tang, marble pocks—filters through her urgent priorities. Spatial choreography is clean; statue, charm, and hull remain tracked. The gears-and-cogs label is lightly ornamental, never tactilely used, capping Q3 just below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—conjure meaning before obliteration—tightens via the literal breath-count clock. Each matched scar is an accumulative beat that deepens the cost of failure; the final breath crystallizes stance without external rescue. Escalation is textural, not causal, appropriate to the lyric lens. Visible price: she trades certainty for continuation, tasted on the charm, felt in the sea’s retreat.</comment>

<comment>Kintsugi-as-acceptance emerges organically through scar-matching action; no editorial thesis is stated. The final reweighting—brokenness as aperture for light—pays off the statue’s accumulated damage without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: workshop may still drown, but she owns the uncertainty. Theme is inseparable from the alchemist’s arc and the closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“quilted memories,” “kintsugi intentions”) stays within her esoteric lexicon. Rhythm mirrors breath: long sentences swell, then compress as seals fail. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent—she sees scars as chapters, tastes metal as history. The lyric pattern is taught early and paid off in the final still-breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description fused with interior motion (“she pressed the charm… tasting copper of old blood”). No loops or scaffold; occasional adjective pairs (“drowning light,” “tarnished key”) stay purposeful. Metaphors are coherent under aquatic pressure imagery. One clause drifts toward abstraction (“rearranging chaos rather than creating meaning”) but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing kintsugi with alchemy via scar-memory quilting is fresh; the acid-sea workshop is a striking container. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot reversals, but coherence justifies the choice. The piece could not swap settings without breaking its metaphysics. Slight deduction for familiar “accept uncertainty” endpoint, rescued by metallic, corrosive specificity.</comment>
