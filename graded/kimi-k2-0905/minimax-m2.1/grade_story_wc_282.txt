<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren’s sensory gifts and post-Sleep vocation are concrete, her interiority vivid (“saltwater support her weight”). Yet the decisive shift—from observer to “voice of the unknown”—is declared more than dramatized; no micro-choice on the page visibly forecloses an alternate path, so the cost feels conceptual rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pulse of algae and heat-signature adds density until the elm leaf reweights the stakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Maren’s stance crystallizes—yet the cost is felt more as epiphany than forfeiture, keeping the resonance strong but not quite at the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave is not backdrop but instrument: mineral signatures, tidal pool, algae that respond to emotion all constrain how Maren can read and finally float. The fossil’s impossibility is tethered to specific sensory cues; environment charges the final image without ever slipping into tour-guide exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the emotional residue before settlement encroachment—tightens when the elm leaf signals a pre-human conversation she must now voice. One meaningful deepening occurs in the tidal pool, but the escalation is interior; the price is insight rather than a lost option, so pressure peaks intellectually more than viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: continuity between human and non-human memory, with the fossil as hinge. No moral is stated; the algae’s brightening answers the thematic question with image rather than assertion. Complexity lingers—no settlement violence appears—so resonance is oblique but earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays cleanly inside Maren’s perceptual idiom; diction (“bioluminescent algae pulsing soft green like a living map”) is character-scaled, never authorial. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at the float, longer braid before—without head-hop or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence carries dual duty—sensory data + emotional decoding—without scaffold. Metaphors are controlled; only “a living map指引她前行” shows bilingual flourish, but it is purposeful. No loops or mixed vehicles; final image is crisp, propelling the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The post-Sleep sensory cartographer mapping fossil emotion is fresh, and the fossil-as-transitional-object avoids cliché by anchoring in specific heat-signatures. Risk is moderate—lyric interiority over external jeopardy—but the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no obvious template echoes.</comment>
