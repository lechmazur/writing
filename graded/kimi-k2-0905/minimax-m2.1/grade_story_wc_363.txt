<comment>The loom-spinner’s contradictory impulses—yearning to finish the weave yet hoarding the self she must surrender—are dramatized in the slow-motion decision to cut her own thread. Every micro-choice (sorting edges, lifting the bead, reaching for the scissors) is visible, embodied, and irreversible, so the final self-unraveling feels causally earned. The cost is scaled to the length: one life traded for one message. No interior label-speak; the silence itself externalizes conflict.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: each puzzle edge acquired “hummed with recognition,” establishing the rule that only her body can complete the pattern. The climax is a Decisive Change—she becomes the message—priced on-page by the empty loom and vanished bead. Setup anchors who/where/when within 60 words; no orientation debt. No teleporting props; the amber’s glow is tethered to her heartbeat throughout.</comment>

<comment>The orchard is not backdrop but constraint: the “raveling silence” actively strips alternatives, forcing her material choice. Bamboo hush, sap light, and loom click all filter through her perceptual bias—sound as thread, light as sap. Spatial choreography is clean: bead lifted, scissors reached, body replaced by fabric. Environment charges the final image—empty loom humming where a woman once sat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—send the message—tightens exactly once: when she realizes the price is her existence. The deepening narrows options from “weave” to “become,” a causal turn driven by her agency. Cost is legible: her physical absence on the loom. No external coincidence; the orchard’s silence is coherent pressure, not antagonist gimmick.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not archived but corporeal—transmission demands flesh. The amber bead’s journey from gift to grave reweights earlier estate-sale edges into a genealogy of sacrifice. Final image reconfigures meaning: remembrance requires self-erasure. No moralizing; the silence after her vanishing is the non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains stable psychic distance, compressing time without head-hop. Syntax mirrors weaving—long, filament clauses interrupted by metallic clicks. Diction stays within the spinner’s lexicon (“heddles,” “sap,” “raveling”). No filter-verb clutter; perception is direct: “watching the ancient sap trap and release fragments.” Voice peaks in the clipped final sentences that sound like snipped threads.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from sinuous thread-like loops to staccato scissor cuts, rhythm matching emotional torque. No loops or synonym churn; each image is single-use precise. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“raveling silence”) and paid off. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo—“forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest”—creating circular weave without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of ancestral gift into literal self-consumption; the jigsaw edges—usually emblems of fractured identity—here become the architecture of reintegration. Risky second-person dissolution is grounded in tactile loom craft so the surreal feels inevitable. Conceptual integrity: the story commits fully to “becoming the message,” never retreating to metaphor. Fresh inflection: estate-sale detritus as quantum postal system.</comment>
