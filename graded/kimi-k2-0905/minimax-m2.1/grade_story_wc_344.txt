<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thessa’s interiority is lyrically particular—her moon-lit fingers, driftwood nostalgia—but the only micro-choice on stage is the ritual offering of the gears; no contradictory impulse or visible cost accompanies it, so the arc feels foreordained rather than earned. The “rhythm of repair” is asserted, not dramatized under pressure. Still, the voice-soaked perception keeps her from sliding into archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final step into multiplying mirrors reconfigures her vocation forever, and the price—the irreversible loss of the gear set—is legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dissolved gear thickens the pattern until the mirror parts. Orientation is swift; causality remains intact. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the last gear vanishes and the passage opens—no reversals are needed at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen library is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered detail—ice-encased tomes, solidified-mist chamber—while the central mirror’s “hauntingly bright” glow actively disables shadows, guiding Thessa’s ritual action. The setting constrains movement (cold, fragile glass) and supplies the requisite offering surface, so the final image is charged by environment. No spatial drift or white-room gaps appear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—acquire celestial gears to fulfill her calling—tightens once: the mirrors demand total surrender of the gears she hoped to use. Agency is present (she chooses to give them away), but because the prophecy foretells the exchange, pressure feels pre-set rather than newly forged. Cost is visible—she leaves empty-handed—yet the emotional weight is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “repair as remembrance” emerges through recurrent driftwood and eclipse imagery; the final multiplication of selves suggests restoration is endless reflection, not possession. No moral is stated—the closing image reweights earlier motifs. The concept stays implicit, though the reliance on riddling prophecy edges toward thesis-speaking.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains a consistent lunar, tide-worn register; syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual pacing. No POV leakage or filter-verb clutter. The diction stays within Thessa’s artisanal lexicon, creating a distinct perceptual signature without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the ritual beats; metaphor density is high but patterned (moon, driftwood, eclipse) and pays off in the final image. No scaffold loops or mixed vehicles. Minor elevation in diction is motivated by the cathedral-like setting. Sentences do multiple jobs—e.g., “Each disappearance rippled the reflection…” advances plot, image, and interior state in one sweep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith who barters gears for infinite vocation is a fresh synthesis; the hall-of-mirrors trope is retooled as celestial archive rather than psychological maze. Risk lies in the lyric, riddle-driven structure, yet coherence holds. Specificity of craft language (celestial calibration, chronometer memory) prevents generic fantasy gloss.</comment>
