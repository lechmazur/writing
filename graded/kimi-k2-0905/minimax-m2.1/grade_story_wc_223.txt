<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—archivist vs. renouncer—are alive in the final footstep pattern; the cost of letting the sister’s name go is embodied in the empty chessboard she leaves behind. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The “benevolently ruthless” trait shows up once, in the triage memory, and is never tested again, so the arc feels slightly under-combed under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the spelled word “beginning” reconfigures the archive into forward motion; the cost is the sister’s name dissolving into the dome. Accumulative lens holds—each whispered footstep adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean by line 5; no因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gallery’s acoustic curve literally steers her final gesture—sound reaches corners her voice can’t, so she relinquishes the name to the architecture. Micro-setting (burnt chessboard) constrains the choice to leave pawns absent. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: footsteps, whispers, scarred wood—no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she release or preserve the sister’s name? Pressure tightens once—from spelling the name to spelling “beginning,” a single deepening that forecloses archival fixation. Cost is the audible absence that answers back. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: history is built from relinquished ghosts, not catalogued artifacts. The empty chessboard and the un-echoed name reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—absence as luminous beginning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Mira’s perceptual filter—whispers, scars, lightless corners. Syntax lengthens then fragments to mimic the dome’s echo decay. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: long anaphoric clauses build, then fracture in the final short beat. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“nomadic penumbra”) is earned by reflective distance; it never clutters the high-pressure final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The crisis-actor-turned-survivor archiving footsteps in a whispering gallery is a fresh synthesis; the burnt chessboard with vanished pawns becomes a concrete emblem of unrecoverable loss. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—pays off in the resonant final absence. No template echo.</comment>
