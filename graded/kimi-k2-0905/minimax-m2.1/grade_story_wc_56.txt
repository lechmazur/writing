<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular—her “smiled with that thoughtfully clear satisfaction” instantiates the required trait in embodied, scene-specific fashion. Motivation (decoding cartographic erasure) stays consistent and escalates to the steering choice toward older brickwork. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page; the moment of internal fracture is told rather than shown (−0.3). The final image of continuing sundial measurement offers a resonant endurance rather than a costly renunciation, keeping the arc just shy of the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s quiet persistence reweights time itself as evidence, making the hidden canal undeniable. Causal linkage holds—each beat (purchase, twilight reading, steering) flows logically because she pursues the erased waterway. Orientation is crisp within the first 60 words; no penalty. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, satisfying the lens (Accumulative/Textural) yet keeping the stakes cerebral; a more visceral price would push higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Canal, barge, twilight, and pocket sundial function as micro-setting that directly shapes tactics: the sundial’s shadow tells her which unused channel to probe, the brick repairs mark where to moor. Sensory triad—visual (amber lamps), haptic (brass wear), auditory (radio static)—is filtered through her cartographer’s eye without tourist cataloging. Setting never stalls momentum; each detail is interleaved with action. The canal as erased infrastructure charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering a deliberately erased waterway—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the sundial confirms the lost hour. Agency is intellectual rather than physical: she “steered the barge toward older construction,” a decision that forecloses safer moorings. Cost is conceptual (history itself is fragile) rather than personal, visible but not felt on the body. One meaningful deepening suffices; the pressure is coherent yet stays academic, keeping it just above the 8.0 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as palimpsests, truth as sediment to be dredged rather than treasure to be seized. No explicit thesis statements; the sundial’s ticking shadow is the final word. Moral ambiguity is preserved—she is complicit in reopening what someone died to hide. The image of measuring “hours that refused to stay hidden” offers resonant non-literal answer, satisfying the 9+ quick test; slightly abstract cost keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to her cartographer’s perception: “warehouses that had long since converted to luxury lofts, their industrial past now a fashionable costume” carries her dismissive tone. Syntax is rhythmic and varied, with purposeful compression: “black glass, reflecting the amber lamps…” teaches the twilight palette early. No dialogue to test, yet internal diction remains within her erudite but field-worn lexicon. Voice modulates: calmer observation builds to the clipped precision of “she steered the barge toward older construction,” mirroring decision under pressure—meeting the 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer cadences for twilight contemplation, shorter clauses at the steering beat. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“twilight settle over the canal like a held breath”—and never clusters to obscure causality. Information density is high; each sentence layers history, motive, and sensory cue. One paraphrase loop detected (“someone who had once trusted this small instrument to tell them the hour when clocks were unreliable or non-existent”) costs −0.2; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: antique sundial as reverse compass—instead of guiding forward, it re-casts the past into present navigation. Erased canal as metaphor for cultural amnesia is not new, but coupling it with a horological device that measures lost time feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: quiet intellectual stakes replace physical peril, yet coherence holds. Specific detail—Konstantýn Vojtěch, 1847—anchors invention in verifiable history, pushing into the 9-band.</comment>
