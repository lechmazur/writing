<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her bare feet in moss, the prism’s cold flash—and her drive to “prove” emotional archaeology is dramatized through careful attention to frost patterns. The beat where she realizes she herself is becoming another absorbed object carries visible cost: “her own essence slowly merging with the stone.” No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the arc from observer to participant lands with earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the arbor’s quartz and frost function as an emotional archive whose density increases until Mira sees her own reflection inside it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she smiles at the future visitor, accepting her absorption as cost. The pattern is taught by 25 % and the final image reweights every prior frost-feather. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; no teleporting props or retroactive fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quartz arbor isn’t backdrop; its cold conducts emotion into Mira’s body and the prism’s refraction literally reveals hidden patterns, satisfying the 9+ gate. Frost on the abandoned windshield is handled twice—once as legible text, once as mirror—charging the final smile. Spatial choreography is exact: edge of arbor, moss stone, car window, mist between columns. Sensory selection stays biased to Mira’s synesthetic mission—no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotions—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when Mira confronts becoming such an object herself. One meaningful deepening: yearly frost patterns softening from “jagged screaming” to “something softer” shows the dead woman’s release and foreshadows Mira’s own merger. Cost is felt in her startled realization and the smile that accepts it. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and accumulative under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative archive: grief is not erased but diffused into place, and the living become future artifacts. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing the prism against glass refracts both light and denial. The final smile offers a non-literal answer: witness is participation, and absorption is the price of proof. No moralizing sentence distills this; the frost image does the reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s synesthetic diction—“crystallized whispers,” “condensation of feeling”—without head-hopping. Rhythm swells with longer sentences during revelation, then thins to a quiet smile, mirroring the shifted hush. No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs are embodied (“felt the cold seep upward”). Distinct perceptual signature: frost as alphabet, quartz as library.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence performs double duty—description plus emotional decoding. No synonym loops or scaffold; “frost” returns only when meaning has shifted. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “cathedral made of crystallized whispers” is sustained by the quiet acoustics throughout. One hairline slip: “pleasant persistence” edges toward oxymoronic filler but occurs early and doesn’t dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Emotional archaeology via frost patterns is a fresh angle on hauntology; no close literary echo detected. The conceit commits fully—no late rule changes—and the reversal (observer becomes artifact) grows inevitably from the premise. Specificity of the abandoned car window as archive page feels irreplaceable. Risky lyric density is sustained without clarity loss, meriting the upper band.</comment>
