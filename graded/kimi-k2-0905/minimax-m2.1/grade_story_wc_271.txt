<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s quiet, plant-tuned interiority is concrete and embodied; every freeze is a live somatic marker, not a label. Her refusal to “heal” in the therapeutic sense is a believable, earned stance, and the final image of the night-blooming cereus crystallizes her values without epiphany-speak. Micro-choices (transplanting, misting, waiting out the freeze) steadily reveal hierarchy of needs. Only minor slack: the grandmother “gift” line flirts with abstract shorthand, and the photograph’s emotional charge is asserted more than dramatized in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each greenhouse act adds density until the single cereus bloom delivers the Resonant Reconfiguration—optimism re-priced as perishable yet possible. Causality is interior but coherent; every repeated freeze → soil-under-nails sensation tightens the loop. The photograph functions as charged object, its wrinkle pattern echoing the cereus petals, giving the final image conceptual cost. No orientation debt; lighthouse/sea anchors arrive by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seaside cliff and salt-bitten greenhouse constrain every choice—wind dictates seedling placement, salt crust decides which species survive. The night-blooming cereus is micro-setting turned talisman; its single-night life span supplies the ticking clock that charges the ending. Sensory hierarchy stays vegetal: scent of nectar, temperature of compost, texture of ceramic—never tourist-catalog. One minor over-label: “cathedral of glass” momentarily drifts into sermon tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake = permission to remain un-healed while still cultivating life. Pressure escalates through accretion: four years of failed cereus buds → one bloom that forces the question: is this enough? The tightening is soft but unmistakable—each failed bloom subtracts hope; the success reweights it. Cost is visible: she stays alone, photo faces still melted, hands scarred by soil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges via vegetal metaphors: resilience is not denial but managed vulnerability (greenhouse glass, cereus bloom). Subtext lives in gesture—she never smooths the photo, never names the explosion, letting silence speak. Final image refuses moral, offers instead a temporal economy: what withers can survive next season. Only minus: “optimism in realism” is half-named in final paragraph; earlier embodiment was stronger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught by patterned clauses of quiet action: “She moved… she misted… she waited.” Perceptual signature is botanical—stems are “resistance,” air has “particular temperature.” No head-hopping; distance stays close-third. Compression in freeze paragraphs mimics vasovagal pause; syntax lengthens again as breath returns. One register lift: “somatic markers” is clinical but justified by trauma context and reused in mirror-image at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm to mimic pulse; paragraph cuts land on image, never filler. Figurative language is sparse, plant-precise: “salt-crusted and forgotten” vs. stacked metaphors. Zero template cadence; no synonym loops. Only micro-slip: “the shape of what remained” is slightly abstract valediction, but occurs mid-passage, not at closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh inflection: trauma story told through four-year orchid cultivation schedule instead of therapy room. Lighthouse keeper absence flipped—she keeps not ships but photos and seedlings off the rocks. Risk taken: almost no external plot, yet pressure holds. Slight proximity to “wounded woman retreats to coast” trope, but vegetal specificity and freeze-to-soil anchoring transform it.</comment>
