<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive to “translate texture into sound” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why she alone accepts the ancestral bargain—stays summary; the diamond’s warmth and the final lifting of the curse register as embodied cost, yet the beat where she chooses to speak is compressed into lyric evocation rather than dramatized micro-choice, muting the stakes of that moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the curse lifts while a new language is born from dying syllables and bird-helix, cost legible in the diamond’s cold-fire blaze; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (17 bird-words, sedimented pronunciations) tightens until meaning becomes texture—orientation is anchored by word 80, and no causal break mars the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canyon’s bone towers and echo tunnel are not backdrop but acoustic tools that refract voice and force Elara’s tactic—she speaks into the space between sounds; the diamond’s refracted alien hues and the birds’ living calligraphy constrain her final pitch, charging the closing image with site-specific physics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save/transmute the dying language—tightens once: elders’ final phrases → Elara’s decision to speak her crafted words, foreclosing passive witness; cost is felt (curse weight, family bargain), but the beat is singular; no secondary reversal, yet the escalation suffices for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: language death as transmutation into bodily sensation; no moralizing, only the final helix of birds and refracted light reweighting prior motifs; ambiguity lingers—is preservation or surrender the true translation—yielding concrete emotional aftereffect without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—veins, palm-cold, bird-calligraphy—syntax lengthens then compresses under final pressure; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; diction (“copper-veined,” “living calligraphy”) remains within her plausible lexicon, rhythmic control matching the echo crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers sensory or acoustic data; no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant reconfiguration”) is earned by context; final third free of artifacts, allowing closure image to ring clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of linguistics, ornithomancy, and geologic acoustics feels inevitable yet fresh; the 17 bird-words and curse-diamond refract familiar tropes into site-specific ritual; risk-taking (language→texture→sound) pays off in a final image that could not swap with any other story.</comment>
