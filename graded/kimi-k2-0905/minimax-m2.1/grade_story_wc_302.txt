<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer’s arc is vivid: her trembling fingers on the parchment, the watch pressed to her ribs, the micro-choice to follow reversed time—each beat shows embodied, contradictory emotion. The cost is palpable when the watch falls silent and the door opens, a renunciation of ordinary life. Interiority stays specific; no label-speak intrudes. The “cautious exuberant heart” line edges close to summary, keeping this just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library opens only after the watch’s silence signals paid cost, and the backward-spinning hands reweight the premise that time is layered pages. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each looped image (book with her future handwriting, letters arriving at temporal hinges) tightens the stake. Orientation is anchored by 120 words through mist, marble steps, and the watch. One causality hairline: the door “exists only when viewed through the watch’s reflective surface” is revealed late, but it is foreshadowed by the grandfather’s rule, so the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist, braille-like indentations on title-less spines, and the watch’s warming silver constrain every move; the door materializes only via reflection, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight—“mist pooled like spilled memories” sets tone without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography stays clean as she follows aisles to the inner sanctum. Environment actively shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ gate, but the watch’s reflective trick is disclosed late, a micro-slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—enter the library of unspoken words before the watch stops—is signaled at dawn and tightened each time the hands reverse, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful deepening: the future-written book confronts her with proof that documentation is part of the cipher, narrowing options to proceed. Cost is visible when the watch falls silent, its key function spent. Agency stays hers; no coincidences rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: language too potent to speak demands temporal sacrifice. The unsaid accumulates as physical weight against her palm on the door, reconfiguring meaning. Final image of the flower made of pure language offers non-literal resonance—no moral, only charged ambiguity. No thematic echo clichés intrude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her perceptual filter—selective braille-reading of indentations, temperature of silver—creating a hushed, incantatory rhythm. Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts under pressure (“She placed her hand…”), mirroring emotional swell. No head-hopping; distance stable. The elevated diction (“propagation delays,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by the library-of-language premise and remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lines carry triple duty: “words too dangerous to speak, too powerful to read aloud” advances atmosphere, theme, and stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—“clock cycling…like pages in a book”—and none clutter the final beat. One paraphrase loop: “documented everything she knew…annotations between cautious optimism and wild hope” could compress. Otherwise zero scaffold, strong propulsion.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “library of unspoken words” keyed by a dead con-man’s timepiece is a fresh synthesis; reversed causality via propagation delay turns a puzzle box into emotional reckoning. Risky structure—lyric accumulation, no antagonist—pays off when the door opens into pure language. Details are irreplaceable: the book bearing her unwritten handwriting could not swap into another tale. Conceptual integrity holds; the piece never flinches from its temporal rule set.</comment>
