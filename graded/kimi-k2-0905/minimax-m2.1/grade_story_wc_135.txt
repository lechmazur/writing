<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is textured through salt-crusted notebooks and automatic hand-to-satchel checks, grounding his compulsive caretaking. His “reactively visionary” trait activates only in Sera’s presence, compressing decades into one charged beat; the cost is the delayed recognition that the valve’s silence is now his to break. The final micro-choice—closing his hand around the valve—crystallizes his shift from cataloguer to re-activator, paying the price of renewed responsibility. No contradictory impulses play out in scene, so the 9+ gate is missed by a hair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the valve’s re-weighted meaning (“promise that the sound would come again”) reconfigures the harbor from absence to potential signal, with conceptual cost—he must now become the voice he preserved. The accumulative lens holds: fragments → vision → cumulative promise; no causal missteps. Orientation is anchored at word 24 (“ivory harbor after rain”), well inside the 120-word window. One tightening beat suffices; the story deepens rather than reverses.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ivory stones glistening after rain, salt crystals on notebook leather, and the corroded brass valve create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the archivist’s grip and final decision. Sensory selection stays inside his professional gaze—cataloguing wreckage, not sightseeing. Spatial choreography is clean: edge-of-harbor → among exiles → stone archive → window. Weather residue affects footing and mood, integrating into the closing image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the archive remain passive cataloguer or become active voice—emerges once Sera presents the box; pressure tightens when the valve itself finally speaks. Agency is exercised in the last line: clasping the valve forecloses the option of continued silence. The cost is future obligation, felt through the weight in his palm. One meaningful deepening satisfies the lens; no escalation curve, but sufficiency for 800-word window.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of reassembly versus re-voicing emerges through concrete fragments and the final re-pricing of the silent valve; no statement of thesis. Subtext whispers in “the harbor would speak once more to those who knew how to listen”—a non-literal answer to the exile’s fragmentation. Ambiguity lingers: he may fail to sound the trumpet again, but the possibility is now alive. No echoing of prompt language or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains perceptual signature: “salt crystals still clung,” “fingers moved automatically,” syntax mirroring cataloguer habit. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences collapse into the tight final clause: “feeling its weight and purpose align at last.” No dialogue, so voice contamination is avoided. Filter verbs (“he saw,” “he felt”) are minimal and character-apt; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action: paragraph lengths contract toward the closing beat. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“salt crystals…like archival frost” is the lone image, earned. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Line density doubles duty: “he invited…she carried…he spread” advances motion while showing status shift. One clause abstraction (“exile had also created a space”) is strategic telling, not scaffold.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The post-exile archivist who re-visions fragments into living memory refreshes the “collector of broken pasts” trope by making the collector the future herald. Specific coastal detail—ivory harbor, salt crust, corroded brass—roots the concept in a singular place. The closing reconfiguration (silent valve → prospective voice) feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric accumulation rather than twist, but executed without safety hedging.</comment>
