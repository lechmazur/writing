<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>One-man show; interiority is lyrical but never slips into self-diagnosis.  The inherited duty supplies credible motive and the daily renunciation lands as earned stasis—“he had bought them another day” pays the cost.  No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the stakes rise but the inner split stays off-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sonic ritual tightens once when the first code-fragment breaks through and is shattered.  Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush is renewed, the cost is his ragged breath merging with fog.  Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no因果 breaks; prophecy logic stays internally consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, prism, dew, saxophone form a closed micro-ecology that actively filters choice: dripping dew sets tempo, prism light cues register shifts, wet stone reflects his notes back as pressure.  Final image—“breath coming in ragged hushes”—is charged by the same elements, so environment constrains and reconfigures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep prophecy silent.  Single tightening when the first syllable almost surfaces; he counters with three staccato blasts that foreclose that breach.  Cost is legible—his exhaustion, the thickened mist—but no new constraint persists into tomorrow except the same cycle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through negative-space music: language is a hunger that silence must feed nightly.  Final image of fused breath-and-fog reweights the premise—prophecy is not defeated but continuously postponed, making endurance the only moral stance.  No explicit thesis; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical, distance held close to breath and brass.  Syntax elongates then snaps in parallel with melodic lines; diction stays within poetic musician lexicon.  No head-hop; compression like “vested hush” is taught by repetition and paid off at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: varied cadence, strategic anaphora, no scaffold loops.  Figurative density is high but motif-consistent; no mixed metaphors.  Occasional adjective stacks (“quietly vivid ribbons”) flirt with purple but serve prismatic effect without tripping causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Concept of sealing prophecy via sax-shaped negative space feels fresh and culturally inverse of oracle tales.  Inherited dawn ritual, prism-light scoring sound-waves, code-alive language—all synthesized into an indivisible whole.  Risk is high but coherence holds; removal would collapse the entire fabric.</comment>
