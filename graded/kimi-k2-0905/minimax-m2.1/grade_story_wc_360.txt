<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is richly concrete—amber light as “a condition of perception,” personalities borrowed like tools—embedding contradictory impulses (curiosity vs self-erasure) in every beat. Micro-choices (holding the fragment to her chest, dissolving into its light) visibly foreclose the path of intact identity. Seventeen accumulated emotional debts accumulate as receipts, paying off in the ending’s transparent liberation. The only absence is an on-page second character, so relationship/status bullets are rightfully N/A; still, the self-other boundary erodes convincingly alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ending lands a Conceptual Repricing: “the mathematics of emotion required…an endless transcription of questions,” reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—her dissolved body. Causal linkage is lyric but legible: halo arrival → empathy extraction → star vanishing → self-dissolution, each because/therefore step tightening the noose on intact personhood. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by sentence one—“topaz workshop,” “seventeen years,” “roofless”—so the early lyric disorientation is waived and pays off in the roofless final image. Persistent constraint: every borrowed personality exacts a fragment of her own, visible in the growing translucency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Topaz workshop functions as micro-setting: the amber light is not backdrop but perceptual filter that literally colors every emotional measurement. The halo fragment is handled across ≥3 beats—falls, pulses, dissolves—charging the final image. Roofless architecture lets stars vanish directly above the presses, fusing setting to stakes. Spatial choreography is crisp: fragment on bench → lifted to chest → dissolves into her sternum, each move tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete self-erasure vs. preserving empathic archive—tightens once: the moment she presses the fragment to her chest, transparency becomes irreversible. Cost is visible: “her own personality begin to borrow” until she is “becoming transparent.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each borrowed signature adds density of light, not narrative reversal, culminating in luminous stasis. No coincidence; vanishing stars externalize the internal arithmetic, complicating but not rescuing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy as consumptive physics—every understood emotion costs literal mass. The final image reprises “amber” and “light” but now as self-loss, reweighting prior motifs. No moralizing; the silence after last star is the non-literal answer. Subtext in gesture: spectacles adjusted mid-proof suggest ongoing calibration of sight that ends in her own invisibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: “mathematics of emotion,” “arithmetic of the soul,” diction precise as lead type. Rhythm modulates from long, clause-stacked sentences to fragmented light beats: “fragment dissolved… smile… understanding.” No head-hopping; single POV holds. Lyric compression (“used light,” “borrowed personalities”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. Voice remains coherent even as narrator dissolves into collective pronoun “whatever came next.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence performs double duty—e.g., “amber light filtering… was not merely color but a condition of perception.” Metaphors stay internally consistent (light = accounting unit). No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct. Opening and closing lines act as mirror-topaz and transparent light—bookending without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—empathy as consumptive letterpress physics—is non-obvious synthesis of print tech + emotional quantification. Transformation test: story collapses without halo-empathy press; could not swap “potter’s wheel” or “camera obscura.” Risk of roofless star-workshop paid off by coherent world-rule. Fresh inflection: vanishing stars are not apocalypse but universe learning to outgrow starlight, a conceptual turn that reframes extinction as evolution.</comment>
