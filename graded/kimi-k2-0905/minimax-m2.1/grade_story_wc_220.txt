<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s sensory gift and quiet obsession are persuasively embodied; the autumn leaf and cylinder function as extensions of motive rather than decoration. Interior contradiction is muted—no moment where bloodhound acuity fails him—so the flaw-to-struggle ratio feels thin. The final endurance (“holding…voice”) is credible renunciation, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mosaic structure (three time-shards) is taught by the 25 % mark and collapses cleanly into the tactile-reading climax; causality is accumulative-textural, not sequential, and the closure reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (“distance is an illusion”). The missing-orientation risk is waived because disorientation is functional—confusion mirrors the narrator’s own hunt for legibility—so no penalty applies. One soft spot: the cylinder’s playing mechanism is introduced as already-built offstage, a mild teleporting-prop moment that blunts the full causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cracked wasteland and scrapyard are sketched with selective, pressure-driven detail; the body-as-micro-setting appears in the fingertip-reading beat where grooves replace geography and directly constrain the final discovery. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—smelt metals, wax texture—avoiding tourist-catalog breadth. The leaf’s amber edge returns to mirror the wax cylinder, charging the final image and satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover brother’s voice—lands early and tightens through each shard; the meaningful turn is the shift from auditory to tactile reading, which forecloses every prior attempt and forces the final revelation. Cost is present but conceptual (acceptance of illusion), lacking a tangible forfeiture such as broken equipment or lost time, so escalation stays solid rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of translation-as-survival emerges through the cylinder, leaf, and groove-reading without explicit moralizing; the final sentence reweights “distance” as bridge rather than gap, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtextual irony—only silence teaches him to hear—adds depth. One minor echo: “wild hush” is named twice, slightly announcing the motif instead of letting it accrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a consistent perceptual signature—metallic olfaction, braille-like fingertips—and rhythmic control that modulates from languid longing to the staccato of discovery. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Compression (“tinted revelations”) is taught early and paid off; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual geography”) is justified by the narrator’s artefactual precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, largely free of loops; only one scaffold-like lapse (“wasteland…wasteland” in adjacent clauses) and no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph cuts are clean. Filter verbs minimal; strong sensory nouns/verbs dominate. Final line lands with imagistic snap, satisfying the read-aloud test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic scavenging frame is reanimated by the bloodhound olfactory gift and the cylinder-as-text concept, a fresh inflection that feels inevitable once revealed. Risk-taking in tactile-reading method heightens intimacy without obscuring clarity. Could push further into smell-as-archive specifics to escape trope gravity entirely.</comment>
