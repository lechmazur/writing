<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s professional mask and interior fatigue are crisply drawn; the mirrored self-confrontation supplies a credible micro-choice. Yet all other figures (Thomas, predecessor, tomorrow’s client) stay off-stage, so relationship/status crucible bullets are moot and the arc is purely internal. The “earned change” is tentative—she merely scatters thoughts—so cost feels symbolic rather than irrevocable. Still, interior contradiction and embodied emotion pass the bar for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layer (chimes, mirror, wind, light) deepens the dominant stake—her need to keep doubt alive without losing herself. Closure is a Charged Poise: the scattering of thoughts crystallizes her ongoing stance and forecloses rest. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. Cost is present but diffuse (fatigue, perpetual vulnerability); stronger if a concrete consequence were foregrounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse cliff, dawn wind, and chime topology are vividly specific and filter through Mara’s professional ear. Micro-setting objects—mirror shard, pouch, stone railing—constrain her ritual and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; environment directly guides her decision to “unhook” thoughts. Weather is not postcard but instrumental, integrating with theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping her doubt-driven practice sustainable—signaled early. Escalation is incremental: Thomas anecdote → self-mirror → dawn message; each beat thickens texture more than tightens options. No visible loss (tool, money, relationship) alters tactics; cost stays atmospheric. Sufficient for short lyric mode but lacks a decisive pressure turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of engineered doubt and the toll on the engineer. Subtext lives in gesture—pointing at chimes, scattering seeds—avoiding explicit thesis. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Insight is earned through concrete particulars, though sentiment flirts with self-congratulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person tight interiority sustains a lyrical, slightly oracular cadence that matches Mara’s vocation. Perceptual signature is strong: wind-as-language, chimes as emotional sonar. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Syntax is varied; metaphor density is high but patterned and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences perform double duty. Occasional lyrical overload (“pink fingers of dawn… fractured splinters”) risks purple, yet stays within POV’s mystical lexicon. No scaffold loops; pronouns clean. Final line lands with resonant punch, justifying earlier compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Conscience for hire” is a fresh angle; wind-chime semaphore and mirror ritual particularize it. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet not derivative. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric meditation rather than plot—but coherence justifies the mode. Could push further if stakes jeopardized her vocation concretely.</comment>
