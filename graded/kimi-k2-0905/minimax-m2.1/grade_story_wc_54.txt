<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait are declared repeatedly but only once translate into an embodied choice (kneeling to lift the sextant). Interiority drifts into abstract hope-equations; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The council speech is summarized, so the cost of her conviction is off-stage. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sextant on her desk reweights the terminal’s future from commerce to community, with “stubborn persistence toward renewal” as felt cost. Causal chain is thin—approval happens off-scene—but the redirected-flow plan is tightly set up and pays off in the final image. Orientation is clean by 120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the aquifer angle is calculated, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cracked polymer walls, “dark ribbons” of sediment, and the brass disk create tactile specificity without catalogue bloat. The sextant acts as micro-setting that constrains her imagination and later charges the closure. Spatial tracking is clean down the stairwell and through three junction chambers. Weather is absent, but neglect itself functions as atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the terminal salvageable—signals early. Pressure rises once when she calculates the aquifer angle, narrowing options. However, no live opposition or resource loss is dramatized; approval is granted off-page, diffusing cost. The only visible price is “seventeen days,” stated, not felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of “returning as the new exploration” emerges through the sextant’s repurposed meaning rather than explicit thesis. Final image reconfigures the original star-bound premise into grounded renewal. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli (sediment swirl, polished brass). One near-miss: “equations for hope” flirts with label-speak but is saved by subsequent concrete plumbing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature skews toward engineering quantification (“calculating how redirected water flows could clear…”). Syntax lengthens during reflection, then shortens under action. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Filter verbs are minimal and justified by observational mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes—sentence lengths vary, paragraphs cut cleanly. Occasional loftiness (“psychological architecture as complex as the physical tunnels”) risks self-paralleling but lands within POV lexicon. No loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor: “hollow ribcage against the gray morning sky” is forgiven for vivid anchoring. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and reverb.</comment>

<comment>Abandoned spaceport restored as community hub is fresh, but the carnival-to-spaceport reveal is delivered once and never complicates action. Sextant-as-navigation-into-future is a satisfying inversion. Risk level is moderate; no structural experiment. Detail specificity (brass disk, aquifer angle) prevents template drift.</comment>
