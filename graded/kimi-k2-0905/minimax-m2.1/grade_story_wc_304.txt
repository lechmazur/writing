<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her professional eye reading “laughter in the way the colors swirled” is character-specific—but the text keeps telling us her motives are “sacred” or “holy” instead of letting a single contradictory impulse collide with the ritual; the result feels performed rather than lived, and the absence of any micro-choice that could fail keeps the arc static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald’s new “living light” is an undeniable conceptual cost, reframing her vocation from cosmetic restoration to soul theft; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of aurora/grotto/stillness deepens until the final crystallization—so causality is not required, yet the piece satisfies the 9+ quick test for Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Skyborne grotto under aurora” is taught early and literally holds the young man’s suspended form; the emerald chip functions as micro-setting that constrains her final gesture, charging the image; spatial choreography is clean—“she descended”—so the environment passes the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the spark before oblivion—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: the threshold never tightens or fights back, and the “lucidly watchful” stance is declared rather than tested; escalation is purely accretive glow, lacking a visible price or narrowed option, so the beat never deepens under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: beauty as mercy against annihilation; the final glint inside the emerald re-prices her lifelong labor without moralizing; the silence around the act invites counter-readings—soul larceny or grace—creating meaningful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained lyric third-person, with mortician diction—“gossamer veil,” “threshold of stillness”—filtered through her perceptual signature; no head-hopping; rhythm swells and subsides with auroral pulses; the elision of technical ritual is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is deliberate—cascading cadences mimic aurora—but occasional stacked modifiers (“radiant hush,” “crystalline structure”) tip toward purple; no loops or paraphrase cycles; final image remains clear and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Beautician-mortician who steals last light with heirloom emerald is fresh synthesis; risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, but coherence holds; could lean harder into moral cost to avoid “lovely surface” middle ground.</comment>
