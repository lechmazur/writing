<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s obsessive need to recover his grandmother’s face is viscerally embodied (tears in brine) and fuels every beat; the thirty-year gap is confessed, not dramatized, so the depth of conversion is told more than shown, but the closing micro-choice—swimming off to keep hunting—pins the cost of “acceptance beyond proof” to his body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each pass through the drowned greenhouse thickens pattern (shattered Heron → re-assembled Heron) until the final image crystallizes stance with undeniable cost—he regains memory but loses empirical distance forever; orientation is anchored by word 80, causality is lyric-not-linear but coherent, closure is Charged Poise with salt-weep as felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse, glass shards, kelped timbers, and the pulsing mushroom are filtered through Elias’s collector gaze; every tactile detail (roots writhing through drainpipes, starlight pooling in gills) constrains his method and charges the final image when the same light re-assembles his grandmother’s face.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens once: skeptical dismissal → bodily surrender to ring’s glow; the single deepening is sufficient, cost is legible (salt tears, foreclosed empiricism), but external antagonist (barons) remains off-stage, so pressure is atmospheric rather than contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-constellation emerges through recurring optic imagery rather than statement; final re-pricing—empirical distance sacrificed for inherited love—lands via image of Heron re-forming in murk, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is he pilgrim or parasite? Complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance, diction skews maritime-archival (“monographs,” “mind-scourers”) consistent with academic eye; rhythm mimics dive cycle—long breaths above, clipped fragments underwater. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; occasional elevated latinate clauses flirt with register drift but stay tethered to POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned (leviathan, Heron, photograph in solution) and pays off at closure; no mixed metaphors, no loops. One paraphrase loop (“chronically curious…hunger”) is repeated three times—minor scar, not fatal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing drowned orchard, bioluminescent fairy ring, and shattered constellation as mnemonic tech feels inevitable yet uncanny; folklore-as-astronomy reframes a trope without gimmickry. Risk in lyric structure is rewarded by crystalline closure.</comment>
