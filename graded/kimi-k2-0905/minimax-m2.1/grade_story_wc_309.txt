<comment>Mira’s quiet custodial life and her later surrender to the mist are credibly rooted, but the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“she felt seen in a way she couldn’t explain”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to withhold the error report is sharp; the climactic choice is more surrender than decision, softening cost. Flaws complicate but the arc lands in credible renunciation.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the final garden image reweights her prior “underachievement” as sacred preparation with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is light—keystone warmth triggers wards to drop, mist arrives—but the piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it; the cadence shift from automated ice to impossible garden is the tightening. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no penalties applied.</comment>

<comment>Environment, body, and keystone function as micro-setting: the spire’s “functional geometry” and keystone’s “internal fire” directly enable/force the mist transition. Selective sensory detail (frost catching light “almost intentional,” keystone warmth against cold air) is filtered through Mira’s custodial gaze and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean from corridor to cloud-garden; no credibility breaks.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dignity of quiet attention versus automated efficiency—is signaled early; escalation is the single cadence shift when wards die and mist offers irreversible exit. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the safety of algorithmic life for an unmapped garden, the absent keystone slot literalizing the trade. No reversal, but pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (drone delivery) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<comment>The sacred hidden in neglected maintenance emerges organically through concrete events—keystone warmth, ward failure, impossible garden—never stated. Final image of “brilliant dimness” reweights automation-era utility as spiritual poverty without moralizing. Ambiguity persists: the Academy’s loss is her salvation, a counter-reading the story permits yet never sermonizes. Resonance is built from specific particulars, not abstractions.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, diction calibrated to a technician’s precision (“boundary wards,” “synthetic packing moss”) that modulates into lyrical compression only as the mist dissolves physical rules. Rhythm mirrors emotional rise: short clauses during ward flicker, lengthened cadence during ascension. No head-hopping; perceptual signature—light as intentional, algorithms as “humming melodies”—remains character-unique.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, high-density; figurative language is selective and paid off (“lingering luminance” reappears in sunset blaze). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor overwrite: “brilliant dimness” risks self-contradiction but is earned by thematic context. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive. Two filter-verb slips (“she found it beautiful”) do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “automation versus neglected wonder” angle refreshes familiar mage-tower tropes; keystone-as-sacred-key is a fresh synthesis. Emotional specificity—custodial shame, warmth of carved stone—grounds the concept so the plot could not transplant wholesale to another setting. Risk is quiet rather than flashy, but coherence and felt cost keep it memorable. No derivative echoes; the final garden that lacks only her stone feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
