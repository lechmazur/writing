<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus’s observant gaze and elevator-mechanic mindset drive every beat; the mainspring barrel as talisman objectifies his need to “read” abandoned places. Interiority stays concrete—never drifts into label-speak—and the final micro-choice to reach for the hatch crystallizes values. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Closure cost is present but comparatively quiet; hence shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each inspection beat (dust, cracks, brass find) tightens options toward the hatch reveal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 4; deliberate early disorientation not attempted, so no penalty. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s decision to engage accepts the “weightless burden” with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Persistent constraint—his gift/curse—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust grains, brass gleam, and ceiling-crack geometry are filtered through elevator-man’s professional eye, grounding space and POV. Micro-setting (the mainspring) doubles as plot engine, constraining the final move. Sensory hierarchy narrows to visual + tactile under failing light, mirroring internal focus. Final image recharges the dust pattern that first hinted at the hatch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curiosity vs. psychic cost—signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: ceiling cracks resolve into hidden hatch, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural/accumulative: dust, spring, echo converge to force stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of burden) rather than visceral, keeping it below 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of “repairing what can’t be seen” emerges from Marcus’s trade and gift; no direct statement. Subtext resides in silence of dead fluorescents and wound spring—objects that “wait.” Final image answers thematic question non-literally: ceilings hide unfinished stories, and engaging means carrying them. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the hatch will cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual signature—mechanical metaphors, light-angle math. No dialogue, so voice judged solely on narrative texture: rhythmic, slightly latinate diction suits reflective mood without drifting into purple. Psychic distance compresses under rising curiosity, mirroring heartbeat of flashlight beam. Filter verbs minimal and earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layered with dust physics, POV bias, and foreshadowing. Figurative control: metaphors (frozen lightning, scratched record) are clean, non-contradictory, and pattern-taught early. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythms vary. Minor alliteration is voice-motivated, not ostentatious.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elevator tech + ghost-whisperer is fresh synthesis; circus setting repurposed as memory archive. Dust-pattern analysis repurposes forensic skill into ghost-hunting method. Risk: quiet, accumulative escalation rather than twist—coherent but not boldly inverted. Specificity of mainspring barrel and photocopy-faded posters keeps it from generic ruin porn.</comment>
