<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marek’s inherited quest is legible and his patient observant nature stays consistent, but the interiority leans on abstract heritage (“rhythm of belonging”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final beat of shared wonder is moving yet feels bequeathed rather than earned through visible micro-choice. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ancestral return → luminous encounter → communal reprise builds density until the closing image reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by line 3; closure lands as Charged Poise—the dome fills with firefly constellations and Marek’s solitude is conceptually repriced into shared witness, cost felt in the imminent flood. One shard, single POV, no teleporting props; archive note and feather resonance bracket the tightening effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Underwater city is evoked with brine-crusted crystal and copper air, each detail filtered through Marek’s hushed reverence; bioluminescent廊 strands and amber-bound firefly serve as micro-settings that constrain his final act of waiting. Spatial choreography holds as he moves from lock to observatory to floor; the dome glass charges the closing image by literalizing the sky-mirror. Selective sensory economy—no gratuitous tech exposition—keeps atmosphere taut.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how to belong when landscapes shift”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the feather warms beside the archived firefly, forcing Marek’s stance from solitary search to communal witness. No antagonist needed; the sunrise deadline supplies external squeeze. Cost is conceptual: he forsakes exclusive inheritance for shared wonder, legible in the final lines, but the price feels lightly sketched rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: belonging is a practice of shared attention, not ancestral formula. The firefly constellation reprises earlier star-mapping research, reweighting their failed isolation into Marek’s open gaze. No moralizing; the closing image leaves ambiguity intact. The burnt feather motif recurs but mainly as heirloom conduit rather than active tension, limiting deeper subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marek; perceptual signature is textured (“cathedral breath of stale water”) without overwriting. Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, compresses at lock-groan and firefly lift, mirroring pulse. No dialogue to test; diction remains within Marek’s plausible lexicon. One stray elevated phrase—“fever dream dreamed in reverse”—barely jostles voice cohesion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; sentences avoid template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“fever dream,” “cathedral breath”) so closure glow feels earned, not sudden purple. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns clean. Only minor hedge—“something within still pulsed”—could be trimmed, but它不损害propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Abandoned astrologer-astronaut city visited by heir with burnt feather is fresh synthesis; fireflies as star-correlates flips typical sea-sky divide. Conceptual risk—lyric stillness over event-plot—heightens resonance without gimmick. Transformation test fails: swap names and the emotional arc survives, keeping score below 8.5.</comment>
