<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s custodian identity and retrocognitive gift are vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“as if the universe had whispered”) that flattens contradiction. No second character appears, so status crucible is moot; her sole micro-choice—climb at midnight—feels inevitable rather than costly. The prism momentarily embodies ancestral hands, yet the beat is summary, not sensed action. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized: we are told she “understood finally” without seeing the path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tower ascent crystallizes options and the pavilion’s approving hum reweights meaning with conceptual cost—she commits to becoming the living bridge. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prism discovery → memory cascade → decision to climb. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty. One scaffold loop—“she felt… she understood… she realized”—slows the final paragraph, but causality survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber-filtered glass pavilion is not backdrop; its vibration cues mood and final approval beat. The prism’s rainbow scatter literally re-colors the walls, marrying object to setting. Beacon skeleton anchors scale and forgotten purpose. Micro-setting succeeds: body-against-glass, palm-on-cold-surface tether interior to exterior. Environment constrains the only path—up the tower—so setting charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can shattered wonder reignite communal navigation?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: prism discovery re-opens a possibility long abandoned. No reversal, but a deepening under Accumulative lens suffices at this length. Cost is conceptual (she must shoulder ancestral voices) rather than visceral; hence ceiling at 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: fragments reassembled into meaning outlast civil collapse. Subtext lives in the pavilion’s refusal to stop humming—beauty as stubborn infrastructure. Final image of “shattered pieces reassembled” reweights earlier debris without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis, though “proving coincidences have meaning” flirts with Echo; saved by poetic distancing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s synesthetic perception—hum as weather, star paths as tactile tug. Rhythm swells then narrows to match rising hope. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Filter verbs appear but feel like custodian calibration, not leakage. Sentence variety and tactile diction create a singular atmospheric stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; most sentences dual-load atmosphere + exposition. Occasional modifier stacks (“lullaby of frequencies that the old engineers had somehow encoded”) verge on purple but stay within POV lexicon. One paraphrase loop in final paragraph; no mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Closure line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-collapse star-navigation via retro-cognition feels fresh, not reheated. Prism-as-vessel-of-“hush” transforms familiar light-splitter into communal memory drive. Risky lyric accumulation paid off in resonant final image. Could swap a few proper nouns, but custodian-beacon-cosmos nexus is specific enough to resist full transplant.</comment>
