<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The caretaker’s motivation to “preserve names” is legible and constant, but she never makes a micro-choice that risks or costs her anything; the ritual is identical each cycle, so no internal contradiction or escalation is dramatized. The final return of the wind chime merely restates her duty rather than crystallizing a new stance. Earned stasis is hinted at but not charged with visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked chime is restored to its altar, the library’s pulse acknowledging that the work is endless. The cost is conceptual—eternal servitude in foxglove regret—but felt only in abstract, not through a beat that narrows her options. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern deepens rather than pivots. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no causal breaks, but no decisive change either.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal library is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail—marble spun glass, frozen breath memory—each phrase serving the caretaker’s reverent attention. The wind chime’s fracture is micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the crack lets “something else escape,” a physical rule that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is stable; no exposition dumps. Environment mirrors interior mood without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are the preservation of forgotten names, signaled early and held throughout. Pressure is static: the night’s routine neither tightens nor risks failure; the museum never threatens collapse or loss. One meaningful escalation is missing; the caretaker’s tactics do not adapt. Cost is existential but not dramatized on this beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as the price of progress—emerges through recurring images of fossilized emotion and the caretaker’s nightly penance. Subtext resides in the crack that leaks more than sound: it leaks the unrecoverable. Final image of eternal return reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is coherent: preservation is both love and curse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“foxglove regret,” “dendritic fracture”) is specific to the caretaker’s cultivated sorrow. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic ritual cadence; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Perceptual signature is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned early, so density feels earned rather than purple. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “opal glow” recurs four times; could trim one without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Museum of extinct feelings is a fresh conceptual frame; cracked bamboo chime as memory phonograph is specific and non-obvious. Risk lies in the quiet, cyclical plot—no twist, only ritual—but the commitment to stasis feels deliberate rather than safe. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, because the chime’s fracture and foxglove regret are irreplaceable images. Conceptual integrity holds.</comment>
