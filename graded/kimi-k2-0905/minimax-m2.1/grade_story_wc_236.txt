<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her synesthetic memory of scent carries the loss. The micro-choice to pick up the screw and keep it warm literalizes her shift from mourning to attention. No contradiction under pressure; the arc is credible renunciation, though Mira stays functional rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elena re-weights “sensing” from scent to attentive care; the warm screw is felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of fog → light, scent → attention, birth → time. One smooth shard, orientation within 120 words, no causality breaks; tightening beat is the screw reveal that re-configures her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog, pine floors, and dripping clocks are selectively filtered through Elena’s altered perception. The birthing-clamp screw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; it constrains her new understanding. Spatial choreography is clean; shop feels lived-in without catalog. Environment never over-describes; each detail tilts her attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she regain a way to “sense” clients—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: fog lifts, screw emerges, attention crystallizes; one meaningful deepening suffices. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure tightens when object re-prices her vocation. Cost is legible in the warmed screw and her renunciation of smell-centric identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges: attention itself is a form of care that outlives any single sense. Subtext lives in silent tea steam and worn screw threads; no moralizing. Final image answers the question “how to heal?” without stating it. Particulars resist tidy uplift; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to Elena; perceptual signature is scent-memory and tactile precision. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences in fog, shorter clauses at screw reveal. No head-hop; diction stays within her lexicon. Distinct voice sustains without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density—every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective: “fog pressed like something wanting in” serves mood without clutter. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: aromatherapist losing smell → water-clock shop → midwife screw links birth and time. Not a trope parade; particulars feel inevitable. Risk is quiet, but stakes stay intimate and specific. Could perhaps push further, yet avoids gimmickry.</comment>
