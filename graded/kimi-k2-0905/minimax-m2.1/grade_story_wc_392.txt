<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—her grip on the lantern, the jaw-tighten at Chen—but the inherited-memory beat arrives as external download, not earned contradiction. No micro-choice in-scene wrestles with the entangled memories; they simply overwrite her, so the final “I’ll publish” lacks felt cost. The lantern lineage is shown, yet its emotional weight is asserted, not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elena decides to expose Chen, lantern now symbol of illumination not flight, cost framed as career peril. Causal lens holds: drought → body → memory download → decision. However, the inciting supernatural transfer is unmotivated, breaking strict causality; the report-filing coda is summarized, muting the decisive moment’s punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Brass lantern, rusted ladder, watermark line, sediment angle—each detail is filtered through Elena’s investigative gaze and steers her next measurement. Tunnel geography stays coherent; lantern’s glow limits visibility, creating intimate micro-setting that final image re-ignites. No environmental detail is wasted; all props either constrain motion or reappear in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes—uncover hidden murder versus bureaucratic cover-up—are signaled early and tighten when Chen’s obstruction is revealed. Yet pressure plateaus: the memory download solves the mystery for her, replacing protagonist agency with supernatural convenience. No tangible resource is lost or risked on-page; the cost is deferred to implied future retaliation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of institutional erasure versus individual illumination emerges through lantern lineage and buried archivist, never sermonized. Final image of “uncertain but honest light” reweights lantern from heritage talisman to ethical instrument. Subtext in skeleton’s reaching pose resonates without exposition. No platitudes intrude; meaning stays anchored to concrete objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—measured, forensic, slightly claustrophobic—never slips. Diction stays within Elena’s professional lexicon; short, observational sentences accelerate under memory intrusion then settle, mirroring pulse. No dialogue present; narration carries subtext through selective sensory filters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and rarely wasteful, but two adjacent “Elena could still see… Elena understood then” create template cadence. Mixed metaphor “water returned with vengeance” clashes with later flame imagery. No loops near closure; final sentence lands crisply. Artifacts are minor but keep the piece below high-band polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing drought-reopened infrastructure with inherited-memory noir delivers fresh angle on buried civil-rights crimes. Lantern-as-evidence-light reclaims family artifact from sentiment to accountability. Supernatural info-dump is the least original move, yet the specific historical victim and bureaucratic continuation twist the trope enough to feel inevitable.</comment>
