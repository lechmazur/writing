<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yuen’s interiority is concrete—dye-master patience, transplant strangeness—and his micro-shift from passive watching to active “return to his dye vats” is earned. The inherited-story capacity is slightly abstract, but the new-heart beat at the end bodies it. No contradictory impulses on page simultaneously; reflection dominates action. Still, the single-POV arc of becoming a story-vessel is credible and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wing-light patterns and valley mist density escalate meaning rather than plot. Closure is a Charged Poise—Yuen lifts the wing, sun trails re-weight his future—cost is the lifetime stewardship he now accepts. Anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One soft beat: “he understood then” is a micro-epiphany that could be more embodied, but it lands inside color-action, not abstract summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating tea-house, cedar table, sun slant through paper screens—each detail is filtered through dye-master sight and constrains the only possible action: watching light on color. Micro-setting (wing, cedar grain, sun trail) literally steers the epiphany. Valley mist and rock altitude are economical, never touristic. Final image of sun cascading across weathered hands re-uses established anchors, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—why stories stick to certain lives—tightens once: from curiosity to vowed stewardship. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive light/color that forces stance crystallization. Visible price: he must now teach apprentices receptivity, abandoning sole creator ego. Could use one earlier micro-loss (time, money) to raise cost, but the conceptual price is legible on the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: absorption/transformation metaphorized through dye and iridescence. No overt thesis—final lift of wing re-prices premise without moralizing. Subtext in “quiet explosiveness” links butterfly scale to human narrative scale. Resists tidy moral; complexity (inheritance, transplant, pedagogy) lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: color-craft vocabulary, patient syntactic rhythm mimicking dye bleed. No dialogue, so voice modulation occurs through psychic distance compression under light shifts. “Colors warned and promised in the same breath” is a self-contained metaphor that teaches pattern early. Final sentence cadence mirrors heartbeat, coherent with lyric texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; stacked color metaphors are pattern-taught and paid off, not overwritten. No loops or synonym churn. “Sun trails trace their patient paths” is a single instance of near-template cadence but fits dye-master idiom. Information density high—each sentence advances image or realization. Clean grammar, precise tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—transplant recipient decodes narrative magnetism via butterfly wing—is fresh synthesis rather than trope. Specificity of dye-craft lore anchors concept. Risk: quiet lyric escalation could feel static, but earned Charged Poise prevents gimmickry. Not quite 8.8 because wing-as-teacher device is faintly familiar, yet execution is individuated.</comment>
