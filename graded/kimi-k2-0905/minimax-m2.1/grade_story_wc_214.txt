<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, consistent, and embodied; the janitor’s spiritually-curious stance drives every micro-gesture. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—only serene continuity—so the character never risks a wrong move or cost. Still, the quiet arc of “witness → cradle → release” is credible and specific to this voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern of stillness + star-tracing early and holds it to the final image. Closure is a Charged Poise—amber fragment lifted into recycling fires—reconfiguring stillness as generative, not terminal. Cost is felt in the janitor’s tender slowness and the star’s extinguished blaze; no orientation or causality flaws intrude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Station, lantern glass, and star fragments form a micro-setting that constrains every motion; spatial choreography is clean and sensory detail selective. The amber glow threading from glass to fragment to dawn charges the final image without overt symbolism. One abstract phrase—“flourishing stillness”—is repeated rather than evolved, slightly diluting specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: witnessing vs. intervening with the fragment. A single deepening—kneeling to trace instead of scoop—narrows options and pays visible reverence as cost. No external opposition or reversal, but under an accumulative lens the pressure coheres through intensified stillness and the stakes feel proportionate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of strength-through-vulnerability emerges via tactile star-care rather than assertion. The amber refraction reweights stillness as creative force, offering resonant ambiguity. Final image avoids moralizing, though earlier “flourishing stillness” leans toward thematic label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, hushed, and rhythmically controlled; perceptual signature centers on light, glass, and slow gesture without repetition fatigue. Psychic distance stays tight; no head-hopping or register drift. One clause—“primal elegance”—reads slightly writerly against the plain spiritual tone, a hairline slip.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative strings serve the accumulative design. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“generations of janitors who had all understood something essential”) momentarily lifts the register above the focalizer’s plain curiosity, but not at closure.</comment>

<comment>“Cosmic janitor” + star hospice is fresh, and the yellow lantern glass as empathy-tech feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric stasis sustains tension without plot reversals, proving the concept. Specificity of amber fingerprints and recycling fires prevents drift into generic space-poetry.</comment>
