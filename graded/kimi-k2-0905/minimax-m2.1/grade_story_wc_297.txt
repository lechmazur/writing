<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The visionary’s interiority is vivid—her rooted body versus roaming mind creates a lived contradiction—but the final “choice” is largely symbolic (planting a clipping) rather than an actionable turn with visible trade-off; the emotional cost is felt yet causally under-dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: planting the clipping reconfigures her from passive receptor to active bridge, the price being irreversible fusion with every future dream; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern intensifies until the membrane image crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glade’s living soil, violet earth, and resin-scented clipping are re-used as tactile tools: the clipping ultimately replanted becomes the literal conduit for consciousness spill; environment constrains her immobility and then enables transcendence, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake—become the bridge—tightens once: accepting the covenant compresses her identity from observer to portal; the cost is rendered as “piercing illumination,” a felt burn that reweights her existence, satisfying the single deepening required under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance-as-transformation emerges through spiral/topiary recurrence; the image reframes rooted captivity into deliberate intergenerational link without overt statement—final image quietly re-prices prior myths as living obligation rather than nostalgic lore.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—synesthetic soil-pulse, synaptic dusk—and cadence swells then compresses exactly at the eclipse beat; no head-hop, no register drift; lyric pattern of “paths inward” is taught early and paid off in the final spiral flourish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density figurative layering remains coherent—no mixed metaphors—while rhythm accelerates into fragmentary bursts at transcendence; occasional adjective richness is justified by visionary POV; zero paraphrase loops, clean prop tracking, no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mythic immobile oracle trope is retooled through ecological grafting and neuro-topiary; future-rush premise binds land-covenants to dream topology, producing a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable after the first paragraph—risk heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
