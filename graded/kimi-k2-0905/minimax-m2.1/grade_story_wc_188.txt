<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her knees on cold stone, the weight of the satchel, the spiral burn she trusts. Contradictory impulses (fear of wasting her last rag vs need to reignite the sky) are held simultaneously in the moment she ties the knot. The final act is earned: she spends her grandmother’s heirloom spark and the village’s last silence, a visible forfeiture. Only the lineage epiphany (“I am a keeper…”) feels a hair over-articulated, trimming the top decimal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: vanished stars → heavier world → Mira walks → mosaic dare → she burns the rag. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is locked by word 80. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: one irreplaceable rag gone, sky still blank, but human response triggered; the “gravity of hopelessness” is physically contested. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; even the mosaic note is discovered, not delivered. A 9.0 would need the cost to boomerang back onto Mira’s body or future options on this same page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fortress flowers, crumbling siege stone, and the rag’s oilcloth texture all filter through Mira’s pyrotechnician eye—smell of thyme vs memory of kerosene. The micro-setting of the courtyard flagstones literally anchors the spiral burn that concludes the story, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography is clean: gate → courtyard → great hall → back to courtyard; no floating rooms. One minor over-spray: “ancient stones that had once been quarried for war and were now crumbling into earth for flowers” packs three metaphors into one clause, slightly diluting the tactile immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—re-light the sky or accept collective despair—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when she decides to burn the non-replaceable rag. The escalation is single but meaningful: discovery of the dare → realization she must spend the heirloom → spiral ignition. Cost is legible: the rag can never be retied; village silence is broken, exposing her to unknown reception. Could edge higher if the story let us feel the physical risk of a botched burn inside those stone walls.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particular fire chemistry and vanished stars: controlled human combustion as answer to cosmic blackout. Final image reframes prior motif—spiral becomes “hope taking physical form despite gravity,” a conceptual repricing that avoids moralizing. Subtext of playfulness vs mortality is woven into diction (“serious playfulness,” “deadly serious and fundamentally absurd”). The essayistic line “darkness could be pierced…” is the closest to overt thesis but is earned by the imminent act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s perceptual filter—smells, weights, chemical ratios. Rhythm mimics her counting chant: long lyrical sentences build, then fracture into clause bursts at ignition. No head-hopping; every metaphor is one she could plausibly craft (“like a reaching hand”). The slight register lift in “ambient awareness” is justified as her professional term. Voice stays distinct and pressured to the last ember.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm swings from processional cadence to spark-quick fragments at the light-off. Figurative density is high but patterned—fire as question mark, hand, hope—teaching the reader early and paying off in final spiral. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One micro-scaffold: “the flame caught, catching, catching hold” could drop one “catching,” but the triplet is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing vanished stars with itinerant fireworks maker feels non-obvious and specific; the mosaic dare turns standard “bring back the light” quest into tactile puzzle. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic messenger—chemistry knowledge, chant, and rag properties are indispensable. Risk in lyrical escalation is balanced by grounded procedural detail. Not quite 9+ because the premise still echoes familiar “last light-bringer” myth, albeit richly re-detailed.</comment>
