<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s patient-strategic trait is credibly lived-in; the three-year decoding effort shows endurance, not tell. Yet her interiority stays general—“keeper of futures,” “stubborn miracle”—rather than revealing a contradictory impulse under the vault’s hush. Because no second character shares the scene, the crucible is purely situational; her embodied cost registers as the awkward chains and slowed descent, but the beat stops short of a micro-choice that forecloses one seed option over another. Still, the silent catechism of keys gives her a memorable perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is legible: wall falls → Mira reaches vault → will wait, then plant. The piano-bench cipher delivers a clean Decisive Change (door opens) with visible effort (chains, three-year study). Orientation is anchored by word 70; no penalty. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she will stay hidden, pay time later—so cost is conceptual but undeniable under the inferred Causal lens. The only hairline slip: the arrow-sigil beat appears at the vault threshold without prior motive, slightly softening the because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Redemption-center debris is tactile, selective, and POV-filtered: cracked rubber balls serve as both camouflage and emotional echo. The piano bench’s velvet split and horsehair stuffing ground the decoding moment in one textured object. Spatial choreography is flawless—prize wall slides, staircase descends, scanner wall, aisles—no floating geography. The synthetic-fletched arrow qualifies as a micro-setting tool that returns to activate the scanner, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve seed diversity—arrives early and tightens once: soldiers will come, she must wait. The piano-key gambit is the single meaningful escalation that narrows options (vault opens, but timing is now enemy-controlled). Cost is legible—she accepts temporal captivity to secure seeds—yet the beat is internal; no immediate loss of a specific seed or ally on the page keeps it just shy of the 8.8 band. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: living memory vs. engineered erasure. The carnival’s dead prizes mirrored against dormant seeds reweights “redemption” without authorial nudge. Final image—wall down, illusion ended—offers a resonant Conceptual Repricing that reframes the entire regime era. No terminal moralizing; ambiguity persists about which seeds will actually survive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person floats close to Mira’s sinewy attention: “clinking softly,” “catechism of survivors.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with her stealth—long sentence for approach, clipped fragments for descent. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on perceptual signature and metaphoric economy; the phrase “green scent of dormant potential” stays within her botanist-poet idiom. No head-hop or register drift; rhythmic control heightens pressure without purple spill.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with participle, noun, adverb to avoid drumbeat. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked in the vault’s hush. One paraphrase loop—“prison and her purpose” / “prison and her purpose” in adjacent clauses—triggers −0.2; otherwise density is high. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; prop states track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing botanical heist with derelict carnival is fresh; seed vault behind stuffed-animal case feels inevitable in hindsight. Piano keys as taxonomic cipher transforms mundane prop into high-stakes lock without gimmickry. Risk is taken—no confrontation, pure stealth—yet coherence holds. The synthesizing image of synthetic-banner arrow fletching crystallizes the up-cycled world logic.</comment>
