<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt-shocked muteness and regenerated nerves are embodied in every beat; the pocketed bolt is a tactile micro-choice that externalizes his self-indictment. Interior contradiction—safety as accomplice to danger—drives the final ascent. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“unpardonable silence”) that slightly over-articulates what the imagery has already shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory shard adds weight until the bronze dust trail reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Marcus keeps climbing, safety’s cost now legible—paid for by the bolt’s weight and the snow-notes image. Orientation is swift; causality never breaks; the single tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (numb hand, thigh-pocketed bolt) and the snow-choked staircase constrain every move; fortress stone and winter cold are filtered through Marcus’s hypersensitive nerves. The bolt’s green oxidation against snow-glare is a visual hook that charges the final image. Micro-setting mastery lets 800 words feel vast.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—tightens once: the bronze trail forces Marcus to admit safety = complicity. No reversals are needed under the accumulative lens; the single deepening beat lands with felt cost (bolt pocketed, path chosen). Pressure is coherent, personal, and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from bolt-to-snow music metaphor: silence as active collaborator in harm. Final image reweights “safety” from refuge to accessory without moralizing. Subtext of fraternal betrayal stays implicit, carried by the bolt’s weight—an object lesson in theme-through-particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited is locked to Marcus’s perceptual signature—every descriptor is nerve-sharp, cathedral-hushed. Syntax lengthens then fragments under pressure; diction stays within a former chorister’s lexicon. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice modulates with cold and guilt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: sentences carry triple duty (image, metaphor, emotional calculus). One scaffold loop—“unpardonable silence” repeated with minor rephrasing—dulls the peak beat slightly. Otherwise rhythm varies, metaphors cohere, and the final clause sings without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar guilt-recovery arc made fresh by nerve-regeneration body-horror and the seraphically mundane bolt. Snow-as-music reconfiguration is an earned, non-obvious turn. Risk lies in lyric stillness rather than plot pyrotechnics; the gamble pays off in resonance.</comment>
