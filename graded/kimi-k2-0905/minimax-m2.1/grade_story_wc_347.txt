<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s inherited dread and reluctant caretaker mantle are viscerally embodied in the weight-transfer image; her micro-choice to kneel and insert the nut crystallizes a hierarchy of values—strangers’ lives over perpetual solitude—yet the interior contradiction between duty and desire stays more summarized than simultaneously enacted in scene. The final ascent costs her the last warmth she carried, a visible price, but the emotional layering flattens slightly because the traveler voices are heard, not faced, so status dynamics and relational crucible remain theoretical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the stone flower opens, path revealed, travelers implicitly saved, and Mira’s irrevocable commitment sealed by the grinding “almost music,” a felt cost that reweights her prior silence. Causal chain holds—nut→depression→mechanism—under a single continuous scene; blueprint gaps create credible ellipsis rather than convenience. Orientation is anchored by word 60 and the lens stays accumulative-textural, tightening cadence toward the frost deadline without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard-cliff-maze triad is filtered through Mira’s bone-cold attention—temperature, texture, brass glare—so topography steers every footfall; the mechanical birds’ cry-pattern supplies both countdown and spatial cue. Environment literally shapes tactics: only the cliffside steps grant descent, only the frost clock propels the final insert. Final image of “warm darkness” reconfigures the earlier sea-cold wind, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lost travelers vs. frost-sealed mechanism—tightens once via the birds’ accelerating alarm; Mira’s agency is decisive insertion, not observation. Price is paid immediately: her immunity momentarily breaks, cold bites foot, then the irrevocable surrender of the nut forecloses retreat. Escalation is single but sufficient; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant stewardship emerges through the orchard that “does not care,” the nut-key that demands sacrifice, and the final image of an open path Mira herself will never take. No moral is stated; resonance arises from the weight-transfer inheritance reconfigured into active gift. Ambiguity lingers: she remains exiled, now knowingly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mira’s perceptual bias—brass glare, stone temperature, blueprint smudges—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under pressure then fractures into short beats at insertion, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, yet interior diction remains concrete, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; most sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Occasional adjective stacks—“offhandedly exact geography”—slightly overdecorate a high-pressure beat, but metaphor logic stays coherent. Zero loops, clean tense, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing clockwork birds, cliffside labyrinth, and botanical curse into one myth-mechanical system feels fresh; the nut-key blueprint mechanic reverses typical quest tokens by requiring surrender, not possession. Specificity of “three short, two long” cry pattern and temperature-coded stones prevents generic fantasy gloss. Risk is moderate but successful.</comment>
