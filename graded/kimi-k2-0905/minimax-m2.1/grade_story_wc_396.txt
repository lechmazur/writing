<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—wanting to “map empathy onto action” while carrying shadows—surfaces early and recurs, but the final choice to carry the fragment toward the ships is more asserted than dramatized; we see the compass-like swing yet feel no bodily cost or risk that would foreclose an alternative path. Her calm intuition is consistently filtered through orchard, ice, and mirror imagery, but the emotional crescendo is compressed into one abstract exhalation. Still, the hierarchy of values (truth over easy peace) remains legible and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered images (mirrors, crystal faces, orchard-on-ice) accrete until the final image reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mira exits with the fragment warming her pocket, ice softening, option space reconfigured; the cost is the perpetual burden of clearer sight. Orientation is clean by word 80; causality holds via “because the fragment showed, therefore she walks.” One minor elasticity: the ships’ immediate peril is told, not seen, muting the tightening beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The impossible orchard, the vintage store bleaching into existence, and the mirror-crystal optics are rendered with selective sensory precision that constrains Mira’s choices: the fragment literally points her off-page. Ice and wind shift from atmospheric backdrop to tactical agent (“softening the ice enough for safe passage”), charging the final image. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly. Micro-setting (fragment-as-compass) satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“see clearly enough to guide ships”—is signaled in para 1 and tightens once when the fragment’s faces merge into an expectant single gaze, forcing her choice to act as living lens. Cost is conceptual (lifetime weight of accurate sight) rather than visceral, but legible. Agency sits in her decision to walk toward the passage; no reversal, yet a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Escalation would sharpen if ship distress were shown rather than implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: peace as prismatic understanding rather than absence of conflict. Mirrors, crystal shards, and layered selves form a returning motif that reconfigures meaning in the final beat without moralizing. Subtext is carried in silence—the shopkeeper’s unexplained gift, the unlisted names of the lost. Complexity is honored; no tidy thesis closes the circuit. Resonance lingers in the image of fragmented light guiding real hulls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is maritime-lyric (“salt that dried into skin from years of sea wind”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during the crystal swing, matching pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Filter verbs serve poetic rhythm and are pattern-consistent. Free-indirect moments (“she understood safety to include the hunger…”) feel character-native, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech, avoiding template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned (light/ice/mirror) and pays off in closure, so no penalty. One paraphrase loop: “she understood… she understood” within five lines—minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Strong information density: each sentence layers image and stakes simultaneously. Line artifacts never touch the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse orchard grown in ship-borne soil, mirrors that show recursive selves, and peacekeeper-as-lens feel freshly synthesized rather than checklist-assembled. The crystal fragment’s shatter becomes a metaphor for perception itself, inevitable in hindsight. Risk resides in the magical store’s unexplained arrival, but the pattern is taught early and integrated into causality. Specificity anchors the fantastical—apples traded for lamp oil, copper-smelling shopkeeper—resisting generic abstraction.</comment>
