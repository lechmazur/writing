<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection while enforcing distance—are dramatized in every micro-choice: her stillness at the man’s approach, the refusal to cross the invisible membrane, the silent counting of years. The final line she allows herself (“You’re leaving”) is earned by three years of suspended speech; its crack carries the full cost of intimacy maintained through omission. Interiority is concrete and fungus-filtered, never diagnostic; the “physics of letting go” is lived, not explained. The closing triangle of familiar strangers achieves Charged Poise: a stance crystallized, paths foreclosed, cost felt in the breath they do not share.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each pulse of bioluminescence thickens the pattern of unspoken nearness until the final breath brightens the network into visibility. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira’s realization that separation itself has been their love language—charged by the laser pointer’s seven-year weight and the man’s cracked vowel. Orientation is taught early (“the hush before the echo”) and anchors hold; no因果 break. Cost is unmistakable: the word “leaving” severs the cultivated silence that had defined them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mushroom farm is not backdrop but active constraint: fungal light responds to footfalls, guiding distance and revealing thresholds Mira obeys. The compressed-earth corridor, the intersection of cultivation rows, and the glowing mycelial threads together constitute the micro-setting that dictates where bodies may stop. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the man halts at the exact geometric boundary every time, turning layout into love grammar. One hairline slip: the phrase “eastern corridor” is floated once and never reused, leaving faint orientation drift—just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can intimacy survive without disclosure? Pressure accumulates through luminous pulses and withheld syllables until the single spoken sentence tightens every prior silence into audible cost. No reversals are needed; the escalation is a deepening of density—three years of quiet folding into one cracked word. The price is visceral: the utterance dissolves the very architecture that sustained their connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from fungal law: permeability is not invasion but recognition of existing filaments. The final image—three figures forming a charged triangle in blue-green light—offers a non-literal answer: love can be the deliberate maintenance of an untouched cap. No moral is stated; the physics of letting go is demonstrated, not preached. Counter-readings linger: is this devotion or cowardice? The ambiguity is productive, not decorative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is dense, mycelial, rhythmic—long sentences braid clauses like hyphae, then break into spore-short fragments at the climax. Diction stays within Mira’s sensorium: “bioluminescent rows,” “compressed earth,” “mechanical certainty.” Filter verbs are minimal; perception is immediate. The single line of dialogue carries seven years of cadence in its crack—voice modulation under pressure achieved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like the fungi: long luminescent sentences swell, then contract into the terse “You’re leaving.” No loops or scaffold; every image does double duty (“luminous and permeable” marries light and emotion). One near-muddle: “revolution through permeable barriers” is repeated twice in close succession—minor paraphrase sting, not closure-touching. Otherwise high-density, zero filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: intrusion detection as mycology of intimacy; laser pointer as revolutionary lantern of silent networks. The trope of forbidden love is retooled into a politics of maintained distance, making silence a cultivar. Risk—entire plot hinges on luminous dirt and one cracked syllable—pays off in inevitability. Specificity of fungal agriculture and spatial gift feels author-discovered, not assembled from prompt parts.</comment>
