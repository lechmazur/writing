<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nameless protagonist’s motive—collecting overheard fragments to reconstruct erased histories—remains consistent and embodied in the tactile handling of the poison label. Interiority is atmospheric rather than deeply contradictory; the “filtering differently” trait is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. The final decision to keep the label and continue unnamed is credible but costs are stated abstractly (“weight became too heavy”) rather than shown through bodily or relational risk. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the label’s preservation reweights the death-certificate erasure, proving survival without official sanction. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fragment-gathering tightens into meaning at the end. Orientation is taught early via the container maze and tide rhythm; no penalty applied. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric-accumulative mode; the label’s discovery feels fated by tide rather than coincidence, satisfying the lens. Cost is legible in the final image of the softened paper tucked among years of fragments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is immediately anchored and continuously filtered through the nameless one’s biased attention—corrugated walls “like rusted skyscrapers,” salt breath, shifting corridors. Sensory selection narrows to touch and sound (soft paper, water against metal) that guide choice. The poison label acts as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture—its cloth-like fragility dictates gentle pocket-placement, charging the closure. Environment, body, and object interlock without ornamental excess; specificity never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival of memory against official erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when the label is found. One meaningful tightening occurs: the label’s discovery reweights the stakes from vague collection to tangible proof, foreclosing the option of surrender. Pressure grows accumulatively via tidal rhythm and fragment density rather than causal reversals. Cost is present but abstract (continued namelessness); a more visceral price would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: erased histories can outlive documents through communal storytelling and the refusal to disappear. Subtext operates in the poison label turned talisman—suicide deferred becomes evidence of endurance. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing: the unnamed keeper walks on, pockets full of contraband memory. Ambiguity is purposeful; complexity is honored rather than balanced into tidy symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to the nameless one’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Syntax is rhythmic, oceanic, with controlled repetition (“fragments,” “rhythm,” “tides”) that teaches the accumulative pattern. Diction remains within the character’s plausible lexicon while reaching for elevated cadence; occasional poetic compression (“the看见 through”) is legible and motivated. Voice modulates from mournful to quietly resolved without breaking texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image + emotional reverb. Minor loop: “fragments” appears nine times without new inflection late in text, dulling edge slightly. Metaphors stay coherent (tide as breath, paper as cloth). No scaffolding or register drift; clarity intact at closure. A crisper final sentence would nudge toward 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—death-certificate error survivor mapping memory through overheard scraps—feels fresh and specific to port liminality. Accumulative lyric structure mirrors theme; risk pays off without obscuring closure. Tropes (poison bottle label, maze of containers) are transformed through salt-water preservation and communal currency. While echoes of maritime ghostliness exist, the synthesis of bureaucratic erasure with tidal archaeology is memorable.</comment>
