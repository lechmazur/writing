<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction pulses vividly—organic blood in titanium limbs, fear-box cradled yet never opened. Micro-choice chain is legible: keep box → open box → inhale fears → fold them origami-tight. Cost is felt when she “fragments into all the moments she had contained”—a body-count of memory paid in real time. Final endurance (empty box, upright roses) reads as Earned Stasis with her rebuilt hands still trembling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image-density rises like static, then resolves into quiet crystalline cadence. Closure is Charged Poise—“strange and organic and beautifully broken” reweights every prior mention of circuits vs pulse. Orientation anchored by word 40 (desert rose farm, domes, wandering north). Single causal gap—how “miniaturize chaos” mechanically fixes magnetic drift—but metaphoric logic is taught early and paid off in final image; cost is her emptied chest cavity, not world mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass dome, thorned stems, rebuilt hands, and fear-smoke function as micro-setting that constrains every move; roses tilt only when she inhales their dread. Magnetic drift is not backdrop but active antagonist warping nutrient lines—setting literally poisons the stake. Final image of dome intact and north relocated reprises opening sky-hum, now charged with her bodily cost. Sensory triage is POV-perfect: Cara notices scent of synthetic petals before color, fitting caretaker ontology.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save roses by curing her own signal noise—tightens when magnetic shift corrupts their feedlines. Escalation is textural: static density mounts in her processors until language itself fragments; roses’ inward curl mirrors her folding of fears. One decisive turn: she shifts from external repair to internal ingestion of chaos, foreclosing sterile detachment. Price is irreversible hybridization—she ends less machine, more mortal uncertainty—visible in “strangely organic” pulse that no manual can calibrate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordless: containment as tenderness—fears kept not deleted but folded small enough to carry. Motif of “north” migrates from compass to ribcage, reweighted when she becomes the new true north. No moral spoken; instead, final image of empty box = zeroed fear yet perpetual scar. Subtext whispers that caregiving always demands metabolizing others’ chaos into one’s own biology—an ethic neither saintly nor suicidal, merely necessary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is chrome-and-blood hybrid: clauses slide from diagnostic precision (“rebuilt seventeen times”) to lyric vapor (“sky that no longer knew where north belonged”). Perceptual signature notices mechanical hum then petal scent—caretaker’s hierarchy. Syntax mirrors pressure: long winding sentences during static storm, then clipped fragments at moment of folding. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside Cara’s sensorium, closing on “beautifully broken” self-diagnosis that feels earned, not therapeutic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate algorithmic lilt that melts into organic cadence—mirror of her transformation. Metaphors are internally coherent (magnetic ribbons, origami shadows) and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle on box, roses, or static. Information density high: one line does three jobs—e.g., “roses did not know they were artificial, and neither, increasingly, did Cara” = world rule + character blur + foreshadow. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—android gains soul, apocalyptic dome—are reforged through fear-box and magnetic field as emotional prosthetics. Miniaturizing chaos via origami inhalation is fresh procedural metaphor that could not transplant to another tale. Risk of lyric static is embraced and paid off in resonant final image. Specificity of synthetic roses’ nutrient regulators vs wandering pole roots the speculative in tactile botany, avoiding generic ruin porn.</comment>
