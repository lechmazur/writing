<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific—her father’s card-counting under sodium lights lands as embodied memory—but the present-scene micro-choices are thin; she boards, walks, sits, speaks once. The hospital moment pivots on a single declarative sentence (“They’re invitations…”) without on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse, so the final stance feels announced rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands: the lantern reweights “honest light” into mutual recognition. Causal chain is loose—subway scrawls are never shown to alter her actual route or tactics—so the turn hinges on accumulation of motif rather than because/therefore linkage; lens = Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, one transition (library→hospital), coherent shard pair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rainwashed library and wet-stone smell are filtered through grief-biased attention; the candle lantern micro-setting constrains the final beat—she opens its pane as the shared confession. Spatial choreography across subway→hospital is clean. Environment never over-describes; each sensory touch primes the father-daughter stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she confess understanding to her father—signals early but pressure stays interior; no external obstacle tightens after the subway photos. Escalation is a single mood shift inside the hospital room; cost is conceptual (abandoning the safety of “careful rebellion”) yet not dramatized as a forfeiture we can see. Sufficient for micro-length, but thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of risk-as-love emerges through recurring probability imagery rather than statement; the lantern’s “honest light” reprises as shared honesty. Subtext in subway graffiti keeps math metaphor alive. Final sentence’s “multiplication of meaning” risks thematic echo, but it is folded into the closure image, so abstraction is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect hugs her mathematician perceptual filter: “understanding probability might somehow save him from himself.” Syntax lengthens with emotional humidity, tightens at hospital. No dialogue to distort voice. One clause drifts toward academic register (“lucid contradiction of being the one exception”) yet fits POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high but patterned—rain, paper, sodium, mica—so repetition feels purposeful. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“clover melancholy,” “addition of losses that might yet become multiplication”) flirts with purple yet supports voice. Closure line is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The math-professor daughter decoding graffiti to forgive her gambling father offers fresh angle; risk-as-love is not new, but the lantern-as-honesty device and probabilistic lexicon particularize it. Structure follows familiar grief→reconciliation arc, yet accumulative lens refreshes delivery. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicked.</comment>
