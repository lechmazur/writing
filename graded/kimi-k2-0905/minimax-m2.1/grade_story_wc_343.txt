<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity is credibly embodied—thumb on worn phrasebook, night-long measuring—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky choice; the climax is observation, not stakes-laden decision, so the cost feels intellectual rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hopscotch-board cipher reweights the starlings’ meaning and Mira’s future. Causal chain is thin—luminance simply appears, pattern merely noticed—but under Accumulative lens the density of mirrored geometries satisfactorily reconfigures her world; cost is the sleepless vigil she willingly pays.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Airship timbers, brass porthole, and chalk-scarred cargo floor are tactile and POV-filtered; the phrasebook’s dog-eared corners and the hopscotch grid’s mirrored symmetry constrain her measuring action and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes (“chart the next great discovery”) are declared early but never tested by opposition or risk; pressure escalates only as intensified attention, not narrowed options. No live trade-off or price is dramatized, so the tightening remains intellectual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-seeking as solitary vocation emerges through mirrored geometries and starlings’ dance, avoiding explicit statement. Final image of dawn-scattered birds reweights earlier isolation with earned triumph, offering resonant ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is steady, with pleasing rhythmic variation and cartographer-specific diction (“measured with the ship’s chronometer”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature—attention to proportion, angle, symmetry—remains distinctive under fatigue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor filter slips (“she found what she had been unconsciously seeking”) and one paraphrase loop (“patterns that seemed almost deliberate—gatherings and dispersals…”) slightly dull immediacy. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of starling murmuration, antique airship, and hopscotch cipher feels fresh and specific; the navigational code hidden in child’s play is an unexpected, organic synthesis. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than jeopardy—but execution is confident.</comment>
