<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “minute departure” radar is vivid, but she never risks a wrong guess or pays a price for mis-reading; the final recognition feels gifted, not earned. No contradictory impulse unsettles her arc—she observes, catalogs, and is rewarded with epiphany. Interiority is lush yet diagnostically tidy (“she understands finally”) rather than wrestled-with under live pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—house-as-memory is legible and reweighted—but cost is only asserted, not dramatized on her body, choices, or forfeited option. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; however, single-scene default is strained by ~120-word delay before spatial anchor (harbor road) and mild loop in “she understands finally” restatement. Orientation debt is mild but present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Salt-worn clapboard, orris ghost, tide-worn path—selective sensory triangulation roots us fast and keeps pressure local. Streetlight violet-to-yellow shift bookends the piece, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the coffee-cup residue) functions as tactile proof-of-presence and constrains her next gentle placement—meets the 9+ gate within scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why houses feel alive”—is declared early but never narrowed or tested by an opposing force or possible misreading; tension is atmospheric, not decisive. No visible price (time, safety, social credit) alters her tactics. Meaningful tightening is the final conceptual flip, yet it complicates nothing she could have chosen otherwise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited sensitivity emerges via orris and coffee-cup traces, avoiding explicit moral. Final image reweights earlier minutiae as ancestral conversation, satisfying resonance. A hairline slip toward echo-statement (“she understands finally”) keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at a consistent middle distance, its syntax mimicking tidal ebb—long wave sentences broken by hyphenated fragments. Perceptual signature (“creeping normality noticer”) colors every noun choice. No head-hop or register drift; compression like “shard of hush” is taught by immediate context and repaid in closing line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythmic modulation carries reader forward; clauses accrete like silt without paraphrase loops. Occasional stack of two adjectives (“salt-worn clapboard,” “faint residual warmth”) stays within POV lexicon and avoids purple overload. One mixed micro-image (“daydreaming streetlights”) is ornamental, not muddling, and occurs early, leaving closure untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inheritance-of-attention angle refreshes the well-trod “haunted house” trope by denying haunting-as-horror and opting for haunting-as-craft. Orris root specificity and grandmother-perfumer background feel discovered, not bolted on. Risk is modest—quiet lyricism over structural daring—but synthesis is coherent and memorable.</comment>
