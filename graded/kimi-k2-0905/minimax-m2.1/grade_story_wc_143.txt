<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—her “professionally obsessive” lens filters every beat. The grain of sand objectifies her mentor-haunted value hierarchy and seeds the final renunciation. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the emotional turn is reported rather than embodied under pressure, keeping her just shy of 9-band immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the chemical image slowly developing inside the camera reweights her witness into permanent loss. The causality chain—earthlight triggers sublimation, clock forces one exposure, film will outlast frost—lands with conceptual cost on the page. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lunar frost, regolith footprints, and the antique chemical chamber are rendered through Mira’s crater-inspector gaze, each detail tethered to her倒计时. The moonlit summit literally constrains her movements and exposure window, charging the final image. One minor orientation wobble: “earthlight” is used before its source is anchored, but the payoff justifies the poetic compression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—document irreversible loss—tightens once: the frost will vanish at sunrise. Agency is the deliberate delayed exposure that accepts permanent absence; cost is the vanishing subject itself, legible on the page. No secondary reversal, but the single meaningful deepening satisfies accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the parallel between chemical latency and geological transience; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of “scattered diamonds” reframes beauty as inseparable from mortality. Ambiguity is preserved: witness is triumph and defeat simultaneously, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person free indirect stays snug to Mira’s technician-poet diction: “tiny monuments to human passage,” “chemical developing chamber.” Rhythm swells toward the shutter release then subsides into resignation, mirroring the dawning light cadence. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntactic axis; no template cadence detected. Figurative layer (“turning the surrounding silence into something almost tangible”) is sparse, taught early, and paid off in the hush-to-blaze transition. One scaffold trace: “she had traveled farther… she understood why” is mild exposition but propels motive. Otherwise lean, high-density lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: lunar frost as disappearing artifact documented by obsolete wet chemistry. The hourglass grain repurposed as memento mori is an elegant, non-obvious fusion of timekeeping metaphors. Voice-level specificity prevents this from reading like standard “last photograph” stories.</comment>
