<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara’s loneliness and perception are evocatively sketched, but she never makes a visible choice; the tension between her gift and wound is declared, not dramatized. Interiority drifts into abstract cosmology (“to hear everything was to understand…”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure means motivation stays static; closure is a step into mist, not a costly act. The result is atmospheric but unmotivated portraiture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers image-signals (shell, starlight, hum) toward a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear by word 60; however, escalation is purely cadence-based—no beat narrows options or exacts cost. Closure is lyric but not decisive; the final step is portent without consequence. Hence the lens coheres but the required tightening never lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Desert-night sensorium is selective and POV-filtered: “dry riverbeds,” “silver shadows,” “persistent question” keep the palette tight. The cracked seashell acts as micro-setting, handled twice and warmed in palm—its changing state charges the final image. Starlight shift is used as causal timer, not postcard. Spatial choreography stays clean; canyon acoustics are woven through action instead of backdrop lists. One of the stronger showings in the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is declared early, but never tested or sharpened. Pressure is atmospheric (hum grows louder) rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Escalation is a slow volume knob, not a turning screw. Agency remains observational; the final step is exploratory, not irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the cost of hyper-perception, the ethics of stolen voice. Subtext sits in the shell’s whispered dust and the trapped frequency of echo-people, never sermonized. Final image reweights the premise—she enters the song, surrendering solitude to possible fusion—without moral dictation. Ambiguity is productive, but the lack of embodied cost keeps it shy of top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, internally consistent: long breathed sentences mirror canyon echoes; diction stays within a mystic-performer lexicon. Perceptual signature is sharp—“layered frequencies,” “note of desperation hidden beneath mimicry.” No head-hop; psychic distance narrows credibly under starlight. Minor template cadence in “she had…she had…” clusters, but cadence serves incantatory build; never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—metaphors extend acoustic logic. One paraphrase loop: “she had spent…she had come…” (adjacent sentences) costs −0.2. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“progressive disclosure”) momentarily lifts POV register, but usage is brief. Closure line breathes cleanly; no artifact touches final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—stolen vocal frequencies, echo-people—is fresh SF-mythic fusion. Execution stays conceptual rather than dramatized, reducing transformative punch. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation instead of causal plot. Specificity of canyon acoustics and shell-in-ear keeps it from generic anywhere-fantasy, but lacks a singular inflection that would feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
