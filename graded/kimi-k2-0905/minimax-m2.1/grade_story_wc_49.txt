<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-tinged devotion and generational guilt are vivid, but the text leans on summary (“waited seventeen years,” “studied its properties”) rather than showing a contradictory impulse in-scene. No micro-choice complicates her resolve; the song succeeds the instant she begins, so the promised flaw/fragility never tests her. Earned cost is present—she weeps, the vine revives—yet the absence of a live decision under pressure keeps the arc just shy of high-band resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure earns its resonance: a Charged Poise as the moonvine bursts into luminous life, re-weighting heritage and possibility with undeniable felt cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer thickens until the dawn alignment ruptures into new life. Orientation is clear by line 4 and anchors every 10–15 sentences; no causality breaks. Slight withholding—the song’s mechanism is asserted not tested—nudges it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arbor’s breathing humidity and brass-glint dawn keep choice tactile: stone bed, poison-free soil, moonlit mist—all constrain where and how the vine must be planted. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s tinkerer eye: gears, lenses, soil acidity over tourist vistas. Final image of “luminous leaves that seemed to pulse with inner fire” recharges every prior visual thread. Environment charges the closure directly, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the moonvine or accept permanent loss—arrives early and tightens through pattern accretion: moon sinking, sun cresting, song rising. Escalation is one slow squeeze rather than sharp reversal; alignment window narrows, stakes accumulate, but no live trade-off complicates tactics. Cost is aesthetic and communal, not personal-risk, keeping pressure lyrical rather than combustive. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks the visible price that would punch into 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as reciprocity: stories humans forgot but plants remember, retrievable only through reciprocal gift of voice and time. No character verbalises this; meaning accrues via golden threads and generational satchel. Final image answers the implicit question—can techno-rational tinkering alone heal ecological rupture?—with a hushed No: only surrendered song revives. Subtext avoids moral statement, earns its quiet reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-person close keeps psychic distance tight to Elara’s perceptual quirks: brass goggles tint moon amber, tools click in metric rhythm. Syntax lengthens and breathes with song cadence, then fractures into short pulses at vegetal eruption—rhythmic control mirrors emotional crest. Diction stays within a tinkerer’s lexicon; no ornamental thesaurus drift. Voice is distinctive yet transparent enough to carry lyric charge without obscuring events.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: paragraph lengths swell/contract like tidal breath; sentence openings vary; no loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors are coherent—“golden threads like spun sunlight” keeps within loom logic. One mixed vehicle: “mist…clung…painted…amber and pearl” layers tactile/cliché color, but it lands in calm beat, not closure. Information density high; every clause either enriches setting or interiority. Minor purple tint but no clarity loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of biopunk tinkerer with druidic song-activism is fresh; it sidesteps both solarpunk tech triumph and pastoral nostalgia. Moonvine genetic memory is grounded in botanically plausible tropes—epigenetic dormancy—giving speculative bite. Risk is taken in eschewing antagonist or failure; success is guaranteed, yet the emotional payoff still feels earned. Not transformative at premise level, but specific accretion makes the synthesis memorable.</comment>
