<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s precognitive forgetfulness is vividly embodied—she forgets the future while clutching chalk to stay present—but the piece never tests the trait under duress; she drifts to the fountain, listens, and smiles without a micro-choice that costs her anything. The interior contradiction is stated, not dramatized; the final “peace” arrives as thematic label rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the tiny bone-growth sound crystallizes the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the garden reweights her longing into “almost peace”—and the cost is the unchanging future she still can’t hold. Orientation is complete by line 5; no因果 breaks, though the middle sags slightly in repeated fog/videotape iterations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fog, mossy videotapes, and chalky soap texture are filtered through Mira’s prophet-gaze; every object drips with abandoned memory and guides her feet. The dry fountain functions as micro-setting that forces the final listening stance. One cap: the garden’s spatial layout is evocative but fuzzy—no clear sight-lines or distance markers—so environment constrains emotion more than literal movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early; pressure mounts as ambient hush thickens, narrowing to the microscopic cartilage creak. The tightening is atmospheric, not tactical: she never risks failure or expends resource, so the cost is implied audience empathy rather than visible on-page forfeiture. Sufficient for this length and lyric mode, but not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-echo emerges organically from videotape static and bodily growth; no explicit thesis states it. Final image of “tidal longing” settling into quiet reprises the oceanic motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: peace may be another forgetting. Could edge higher if a concrete object (chalk?) had been sacrificed to embody the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Mira’s synesthetic mind: “ghost of a family’s last argument,” “impression of someone who had waited.” Syntax lengthens and softens like fog itself; diction stays within her mystic lexicon. No dialogue, no head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent and muscular under pressure. Minor over-alliteration in “silent static” phrase is the only hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with discovery—long coils of image, then a short gasp (“It was smaller than that”). Figurative density is high but patterned early, so it reads as voice, not purple. No loops, no scaffold; each clause adds new sensory angle. One mixed metaphor: “tidal longing… like a mother holding a child” momentarily merges ocean and cradle, but clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The junkyard-prophet who hears bones lengthening in a magnetic-tape purgatory is fresh; the concept marries tech-decay and corporeal time. Execution leans on atmospherics rather than plot invention, so the premise feels slightly safe within its lyric niche. Risk points for architecture of abandonment imagery, but the microscopic growth sound tips it into memorable specificity.</comment>
