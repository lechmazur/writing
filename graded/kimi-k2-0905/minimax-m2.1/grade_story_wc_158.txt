<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The poet’s endurance of centuries of sleepless longing is credibly embodied in the “reef-shadow joy” she distills from waiting; the final image of writing faster as the postcard trembles crystallizes her hierarchy of values—composition over relief. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, however, so the interior conflict remains more asserted than enacted. The cost is felt, the voice particular, the renunciation earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the accelerating writing and trembling postcard reconfigure the wait into active offer, cost felt in the “sustained dark.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of lullaby dispersal and spiral imagery tightens toward the final bloom—without causal reversals. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet serves the final image, so no penalty. All beats grow from prior particulars; no teleporting props or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The shell-house is sensuously lived-in—“spirals inward toward her chair and outward toward the world”—and the postcard’s tremble recharges the setting at closure. Selective sensory economy favors sound (off-key wind) and touch (tremble) over visual catalogues. Spatial logic stays coherent in the single garret. While the shell never constrains a tactical choice, the postcard’s evolved state satisfies the 9+ gate for micro-setting charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the wait break her?—tightens through density increase: poems become tendrils, roots, blossom armistice, each image raising the cost of continuation. Agency is endurance/attention that forecloses surrender; coincidence absent. The escalation is textural, not causal, but the final image unmistakably reweights the stake. A visible price (accelerated writing in trembling silence) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sustained metaphor of photosynthesizing grief into beauty; no explicit thesis stated. The “blossom armistice” reweights the silence, offering resonance without moral. Subtext lives in gesture—trembling postcard—rather than explanation. Sentimentality avoided; complexity preserved in the paradox of reef-shadow joy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is distinctively lyric—compressed, rhythmic, patterned (“shyly unstoppable,” “reef-shadow joy”)—taught early and stable throughout. Syntax mirrors the spiral: long breathless clauses that coil back on themselves. No head-hopping; POV distance stays interior and consistent. Register remains within the poet’s plausible lexicon even at heightened moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or emotional charge without scaffold. No loops, paraphrase, or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors avoided—spiral, reef, greenhouse, blossom form coherent ecological through-line. Minor register drift toward “photosynthesize” is voice-motivated and paid off; no clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>7.4</question><comment>Premise—centuries-long insomniac poet in shell-house dispersing poems as lullabies—is fresh, but the emotional arc of transforming grief into beauty leans on familiar poetic tropes. Specificity of “reef-shadow joy” and “blossom armistice” provides memorable inflection. Risk in lyric compression heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Transformation test passes: the shell/spiral architecture is inseparable from the wait/write dynamic.</comment>
