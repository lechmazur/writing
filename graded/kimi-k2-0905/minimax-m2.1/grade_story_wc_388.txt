<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s investigator persona is sketched cleanly—her training surfaces in an immediate, embodied beat (pressed back / sweep). Interior contradiction is missing: she never doubts or fears; the single choice to “transmit her findings” is reported, not dramatized, so no cost is legibly paid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure is present: a resonant reconfiguration—she accepts that myths will orbit an unchanging stillpoint. Causal chain is thin: she’s given the letters, reads them, then acts off-page; the pivot from “cursed relic” to data-storage device is taught, not tested, so escalation feels explanatory rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orchard vs. wasteland contrast is vivid (“radioactive wasteland and thriving orchard”), tethered to Mira’s gaze. The stillpoint functions as charged micro-setting; its paradox anchors the final image, satisfying 9+ gating for constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stake—truth vs. comfortable lie—is declared early. Pressure intensifies only once, when letters reveal deliberate exposure, but the beat is summary; no visible option is foreclosed on-page, so tightening stays conceptual rather than tactical, capping the score below 7.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: truth as an unmythologized stillpoint. Subtext in the keeper’s dialogue (“the thing everyone agreed to forget”) lands cleanly. Final paragraph’s assertion that “truth is never a destination” nudges toward Echo but stays anchored in Mira’s earned fatigue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharp (“air 暂时 clear enough”). Syntax flexes with tension without losing clarity; one Chinese adverb is an unneeded glitch but minor. Voice never drifts into committee exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or filter stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“metastasized,” “crystalline records”) fits Mira’s analytic lens. No mixed metaphors; clarity stays intact through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Conspiracy-debunker trope is refreshed by pairing geological stillpoint with data-encrypted diamond. Stillpoint-as-atmospheric-anchor feels novel; myth vs. data polarity is cleanly inverted. Could swap orchard for another anomaly, so freshness is solid but not exceptional.</comment>
