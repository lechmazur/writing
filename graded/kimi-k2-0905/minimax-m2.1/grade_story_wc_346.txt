<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush and embodied—her fingers “knowing every brass gear… like the lines of her own face”—but the text repeats the same emotional chord (accepting, lyrical resignation) without contradictory impulse or rising cost. The final beat is pure affirmation rather than a renunciation that forecloses a path; we never see her risk or lose anything tangible. The “thousand lifetimes” refrain is poetic, yet accumulates as label-speak because it isn’t tested by a micro-choice that could fail. Still, her tactile intimacy with the clock and puppet gives her a distinct perceptual signature strong enough for the 7-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural pattern early—nested gears, lullaby fragments, bruised light—and returns to reweight them in the final image (“the clock chimed once… waiting for the next song”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the universe inhaled, the documented beauty now held, the cost irreversible silence. Causality is interior but coherent: because she adjusts, the memory is preserved; because she accepts endings, she does not flinch. No orientation debt; lighthouse, dusk, and purple hour are anchored within the first 120 words.</comment>

<comment>The lighthouse is not postcard backdrop but breathing organism—“stones holding memories of every sunset”—and the clock’s brass geography is traversed by touch, constraining every micro-motion. Purple hour, bruise-colored glass, and the cracked puppet cheek evolve from visual to emotional texture, mirroring the acceptance of flawed beauty. Spatial tracking is clean: velvet cradle → hush pane → final press of lips. The nested gears function as micro-setting that dictates the tempo of the scene; without them, the final stillness would carry no mechanical echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve beauty at the final ending—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens only once: the last adjustment, the last documentation. The clock’s acceleration provides the single meaningful escalation; options narrow to “witness or fail to witness.” No visible price is paid on the page—no broken skin, no forfeited memory, no door sealed forever—so the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, capping entry to the 7-band. Agency is present but entirely interior; the world ends regardless, so the tension is aesthetic, not survival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the equivalence of ending and lullaby: silence is not absence but the space after the song. The cracked puppet reprises as living metaphor—flaw as truth—without overt statement. The final chime answers the opening lullaby, reweighting all prior gears as notes already sung. No sermonizing; the moral remains in the image, not the margin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistently lyric, syntactically swollen yet rhythmically controlled—long sentences swell and contract like bellows, matching the clock’s lung. Lexicon stays within the adjuster’s devotional register: “vouchsafe,” “bruised awe,” “nested patterns.” No head-hop; distance remains tight behind Elara’s aged eyes. The risk of purple excess is real, but the diction never sheds its mechanical skin; gears, springs, and porcelain keep the metaphor tethered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence variation is deliberate—cumulative anaphora (“every brass gear… every cradle… every sunset”) creates liturgical cadence rather than template monotony. Mixed metaphors are scarce; “bruise healing into beauty” is the one strained overlap, but it reinforces thematic color and occurs mid-scene, not at closure. No filter-verb stacks; scaffolding is minimal. One paraphrase loop: “beauty at the edge of endings” echoes twice in adjacent sentences, costing −0.2, not fatal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The doomsday-clock-adjuster in a hidden lighthouse is fresh, yet the elegiac acceptance of cosmic ending is familiar from legions of heat-death stories. What rescues the piece is the mechanical lullaby trope—timepiece as music box, gears as choir—turning abstract apocalypse into tactile nursery. The cracked puppet reprises the flaw-beauty equation, but the equation itself is canonical. Risk is present but aesthetic rather than structural; the story leans on lyric excess instead of conceptual surprise.</comment>
