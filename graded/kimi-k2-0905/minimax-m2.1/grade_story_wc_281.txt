<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “affectionate skeptic” label is shown through her bodily reactions to the geode, not told; her micro-choice to press it to her temple crystallizes internal contradiction. Cost is felt: she forfeits her guarded distance when she accepts the crystal’s invitation. Interiority is concrete, but the leap from “static shock” to geode-awakening is under-motivated, so the beat lands at strong, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the decision to “document everything” crystallizes a new stance with visible forfeit of her earlier detachment. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern break (fractal light) reweights the stake of human connection. Causality is soft but coherent within lyric mode; orientation anchors within 120 words and the pattern holds to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The RGB-lit studio functions as micro-setting: its velvet case, cold metal table, and refracted purple constrain how Mira handles the geode and reads its pulse. Details are selective, filtered through her scientific eye. No spatial drift; the environment is tactile and lived-in, though it never limits her agency in a way that charges the final image, capping entry to the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to re-establish consensual connection after the pill recall—tightens when the geode offers an alternative path. The single deepening occurs at the temple-press beat: she trades isolation for permeability, and the cost (loss of prior protective skepticism) is legible on the page. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the lyric mode; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: consensual attunement versus forced transparency. The ending’s “willowglass hope” image reweights earlier fractal light without moralizing. No thematic echo violations; subtext operates through bodily markers and refracted light. Ambiguity is purposeful—connection remains fragile—but the insight feels earned from the specific geode trial rather than imposed thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person interiority stays tight to Mira’s scientific perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under shock, mirroring her somatic state. Free indirect style is clean, and no filter-verb clusters dull immediacy. Voice is distinctive but not yet singular enough to push into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Occasional lyrical stacking (“fractally precise display that defied random formation”) edges toward density but stops short of purple. No loops or scaffold; pronouns are clean. Tight concision throughout, with only minor figurative surplus in the middle beat preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The telepathy-pill recall backdrop is familiar, yet the geode’s invitation-through-light reframes it into non-obvious territory: consensual optics instead of chemical breach. Somatic markers as navigation tech feels fresh and specific to this piece. The synthesis is memorable, though the premise risk remains moderate; transformation is present but not radically destabilizing.</comment>
