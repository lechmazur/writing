<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrical but stays cerebral; the reverse-telling choice externalizes no contradictory micro-beat on the page, so the “earned” shift feels announced rather than dramatized. Serenity trait is asserted, not tested under pressure—no bodily cost or visible mistake complicates it. Still, the single-POV arc is coherent and the final renunciation carries a felt price, meeting the 600-word baseline for credible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stick left standing reweights the premise that “unwritten words” can possess ethical force; cost is legible in the abdication of narrative control. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of echoing hush/stick/light culminates in the final image without causal contradiction. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props or logic breaks. Just shy of 8.8 because the reverse-telling device is declared rather than demonstrated beat-by-beat, softening the decisive change punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dome’s acoustics and circular machinery scar directly enable the stick planting and the “whispered” reverse-telling; environment constrains the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elias’s calligrapher eye for bone-white surfaces and negative space. Spatial choreography stays clean—single ingress, central platform, exit line. No weather clichés; meteor hush is thematic tone rather than generic backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how far to carry a story—signaled early via Mira’s accusation; pressure tightens when Elias chooses to unsay rather than finish, a visible forfeiture of his lifelong craft in front of an audience of none. Accumulative escalation comes through image density (stick / dome / meteor) rather than causal reversals, fitting the lens. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he abandons the story-teller’s authority. No second beat of external resistance keeps it from the 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of narrative ownership reframed as negative space—what we leave unwritten. Subtext lives in the abandoned stick and the unheard backward tale. Final image reframes prior metaphors (celestial eye now blind, stick now horizontal monument) without sermon. Ambiguity is productive: reader must finish the silence, enacting the lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical voice maintains consistent psychic distance; diction stays within a calligrapher’s lexicon of bone, ink, inscription. Rhythm modulates—long accumulative sentences build to short final release. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Metaphor chain (eye / bone / combustion) risks density but pattern is taught early and pays off in last line, keeping clarity intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence variety strong. Figurative language is dense (>60% of sentences) yet patterned and purposeful, avoiding artifact cap. One mixed metaphor—“architectural husk and the strange acoustics that made every sound feel like it was being whispered from very far away”—slightly blurs physics, but does not touch closure. Zero loops or scaffold; information density high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Reverse-telling as ethical renunciation feels fresh; stick-as-monument twist re-energizes the familiar “artist learns humility” arc. Specificity of decommissioned Cold-War dome grounds the abstraction. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than radical formal rupture. Could swap names/places with minor edits, so not fully singular, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
