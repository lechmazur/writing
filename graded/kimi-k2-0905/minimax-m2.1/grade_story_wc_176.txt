<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Yara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to resume her craft—are dramatized in the tactile re-braiding beats; the final renunciation of exile costs her the last warmth of isolation and is earned by the five-winter reflection braided into the present action. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The “technically gentle” trait directly enables the rope surgery and carries the risk of snapping the fragile fiber, so flaw and gift collide. One hairline slip: “forgiveness had come at last” is slightly abstract, but the next sentence immediately forges it into the physical act, so the arc retains credibility.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope’s new hum is an audible, felt cost—she walks away aching, leaving her safety of silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each paragraph adds density to memory-objects until the final cadence shift reweights the stake from “frozen grief” to “carried remembrance.” Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sanctum’s doors,” “frost-laced floor”) and never wavers. No causality breaks; the punched card pattern is the taught constraint that shapes the braiding tactic and pays off in the glowing rope.</comment>

<comment>The icebound sanctum is not backdrop; its cracked dome showers ice dust onto the rope, forcing Yara to work finger-numb, turning environment into antagonist. The aurora’s shifting color registers her progress bar—green to prism—mirroring the rope’s activation without overt symbolism. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the ceremonial rope itself functions as mobile architecture, constraining every finger placement. Spatial choreography is immaculate; she kneels, rises, exits, and the rope’s new state is left humming in the exact center of the dome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she resume her custodial duty?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the rope’s fragility threatens to snap under her touch, foreclosing the option to remain passive. The punched card scrap provides the single deepening that converts guilt into tactic; no coincidence required. Cost is viscerally paid: numb fingers, aching joints, and the permanent loss of her protective silence once the rope begins to “breathe.” One minor slack: the middle third could use one additional micro-tightening beat to push her closer to physical failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—“remembrance as an active, living burden rather than frozen monument”—emerges through the rope’s re-activation, never stated. The final image reweights the entire archive from static bronze to vibrating fiber, offering conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext hums in the rope’s quiet resonance: the dead are not resurrected, but their names now demand ongoing maintenance. Counter-readings linger: is she re-opening the wound she fled? The piece refuses to resolve that ambiguity, deepening resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Yara’s perceptual signature—fibers, tension, cold, aurora color—creating a rhythmic, almost incantatory cadence that mirrors braiding. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress (“her breath fogging… fingers grew numb”) then lengthens for the final poise. Diction remains within her artisan lexicon: “lost wax,” “hemp and silver thread,” “frequencies.” One hairline slip: “something older” is vague, but the next clause (“retained memory of every voice”) immediately re-specifies, so voice coherence holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long braided clauses to short declarative punches, propelling the night’s work. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“silence pooled like water frozen mid-collapse”) and never overruns the tactile beats. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. A single filter verb cluster (“seemed to mock”) is voice-motivated and paid off by the literal color shift at dawn, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lost-wax metallurgy with textile auroral-archive feels fresh and inevitable; no trope catalog offers “rope-as-punch-card.” Risk is taken in the quiet, non-dialogue, single-scene structure, yet pressure stays coherent. Specificity of the bronze-pressing craft and the organ-card encoding prevents generic substitution. Minor deduction: the five-winter exile is a familiar grief-recovery arc, slightly dampening surprise.</comment>
