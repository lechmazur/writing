<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The interiority is consistently embodied and character-specific; Miriam’s micro-choices under pressure (“she descended alone… measured cycles… guided… worked the seal free”) trace a legible value-hierarchy with visible cost. The note discovery sparks a credible, earned shift from compulsive searching to deliberate messenger, crystallizing her arc without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the note and globe re-weight loss into transition while Miriam accepts the cost—“she would find the daughter… understand how to let go.” Drive lens Accumulative/Textural holds from first line (“amber silence… collapsed into something more honest”) to final smile, with pattern-taught compression and a single effective deepening pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Miriam’s professional eye; the collapsed hull aperture, drifting textbooks, and manipulator-arm choreography are tactile and selective. The snow globe micro-setting constrains the climactic choice and charges the final image; library details evolve from hushed decay to active vessel of transmission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand letting go”—is signaled early and tightens once when the sealed note forces Miriam to trade lone custodianship for outward delivery. The cost is palpable in her final vow; pressure deepens rather than reverses, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges via the shifting snow globe and bioluminescent refrain: loss not as erasure but transformation. The ending image of settling flakes offers a non-literal answer to the physics of letting go without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distilled, lyrical diction (“amber silence… collapsed into something more honest… sophisticated melancholy”) remains in Miriam’s plausible academic register; syntax modulates with descent pressure, no head-hopping. Pattern-taught elision (“the deep had become Miriam’s second language”) pays off in the final acceptance of release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes from long reflective lines to tight motor-action clauses; high information density without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent, no mixed vehicles in peak beats, clean propulsion to the settling-snow close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh inflection: lost-library-as-submarine-archive and the physics metaphor of bioluminescence/transition. While “deep-sea grief epiphany” is recognizable, the snow-globe time-capsule and maternal broadcast transform the trope into specific, inevitable logic.</comment>
