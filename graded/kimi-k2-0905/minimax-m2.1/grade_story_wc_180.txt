<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s stubborn pride and need for repair are palpable, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnostic labels (“she understood… that some promises could not be mended with tools alone”) that tell us the epiphany rather than dramatize it. The embodied emotion is strong early (ribbon in pocket, knees aching) yet the final beat summarizes the change instead of letting contradiction play out in gesture. The cost is felt—daughter’s stopped reach, the re-tied ribbon—but the turn is slightly over-articulated for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the re-tied ribbon is a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes the before/after legible and carries felt cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each seasonal image and rotting pear adds density until the final release. The Orientation Test is passed: ivy-curtained doors, shattered glass, and orchard in rafters anchor us by 120 words. One minor loop—“she had… she had… she had”—slows the climb but does not break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vividly tactile: pears rot on marble, incense clings to stone, moonlight catches the re-assembled eye. These details constrain action—she kneels on slippery fruit skin, works by fading amber then moonlight—so environment shapes tactics. The micro-setting of the ribbon evolves from pocket talisman to statue collar, charging the final image. A hair more specificity on tool use (the grinding wheel’s whir against night silence) would have pushed 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she mend the shattered quartz eye and the broken promise—tightens once: the recognition that tools alone fail forces the shift from craft to offering. Pressure accumulates through decaying pears and failing light; the final gesture forecloses further repair work and accepts relational cost. No false escalation; coincidence is absent. The price (daughter’s absence, pride’s limits) is legible, but the beat could carry one more visceral loss to hit 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: repair is not restoration but renegotiation across generations. The deciduous vow motif moves from abstract to concrete as fallen fruit and re-tied ribbon reweight “promise” as something that must be released to re-root. No moralizing; the final image invites multiple readings—atonement, continuity, surrender. The insight is earned through tactile struggle rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature favors amber/moon/quartz light and decay-sweet air, all filtered through Mira’s artisan eye. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during shard-work, mirroring attention. No head-hop; the daughter’s arrival is purely external, read as silhouette. One clause drifts toward editorial—“the deciduous vows made manifest”—but the overall rhythm modulates with pressure and remains character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or emotional newness. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (stars in pears, cathedral as orchard) stay coherent. Minor register lift—“recrimination and silence,” “conceptual repricing”—but diction remains within a craftswoman’s lexicon. Final ribbon line lands clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing ruined cathedral with upside-down orchard feels fresh, and using fruit decay as a calendar of broken vows is specific to this story. The quartz-eye statue as generational trust object avoids cliché by being both literal craft and metaphorical lens. Risk is present—lyric accumulation in under 800 words—but the pattern is taught early and pays off. Not quite a 9 because the emotional arc still echoes familiar atonement templates.</comment>
