<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—ghostly despair yet mentor-mission—drives her micro-choice to lift the coin. The synesthetic trait (“tasted violets when she heard grief”) is embodied, not label-speak, and underwrites her final renunciation. Mira’s interiority is thinner; her pivot from collapse to belief is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost is felt more on Elara’s side. Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis: the spectral exile knowingly relinquishes her anchor to save another, foreclosing her own return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered echoes reweight possibility rather than causal chain. Orientation anchored by line 3; no penalty. Single scene, two on-page characters, one seamless transition through glass. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the coin’s release crystallizes both women’s stakes and reconfigures Elara’s exile into gift; cost visible in “weight of the coin lift from her palm.” Persistent constraint: her spectral limbo persists, only the reason changes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Emporium and orchard are filtered through Elara’s synesthetic bias; every sensory note (silver-tinged apples, dust tasting of rain) is purposive. Micro-setting—the coin—literally charges the final image by glowing and spinning. Spatial choreography holds as Elara drifts, Mira sits, the coin hovers. No object behaves contrary to its established metaphysics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can despair be converted into possibility? Pressure intensifies when echoes force Mira to witness branching futures; tightening beat is her reaching the coin. Agency is shared: Elara initiates, Mira accepts; both pay—Elara forfeits tether, Mira forfeits certainty of failure. Cost is legible on-page: spectral relief and tear-stained choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: despair not as end but as doorway. Motif—fractured timelines—reweights at closure: failures are exposed as branching encores. No moralizing; final image is silent dawn-light. Subtext in gesture: coin hand-off is wordless covenant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinctive lyric texture: “spectral skin,” “silver undertone,” synesthetic diction sustained without purple drift. Filter verbs minimal; perception is immediate. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. POV modesty maintained—Elara cannot know Mira’s future, only enable it.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences deliver world-logic, sensory data, backstory (“suicide of hope”). Rhythm varies—long lyrical cadence vs. short clause bursts under pressure. No paraphrase loops; metaphors internally coherent. Opening and closing lines echo through coin motif, fulfilling read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Spectral magician mentoring failed magician through synesthetic time-fragments is fresh synthesis. Trope of “haunted emporium” is elevated by orchard-as-liminal-stage and coin-as-performance-prop that literally replays acts. Risk: lyric non-linear structure; paid off by coherent closure. Not 9+ because core emotional arc—elder ghost saves younger artist—remains recognizable archetype.</comment>
