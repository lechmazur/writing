<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—nightly “signifying” versus learned stillness—plays out in embodied beats (key tag palmed, lungs burning). The shift from striving to receptive quiet is credibly costed by nineteen years of lamps and three winters in icy holds. One micro-choice—pressing worn brass to chest while saffron threads braid the water—crystallizes the arc. Motivation never drifts; every beat serves the father-vow stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias sees the hum, renounces active searching, and the image reweights all prior effort with conceptual cost. “Meteor hush” final line reprises opening lanterns, locking RR. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of patience taught early, paid off when light “made visible” rewards quiet attention. Causality intact: no late rules, no off-stage resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Library’s still water, lantern-amber sinking through ceiling breach, and brass key in pocket together constrain stance—he must float motionless to receive. Meteor flash, cathedral hush, and tide-clock supply immediate sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography clean: collapsed ceiling → rippling ribbons → bookshelf wrap. Environment charges final image; removing any prop would collapse the visible-sound moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—receive, not seize, the color of sound—tightens once: effortful dives → stillness under meteor flare. No reversals needed; single cadence shift sufficient for lyric accumulative arc. Cost legible: years of numb fingers and burned eyes pay for the one moment of seeing saffron hum. Agency preserved—he chooses to wait, forecloses the old striving path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: vows survive as kept existence, not riddles solved. Luminous vows reframed from quest to gift avoids moralizing; resonance carried by image, not assertion. Amber ribbons answer the father’s impossible promise without thesis statement. Final meteor hush invites reflection on patience as perceptual key.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—light fingerprints, salt-metal taste, key-tag cold. Syntax lengthens during submerged stillness, compresses at meteor flash, mirroring attention shift. No head-hop; knowledge strictly bounded to what he can sense. Lyric elision (“impossibly still”) taught early and paid off in visible hum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies—long breathy sentences in library hush, short pulse at meteor cross. Figurative language sparse enough to avoid muddle; each metaphor (lanterns like apologies, light fingerprints) recurs with shifted meaning. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Opening anchors voice, final line cadence echoes first lantern image, supplying propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sunken-library-as-threshold and color-of-sound synesthesia feel fresh yet inevitable. Nineteen-year lamplighter patience converts standard quest into accumulative meditation. Father’s vague vow survives without expositional patch. Risk in quiet climax rewarded by earned visual chord. Could not swap settings without breaking synesthetic payoff.</comment>
