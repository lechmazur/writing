<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eleanor’s hatred-to-healing arc is embodied in tactile gestures (thumb on rosette) and micro-choices (offering scale to student), but the text still summarizes her turnaround (“hatred had…been unlearned”) rather than dramatizing one irrevocable on-page cost. The student remains a mirror, not a crucible; no reciprocal pressure forces Eleanor to risk anything tangible inside this beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Eleanor’s decades-long subtraction of inner noise crystallizes in the final image of the worn flower, cost visible in years of silence she can’t reclaim. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of subtractive listening tightens until the hush itself becomes the decisive chord. Orientation is swift; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Velvet library, amber leaves, and the zither’s rosette supply sensory filtration that mirrors interior subtraction; micro-setting (worn wood under thumb) constrains her ritual and final image. Light, fabric, and wood are returned to in cadence, charging the hush with palpable residue. Environment never becomes a prop, but it also never actively endangers or resource her tactics beyond ambience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoration of voice through listening—signals early and tightens via the student’s reluctant posture, but escalation is observational, not adversarial. No external or internal obstacle raises the price inside this scene; the risk remains retrospective (“voices could be dangerous”) rather than immediate. One micro-turn—student’s hands emerge—does re-weight silence into possibility, satisfying minimal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of harmony-as-subtraction emerges through iterated acts (teaching, tracing rosette, breathing with student) rather than dictation; final flower image re-weights the motif without moralizing. Subtext of political silences survives in single line about dialect transport, letting universality retain bite. Complexity acknowledged: hatred’s residue stays legible in worn wood, refusing tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature relies on hush, pressure of silence, and tactile wood grain rather than idiosyncratic diction. Syntax modulates between long reflective coils and clipped present-moment fragments, mirroring the inhalation/exhalation of choir work. No head-hop; register stays within Eleanor’s educated but trauma-weathered lexicon. Voice memorable, if not yet inimitable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with variable sentence lengths; metaphor density kept purposeful and subordinate to hush. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“swallowed his consonants,” “velocity of silence”) carry weight. Occasional elevated phrasing (“expectantly resigned despair”) edges toward thesis-speak but occurs outside peak beat; no loops or mixed metaphors at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Taking the familiar “refugee music teacher heals through art” arc, the piece freshens it via subtraction-as-method and a zither instead of piano, while wartime censorship specifics root the danger in lived memory. Worn rosette as witness provides a charged object-return not typically seen in the trope. Conceptual risk is modest; execution specificity lifts it above template.</comment>
