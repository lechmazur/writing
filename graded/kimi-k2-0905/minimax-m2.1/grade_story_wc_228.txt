<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s grief-numbed stasis is embodied in the cave walks; the returning itch in his fingers offers a credible micro-shift. Interiority is mostly concrete (“illusion of surrender,” “cathedral walls”) but drifts into abstract summary (“temporary eternity he had spent his life constructing”). The renunciation—placing the painted shell into the pool—carries visible cost and reconciles his promise. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene, so the beat falls short of 8-band complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: three years’ stasis, cave wandering, and the emergent pool reweight the stake of “why paint” until the shell release crystallizes the shift. Orientation is clear by line 30; no causal chain is required under this lens, only a density shift that lands with cost. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of water holding hidden light reconfigures meaning and forecloses repossession of art as ownership. The cost is felt but could be sharper on the page; a single sentence of bodily register at the release would clinch 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The coastal cave system is evoked through sound, touch, and mirrored light rather than travel-brochure vistas; the pool’s ceiling reflection becomes a micro-setting that literally reframes Marcus’s past. Spatial choreography stays clean across the wrong turn and chamber discovery. Sensory hierarchy matches a painter’s eye: light quality, surface texture, reflected image. The cave constrains the final gesture—release into water—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“find the why of painting again”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through accumulative wandering and the shell’s impossible reappearance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pool reflection reveals the memory-image, forcing the choice to relinquish the painted shell. The cost is conceptual (ownership illusion abandoned) rather than viscerally felt; a tactile consequence (shiver, tear, audible exhale) would sharpen 8+. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: beauty cannot be possessed, only offered. The shell’s migration from childhood gift to painted talisman to water-borne monument reweights meaning at closure. Subtext operates in the cracked mirror (self-fracture) and the pool’s hidden light (art’s fugitive luminosity). Final image reframes prior material; no explicit moral is stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is painterly—focus on reflected light, pigment-like water, spiral geometry. Prose texture is lyrical but controlled, with rhythmic cadence that mirrors tide and breath. No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters. The compressed diction under stress (“neither living nor grieving nor creating”) reads intentional and voice-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary to match cavern echoes and interior hush. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—light “hiding,” cave as “cathedral”—and avoids mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“illusion of surrender…exhausting pretense of choice”) costs −0.2. No scaffolding or synonym churn in final third; closure sentence is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The cracked-mirror trigger and luminous cave chamber freshen the familiar “artist blocked by grief” arc. The painted shell’s return feels inevitable yet uncanny, not contrived. Risk lies in the near-mystical pool reveal, but the accumulative texture justifies the slight fabulist lift. Specific painterly vocabulary keeps the premise grounded.</comment>
