<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically textured but remains static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The single on-page “choice” is to let the pulse return—an endurance already implicit from line 1—so no higher-stakes fork is tested. Cost is asserted (“she did not know if she would ever leave”) rather than paid in a beat we can point to. Character therefore reads as atmospheric mask, not evolving agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the renunciation of physical departure is restated with tonal solemnity, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is circular, not progressive—each paragraph re-samples the same stasis—so the tightening is poetic density rather than option reduction. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, meeting the single-scene window. No meaningful cost is newly dramatized at the final image, keeping the beat short of the 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s engine: bone towers, wind-carved fossils, and bird-flight patterns supply the literal navigation system. The arrowhead micro-setting constrains tactile attention and reappears in the cooling beat to mark session’s end. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—dust layers, thermal currents, echo timbre—integrated into the meditation rhythm. Spatial anchors remain coherent within the single fixed vantage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“navigate without moving”—is declared early but never tested by a fresh obstacle; pressure is atmospheric, not escalating. Mid-text bird scatter hints at distant danger yet alters zero tactics for the skimmer. No reversal narrows her options; the pulse simply waxes and wanes. Closure re-affirms original stance rather than foreclosing a path that was ever live.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-as-navigation emerges through iterated imagery rather than thesis statement. Final sentence reweights “movement of spirit” as sufficient voyage, supplying quiet resonance. Ambiguity is present—peace tinged with imprisonment—but lacks counter-argument on the page, so complexity feels curated rather than earned. No moral is preached, avoiding the Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent archaic cadence and fossil-obsessed perceptual filter. Syntax lengthens and contracts with inhalation/exhalation of pulse, demonstrating rhythmic control. No dialogue appears; therefore no voice-convergence issues. Diction stays within POV lexicon (“geological time,” “resonances”) without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet generally purposeful; each sentence layers texture or advances temporal marker (seasonal dust shift, afternoon light). Occasional stacked modifiers (“fossils of impossible creatures into cathedrals and monuments”) verge on purple but occur during low-tempo meditation, so momentum survives. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors detected. Final paragraph avoids cliché by returning to cooled arrowhead, giving tactile exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Concept of immobile celestial navigation via bird-flight augury feels fresh and is rigorously followed. Still-life epic fantasy is risky but executed with sensory conviction. No familiar plot template is borrowed; the piece stakes everything on atmosphere and succeeds. Minor deduction for safe circular structure that refuses to test the premise against external change.</comment>
