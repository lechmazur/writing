<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s numbness is conveyed through embodied, character-specific choices—sheathing the blade, the decision to “vivify.” Internal contradiction pulses cleanly: the clone feels while the original cannot. The final renunciation—accepting a shared consciousness—arrives with visible cost (the permanence of numbness cracked open) and is earned by the prior blade-to-chest beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the blade touch vivifies both selves and locks them into a new, shared ontology. Causal lens holds throughout (“because” the cut, “therefore” the crack in numbness). Cost is unmistakable on the page: “The numbness remained, but it was no longer absolute.” No orientation debt; spatial choreography of floating stones and upward-falling leaves stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective, urgent detail: the upward-falling maple leaves, the hovering stones etched with masters’ names, the ceremonial knife as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and breath during the blade moment, mirroring the internal thaw. The floating dojo’s physics is accepted early and never contradicted; environment metaphysically mirrors the split self without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>One dominant stake—recover the capacity to feel—tightens through the single decisive blade beat that vivifies connection. Escalation is causal under the lens: the need to feel → the duel with the clone → the blade touch that cracks numbness. Cost is visible on the page: acceptance of permanent partial numbness in exchange for shared feeling. Coincidence is absent; the clone is legal requirement, not lucky intrusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of identity-through-complement emerges from concrete action (blade touch), not assertion. The maple leaf motif returns with reversed gravity, reweighting the idea that what falls can rise. No moralizing; final image offers quiet Conceptual Repricing: two halves of one consciousness orbiting in autumn twilight. Ambiguity lingers—will the crack widen or seal—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person interiority carries a cold, precise diction (“capacity to feel scoured raw and hollow”) that modulates to warmth only at the crack. Distinct perceptual signature: attention to etched names, upward leaves, the blade’s ceremonial weight. No dialogue clutter; single spoken line carries subtext (“you do not want a child”). Rhythm tightens into fragments under blade pressure, then exhales into longer cadence at reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers stakes, image, and world rule. Metaphors are spare and consistent—“membrane between imitation and authenticity”—never mixed. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Passive voice used once, deliberately (“had been burned”), to echo passivity of numbness. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “a consciousness that survived ego death by learning to feel through another.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of Zen-flavored martial arts, legal clone custody, and anti-narrative ego death is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky abstraction of “complementary opposites” is grounded through the blade beat and shared breath. Specificity anchors novelty: upward-falling maple leaves etched with centuries of names. Transformation test fails if names or place change—this exact configuration is required for the crack in numbness to feel earned.</comment>
