<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet stewardship is rendered with sensitive interiority and credible ritual; her micro-choices (breaking bread, releasing vines) visibly enact her vocation. Yet the absence of live opposition keeps pressure interior and stakes modest, so the “earned cost” bar is only just cleared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each small tending beat layers density until the butterfly lift reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the bread shared, wings dried—felt cost is the slow lifelong custodianship she recommits to; causality is internally sound, though a single-scene default is gently stretched by the montage sweep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Overgrown palace, fountain trickle, reed broom, monarch chrysalis—details are selective, tactile, filtered through caretaker priorities. Spatial choreography stays clean; the tea-house vines and courtyard cracks function as micro-settings that constrain daily labor and charge the final butterfly image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prevent total neglect by noticing and tending”—is declared early; escalation is accretive, not perilous. One meaningful tightening: the bread’s appearance reframes her ritual into communion/absolution. Cost is poetic rather than practical; options never truly narrow, keeping the score shy of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “tenuous absolution through ordinary persistence” emerges organically from recurring maintenance images; no explanatory sermon. Final butterfly flight reconfigures the bread’s meaning without moralizing, producing quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited maintains calm, patient rhythm mirroring caretaker temperament; perceptual signature notices slow change, cracks, vines, seasonal hush. No dialogue to test, but free-indirect texture is consistent; patterned elision (“uncloak”) is taught early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences breathe in step with seasonal calm, avoid scaffold; occasional adjective pairs (“stale but not rotten, hard but not corrupted”) feel slightly mannered but never muddy. No loops, no mixed metaphor; clarity and momentum hold through the lyrical cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Garden-as-spiritual-resistance and forgotten-palace tropes are familiar, yet the focus on “guerrilla gardening” as sacramental maintenance, anchored to vanished baker’s bread, gives a fresh, humble angle. Risk is modest but coherent; specificity of ritual keeps it from feeling generic.</comment>
