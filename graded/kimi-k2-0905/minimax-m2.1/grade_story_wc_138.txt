<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elian’s millennia of exhaustion is palpable in embodied gestures—amulet cold against “the永恒 of his skin,” bones humming with the storm—yet the interior contradiction between boredom and unrelenting search stays vivid. The final micro-choice to raise the fragment lands as earned renunciation of endlessness, cost legible in the spatial tearing around him. No secondary character on page keeps relationship crucible dormant; that is within scope. Still, the beat-to-beat motivation is consistent and individuated, held back from 8+ only because the magnitude of the personal cost could be sharpened still further in one on-page sentence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: “some goodbyes were merely hellos…” reweights immortality itself under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the visible shredding of the escondite he must now inhabit. Orientation is taught early via prismatic fracturing and the amulet cue; no penalty applied. Causality holds: three-millennia wait → storm pulse → spatial mutiny → lifted fragment → revealed translation. One tight deepening suffices for this length; no reversals are required.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and magnetic lines function as micro-setting that directly enables the final revelation; they bend, tear, and sing precisely because the fragment is raised, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory triage narrows to light-spectra and electromagnetic touch, matching an immortal’s detached yet hyper-attuned gaze. Spatial choreography keeps the amulet, body, and tearing space cleanly tracked. Selective detail avoids tourist syndrome; every luminous ribbon or magnetic strand presses against choice rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he grasp the meaning of transition?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: the mutiny forces the decision to raise the fragment, foreclosing passive waiting. Agency is legible in the deliberate lift; cost is the reality rupture he must now endure. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via intensifying light, warmth, and tears in space; no coincidence is used to resolve. Could edge higher if the text let us feel one sharper personal price (pain, memory loss) during the tearing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transition as translation, not termination. The amulet’s curse and solar storm act as concrete particulars that reweight “goodbye” into doorway imagery without moralizing. Final image crystallizes the concept—hellos in a pre-stellar language—leaving lingering ambiguity managed with precision. No thesis statement intrudes; insight is earned through the spatial mutiny endured on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV maintains consistent psychic distance, filtered through Elian’s ancient perceptual signature—light fractured into spectra, magnetic lines as supplicants. Diction (“escondite,” “spatial mutiny”) remains within a quasi-timeless immortal lexicon, justified by seven-millennia scope. Rhythm swells from languid opening to pulsing storm, mirroring rising urgency without monotony. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. The voice is singular, coherent, and charged at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet readable—“wounds in reality itself” performs double duty as metaphor and literal effect. Metaphors cohere within light/ magnetism field logic; no mixed vehicles trip the reader. One paraphrase loop detected (“fracturing dimensions and singing magnetic fields” echoes earlier “fractured…fields”) costs −0.2. Otherwise rhythm breathes, sentences vary, and final line lands clean, supporting closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Immortal ennui + solar storm + cursed fragment is familiar raw material, but the synthesis through spatial mutiny and magnetic choreography feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Treatment of “goodbye” as cosmic translation supplies fresh emotional inflection. Risk in abstract escondite pays off by charging the ending image. Piece avoids gimmickry and commits fully to its lyric premise.</comment>
