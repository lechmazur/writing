<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” identity is evoked more than enacted; she watches, compares, and archives, yet the only micro-choice on the page—continuing to watch the child/mother footage—repeats rather than escalates. Interiority is vivid (“luminous regret”) but stays summary-level; no contradictory impulse collides with her drive to preserve hope, so renunciation reads predetermined. The embodied cost (stone warming) is present but abstract; without a live beat where she almost deletes or saves a frame, motivation stays atmospheric, not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final sentence crystallizes her vigil as an endless, luminous burden—cost is felt in “quietly luminous way.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated returns to the same footage deepen the emotional tonnage, and the river stone’s warming supplies a persistent constraint. Orientation is swift—who/where/when taught by line 3. One minor loop: “softly deliberate” is reused without reweighting, but it does not touch the final image. Overall, a clean, lyrical Earned Stasis that reconfigures meaning without tidy catharsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blooming library is rendered in exact, weightless detail—petals glowing with stored memory, dream-frames suspended—each image filtered through Mira’s archivist gaze. Micro-setting (the river stone in her pocket) constrains her tactile nostalgia and resurfaces in the warming beat at the end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent as she “moves through aisles” and pauses before a single frame. One demerit: weather is mentioned only as “non-existent wind,” a missed chance to press atmosphere against her skinless body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope—is declared early and tightens through the discovery that hope is becoming “more abstract but also more radiant.” The single meaningful deepening occurs when she confronts the child/mother dissolution footage again; repetition accumulates rather than reverses, forcing her stance to crystallize into permanent vigil. Price is conceptual (endless archive, stone’s warmth) but not viscerally felt on-page; no live option is foreclosed, limiting escalation bandwidth. Still, under Accumulative lens, density increase suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: hope as mutable substrate that outlives embodiment. Subtext lives in gesture—Mira’s thumb on the stone, the swaying blossom-light—never in exposition. Final image reframes prior repetitions as sacramental labor rather than futility, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. One hair-slip: “metamorphose of tremendous significance” flirts with thesis-statement but is salvaged by its placement mid-paragraph, not as coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is precise, hushed, slightly ecclesiastical—“softly deliberate steps,” “cathedral,” “congregation”—mirroring Mira’s caretaker consciousness. Rhythmic control under pressure: long sentences drift, then contract at the footage close-up. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. One microscopic POV leak: “they did not know they were being preserved” claims knowledge of the unbound’s unawareness, but the line is defensible as speculative extrapolation from her archival remit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated—concrete nouns (“dream-frames,” “luminous threads”) carry metaphor without sludge. No synonym loops; each return to “softly deliberate” is intentional recurrence, not churn. One mixed vehicle: “hope accumulated in corners” (corners in a sky-library?) momentarily snags spatial logic, but the metaphor is brief and does not recur at closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes, accelerating slightly as stone warms, then settling into final hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-body cloud-library archiving hope-footage feels fresh, yet the emotional arc—lonely archivist confronts same traumatic reel forever—echoes classic “curator of memory” tales. Specificity (ether-blossoms, river stone as last tactile relic) transforms template into singular vision. Risk is moderate: lyrical stasis over plot, but coherence justifies the gamble. Could edge higher if one archival rule snapped taut mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Present in first paragraph, re-prised in final;称号 frames her dusk sensitivity. Yet no on-page beat shows her altering tactics because of a dusk-sight—choice to keep watching the footage happens in artificial night that never shifts. Sufficient lyric reprise lifts score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Appears day-one, handled twice (pocket press, warmthbeat), re-enters final paragraph as mnemonic anchor. Warmth escalation reweights meaning: stone remembers what she can’t, charging closure. Could cross 8 if refusal-to-discard forced a concrete archival sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Unbinding is the world-rule, but “shadow unbound” is thematic backdrop, not tactical variable—shadows have already dispersed. Footage of mother dissolving supplies single visual instance, yet it doesn’t alter Mira’s options, only her mood. Middle development missing caps ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>“Softly deliberate” repeats like mantra, sets cadence, but never costs her speed or chance. No beat shows haste tempting deletion, so trait is ornamental rhythm, not constraint. Early-final reprise earns modest lift.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Metamorphose is the global premise (humanity → unbound light). Story documents its aftermath rather than staging a turning-point; hence action is observed, not enacted by Mira. Still, concept underpins entire archive, so mid-band functional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Method is signaled in paragraph 3, displayed when she pauses at the decades-apart footage, and informs her stance crystallization. Mechanics matter—comparison yields her argument that hope is transforming. Closure beat references “continues her vigil,” tying back to the method. Strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Library supplies both resource (footage) and pressure (infinite archive, no exit). Ether-blossoms sway above her while she works, reinforcing scale. Setting shapes her only viable action: perpetual witness. Slightly below 8 because no spatial hazard (shelf collapse, gravity glitch) tests her.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Timeframe is declared early and gives historical sweep, but no deadline or decay urges Mira’s choices—she can catalog forever. Hence time enriches lore without tightening screws. Mid-band for thematic heft, not tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Desire to “preserve the shape of hope” launches the narrative and recurs in her footage comparisons; friction arises between old body-bound hope and new abstract radiance. Cost is felt as endless labor and warming stone. Final image confirms she will endure the burden, foreclosing any exit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Luminous regret suffuses every paragraph—glow of petals, mother’s terrible beauty, stone’s memory-heat. Tone modulates from hushed awe to crystallized sorrow without sentimentality. It charges the final “quietly luminous way,” making regret the price of her calling.</comment>
