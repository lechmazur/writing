<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—her pocket-touch of the thread, the “profession of farewells”—but the decisive renunciation (“she would stay”) is foreshadowed more than dramatized in scene; the cost is felt yet not fully compounded by prior micro-choices, keeping the turn just shy of full causal burnish.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each imagistic tile—falling leaf, dry fountain, red thread—adds density until the final “first stroke of the map” reweights the premise; the traveler’s lateness becomes an earned stasis with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying closure with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden’s geometry, the birch bark “peeling like pages,” and the thread’s warmth against her thigh are seamlessly filtered through her mourner’s gaze; these details constrain her decision to remain, charging the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping absence while becoming one—tightens through pattern accumulation; the final cadence shift crystallizes cost, though the escalation is more tonal than tactical, keeping pressure just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: documenting absence becomes self-erasure; the closing image of the garden “holding its breath” reprises the leaf-fall and thread motifs, reframing survival as a form of gentle haunting—no moralizing, pure resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at consistent psychic distance; diction (“weft,” “lonesome splendor”) stays within the traveler’s scholarly lexicon, the cadence mirroring her cataloguing mind; no head-hop or register drift, only hairline slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long breathless accumulations to curt fragments that mimic leaf-fall; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each line advances texture or knowledge, climaxing in the clean strike of “first stroke of the map.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The obituarist-of-the-living premise, palace-thread relic, and garden-of-absence triangulate into a singular meditation on survival-as-documentation; risk-taking in lyric stasis heightens rather than softens stakes, feelin</comment>
