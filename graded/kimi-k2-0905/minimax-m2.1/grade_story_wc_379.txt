<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is prettily written ("sandstorm calm") but abstract; the only concrete choice she makes is to open a mailbox she has stared at for weeks, a decision telegraphed rather than pressured. The promised flaw—"following curiosity like a thread"—never complicates or endangers her; she simply succeeds. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; even the final realization is delivered as summary ("she understood finally"). Emotional cost is asserted, not embodied: the sisters’ reunion happens offstage and we are told, not shown, that "listening heals."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: letters, locket, and stories layer until meaning accrues. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elena reframes her job as "curation of memory." Cost is nominal: she loses nothing, risks nothing; the mailbox opens easily once Mrs. Okonkwo hands over a key. Causality is loose: scratches on brass do not logically imply hidden letters, and the grandmother’s breadcrumb plan is retro-fitted exposition.</comment>

<comment>The courtyard is vividly anchored—stone tiles, bakery door, light changing—and sensory hierarchy (Elena’s curator eye for detail) stays consistent. Micro-setting objects (mailbox, locket) receive tactile handling and constrain action: the jammed slot literally blocks further letters, forcing the opening beat. Weather is used metaphorically ("sandstorm calm") rather than physically altering choices, keeping it just shy of top-band constraint.</comment>

<comment>Stakes are thematic ("prove listening heals") rather than personal; Elena risks no tangible loss. Pressure escalates only narratively—letters accumulate, stories spread—but none tightens her options or exacts a price. The single micro-choice (open mailbox) is curiosity, not dilemma. Cost is displaced onto the long-dead grandmother and the now-reconciled sisters; Elena’s own stance never faces a test.</comment>

<comment>Theme—story as salvage—emerges cleanly from the iterated images of unspent letters, tucked photographs, and second-hand goods. Subtext operates in the silences of uncollected mail rather than exposition. The final reconfiguration ("thrift store as memory curation") is understated, avoiding moralizing. Some abstraction ("proof that someone had lived, hoped, failed") drifts toward pseudo-profundity, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elena’s curator perceptual lens—objects are "stories hidden within," scratches are "three parallel lines scored by something precise." Syntax is rhythmic, with controlled elongation in reflective passages and shorter percussive fragments at beats ("she rose and crossed the worn path"). No head-hopping; Mrs. Okonkwo’s voice is filtered through Elena’s attention. Occasional elevated diction ("sandstorm calm," "generative") feels slightly writerly but remains internally consistent.</comment>

<comment>Prose is mostly clean, with high information density—each sentence layers object, history, and metaphor. A few soft loops: "worn stone tiles" followed by "worn path," "stillness" echoed twice in two sentences; these are minor. Metaphors stay coherent (mailbox as sentinel, letters as pressed flowers). Filter-verb clusters absent; strong verbs dominate. Final paragraph’s repeated anaphora ("that particular stillness") is purposeful cadence rather than artifact.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The "unsent letters locked in forgotten mailbox" device is familiar; freshness comes from thrift-shop curator as witness rather than protagonist of the estrangement. Specific detail—loocket wedged in lock mechanism, grandmother’s dictionary pages—elevates the trope. Risk is modest: no structural experimentation, no moral complexity beyond "listening heals." The courtyard-as-memory-archive angle feels memorable but not transformative.</comment>
