<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority is evocative but stays observational; no micro-choice alters her path or costs her anything. The final “recording” is abstract—no quill touches stone, no risk taken—so identity shift feels asserted, not earned. Pre-emptive nostalgia remains a label; it never complicates a decision on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: she inhabits identity as performance, cost felt in the hush after storm. Accumulative lens holds—density of image, not causal chain—yet the ending still reweights the premise. Shadow-reading is taught early and returns in final image, satisfying pattern. Orientation clear by 70 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt, solid fog, and stormlight are tactile, filtered through archivist’s professional gaze; surfaces reveal memory accuracy. Lightning angles supply usable data for her craft, so environment constrains method. Micro-setting (monument shadows) directly shapes her reading and the story’s final image. No world-rule drift; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witnessing versus shaping identity—announced early but never tightens. No reversal or trade-off occurs; shadow angle delivers confirmation, not crisis. Pressure stays ambient; storm is spectacle, not test. Closure is resonance, not escalation, so cost is conceptual, not viscerally foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—identity as collective accumulation—emerges through monuments, shadows, and whispering crystals without explicit thesis. Final image of “presence over name” reweights earlier motifs. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Could use one concrete counter-instance to sharpen complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains distinctive cadence and lexicon (“summer-quill,” “threshold time”) without purple drift. Perceptual signature—measuring grief by shadow angle—remains consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. One register spike (“architecture of human nature”) barely grazes closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; rhythm echoes storm cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned, taught early, and paid off in final lightning hush. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high—each line advances image or concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memory-archivist above solid fog is fresh; shadow-reading as identity assay offers new angle on familiar “stones hold memory” trope. Concept stays integral, not ornamental. Could push further by letting her misread one shadow—introduce fallibility—for higher risk.</comment>
