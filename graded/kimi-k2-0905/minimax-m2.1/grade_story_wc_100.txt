<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aldric’s quiet refusal of modern embalming crystallizes into a vocational philosophy that survives the surreal transition; the aching rib-cage motif migrates from habitual fatigue to spiritual vocation without interiority ever slipping into label-speak. The lens in his lap becomes both tool and mirror, forcing micro-choices—touch, listen, release—that chart an invisible moral ledger. Stubbornness, weariness, and caretaker instinct braid into one irreplaceable sensibility; remove Aldric and every beat collapses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arrival-of-box inciting incident teleports Aldric to an impossible drowned library, a causal leap that the text legitimizes by anchoring the lens as both ticket and task; orientation inside the underwater space is taught through bodily disorientation rather than exposition. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the once-broken lens whole again, now broadcasting an endless signal he is fated to answer—cost is the lifelong vigil he accepts in exchange for purpose restored. No outline drift, no retro-patching; every beat follows the “because/therefore” of a man summoned to midwife the forgotten dead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt-smelling sand, waist-deep water, and rib-like bookshelves perform as micro-setting that physically constrains Aldric’s movement and attention; the throne-chair suspends him between mortal craftsman and after-life ferryman, charging the final image of sentinel-by-window. Sensory hierarchy obeys his embalmer’s eye—texture of glass, weight of lens, acoustics of foghorn—while spatial choreography stays coherent across impossible geometry. Setting is not backdrop; it supplies the only tools with which Aldric can complete the ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: will Aldric answer the distress call of unrecovered souls? Escalation is accretive—each soul he listens to knits the lens tighter and binds him closer to perpetual service; the tightening is visible on the object itself. Agency is renunciation: he forfeits retirement-in-stillness for eternal lighthouse-keeper duty, a price legible in the final image of fresh coffee poured only to wait. Coincidence operates only as inciting trigger, never as resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of stillness: only by surrendering to unending summons does Aldric locate the rest he chased in idleness. Subtext hides in gesture—pouring away cold coffee becomes quiet baptism into new time-discipline. No character moralizes “meaning”; instead, the restored lens refracts the idea that tending the forgotten is an inexhaustible vocation. The ending’s quiet charged poise lets the reader feel both gift and life-sentence without statement.</answer>

<comment>Voice carries undertaker precision: tactile, unsentimental, alert to weight and silence. Rhythm modulates from languid morning cadence to short, breath-held clauses when underwater; compression is taught early in the shifting package contents and pays off in bubble-doubled dialogue. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays locked to Aldric’s haptic bias. Free indirect style is clean—“his heart had grown something else entirely” keeps filter verbs character-true.</comment>

<comment>Prose is scaffold-free; no synonym loops, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“bookshelves rose like ribs” is the single overt simile and it earns its place by fusing anatomy to architecture. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror breath control underwater. Opening line anchors voice and anomaly; final line resolves through image that recharges prior motifs of light and vigil.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Few stories wed embalming craft to underwater after-life bureaucratic rescue; the synthesis feels inevitable once the salt-sand hits nostril. Broken lighthouse lens as after-life pager is fresh tech that grows from character occupation—light to guide the unburied. Risk of absurdist portal is fully embraced rather than hedged, and coherence is preserved by bodily sensory logic. Transformation test: swap undertaker and the entire emotional math collapses.</comment>
