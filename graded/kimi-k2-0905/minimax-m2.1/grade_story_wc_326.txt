<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—rage at the system versus ache for its maker—grounds every beat; the pulse-counting habit embodies her exile and is surrendered in a credible renunciation. Yet the architect-ghost remains off-stage, so status/relationship pressure is absent and the final forgiveness feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira stops counting, accepts the ghost’s apology, and the heartbeat becomes ambient—cost is the lifetime she spent tallying erasure. Accumulative lens holds: ink patterns, pulse totals, and snow depth tighten texture until the final quiet reweights meaning; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The opal walls, copper dome, and ink-cold interface are tactile constraints that shape the defragment ritual; the Comforter constellation reappears to charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to Mira’s astronomer-trained eye, and the snowed-in isolation literally forecloses outside options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mira keep indicting the system or accept the ghost’s regret?—tightens once when the ink yields the Comforter pattern, turning accusation into mourning. Cost is visible: she abandons the counting tether, relinquishing her last shield against erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of bureaucratic erasure and human remorse; no character verbalizes it. The heartbeat-to-silence arc reweights “presence” without moralizing, and the midnight solace tone lets apology and survival coexist in uneasy poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual filter—numbers, astronomical references, frost on glass. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into shorter pulses during ink-touch beats, mirroring cardiac rhythm; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but patterned: each metaphor (opal bone, snow equations, ink tears) recurs with accrued meaning; no mixed vehicles or synonym loops. One scaffold—“she had only wanted efficiency, had only wanted to help”—is justified as ghost-protocol stutter, not slop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The digital-ghost-as-apology-engine reconfigures familiar techno-dystopia into intimate penance; the astronomical observatory as séance chamber feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky compression of two deaths (Mira’s civil death, architect’s actual death) into one ritual succeeds without late rule changes.</comment>
