<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Miriam’s grief-wonder mix is evoked more than embodied; “searing mixture of grief and wonder” is label-speak at the emotional peak. Her single on-page micro-choice—kneeling to trace the cipher—feels lightweight against thirty years of yearning; the apparition does the narrative work, not her. No contradictory impulse is staged in real time, so the beat reads as revelation rather than decision. Closure is vicarious witnessing, not an earned renunciation or act that costs her a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is clear—diary → lagoon → apparition → witness—but the decisive change is performed by the grandmother, not Miriam; the only cost is transferred memory. The apparition’s exposition retro-explains stakes instead of tightening Miriam’s choices. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (truth must be remembered), yet the price is prospective, not felt on the page now. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the final image reweights meaning, but the protagonist’s agency is passive, capping the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Obsidian lagoon, floating zeppelin library, and ciphered debris are vividly particular and filter through Miriam’s scholarly gaze. The lagoon’s light-swallowing surface mirrors her internal black-hole of history, charging the final apparition. Spatial choreography is clean: descent ramp, crescent of artifacts, kneeling at water’s edge all track. One high-band slip: the zeppelin’s amber gasbags are admired, never used to constrain choice or tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“will Miriam accept the parley witness role?”—is latent until the final paragraph; no intermediate obstacle or cost tests her readiness. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: static zeppelin, windless lagoon, calm apparition. The single micro-turn is the grandmother rising, but it complicates nothing; it delivers. Pressure stays thematic (burden of memory) rather than visceral or tactical, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens but only lightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited historical witness emerges organically from diary → lagoon → cipher debris chain; no explicit thesis moralizes. The final reconfiguration—“truth deferred but never destroyed”—is earned by the grandmother’s decades-long loop, not Miriam’s struggle, so resonance is second-hand. Subtext in the ciphered shells is elegant: patina of time literalized in salt-crusted bone. Ambiguity is present yet leans sentimental rather than morally complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays snug to Miriam; perceptual signature is archivist-careful—“yellowed pages,” “sun-bleached bone,” “mechanical lullaby.” Syntax is varied, rhythmic, with controlled lift in lyrical passages; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively trapped”) momentarily lifts POV vocabulary but is internally consistent with her scholarly lens. Voice modulates from hush of reverie to crystalline clarity under apparition light without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is supple and image-dense, yet three adjacent sentences open with “The…” in the first paragraph; minor template cadence. Mixed metaphor cluster—“lagoon as doorway,” “insect in amber,” “patient whale”—lands safely because each serves a discrete beat, but edges toward ornament. Zero paraphrase loops; information density is high. No artifacts touch the closing image; momentum stays fluid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing civil-rights archive guilt with cosmic-uncanny parley feels fresh; the zeppelin-library is a striking mobile reliquary. Grandmother’s retrocognitive imprisonment retrofits ghost-trope into archival ethics, avoiding standard haunting beats. Yet the apparition rising from black water is visually close to familiar “ghost from lake” imagery; transformation is conceptual, not visual. Specificity of ciphered beach debris rescues the scene from derivative territory.</comment>
