<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s renunciation of violence and embrace of cultivation is embodied in every micro-gesture; the final paragraph crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The sandbag scrap functions as a tactile anchor for filial ambivalence, handled twice with shifting emotional weight. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously in scene, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the roses’ persistence reconfigures the meaning of “peace” with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is implied rather than chained, but the final image reweights all prior material. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices at this length, and the canvas-to-rose contrast supplies the required constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The dome’s glass and sand, the thorned stems, and the pocketed canvas scrap together constrain every choice Mira makes; removal of any would collapse the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased toward touch and light, filtered through a gardener’s priorities. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single continuous scene. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the closing beat, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—tending continuity against collapse—is signaled early and deepened when refugees arrive, forcing Mira to test her pacifist stance. One meaningful tightening occurs: offering water commits her finite resources, narrowing future options. Cost is visible in the final paragraph’s assertion that beauty persists “even when everything else crumbled.” Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens, but no second reversal keeps it from the 8+ tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between sheathing blades and sheathing memory in canvas; no explicit thesis is stated. The roses’ bloom reframes peace as active cultivation rather than absence of fire, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—thumb over canvas fibers, pruning cuts—rather than exposition. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: continuity is the quiet engraving that outlasts towers.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Mira’s perceptual signature—light angles, stem slants, canvas hum—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates from long horticultural sentences to the staccato of “she led them to her well,” mirroring threat then relief. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on narrative texture alone; the diction remains within a gardener’s lexicon. Distinct syntactic music and perceptual bias satisfy the 9- gate with only hairline reserve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“quiet like water finding its level” survives the mixed-metaphor test. One minor scaffold—“the way the light fell… the particular slant of a rose’s stem”—repeats syntactic opening, but the pattern is taught early and pays off in closure, keeping the penalty sub-deductive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse rose-monastery kept by a bounty-hunter’s pacifist daughter offers a fresh synthesis of Western and solarpunk tropes. The ballast scrap as memory-sheath reconfigures familiar father-ghost motif into tactile quiet. Risk is taken in the Accumulative/Textural structure rather than plot reversals, and it coheres. Not quite a 9 because the conceptual twist feels inevitable rather than startling in hindsight.</comment>
