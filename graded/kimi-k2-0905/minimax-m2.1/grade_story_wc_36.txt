<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira’s guilt and need for penance are vivid, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“failure was not a single moment but a long process…”) that flattens the embodied cost. The final shift to “witness rather than intervene” is credible, yet the beats showing her arriving at this renunciation are compressed into a single reflective paragraph, so the contradiction never fully combusts on the page. Still, the flute-as-weight and the driftwood ritual give us two tactile micro-choices that keep her from sliding into pure abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each driftwood marker and echo layer deepens the stake of “how to carry failure.” Closure is a Charged Poise—she rises with the flute, stance reconfigured, silence now a deliberate vocation rather than paralysis. Cost is legible in the final sentence: the guardianship path is foreclosed, humility installed. One causal gap: the Weaving itself is never shown or re-shown, so the reader must take the catastrophe on faith; because the story’s engine is her response, not the event, the gap is tolerable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is more than postcard: the acoustic rule forces her muteness, the dried riverbed supplies the ritual material, and the Listener’s Crossing re-appears as the exact scar-site, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the velvet case pressed to sternum) functions as emotional barometer. Spatial choreography is clean—three canyons, one junction, driftwood pattern mirroring a constellation—tracking holds throughout. Environment directly constrains her only viable action: silence and marking, not playing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to atone for letting the Weaving unravel—tightens via the imposed canyon hush: she must endure silence instead of fixing. One meaningful deepening: arranging the final constellation-pattern markers crystallizes her shift from “guardian-actor” to “witness,” narrowing future options. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is felt—she forfeits the right to ever play the flute—but could be sharper if the text let us hear her almost-play and then withhold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: relics choose keepers, not vice versa; stewardship may mean attentive surrender. Subtext lives in the unplayed flute and the unheard songs—silence speaks louder than alarm. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: witness over intervention. The driftwood-as-constellation quietly answers the opening collapse with a new, humbler cartography.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical yet grounded idiom—“avalanchingly quiet,” “echo-heavy passages”—that feels owned by Kira’s perceptual filter. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure (short clauses when she lifts the flute). Syntax mirrors canyon rhythm: long rolling sentences for echoes, abrupt fragments for her heartbeat freezes. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; no academic intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence fronts, high information density. One paraphrase loop: “silence could speak louder than alarm” / “silence speaking of all the songs it had witnessed” within four lines—minor. Occasional stacked modifiers (“tiny suspended worlds waiting to be born”) flirt with purple but serve the filtered light moment. No figurative muddle in the closure beat; final paragraph is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar guilt-and-penance arc is refreshed by the acoustic geography and the unplayed golden flute—an inversion of the heroic relic quest. Risk: making the protagonist’s victory a refusal to act could feel convenient, but here it is framed as costly renunciation rather than evasion. Specificity of the echo-canyon and the grandmother’s constellation pattern keeps the world from feeling generic. Not groundbreaking, but the synthesis feels particular to this voice.</comment>
