<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity and residual loyalty to Amari are clear, but her interiority drifts into abstract paraphrase (“fear and wonder warring”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final step-forward is a stance shift, yet it feels willed by the cosmic metaphor rather than by a prior micro-choice that exacts a visible cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the arrowhead remains symbolic cargo, never a decision pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira crosses into the “harmony untamed,” reconfiguring her options with the garden’s vibration as felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is secure by ~100 words. The persistent constraint (gravity play, creature frequency) shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The underground garden’s bioluminescent moss, reverse-flow water, and frost-laden air are rendered through Mira’s goal-directed attention, anchoring every beat. The flint arrowhead’s cold against the sternum reappears at the exact moment of metamorphic recognition, charging the final image. Gravity’s caprice constrains her literal footing, turning environment into tactic. One hairline slip: “soil to float in gentle clouds” repeats the same image within two sentences.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mira confront the transformed Amari and the truth he embodies—tightens when the vines coil upward and gravity loosens its grip, forcing her to decide: retreat or step into the untamed. The escalation is textural-densifying rather than causal-reversal, legitimate under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the physical lift-off and the frequency that rewrites her sensory floor. A second tightening beat would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the refusal to domesticate wonder: academia’s mockery is answered by becoming the very joke it laughed at. The cosmic-punchline metaphor reweights earlier ridicule without moralizing. Subtext sits in the static itself—knowledge that can only be heard when one surrenders control. The arrowhead’s return in the final breath crystallizes the reconfiguration, though a touch less abstract phrasing would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter: she hears frequencies as hair-raising static, sees gravity as “playful,” never exceeds her sensory boundary. Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under threat; diction stays within a botanist-academic lexicon without drifting into thesis-speak. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet the phone-filtered fragment of Amari carries altered cadence, sufficient for the cast size.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the garden’s pulse; sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful, pattern-taught early. One paraphrase loop—“refusing to be contained, refusing to be categorized, refusing to be anything...”—dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise clean mechanics, zero typos, strong verbs, no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cryptid-horror with academic satire feels fresh: the skeptic literally becomes the footnote she chased. Gravity-play and reverse horticulture invert familiar underground-garden tropes. The cordless phone as séance device repurposes retro tech without nostalgia. Risky lyric escalation pays off; the piece would collapse if any core image were swapped.</comment>
