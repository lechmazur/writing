<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s claustrophobia and stunt history are shown through tactile memory and present-tremor, not label-talk; the “trembling certainty” line lets fear and power coexist on the page. The micro-choice to read the cast while shelves press in embodies both phobia and stunt-honed nerve, earning her final stance. Daniel’s shift from mentor to captor is legible in one beat of honeyed condescension. Cost is felt: she will flee the library still trembling, but now armed with a self she chose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shell → voice → cast → coordinates → confrontation → renunciation. Orientation achieved by 80 words; no debt incurred. The single-scene default is met; the cast functions as both prop and decrypting tool, landing a Conceptual Repricing closure—her identity map is rewritten with undeniable social cost. Lens stays causal throughout; no amnesia or teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned library is sketched through cold rust, groaning shelves, and starlight milk—selective, not catalogic. The cast micro-setting constrains the final decrypting action and is handled twice, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is clean: back-pressed-against-shelves → table → standing with cast-shield. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—owning her true identity—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when decryption forecloses the “harmless pawn” option. One meaningful turn: she pivots from flight to confrontation under rising shelf-pressure. Cost is visible: trembling throat, clutched cast-shield, permanent relational rupture with Daniel. Agency is hers; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as power—emerges through the cast artifact and trembling voice, never sermonized. The shell-whisper reweights from maternal ghost to self-voice, a resonant reconfiguration. No final moral; image of cast-shield suffices. Ambiguity remains: she is still afraid, still moving, now author of the next scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect texture (“irony was not lost on her”) stays within Maya’s stunt-performer perceptual orbit. Syntax lengthens under reflection, fragments under shelf-pressure, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue until Daniel’s single line—its honeyed condescension carries subtext of ownership. No head-hop; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Metaphors are few, mixed once (“tide against rock”), but cleared before climax. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Strong verbs: “tumbled,” “clawing,” “crystallized.” Final line lands on monosyllabic punch. One paraphrase-adjacent line (“constructed… swapped… trained to forget”) is tolerated for expositional speed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Identity-via-child-cast-crypto feels fresh; stunt-claustrophobia irony sharpens it. Seashell-as-oral-USB and library-as-decryption-booth are specific syntheses, not stock tropes. Risk is moderate—single-scene decrypt thriller in under 800 words—but execution keeps it from gimmick. Could transpose names, yet cast-shell pairing would still feel bespoke.</comment>
