<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-anchored patience and the girl’s guarded vulnerability are rendered through tactile micro-choices (climbing rungs, soil tuck) that embody contradiction without label-speak. The gauge-tooth hand-off crystallizes a credible shift in both characters’ hierarchies of value. Cost is felt: the girl’s tears stop, Maren relinquishes talismanic control, and the rose’s winter stake is accepted. Interiority stays concrete; only the father’s quoted maxim flirts with aphorism, slightly softening the edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cutting planted in moonlight reconfigures both mourners’ stances while the rose’s unseen roots pay the deferred cost. Causal linkage holds: girl’s grief → climb → gift → joint planting, each beat narrowing emotional options. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated hush/oar/gauge motifs tighten until the final image reweights “waiting” as active creation. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive by line 5 and the harbor frame stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fire-escape lattice, moonlit harbor, and gauge tooth function as micro-settings that constrain motion and supply tactile light reflection for the culminating act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Maren notices iron chill, oar rhythm, gutter distance—never tourist postcard filler. Weather and tide remain consistent, silently licensing the returning fishing boat that bookends the scene. The rosebush’s thorns and empty pots ground grief in palpable space without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can bereaved hope be rekindled?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and deepened when Maren risks her sole relic to engage the girl. One meaningful tightening: the gauge leaves Maren’s palm, foreclosing solitary consolation and forcing communal ritual. Cost is legible: talisman surrendered, emotional armor lowered, winter still coming. Under Accumulative lens the hush/oar pattern intensifies until the planting beat crystallizes the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of patient, root-level renewal emerges through rose history and oar cadence rather than thesis statement. Subtext resides in the girl’s silent acceptance of the gauge and the moonlit soil pressing back against their fingers. Final image reframes loss as latent growth without moralizing. Only minor slack: “instill hope into darkest places” edges toward prompt-echo, but is immediately grounded by the planting action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual filter: harbor sounds equal her father’s pulse, gauge weight equals memory. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during ladder climb, mirroring emotional altitude. No head-hopping; child’s interior is shown through gesture and stopped tears. Distinctive maritime-gardener idiom (“fire escape gardener,” “pragmatic roses”) sustains texture without forced quirk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “luminous harbor,” “红色叹息” supply sensory punch without purple drift. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or setting. Metaphors (moon as silver/blue paint, oars as paternal heartbeat) stay coherent and physically aligned. Only hairline slip: “instill it into those dark corners” flirts with therapeutic register, but immediate tactile burial of cutting rescues immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fire-escape rose gardening as grief ritual feels fresh, merging urban verticality with horticultural patience. Gauge-tooth-as-talisman repurposes an obscure locksmith tool into emotional skeleton key without gimmickry. Synthesis of moonlit harbor and pruning lore produces a singular atmosphere unlikely to survive relocation. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric closure substitutes crystallized poise for twist, but specificity keeps it from generic elegy territory.</comment>
