<comment>Aldric’s contradictory pull between guarded solitude and ache for connection is rendered through tactile micro-gestures (thumb worrying wax paper, lifting the flower to light) that externalize interior pressure. The final decision to write is credibly foreshadowed by the remembered childhood abandonment, so the renunciation of isolation costs something we have watched him nurse for nineteen years. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority alone drives the arc and meets the 9+ test.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the Edelweiss re-weights Aldric’s entire life, turning the lighthouse from sentinel of abandonment into “gathering place for lost things.” Causal chain (stranger → hidden note → recovered memory → decision) is tight; each beat narrows his interpretive options until writing feels inevitable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within first 80 words; Lighthouse Test passed. Cost is legible in the final clause—“follow the trail…close the gap”—which admits the emotional price of reopening sealed loss.</comment>

<comment>The opal dock, mist, and revolving beam act as micro-setting: the vanished footprints literally remove physical evidence, forcing Aldric to adopt “gaps” as method. Edelweiss functions as portable alpine environment that constrains interpretation once the note is discovered. Sensory hierarchy obeys keeper priorities—sound of beam mechanism, smell of brine over perfume of dried flower—so detail never catalogues. One minor slip: “opal” color is stated but not exploited later for reflective/light interplay that could have charged the final image even more.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode stranger’s gesture or live with permanent ambiguity—is signaled in paragraph two. Mid-story discovery of hidden address/note supplies the single meaningful tightening: mystery shifts from impenetrable to actionable, forcing a choice. Cost is felt in the remembered abandonment that resurfacing will reopen. No escalation after that midpoint, but under lyrical-accumulative lens the density of meaning (not event) intensifies sufficiently; additional external complications would have over-stuffed 741-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—reconciliation across silence—emerges through iterated images of “gaps” (missing footprints, blank memories, untaken letters) rather than statement. Final image of lighthouse as “gathering place for lost things” reconfigures the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the flower: alpine fragility carried seaward implies maternal love mis-delivered yet enduring. Ambiguity is preserved: we never learn mother’s name or fate, so theme breathes rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; metaphors (“tide marks on stone,” “golden eye”) arise from keeper’s maritime sensorium. Syntax lengthens during recollection, then fractures into shorter units at discovery beat, mirroring cognitive jolt. No dialogue, so voice assessment rests on narrative texture, which sustains a hushed, ebb-and-flow rhythm consonant with twilight/mist. Perceptual signature is consistent: Aldric notices absence first—missing prints, unspoken words—aligning with his investigatory method.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but rarely overwrought; figurative language clusters in descriptive openings, then thins during action beats to avoid clutter. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor risk: “memories settling…like tide marks on stone” joins geologic and oceanic vehicles, yet the confluence is brief and doesn’t recur. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with paragraph breaks timed to lens-sweep and revelation beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “borrowed memories” gift is reframed as emotional archivist rather than genre super-power, fresh angle on empathic-psychic trope. Alpine Edelweiss at sea creates incongruous collision that pays off thematically. Structure—revelation through negative space—feels inevitable yet not derivative. Specificity of lighthouse protocol and nautical twilight timing resists generic coastal gothic, anchoring universals in lived detail.</comment>
