<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Tracker is vivid—albino-sensitized touch, “serene angry smile”—but he never makes a decision that changes his course; he only watches, touches, and finally dissolves. Interiority is evocative yet circular (“rage served no purpose… serenity remained”) without contradictory impulse in-scene. Disappearance is something done *to* him, not an earned renunciation; hence no visible cost scaled to the length. Voice keeps him memorable, but agency gap caps him mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: tracker’s body fades while consciousness expands, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—ink patterns and drone footage layer until the world dissolves. Orientation is clear by 120 wds; causality is loose under accumulative design, so no penalty. One minor loop: “three days ago… three days more” restates without new pressure, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Wind-scoured stone, hummingbird drone, and metamorphic ink act as micro-setting that directly constrains the final touch; without them the dissolution beat fails. Sensory selection skews visual but filtered through tracker’s temporal sensitivity (“frequency only he could hear”). Spatial choreography is clean—drone lands on finger, ink on table, body at perimeter. Weathered ruins never feel generic because they breathe with the same erosive force that thins time itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and deepens when ink begins to glow, tightening from observation to participatory dissolution. One meaningful shift: observer becomes subject, foreclosing escape. Cost is legible in bodily fade; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Could use a mid-scene tactical loss (tool, stamina) to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inexplicitly: consciousness as erosion—time, identity, and matter dissolve under patient observation. Recurrent “ink that remembers” reweights from curiosity to existential substrate without thematic statement. Final image of drone filming empty space offers Conceptual Repricing: knowledge outlives the knower. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds tight to tracker’s perceptual filter: metallic wingbeat as heard threat, ink motion sensed through gloved touch. Syntax lengthens under time-thinning effect, mirroring honey-like cadence without breaking clarity. No dialogue, so voice carries full burden and stays idiosyncratic. One register spike—“temporal dynamics”—feels academic but fits bureaucratic backstory, forgiven at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive; figurative density stays controlled, taught early (“wind-carved… persistent breeze”) and paid off. No paraphrase loops; sentences vary in length and opening. Minor scaffold: “three days ago… would consume three days more” echoes rather than advances. Otherwise clean, vivid, and rhythmically alive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of albino perception, feral archaeology, and sentient ink feels singular; not a trope checklist. Conceptual risk—time-collapse as breathable habitat—commits fully without late rule cheats. Disappearance trope is refreshed through material agency of spilled ink rather than mystical portal. Could edge 9+ with sharper causal fingerprint from protagonist, but synthesis is memorable.</comment>
