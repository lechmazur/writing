<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—submission to experiment versus covert reclamation of agency—remains vivid and embodied; the childhood drum-code micro-choice on the stone platform crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The link between her endurance and Mira’s dream is emotionally specific, but the cost (continued subjection to vomiting sessions) is asserted rather than shown in the final beat, keeping the renunciation just shy of irrevocable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bridge of living color reconfigures meaning without curing her, and the drumming choice bears visible energetic price (“the garden answered…cascaded upward”). Accumulative lens holds—pattern of sensory ripples builds to final auric convergence; no causal ambiguity at end. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by ~100 words; no waiver needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound-garden mechanics constrain every action—pressure-sensitive orchids, bass-moss hue-shifts—so the setting actively enables the climax; the lagoon’s breathing returns under starlight to charge the final image. Black-stone platform’s vibration conduction is a micro-setting tool that focuses the signal beat. Detail economy is high; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive Mira’s dream via neural entanglement—tightens when Elara risks amplified feedback to drum the forbidden pattern; garden’s response forecloses secrecy and exposes her to tomorrow’s data probe, a felt price. Single meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens. Escalation is coherent, though secondary physical risk (vomiting) remains static rather than worsening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unauthorized resurrection emerges through sensory particulars rather than thesis: dream is “suspended like light between stars,” reweighted when Elara turns the lab’s therapy tool into séance. Final image offers non-literal answer—sister’s smile within entanglement—without moral. Complexity preserved: scientists remain oblivious, rebellion is tiny yet cosmic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Elara’s perceptual filter—she notices frequencies as haptic ripples, starlight as inhalation. Rhythmic control mirrors pressure: longer clauses for garden wonder, staccato “three beats, pause” for code. No head-hop; psychic distance clean. Distinct voice maintained through diction within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with different structures, no template cadence. Information density high—single clauses manage sensory, emotional, and world data. One mixed-metaphor risk: “vomiting stars” is tolerated because it encodes both nausea and cosmic scale within Elara’s altered perception. Zero loops or filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sonic-therapy-garden as séance instrument feels fresh; trope of neural experiment is inverted—subject weaponizes the very externalization tool meant to quantify her. Childhood tap-code repurposed as biosystem hacker key is specific, inevitable in hindsight. Concept commits fully: no safety retreat to metaphor—lagoon actually breathes, dream actually pulses. Risk augments stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
