<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kira’s interior contradiction—gift as wound—is dramatized in the final beat when she lowers the shard and accepts endless exile; the embodied cost is felt. Earlier, however, her choices are reported rather than shown (“she had come to redirect the flow”) so agency is muffled. Mentor absence keeps relational pressure off-stage; the crucible is purely intra-subjective, acceptable but thinner. The cyclical memory loss is label-stated, not demonstrated mid-action, muting flaw-driven mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kira renounces the rescue fantasy and accepts perpetual transit; the conceptual cost—“she would forever weave between worlds”—is on-page. Causal chain holds: shard-touch → membrane-thin → self-confrontation → renunciation. One soft patch: the first mention of “redirect the flow” is abstract; the concrete action (pressing shard to panel) arrives late, so motivation lags ~100 words. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Repair bay is textured through Kira’s sensory map: cold metal, residual vibrations, empty crane cradle—details filter her professional gaze. The crane catwalk supplies vertical choreography that guides her ascent and final stance, charging the last image. Micro-setting (shard in pocket) constrains every move; its glow alters air pressure, integrating tool and place. Only light lapse: “colors that existed in no earthly spectrum” is generic wonder-phrasing amid otherwise sharp specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover mentor’s withheld truth—faces a single tightening when Kira realizes the truth is her own wound. Pressure escalates via cognitive tilt rather than external obstacle; the shard’s glow is the visible price. No reversal, but the deepening reweights options: rescue becomes self-acceptance. Cost is conceptual, felt in final line, satisfying short-form scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: knowledge pursued as external rescue collapses into internal reckoning. Subtext operates through spatial metaphors (ascending catwalk, thinning membrane) that mirror epistemic breach. Final image—“particular weight of a truth finally set down”—reverberates without moralizing. No motif checklist; green glass recurs because it actively thins reality, not as token symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly fused to Kira’s perceptual filter: molecular grief, cognitive wind, murmuring dreams. Syntax lengthens under metaphysical pressure, then contracts at stasis—“She lowered her hand”—mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Occasional elevated diction (“epistemic,” “causality itself”) slightly overshoots her grounded sensoriality but remains within lyrical allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, high-density; most sentences carry dual duty. No loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle: “cognitive wind” beside “everything tilting” is nearly contradictory but reads as synesthetic overload rather than muddle. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“rang,” “swirling,” “tilting”) propel. One paraphrase overlap: “membrane between worlds grew thin” echoed three sentences later as “membrane began to thin”; minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Parallel-world rescue turned self-reckoning is familiar, but sensory cartography as vocation and the shard-as-wound reversal give fresh tilt. Cyclical return is implied rather than diagrammed, avoiding gimmick. Specificity of Kepler-7 spaceport deters generic anywhere. Risk is moderate; no structural acrobatics, but voice-driven lyric escalation carries the piece beyond trope defaults.</comment>
