<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s inherited “territory philosophy” motivates every beat; the foreign bill is handled twice, embodying paternal code. Elena’s “perceptively calm” stance bends once—she asks Marcus to “help me dissuade the others,” a micro-choice that seals their alliance. Interiority is concrete (studying her “the way his father had studied rest stops”), never diagnostic. The final stance—dissolve, not sell—carries felt cost (“clean” money foregone) and is earned by the train-as-argument causality.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the couple choose deliberate dissolution over acquisition, costed by the cash they walk away from. Causal lens holds: “territorial markers” argument → Elena’s request for help = decisive tightening. Foreign bill and circus cars keep spatial continuity; time is one evening; no orientation debt. The line “clean starts are just circles…” reweights the premise, satisfying CR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Rusted circus cars…faded paint whispering” gives tactile decay; the train’s moving territories metaphor is fully dramatized through touch and arrangement logic. Dusk “purple and gold” mirrors their exhausted, sacral mood. The foreign bill acts as micro-setting, constraining Marcus’s pitch. Spatial choreography clean: two bodies circle one car, exit together. Weather (dusk) affects tone and timing, not just backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the team’s autonomy—signalled in first 90 words. Tightening beat: Elena’s buy-out offer → Marcus’s territorial counter-argument → joint renunciation. Price visible: they forgo immediate payout (“enough to start over. Clean”). Agency is persuasive, not coercive; coincidence absent. Internal/external stakes interlock: identity as founders vs. paternal legacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: mobility vs. erasure, legacy vs. liquidity. “Territories were stories people told themselves” is voiced by character, not author, and is tested by the final refusal. Subtext in Elena’s brittle laugh and the dusk light carries nostalgia’s cost. Final image—abandoned train “still marking its territory in the gathering dark”—reweights earlier metaphor, resisting tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature evident in highway-robber lexicon (“reading the landscape for markers”). Free indirect (“His father used to say…”) is clean. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentence on dusk, then clipped “Will you help me dissuade…” under pressure. No dialogue tags distract; Elena’s voice distinct in layered county-evening cadence. Register stable; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “shoebox of foreign paper money and a philosophy” compresses backstory and stakes. Mixed metaphor check: “rusted…whispering” + “iron skin” remain coherent. No paraphrase loops; sentences advance distinct knowledge. Paragraph cuts purposeful: single-line “So what do we do instead?” isolates shift. Minor cadence echo “markers…markers” is pattern-taught and paid off, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of startup crucible with itinerant-circus metaphor feels fresh; neither source dominates. “Territory moves with you” reconfigures typical exit narrative. Foreign currency as portable legacy is specific, not quirky. Transformation test: story collapses if circus train replaced by generic ruin. Risk in quiet renunciation succeeds; no gimmick. Voice synthesis of VC diction and highway-robber wisdom is non-obvious.</comment>
