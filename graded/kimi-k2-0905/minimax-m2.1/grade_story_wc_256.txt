<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her habit of holding the lens to her ear, the “texture of connection” obsession—but no contradictory impulse ever collides with it; every micro-choice merely confirms her monolithic intent. The final stance is a restatement, not a renunciation or costly crystallization, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph thickens the pattern of “manufactured yet authentic” until the final crystallization that “all journeys are artificial.” Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on-page; no persistent constraint or price shapes tactics, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carbide lens functions as micro-setting: its scratched glass literally refracts the emergency lights across schematics, guiding Elara’s design choices and returning in the final golden pool at her feet. Laboratory details are filtered through her engineer-poet perception, anchoring sensory hierarchy without tourist excess; the “amber glow” and magnetic-tape timbres evolve with her escalating obsession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a fake pilgrimage feel real?—is signaled early and tightens once: the committee doubt becomes her private fear that “texture” might be impossible to blueprint. The deepening is purely internal; no external test, deadline, or resource forfeiture narrows options, so escalation is cerebral rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges inexorably from the paradox she engineers: authenticity is a retroactive human graft, not a site. The lens’s final golden pool reweights every prior “artificial” label without moralizing; the resonance is earned, but the absence of visible cost to Elara keeps it just below the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—scientific precision braided with synesthetic longing (“prism-song,” “grain and warmth”). Rhythm modulates with her intensity: longer clause-strings when she theorizes, clipped fragments at the threshold moment, all without register drift or scaffold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—information plus atmosphere—without figurative pile-up; only one mixed metaphor (“liquid courage” for light) momentarily wobbles. Loops are absent, propulsion steady; the final line lands clean, recharging “golden shadows” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Post-collapse pilgrimage-as-code is fresh, and the miner’s lens repurposed as sacred relic transfigures a tired trope. The concept never retreats into safety, yet the absence of an on-page pilgrim trial keeps the innovation slightly abstract rather than viscerally tested.</comment>
