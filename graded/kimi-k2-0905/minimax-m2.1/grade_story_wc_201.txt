<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s shame-riven interiority is vivid and embodied; “body remembering” supplies micro-choices with cost. The final stance—refusing to unclip the beacon-strap—crystallizes an earned stasis that forecloses comfort, though her overt contradictory impulse in-scene could be sharper still.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: each sensory and memory layer thickens rather than triggers. The beat sequence (forest walk → clearing threshold) deepens knowledge and stakes; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the mask-strap as shackle/key. Orientation clean within 120 words; anaphoric repetitions (“the mathematics…”) teach rhythm; cost is felt in final ultraviolet glare.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Forest rendered in synesthetic ultraviolet supplies both atmosphere and conceptual mirror of Mira’s hyper-perception. The mask-strap and moss path operate as micro-settings that constrain footfall and skull alike. Space is coherent; few objects, all re-used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she keep or drop the beacon?—tightens once: the strap’s hum rises, options narrow to enter the clearing. Pressure is situational yet coherent; agency is endurance/attention, not reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ultraviolet forest and strap build a meditation on surveillance and self-punishment without naming it; the ending image re-prices mercy as perpetual exposure. No moralizing. Could leach slightly more concrete loss (social, bodily) to reach highest band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Proprioceptive hallmark colors every perception and verb choice; lyric cadence taught early and paid off in final hush. No head-hopping; psychic distance tight to trauma body. Register stable, slight purple risk in “mathematics of mercy” yet reads as Mira’s obsessive idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density, minimal scaffold; repeated “mathematics” is intentional motif. Opening/closure sentences echo without loop. Every clause advances knowledge, atmosphere, or beat. Metaphors stay consistent (UV light as liquid). Minor synonym adjacency (“treescape… forest… treescape”) is loomed into pattern so excused.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Interrogation-scarred proprioceptive survivor is familiar SF territory, but the ultraviolet forest + strap-as-beacon pairing gives a fresh visceral twist; risk taken with lyric temporal dilation. Could push further into unmapped sensory lexicon.</comment>
