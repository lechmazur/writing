<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kira’s obliging nature is shown through tactile ritual, but the “mechanically warm” trait is stated, not tested; the moment she proves sideways time, her interiority flatlines into summary awe rather than a contradictory stance with cost. No micro-choice after the discovery reweights her identity or future; the closure beat is purely observational.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The closure lands a clean conceptual re-pricing—time is sideways—delivered through holographic display and ARIA’s confirmation, with the station itself as persistent constraint. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each tightening is a density increase in temporal bleed evidence rather than a because/therefore turn, but the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The lever pull sequence is effectively the single deepening required for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Setting is filtered through Kira’s mechanic gaze—worn lever, humming nexus, iridescent wings—details selected for engineering utility. The cold bay and warm fingertips create a micro-environment that mirrors the thematic temperature clash. The magnetic nexus and observation glass evolve from backdrop to active constraint that enables the final temporal image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—is signaled early and tightens once when holographic grids reveal dual molt phases; the lever pull deepens rather than reverses, forcing her hypothesis into undeniable reality. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the universe’s rule-set is reweighted, and the station’s perpetual cold acts as persistent constraint. Under Accumulative lens, a single meaningful intensification suffices, and it delivers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the mechanic’s humble documentation of cosmic re-ordering: sideways time reframes her twenty years of “obliging” repair work into an act of witnessing. The iridescent wings and magnetic nexus carry the thematic load without explicit statement. Final image of the station “suspended between moments” offers resonant, non-literal answer—no moralizing, just charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kira’s tactile, engineering perception; diction favors tool verbs—“adjusted her wrench belt,” “gripped the lever”—creating a rhythmic, metallic texture. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she could feel the vibration”). Under peak pressure, syntax compresses—“Time had revealed its sideways nature”—without breaking POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, varied, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated lyrical lifts (“existing briefly in states that shouldn't logically coexist”) are earned by the speculative frame. Metaphors stay coherent—wings like pages, station breathing—without crowding high-pressure beats. Final line lands with cadence punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The sideways-time premise is freshly grounded in a maintenance worker’s POV rather than scientist-hero cliché. Velith-wings as temporal instruments feels specific to this world. Risk lies in the quiet observational ending; it pays off through accumulated image rather than twist, yielding a non-obvious but inevitable closure.</comment>
