<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow’s interiority is sensuously grounded (rain on glass, wood dust in nostrils) and her micro-choices—ignoring the kettle, pressing glass eyes last—embody the “here/gone” tension. The contradiction between clinging and releasing is dramatized, not declared. Yet the arc is more accumulative image-pattern than causal escalation, so the final “keeping hold / letting go” read as earned stasis rather than a turn that costs her a future path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glass-eyed lion crystallizes the paradox that containment ≠ imprisonment. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of rain, shavings, kettle whistle—each recurrence re-weighting absence. Cost is legible in the cold kettle and the fading autumn light; she forfeits the daily ritual of tea for the eternal one of carving. Causality is interior and recursive rather than forward-driving, but the pattern is taught early and pays off cleanly.</comment>

<comment>The loft, skylight, and rain function as micro-setting: water beads determine the quality of light she carves by; arena-sawdust ghost anchors vocation. Ash block is handled in every beat—its weight, grain, scent—culminating in the moment thumb reads rising grain. Spatial choreography is tight: kettle, shavings-pile, window, her lap all track cleanly. Weather and wood constrain the pace of work, directly charging the final rust-hued image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: transform absence into form without betraying wildness. Pressure escalates by texture—each curl of shaved wood tightens the emotional torque rather than narrows external options. The “containment” choice is reiterated with rising specificity (mane strand by strand) until the eyes’ insertion makes the cost irreversible. No external antagonist, but the kettle’s ignored whistle is an audible reminder that domestic time is forfeited for carved eternity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from tactile paradox: embrace ≈ cage, gone ≈ here. Subtext hides in silence—no dialogue, only whistle and chisel—forcing reader to feel the unsaid. Final image reweights “here and gone” without moralizing; the lion’s gaze is presence carved from absence. Ambiguity is purposeful: widow has not “moved on” but has redefined what moving means.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at psychic distance that can slip into quasi-second-person imperatives—“the work decided whether to live”—mirroring her trance. Syntax lengthens and softens, replicating rain’s drag; diction stays within artisan lexicon (chisel, grain, bead). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is wood-centric and rain-narrowed. Voice modulates: calm description under rising emotional pressure without breaking cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with carve-and-pause action; paragraph breaks mirror chisel lifts. Figurative layering (“color of old iron,” “crystallized time”) is dense yet consistently welded to sensory ground. One scaffold detected: “the work was love, and the work was letting go, and the work was keeping hold…” triple anaphora borders template cadence but reads intentional as incantatory closure. No mixed metaphors, no paraphrase loops; information load per sentence is high yet clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Grief-through-carving is familiar turf, but focus on lion-tamer’s craft specificity (arena dust as ghost) freshens the frame. Transforming husband into carved lion converts biographical memory into mythic object without allegorical overkill. Risk: heavy lyric repetition could slide into workshop trope, yet rhythm restraint keeps it from purple spill. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet not derivative; widow’s stasis is portrait, not self-help.</comment>
