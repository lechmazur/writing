<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kira’s solitary obsession is evoked through tactile ritual—compass spins, palm on warm basalt—yet her interior contradictions remain mostly summarized (“restless energy…transforming it into something more durable”). The final unyoking pays off her grandfather’s journal thread, but the cost is more announced (“the subtle release”) than embodied; still, the arc from observer to catalyst is coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the viaduct’s song and lake’s answer crystallize a before/after stance with felt cosmic cost. Accumulative lens holds: each night’s moon-track adds density until the magnetic lattice and lunar river converge, reweighting Kira’s life-work. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no因果 gaps. Persistent constraint—the thousand-year binding—shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Basalt ribs, groaning ice, and moon-polished surfaces are filtered through Kira’s cartographer gaze, constraining her movements and pacing. Warm volcanic stone in sub-zero air is a concrete sensory contradiction that charges the unyoking beat. Spatial choreography is clean; the frozen lake serves as both mirror and resonant drum, integrating into closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map a horizon only patience can reveal—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: nightly moon paths thicken the lattice of meaning until the viaduct’s hum fuses with lunar reflection, forcing a tacit trade-off: personal disappearance into the work. Cost is legible in the final tone-shift: spring will change the world “no other cartographer would think to map,” implying irreversible outsider status.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges through accreted images rather than statement; the final image reweights the premise that landscapes yield only to those who surrender lifetime urgency. Ambiguity remains—will the change liberate or erase her?—creating lingering resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Kira’s shoulder with a geologist-poet lexicon—“mineral structure,” “silver rivers”—that stays within her trained perception. Rhythm swells from measured cataloguing to syncopated clauses under the viaduct’s hum, mirroring her interior crescendo. No head-hopping; compression (“she unyoke herself”) is taught by context and pays off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “ice spoke in groans and cracks” does triple sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay geologic and coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“parchment-thin boundary”) is justified by cartographer POV. Final sentence lands with crystalline cadence that recharges “horizons” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fuses obscure geomancy with solitary female explorer trope, then interiorizes the expedition into lunar telemetry and basalt resonance. Magnetic viaduct as natural bridge-between-worlds feels geologically inevitable rather than fantastical gadget. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; payoff is a fresh inflection on “mapping the unmappable.”</comment>
