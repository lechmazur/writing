<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the geode as ‘sleeping god’ and the urinating-to-survive detail crystallize a believable, guilt-ridden psyche. Contradictory impulses—scientist’s rationalism vs. mystic hope—co-exist live in the final paragraph. Closure cost is felt: the perpetual hunt is accepted with “what else is there to do.” Slight reserve: no micro-choice inside the observatory scene forces a new tactic; stance is static revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of returned images (geode, cooling LEDs, pools of potential) tightens to Charged Poise ending—“hold it up to the light and watch it scatter”—with visible conceptual cost (endless search accepted). Causality intact; drone strike + survival anchor by 120 words. No meaningful pressure turn inside present scene, only deepening, sufficient for ≤800-word lyric design. Closure beat is legible and untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (geode) functions as environment: texture, temperature, light-refraction steer attention and mirror internal state; “scatters into geometries that look... like answers” charges the final image. Ruins below and observatory walls are sketched sparingly yet supply scale and confinement. Sensory hierarchy obeys stress-narrowed perception. Geode specificity would cap Q3 at 8.8 without full constraint on a tactical choice, meets 9-band gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hunt unused potential”—is signaled early and deepens through reiterations of cooling LEDs and geode warmth, reweighting cost of endless search under Accumulative lens. Tightening occurs cognitively rather than via new external threat; one on-page turn sufficient at this length. No price paid inside scene (already lost wife, status), but conceptual cost crystallizes at end. High band secured; lacked visible new constraint to push ≥8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: mathematics of grief—random strike vs. hidden connectedness—stays implicit; no authorial thesis stated. Final CR image (“geometries that look, for just a moment, like answers”) reweights prior material without moral. Ambiguity between scientific and mystical readings is invited, not resolved, supplying lingering aftereffect. Particulars (urinating survival, scorch-mottled geode) keep universals grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: scientific diction (“perturbation theory applied to existential crisis”) braided with mystic register (“secret the earth kept too long”). Syntax lengthens then fractures under emotional crest, mirroring cognitive strain. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Lyric compression (“bleak exhilaration”) is taught early and paid off. Rhythm control tight; no drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density; most sentences advance image, atmosphere, or interiority. Figurative language clustered but pattern-taught (“pools of unused potential” recurs) and resolves cleanly. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor filter-verb stack (“feels intangibly tangible”) forgiven as it names the paradox driving hunt. Closure image remains clear and potent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drone-strike wedding survivor fused with hard-science mathematics of grief via geode talisman—specific enough to prevent trope recycling. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulative structure, no plot reversal—heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Details (olive copse piss-break, cooling circuit LEDs) feel idiosyncratic, not googled. Transformation test fails if names swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
