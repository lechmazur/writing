<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is consistently concrete—her breath “rising like ghost-motes,” the “weight…pressing against the inside of her skull”—and her micro-choices (kneel, trace silence, release the wing) track a credible shift from dread to purposeful renunciation. The contradiction between mastered binding arts and the new art of “unmaking” is held in-scene, not abstractly declared. Cost is felt: she forfeits the security of prophecy itself, a loss legible in the final image of the wing drifting away. The only limit is the absence of a second character to test status dynamics, but at this length the solo crucible suffices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy reweights from immutable fate to “frequency that could be tuned,” and the cost is the surrender of predictive certainty itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each hush-layer (brook, frogs, paper wing) thickens silence until meaning, not event, is altered. The origami wing’s journey downstream is the charged image that makes the before/after legible. Minor waiver: orientation (who/where) is taught after ~120 words, but the delay is purposeful and pays off in the final stillness, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The brook, moonlit stones, and paper wing form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains her method: water provides the “frequency,” moonlight the visible signal, the wing the tactile tool she must finally relinquish. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices cold breath, paper creases, frog cessation in the order a focused ritualist would. Spatial choreography is immaculate: wing lifted by air currents, settles on water, drifts downstream—no impossible positions. The environment evolves in lockstep with the hush-ritual, charging the final image with earned quiet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent a coded prophecy from hardening into destiny—tightens through silence-accretion rather than external opposition. One decisive deepening: the prophecy flips from threat to “desperate plea” across the hush-bridge, narrowing her options to renunciation rather than combat. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she loses the future as map, gains it as open water. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is coherent and internalized under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: prophecy as noise, silence as agency, paper as both message and vehicle. The crane wing’s reprise downstream reweights “folded possibility” into “unfolded future,” a conceptual repricing achieved by image, not assertion. Subtext resides in gesture—quieting frogs equals silencing court intrigue at a distance. Final image offers non-literal answer: an unwritten future is not emptiness but spaciousness, a resonance earned by particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“ghost-motes,” “terrestrially cosmic”) stays within a scholar-ritualist’s lexicon. Rhythm mirrors the ritual: long sentences during buildup, fragment-like calm at the hush-crest. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; interior voice is singular and sustained. Compression (“the mapping of silence as cartographers once mapped stars”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances hush-layer or character knowledge. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—moonlight as flame, prophecy as frequency—no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety propels the ritual crescendo then settles into the quiet final cadence. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“carrying truth downstream”) that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “smoothing hush” mechanic is fresh: defeating prophecy by quieting its medium rather than counter-spelling. Origami wing as both childhood relic and signal-dampener synthesizes personal memory and cosmic scale without exposition. Conceptual risk—treating time as frequency—pays off because the closure image makes the abstraction felt. Specificity throughout (paper creases, frog silence, moonlit water) prevents the premise from feeling abstract or gimmicked.</comment>
