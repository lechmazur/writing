<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—equations vs. the butterfly’s ambiguous fade—is embodied and sustained. The micro-choice to sit on the overturned pot crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: she forecloses the “dramatic narrative” lens forever. The shift from observer to humbled witness is earned; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes. What keeps her from 9+ is the absence of a second beat where her new stance is actively tested under fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the golden fingerprint reweights her entire cosmology. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust patterns slowly reconfigure meaning—cost is legible in the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 45; no lens ambiguity. One causal gap: the aunt’s philosophy is introduced late and never dramatized, so the greenhouse comparison feels imported rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s broken glass, receding water, and surviving rosemary bush function as micro-setting that constrains her motion and supplies the butterfly. Sensory hierarchy obeys an astrophysicist’s eye: bruised-purple sky, infinitesimal scales, light-curve tracery. Spatial choreography holds as she crouches, stands, returns three days later. The missing 9+ gate: no object or environmental feature is manipulated in a final beat to charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep forcing cosmic drama onto every death?—is signaled early. The butterfly’s gradual decay supplies one decisive tightening that repatterns her interpretive lens; cost is the loss of her prior certainty. Under Accumulative lens, the slow dust shift is sufficient escalation. No secondary pressure or antagonist appears, so the escalation is single-note; that caps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the violence of supernovae vs. the quiet dignity of unrecorded decay. The butterfly’s golden fingerprint becomes a non-literal answer—smallness liberates rather than diminishes. No moralizing sentence closes the piece; the final image of dispersing dust reweights prior material. The aunt’s late entrance is the only soft echo, slightly diluting thematic cohesion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature: “preprocess reality,” “elegant violence,” “light curves.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into shorter units at the moment of release, mirroring dust dispersion. No head-hopping; free indirect discourse is clean. The almost-lyric cadence risks one repetitive anaphora (“she had… she had…”) but redeems it by pattern payoff in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “water recede from the cracked floor tiles while the sky outside held the bruised purple” marries action, setting, and tone. Metaphors stay coherent—dust as light curve—never mixed. One scaffold clause (“she understood, in that moment”) is easily trimmed; otherwise zero loops or synonym churn. No artifact appears in the final third; clarity at closure remains pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The astrophysicist humbled by a dying butterfly could slide into cliché, yet the neutron-star vocabulary grafted onto greenhouse minutiae feels idiosyncratic and earned. The insight—that gradual accumulated dust is the same physics as stellar collapse—offers a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken in the quiet, anti-dramatic arc, but coherence never wavers. The late aunt mention is the only derivative echo, preventing a higher band.</comment>
