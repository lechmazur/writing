<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is textured (“she had learned to measure journeys by the quality of silence between stars”), but the climactic self-sacrifice is declared rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses; we never feel her fear or hesitation, only her serenity. The empty hourglass reappears but does not constrain any micro-choice in-scene, so the promised cost remains conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Maren steps into the nexus, ferry stabilizes, timelines merge, and she accepts permanent transience—an Earned Stasis with visible conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: urgent radio → recognition of instability → voluntary merger → grotto solidifies. One transition (dock → intersection) is legible; orientation anchors inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment> Spectral grotto, starlight at impossible angles, and the flickering hull create a tactile, POV-filtered world that directly guides Maren’s choice to act as stabilizer. The empty hourglass functions as micro-setting, its weight against her hip cueing the final beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent passenger dissolution—emerges early via radio urgency and tightens once: Maren must risk scattering herself to merge timelines. Cost is legible in the final image (“she had found a kind of home” in permanent transience), but escalation is single-step; no secondary reversal or resource loss alters tactics mid-course.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding home inside permanent transience emerges through Maren’s stance crystallization rather than statement; the empty hourglass’s reprise reweights earlier material. Final image avoids moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity, though thematic nuance is thin—no competing value is seriously tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice carries a consistent lyric-technical hybrid (“interconnected strands of frequency and static”) that feels native to a deckhand who navigates impossible geometry. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature holds through climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional modifier stacks (“light and shadow interweaving in those intricate patterns”) verge on overwriting without pattern pay-off. One paraphrase loop near midpoint; no loops touch closure. Strong read-aloud rhythm overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Flickering ferry + sideways clocks + radio-pattern navigation remix familiar slipstream tropes into a fresh commuter-premise anchored in one woman’s acceptance. Specific sensory detail prevents template feel; risk is moderate, coherence high. Not radically original but memorably particularized.</comment>
