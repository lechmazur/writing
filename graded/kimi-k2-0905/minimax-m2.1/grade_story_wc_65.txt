<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her “groundedly imaginative” stance is shown through tactile micro-choices (hovering quill, tracing patterns). Yet the absence of any second character keeps relational pressure off-stage, so the only crucible is self-imposed; the final “began to write” is credible but not visibly costly, capping depth at 7.2.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quill descending encodes the conceptual cost of mapping ignorance itself. Causal chain holds—feather → constraint → predictive model → poised act—without teleport or amnesia. One shard, one POV, orientation anchored by 120 words; the reflective block (~30%) is interleaved with present stimuli and micro-choices, satisfying BRR exception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher feather operate as micro-setting that constrains the final act: cold rigidity mirrors the constraint she embraces, feather’s river shimmer supplies the ink’s blue. Sensory hierarchy obeys her cartographer gaze—light fracture, tactile nib, breath mist. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she write possibility without false certainty—tightens once: refusal to script a single future narrows her options to constellation-only. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: density of mirrored ice shards, feather’s shimmer, and blank page intensify the stakes. Cost is conceptual but legible; a more visceral forfeiture could push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as navigable ignorance—emerges through image pattern (lake shards, feather dive, blank light) rather than statement. Final image of blue ink poised above white reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: innovation born of humility and audacity. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is cartographer—quantifies light fracture, reads policies’ ripple effects. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at quill hover, mirroring breath. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within her scholarly lexicon. Distinctive rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “iridescent blue-green of the kingfisher feather quill nib” packs color, material, and memory in one noun phrase. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors (lake as timeline shards) cohere. One mixed moment—“cosmic accident” slightly jars empirical voice—kept from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Ignorance cartographer” is fresh; coupling it with predictive modeling against a frozen lake yields a singular conceptual stance. Risk—refusing to write one future—grows organically from premise. Not quite 9.5 because the feather’s cosmic arrival is the lone coincidence, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
