<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s “methodically curious” trait is asserted more than dramatized; she never makes a costly on-page choice that forecloses future access. The renunciation at the end is admirable but causally under-motivated—no prior beat shows her risking or losing anything by refusing to excavate. Interiority is evocative yet abstract (“the past yearned to speak”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elena exits without forcing the door, a resonant reconfiguration that carries conceptual cost (“some truths require patience”). Causality is accumulative/textural; the comparison of film frames supplies the single tightening that reweights the stake. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 120 words and supports the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The henge, altar stone, and fresco vault recur with shifting texture; the 1952→1987 film gap turns the rain-scoured pigments into a time-lapse meter that charges Elena’s final refusal. Spatial choreography is clean—descent, projection corner, ascent track without drift. Weathered pigments and dawn light constrain perception and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><answer>The dominant stake—“will she force the vault open?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the 1987 doorway proves human re-entry possible, converting abstract history into immediate ethical choice. Agency is renunciation rather than action; cost is conceptual (foreclosed knowledge) and felt in the final “shielded openness” image. One meaningful escalation suffices under the accumulative lens.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: stewardship of silence versus possessive knowledge. Subtext resides in Elena’s retreat—she honors prior “inheritors” without sermonizing. Final image reweights earlier cartographic metaphors (“blank parchment”) into reverent restraint. Avoids explicit thesis, though “whispered chapel” drifts toward Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature is cartographic—“spaces between places,” “ink met emptiness”—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts during descent, supporting emotional curve. No dialogue to test, yet interior diction stays within Elena’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates gracefully; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Occasional elevated diction (“pregnant with accumulated whispers”) skirts purple but stays pattern-justified. Information density high; only minor loop near “reverence…inheritors” phrasing. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresco-vault-revealed-by-archival-film is fresh synthesis; henge tropes are inverted into archival patience rather than cosmic horror. Risk lies in quiet refusal climax—works here because prior imagery frames restraint as active virtue. Could travel with names changed but loses Elena’s map-framer idiom that powers voice.</comment>
