<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is evocative (“she loved it for that”) but stays lyrical and observant; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final “new understanding” is declared rather than shown through a micro-choice that costs her something tangible. No embodied emotion undercuts the epiphany. Still, the vendor’s perceptual filter is specific and consistent.</comment>

<comment>The concept of “quantifying absence” supplies a conceptual Decisive Change: she reframes her merchandise from blank to pregnant with chosen silence. Cost is conceptual, not felt—no consequence or constraint is visible on her future business. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds and lands. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Glass orchard, obsidian trunk, bottled moonlight: sensory triad is vivid, selective, and filtered through the vendor’s aesthetic gaze. The bottles refract moonlight across the final paragraph, charging the closure image. Setting never blocks or enables a physical choice, but it supplies the symbolic grammar she adopts. Meets 9- gate: environment supplies the final image’s resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stake is intellectual—can she read the library’s negative language?—but no external or internal pressure escalates; the lull merely permits reflection. The single “tightening” is the recognition that absence shapes stories, yet it neither narrows her options nor exacts a price. Agency is purely attentional. Enough for micro-length, but thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of silences as generative emerges through glass, bottles, and refracted light, never slogan. Final image of “mindful scattering of silences” reweights her earlier sales pitch without moralizing. Subtext is embedded in sensory pattern rather than asserted. Complexity is present but constrained by the piece’s observational stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors prismatic light and negative space. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “glass,” “bottle,” “absence” to create accretive rhythm. No register drift. One POV, no head-hop; voice matches the vendor’s curator temperament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no filler loops. Clause rhythm modulates to match the hush of the library. Minor scaffold: “stories waiting to be born” / “narratives still forming” are adjacent paraphrases. Image density stays high without purple overload. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The inverse library of unwritten silence is conceptually fresh; the commerce metaphor (“clean slate vendor”) reframes writer’s block as curatorial. Negative-space epistemology feels inevitable by the end. Risk is moderate—lyric concept piece—but execution keeps coherence. No echo of familiar pop-culture libraries.</comment>
