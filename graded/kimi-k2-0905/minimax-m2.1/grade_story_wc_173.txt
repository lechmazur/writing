<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The courtesan’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “refusal” encoded in wrist-turns, her gaze carrying “entire conversations”—and her quiet endurance earns a credible Cost: she forecloses the palace’s lullaby forever. No contradictory impulses are staged in a single beat, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed, but the character-specific poetry of gesture and the final crystallized defiance keep her well inside the high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the courtyard’s echo-threads accumulate until the dawn-light re-prisms them, re-weighting her stake from passive survival to luminous defiance. The closure is a Charged Poise—she walks away leaving “no mark,” yet the cost is legible: she can never again be sung asleep. Orientation is anchored inside 60 words; pattern taught early; final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen fountain-prisms function as micro-setting that literally refracts the final stakes onto the snow; their light “brighten[s]” in response to her untangling, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean—her footprints absent, her knees at the rim, the dawn throwing “tiny rainbows.” Weather and surface actively constrain stealth and visibility, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain awake to the lullaby—tightens via each thread she releases; the palace’s song frays “unable to reach her.” Escalation is accumulative: every freed echo increases her own luminosity. The cost is felt—she is now “wild and bright and absolutely… defiant,” a social death inside the palace—satisfying the lens, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the reclamation of discarded selves versus institutional sedation. Subtext lives in gesture-code and prism-light rather than pronouncement. The final image refracts the lullaby into rainbow shards—an implicit, non-moral answer. Minor abstraction in “spiritual residue” keeps it just below the 9+ tier, but complexity and lingering ambiguity are solidly met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet always legible; patterned diction (“lullaby of conformity,” “harvest the echoes”) is taught by sentence two and paid off in the final stride. Perceptual signature is consistent—she reads the world as poem and thread. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses at dawn-light pivot. No dialogue = no voice contamination; internal register stays within courtesan-poet lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high; metaphor density is purposeful and patterned, not gratuitous. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction (“inviolate,” “resignation”) fits the POV’s poetic self-training. One mixed image—“threads…wrapped around frozen water”—is momentarily physical nonsense but does not touch the closure beat, so keeps the 9− band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar “courtesan with hidden inner life” is re-animated through the echo-harvest mechanic and prism-refraction closure, a fresh synthesis. Palace-as-siren and gesture-code feel specific to this text. Risk—lyric stillness in place of overt plot—heightens rather than obscures stakes. The transformation test fails if relocated, confirming freshness; slight abstraction in world-rules holds it shy of 8.8.</comment>
