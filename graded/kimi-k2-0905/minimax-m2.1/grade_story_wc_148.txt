<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s filial duty and refusal of silence are vivid, but his inner contradictions stay abstract (“stone in his chest”); no micro-choice on the page actually changes his tactics after entering the cell, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marcus speaks the withheld words and the lighthouse keeper hears, reconfiguring prisoner/keeper roles with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of layered images (copperlight, lattice, scuffs) tightens to final resonance—though the bodies-on-reef stakes are declared, not tested, keeping the cost slightly speculative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Door scuffs, lattice glow, and reef copperlight filter through Marcus’s obsessed perception; these micro-settings constrain his path—he can only enter via the scored threshold and must kneel at the converted confessional, charging the final image with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“speak the buried truth before the village learns of the bodies”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Marcus threads the lattice meaning through the door scars, but escalation is atmospheric, not causal, and the reef bodies remain off-stage, blunting visceral cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited story versus communal denial emerges through recurrent lattice/copperlight imagery that reweights at closure; no moral statement intrudes, and the final image of “lattice holding the light” offers resonant, non-literal answer to who carries truth when no one listens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person stays welded to Marcus’s sensory register (“copperlight repose… fever breaking into sweat”); rhythmic control heightens under pressure, no head-hop, and patterned elision (“hovered now at the threshold… in that other sense”) is taught early and paid off at threshold crossing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned—copperlight, fever-sweat, reef grave—so it reads as accumulative design, not purple overload; zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors in peak beat, and final sentence cadence crystallizes without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment> Cry-wolf retold as posthumous vindication through lighthouse-prison fusion feels fresh; risk-taking in lyric compression heightens mood without gimmickry, though reef-wolf link stays metaphorical rather than reinventing lore mechanics, keeping it short of exceptional.</comment>
