<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lysara’s interiority is lush and embodied—grief hums in her fingertips, fear in her scent-memory—yet the pivot from refusal to readiness is declared (“she was afraid, and she was ready”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. The spice-crushing beat shows corporeal agency, earning the metamorphosis, but Korin remains an off-stage memory rather than a relationship under pressure, so the arc is solo-mythic rather than crucible-tested. Still, the contradiction between human fragility and animal hunger is kept alive in every breath, enough to lift the score into the strong band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lysara’s “I would become the bridge” crystallizes the new state and its cost—permanent hybridity—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Scent-memory linkage is taught early and paid off in the final image (“spices continued their fragrant work”), so the pattern holds. One causality seam: the fortune’s prophecy never concretely narrows options; it merely echoes. Nevertheless, the ending beat reweights every prior sensory thread, satisfying the cost test with felt rather than plot currency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Moon-drenched orchard and spice geography are vivid, selective, and filtered through Lysara’s animal-attuned senses. The silver light and star-fruit function as micro-setting, but only the spice scent actively constrains the ritual; the orchard itself does not foreclose alternatives, keeping the score below the 9 gate. Spatial anchors hold; no orientation drift. A few ornamental celestial phrases could be trimmed without loss.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reunite with Korin across death—signals inside 120 words and tightens once: the ritual irrevocably dissolves her human boundaries. The price is visceral (perpetual half-beast existence) but paid narratively rather than dramatized in a beat of agony; still, the cost is legible. No reversal, simply deepening, sufficient for this lyric mode. Escalation is steady under Accumulative lens: each inhalation adds density until the final crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—love as trans-species, trans-death continuity—emerges through spice, scent-memory, and phoenix-fire images rather than statement. The cosmic intimacy tone risks grandiosity yet stays grounded in crushed cardamom and Korin’s rough hands. Final line’s “smiling back” reweights death from terminus to companion, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Minor drift toward abstract “infinity” keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical voice maintains coherent psychic distance; syntax lengthens under ecstasy, shortens under ritual precision, mirroring metamorphosis. Diction—“trees dreamed in amber,” “thunder lived”—stays within Lysara’s mythic sensorium without purple overload. No dialogue to test, yet voice is unmistakably individuated. One head-hop micro-slippage: “the orchard seemed to lean in” anthropomorphizes setting without POU cue, but the effect is brief and patterned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive; metaphors braid scent, light, and heartbeat without mixed logic. A few adjacent near-paraphrases (“like water, like welcome, like the arms...”) create list-loop but pass the ear test aloud. No filter-verb clusters or scaffold. One register spike: “cosmic intimacy” feels coined; tonally earned but borderline. Artifact-free in the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Beast-whisperer undergoing self-ritual to bridge death is fresh synthesis; phoenix resurrection and scented necromancy are familiar tropes but re-coded through spice trade specificity and sibling grief. The “fortune cookie” angle could feel gimmicky yet is subdued to a single line, avoiding meta-wink. Risk is moderate—lyric escalator rather than plot reversals—but the emotional conviction sells it. Not quite paradigm-shifting, hence shy of 8.5.</comment>
