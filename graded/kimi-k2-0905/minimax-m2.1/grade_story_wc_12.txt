<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Father Matthias’s investigative motive is clear and sustained, but the piece withholds any micro-choice that alters his tactics once the threshold walk begins; Gabriel remains off-page, so the priest’s interiority never meets embodied opposition. The promised “questions” never materialize as a concrete on-page beat, so the climactic step feels pre-decided rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: looping chant, tightening time, and the shrinking palette reweight the stake toward a single-color confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise––Matthias crossing the threshold with the crimson wound-image––but the absence of an actual interrogation scene keeps the cost conceptual rather than dramatized, blunting the decisive snap required for 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>St. Bartholomew’s is sketched with monkish austerity that doubles as Matthias’s tactical stripping: no bells, no candles, only stone and silence that “decorates itself.” The palette’s alizarin crimson finally charges the exit image, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the last action; spatial tracking stays clean within the single sanctuary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake––will the priest uncover the hidden contract before possession completes––tightens via the ticking watch and multiplying chant, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no renunciation or trade-off narrows Matthias’s options. Pressure crests symbolically rather than through an on-page reversal, keeping cost legible yet abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of consensual possession emerges through layered chant and the palette’s reduction to one wound-colored truth, avoiding sermon. The ending’s crimson glow reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though the absence of an answered question leaves the resonance slightly under-plumbed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres strictly to Matthias’s scholastic sensorium; syntax lengthens and compresses with the looping chant, producing a textured, priest-rhythm that never leaks into editorial exposition. Distinctive perceptual signature––“the color of the inside of a wound just beginning to heal”––carries through to the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and auricular, but three adjacent sentences beginning “The loop pedal clicked...” create a template cadence that dulls the final third; one mixed metaphor—“threads of quiet pulling apart to reveal something brighter and more terrible than absence”—muddies the sensory logic at the hinge moment. Otherwise sentences carry dual duty and the diction stays inside Matthias’s cloistered lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Exorcism via Socratic interrogation and a single-palette painter-monk feels fresh; the dimensional-anchor locale and loop-pedal liturgy synthesize medieval ritual with modern tech without gimmickry. The concept risks late abstraction, but the crimson-wound closure keeps the invention grounded and memorable.</comment>
