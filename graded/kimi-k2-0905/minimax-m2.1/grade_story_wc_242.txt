<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her ear for the tunnel’s “breathing” and the glass harmonica’s impossible light—but she never makes a visible choice under pressure; the arc is purely observational. The “cultivated estrangement” is declared, not dramatized in a beat that costs her anything. No contradictory impulse surfaces in scene; the job tenure (11 years) is backstory, not stakes-tested. Closure is a poised wait, not an earned renunciation with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ringing phone adds density to the pattern of anonymous confessions, tightening the emotional load until the final “phone rang” crystallizes Mira’s perpetual threshold stance. Orientation is nailed by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure is Charged Poise—the harmonica’s suspended note and the unanswered ring reweight her vocation as endless vigil—cost is the lifetime of absorbed grief she can never release. One soft spot: no micro-turn inside the scene; pressure accrues but never pivots her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Utility tunnel as body-extension: copper arteries, concrete lumen, the booth glass catching fluorescent spill—every detail filters through Mira’s sailor-like knowledge and constrains her to this artery. Glass harmonica serves as micro-setting, its impossible refraction charging the final image. Sensory economy is superb—sound of shifting ventilation awakens the disc, not a visual catalog. Spatial choreography immaculate; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: witnessing strangers’ endings without ever stepping through her own doorway—signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each wrong-number call layers unspent grief; the harmonica’s rising note is the tightening cadence, not a causal turn. No visible price paid on-page—she absorbs but never forfeits—so cost is conceptual, felt in the final suspended ring. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a moment where her endurance forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: anonymous caretaking as secular priesthood—endings taught to begin in darkness. Subtext lives in gesture—she never says “I’m lonely,” yet the harmonica’s infinite sustain says it. Final image reweights the premise: the phone that always rings is both grace and life sentence. No moralizing, only charged poise; ambiguity lingers like the note itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: tunnel “breathes,” streetlamps “hum to life,” harmonica “sings” at pressure shift—syntax stays inside Mira’s sensory lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long tide-sentence at opening, staccato “phone rang” at end. No dialogue, so voice remains pure filtered consciousness. Free-indirect style is immaculate; no filter-verb stacks. One hairline slip: “the way loss sounds when you have lived with it long enough…” drifts toward aphorism, but beat is saved by concrete anchor “becomes the air itself.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is tidal, sentence lengths ebbing and surring like tunnel airflow. No scaffold loops; information density high—each sentence layers job mythology + sensory cue + emotional corollary. Metaphors stay consistent (tunnel as artery, grief as frequency) without mixed vehicles. Minor adjective drift (“impossible light,” “threshold hour”) but diction stays within Mira’s poetic technician range. Closure line is pristine monosyllable: “The phone rang.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh: underground wrong-number confessional as lifelong vocation. Harmonica disc—Franklin’s madness engine turned grief antenna—feels inevitable, not quirky. Risk lies in static observation arc; piece bets everything on accumulative aura rather than event. Pays off: the endless loop becomes the horror and the benediction. Could not swap Mira with any other caretaker; her ear is singular.</comment>
