<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Yara’s synesthetic blessing gives her a concrete, character-specific way of perceiving the world, and every beat stays filtered through that lens; her interiority is vivid, never generic. Yet we get no contradictory impulse or micro-choice that visibly costs her anything—she simply follows the inherited script, so the arc feels like enactment rather than earned change. The tears that freeze are the sole embodied cost, but they arrive at the very end and read as affirmation, not sacrifice. Without a moment where her unique gift forces her to relinquish a live alternative, characterization stays competent but not transformative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds (whispered coordinates → amber sheet → bell → aurora convergence) until a single cadence shift reweights the premise. Anchors are clear by word 80; the Orientation Test is satisfied. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—wonder is “certified” and the aurora carries that charge outward—so the before/after is legible and the conceptual cost (the world’s slow cooling might now be arrested) is on the page. The only slack is that the sculptor beat is elliptical: it complicates but never intersects causally with Yara’s act, so the tightening feels atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as both backdrop and instrument: every surface becomes a vibrating bell, so the setting literally supplies the final sonic architecture. The fossilized snow altar and refracting auroral walls are handled tactilely, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean—bell, sheet, aurora, body stay tracked. Because the ice is the resonating body that delivers the certified wonder, the environment constrains and enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate; only the sculptor’s distant workshop remains a floating postcard, preventing the extra tenth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—prove wonder essential to keep the world warm—is signaled in paragraph two and held to the end. Pressure tightens once: the silent cavern “unfetters” into symphonic resonance, reweighting the hush from absence to presence; this deepening fulfills the lens. No reversal or trade-off is forced upon Yara; the beat is revelation, not decision, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Enough for strong mid-band, but without a moment where her synesthesia exacts a visible price the escalation stays poetic, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the equation of wonder with atmospheric warmth, made concrete via auroral light and bell-spectrum; no character moralizes the thesis. The amber sheet’s ancient tree-blood quietly reframes music as fossilized life, so the final ringing becomes ecological transfusion. The sculptor’s pause supplies Dramatic Irony—readers see wonder flow into him while Yara remains unaware—creating subtextual loop. Final image refrains from tidy moral; instead it re-prices the premise: wonder is heartbeat, not luxury, leaving plausible counter-readings open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays locked to Yara’s synesthetic sensorium; every noun arrives color-tagged (white-gold filament, violet dawn) without ever feeling tacked on. Rhythm swells and contracts with sonic pressure—“the sculpted hush...became something else”—demonstrating deliberate cadence control. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. The distant sculptor paragraph risks microscopic slippage, but the lens re-centers instantly; the piece reads as one sustained bell-stroke rather than stitched fragments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax, echoing the mounting overtones; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay within acoustic/light physics—filament, spectrum, resonance—so vehicles remain coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“patient conjunction,” “chromatic truth”) borders on thesaurus-adjacent but is earned by cathedral scale and does not blur causality. One mixed moment: “silence that resounded” is oxymoronic by design; context justifies it, so clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synesthesia with campanology in an ice-cathedral is a fresh synthesis; no pop-culture echo detected. The “music as fossilized sunlight” angle reweights standard eco-fantasy into geologic time, making wonder a literal renewable resource. Risk is taken with the sculptor cross-cut, but coherence holds because the beat functions as thematic resonance, not gimmick. Specificity of color-sound mapping and auroral mechanics transforms what could be abstract into lived physics, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
