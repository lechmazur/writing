<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—clinical resolve vs. sentimental ache—are dramatized in the trembling gloved hand and the refusal to look back. Sacrifice is embodied, not labeled: the map-cracks she counts are the same fissures she has carved into her own life. The final renunciation (walking away) carries visible cost: “everything that once mattered” is itemized and forfeited. Only the late, single-sentence label “simply driven” nicks the skin; it is abstract after such granular embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the egg alone on the salt flat reconfigures the entire moral universe with undeniable conceptual cost—she has engineered a sterile Eden to buy one fragile chance at song. Causal chain holds: drought → elimination of threats → release → self-exile. Time/place anchor (“the afternoon sun would warm its shell”) is precise at ~word 550, inside the 120-word window. No prop or knowledge teleports; the container is unpacked, the map is followed, the thunder lull is honored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but crucible: its reflective glare hurts her eyes, its silence silences her thoughts, its sterile crust guarantees zero predators. The egg’s translucence—veins visible inside—becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather is tactical: afternoon sun vs. night cold simulate incubation cycles she cannot perform herself. Spatial choreography is spotless; every pace is counted along the map of cracks she herself authored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo—signals early and tightens once: the manufactured drought eliminates every rival, forcing her final renunciation. Pressure is situational; no external antagonist, yet options narrow to a single release point. Cost is visible: “she walked away without looking back” forfeits control and certainty. The thunder lull acts as live clock, but the escalation beat is solitary; a second micro-turn could have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of sterile creation: to resurrect song she must first orchestrate silence. The salt flat’s white blindness mirrors her moral erasure; the egg’s translucent veins become the last possible pigment of meaning. No moralizing sentence intrudes; the final image reweights “fractured grace” as both crime and benediction. Reader is left inside the contradiction, the only honest place to land.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is steel-spined, lyric-cold: “the calculus in her eyes” condenses worldview into a noun phrase. Perceptual signature is selective—she notices cracks, veins, thermal math, not her own face in the reflection. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses under pressure (“She placed the egg gently… Then… She walked away”) without syntactic monotony. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; every verb is strong enough to carry the moral weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythms vary from long, salt-flat panoramic shots to clipped release beats. Information density is high: one sentence gives us container, continent count, insulation, synthetic warmth, extinction status. Figurative language is precise—“map beneath her boots was drawn by cracks”—and never competes with itself. Only a single adjectival stack (“manufactured drought in neighboring regions”) feels administratively dense; it passes because drought is literally manufactured by administration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit of an amoral philanthropist who terraforms drought to incubate a single extinct song is fresh, yet grounded in real water wars and de-extinction science. Specificity anchors novelty: the map is not metaphor but GPS-guided crack-counting; the incubator is not sci-fi but insulated logistics. Risky moral calculus is pursued to the bitter end—no soft reset, no sentimental rescue. If names and places were swapped the core moral machinery would still hum, but the salt-flat glare and avian song are irreplicable.</comment>
