<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—between hiding and exposure, burned identity and latent courage—grounds every beat; the pillbox hand-off crystallizes her re-awakened agency with visible cost in the final image. Micro-choices (reading snow codes, climbing open ground) tighten to the thematic question of dormant valor. The ally’s late arrival dilutes relationship-as-crucible pressure, but the primary arc sustains. Voice remains coherent under stress; no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s pillbox transfer reweights her self-definition and the wider conspiracy stake with felt conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: spiral/cross/line snow codes motivate ascent → ally appears → pillbox offered, each because/therefore link narrowing future danger. Single-scene orientation locked within 120 words, no ambiguity. Drive lens is Causal; no late ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded bluff functions as micro-setting that constrains visibility and tactics; snow drifts act as readable text that directly shapes Elena’s next move. Sensory hierarchy obeys a spy’s threat scan—wind, stone, silvered light—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography clean across precipice meeting. Weather is causative, not décor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose internal rot or perish—signaled early; escalation occurs through the decoded snow signals and the exposed meeting, each sharpening risk. Protagonist agency drives the final transfer; no coincidences resolve. One meaningful tightening suffices: open-air hand-off forecloses retreat. Cost is legible in irreversible exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resurrected courage emerges from concrete pattern: hidden codes → open risk → offered trust, never abstract assertion. Final mist-brightening image reweights “silver hush” from menace to fragile renewal. No moralizing. Subtext in silent pillbox transfer carries conspiracy weight without expositional speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—acid-burned skin, memorized cliff paths—feeds distinct diction. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences mid-scene, then compressed beats at hand-off. No filter-verb stacks. Dialogue single line carries subtext of alliance; voice stays in Elena’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; no template cadence. Every paragraph advances knowledge or tension; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (mist as shroud, wind tongues) stay internally consistent. Information density high: snow-code mechanics, bodily memory, conspiracy stakes in one beat. Closure image unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar burned-spy trope refreshed through sensory snow-cipher mechanics and “unused courage” trope reframed as dormant, not lost. Setting fused with intel craft—bluff as cipher table—feels inevitable. Risk taken by exposing protagonist on open cliff pays off. No derivative lines echo famous sources.</comment>
