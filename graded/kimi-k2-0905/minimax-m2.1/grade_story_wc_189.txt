<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s chronicler identity is concrete—she tastes the jade cicada, links tide data to emotional stakes, and her final micro-choice (placing the charm between them) re-configures the sister stasis. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic; the “warmly observant” trait shows in how she tracks water rhythm while avoiding eye contact. Flaw: the sister remains a silhouette; no contradictory impulse from her is legible, so the relationship crucible is half-forged. Still, Mira’s earned refusal-to-retreat carries visible cost in the image of warmed stone cooling between them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tidal returns, jade warmth, and star-wheel re-weights the silence until the cicada placement crystallizes Charged Poise. Closure lands—“the tide was turning”—with conceptual cost: the sisters accept an unfinished ebb rather than synthetic reconciliation. Orientation clean by line 8; no prop drift. Minor ripple: three-year gap is told not dramatized, but it doesn’t rupture causality because the present texture carries the emotional debt.</comment>

<comment>Grotto and night sky function as micro-setting: starlight on water dictates Mira’s tangent gaze, stone lip holds the cicada offering, walls echo softer speech. Sensory hierarchy obeys her chronicler bias—temperature of minerals, sound of distant tide, visual diamonds in pool—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography steady; bodies remain seated, cicada tracked in hand → floor. Setting does not constrain a tactical choice as strongly as internal stance, so it stops short of 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: can observation-without-words bridge the three-year silence? Escalation is textural—each tidal metaphor thickens the unsaid until cicada placement forces a stance crystallization; sister’s softer voice confirms narrowing options. No external antagonist needed; risk of permanent estrangement is felt. Cost is conceptual—the acceptance of partial, tidal return rather than full flood—legible in final “turning” line.</comment>

<comment>Theme of transition emerges through iterated tide-to-speech parallels; no character moralizes it. Subtext lives in gesture: cicada warmth = stored songs never fully voiced. Final image reweights grandmother’s gift from souvenir to conversation starter without thesis line. Avoids sentimentality by leaving reconciliation tidal, not certain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited anchors tightly to Mira’s perceptual bias—mineral taste, star refraction, water hush. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses at sister’s first words, matching breath rhythm. No dialogue until final two spare lines; both carry subtext (“You still collect things” = I remember who you were). Cicada and tide lexicon remain inside chronicler idiom; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: one job per sentence, no scaffold loops, strong verbs (“carved,” “shimmered,” “crystallized”). Figurative layer is dense yet patterned—every water image pays into final “tide was turning,” so density is earned. One mixed vehicle: “silence stretched…like surface of a pool” is generic, but it sits early and doesn’t recur. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long accumulation to single-clause finale; no monotony.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tide-pool chronicler + estranged sisters + cicada totem yields a non-oblique angle on forgiveness as cyclical rather than binary. Risk lies in near-static scene; lyric accumulative structure justifies it, so gamble pays off. Could swap names but not metaphor engine, keeping originality intact. No familiar trope clones detected.</comment>
