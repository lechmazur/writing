<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s pacifism is lived in her refusal to pry the clasp with metal tools and her turning instead to resonance; the interior contradiction between scientific precision and emotional need is felt in “she pressed her ear against its silver wings.” Micro-choices under pressure—dialling, listening, writing—track a hierarchy of values (preservation > possession). The final renunciation is earned: the diary opens not by brute frequency but by the exact emotional pitch of “ready to receive,” a costed stance crystallized in the closing line about spent thoughts. The only gap is that her forty-year catalog remains abstract; we are told, not shown, how any single silence once altered her tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence variety is a layer whose density peaks when the firework roar momentarily lets the clasp’s note through. Closure is a Charged Poise: the diary clicks open and Mira rewrites her own rule—silence after joy, not loss—reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3 and evolve with the firework countdown. Causality is intact: the resonator tuning leads directly to the audible note that releases the clasp; no late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The workshop under frost-glass stars functions as micro-setting: the brass resonator and moth-shaped clasp are tactile props whose proximity allows the tuning beats. Spatial choreography is clean—bench → ear against metal → outside step. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s vocation: sound first, then the red glare that paints walls. The setting charges the final image: sparks fall “like spent thoughts returning home,” reweighting the indoor silence she has just re-catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover access to her life’s catalogue without violence; secondary: confirm that empathy-through-listening still works. Pressure tightens once: the external firework countdown + the internal jammed clasp force her to hit the emotional, not merely technical, frequency. Cost is visible—she almost loses forty years of work—and the final image forecloses nostalgically hoarding silence; she steps outside to accept post-celebration quiet. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence (fireworks) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the varieties of silence are not data but lived relationships; the climax re-prices them as joy-tinged rather than loss-tinged. Subtext operates in the moth clasp—an image of fragility and transformation—whose release is legible as permission to keep listening after almost failing. The final line’s “spent thoughts returning home” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: silence is not hoarded but released. No tidy moral is asserted; the insight is earned through the specific acoustics of the scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mira’s perceptual signature: brass dial, hertz numbers, frost on glass. Rhythm swells and contracts with her tuning breaths; long sentences for catalogued silences, short clauses at the click. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—no poetic inflation beyond “theatrical sincerity” she herself might admit. Voice never leaks into fireworks or neighbours; pressure stays in her wrists and eardrums.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between speculative cadence and tactile beats; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are few, integrated, and non-contradictory: “static like snow falling on a dead television screen” is precise to her era and vocation. High information density: each sentence does two jobs—advances tuning and layers silence taxonomy. Only minor scaffold: “she understood that empathy could not be rushed” could be shown even more granularly, but it does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The conceit—listening objects open by emotional frequency rather than force—is fresh yet inevitable given her vocation. The fireworks-as-metronome is non-obvious and locally accurate: valley acoustics really do carry a percussive overtone that can mask/uncover subtler tones. The moth-shaped clasp as both lock and symbol of metamorphosis synthesizes image with function without late rule change. Risk in quiet, anti-heist tension pays off; nothing feels stitched to a prompt.</comment>
