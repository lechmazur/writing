<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “infinite patience” is shown through tactile micro-choices—coiling rope, pocketing glass—so the trait is more than label. Interiority stays concrete, but the epiphany (“he understood finally”) is declared, not dramatized with contradictory impulse, so the cost feels announced rather than paid. Still, the renunciation of immediate action for long planting is consistent and stakes a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope-and-glass reading crystallizes his vocation, foreclosing idle curiosity. Causality is Accumulative: fog, snow, and knot-pattern recognition tighten the mood until the lens flips from mystery to mandate. Cost is conceptual—he now carries the ancestral burden—but the beat is one quiet moment; a sharper physical or social price would push higher.</comment>

<comment>Dock, snow, and fulgurite are tactile and bias-filtered; the hemp knots literally guide the climactic recognition. Weather shifts (fog thickening, snow catching in hair) track the internal intensification, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining visibility and therefore choice. Spatial anchors hold; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve or lose the weavers’ code—surfaces early and tightens as fog erases the harbor, forcing attention inward. One meaningful deepening: knots change from utilitarian to script, narrowing options to “plant the code.” No external antagonist; pressure is situational and accumulative; cost is legible but internal, not externalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of inheritance-as-practice emerges through rope spirals and seed hulls, never sermonized. Final image of planned spring planting reweights the fulgurite and rope as living texts, offering a non-literal answer: memory survives only when encoded in daily labor. Ambiguity is preserved—no moral spelled out—yet resonance is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: maritime diction, seed science, and patient syntax mirror his vocation. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; rhythmic control heightens in the final paragraph without drumbeat monotony. Patterned elision (fog erasing world) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative language is selective, not stacked. One scaffold risk: “patient as the tide” / “certain as the return of light” verge on proverb, but they close the piece and echo earlier patience, so the loop feels earned rather than redundant. No filter-verb clusters; pronouns stay clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing maritime knot-lore with seed genetics feels fresh; the fulgurite-as-lens device avoids cliché by functioning as microscope rather than talisman. Risk is quietness—no twist or reversal—but the conceptual repricing is non-obvious and grows organically from chosen particulars. Transformation test passes: swap out any object and the epistemology collapses.</comment>
