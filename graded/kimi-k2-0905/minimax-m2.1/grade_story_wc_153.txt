<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradictions—fierce love vs. cowardice—are embodied in her pocketed shard and micro-choice to press the window; the self-forgiveness lands only after the shard warms and condensation answers, meeting the 9+ test. The 17-year guilt is shown, not diagnosed, and the final stance crystallizes both selves with visible cost (she stays till dawn, letter obsolete). Minor: sister remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is memory-only, capping top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “I forgive you” reweights the unsent letter and lets Maren occupy both selves—clear, felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is memory-driven, but each return of the shard/condensation tightens the emotional stake without contradiction. Orientation is swift; no prop or knowledge teleporting. One hairline slip: the window’s first message is slightly late (~140 w), just past the 120 w waiver, but it pays off at closure so penalty waived.</comment>

<comment>The mangrove roots, black water, and salt-mist spirits function as active memory archive—guiding Maren’s path and later mirroring her suspended apology. Glass window set into trunk is micro-setting that literally frames her closure. Shard’s texture and moonlight glow constrain her final ritual. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through Maren’s medium-bias: she reads currents and condensation, not tourist visuals. No spatial drift; choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release self-punishment for abandoning sister—tightens once: condensation command → shard warming → self-forgiveness reconfigures cost. Agency is attention/renunciation (she endures memory until letter becomes unnecessary). No coincidence; escalation is emotional density under Accumulative lens. Price is legible: she forfeits the fantasy of revision and accepts permanent loss while reclaiming identity. Sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges from tangible objects (shard, letter, condensation) rather than thesis. Final reweighting—“Its words had finally, impossibly, arrived”—offers non-literal answer: apology needs no delivery when self-forgiveness is embodied. Ambiguity survives: sister’s actual ghost never appears, preserving moral complexity. No closing moralizing; resonance runs through image, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction—“crooked fingers reaching for absolution,” “language of things left unsaid”—is medium-specific and rhythmic. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent (she “reads” water memories, feels shard warmth). Compression in peak beat—“she stood there for a long time”—mirrors her temporal suspension without breaking voice. Dialogue absent by design; narration carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots rose from black water like crooked fingers” does image + atmosphere + stakes in one stroke. No synonym loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective, never clotted. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for swamp, fragment (“Come back”) for spirit message—without algorithmic pattern. One near-mix: “monument to her cowardice” skirts abstraction, but immediate tactile follow (“paper had nearly torn”) grounds it. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-quest is refreshed by inverse medium: dead speak through condensation, living woman must read herself. Shard as broken courthouse gargoyle witness is specific, not gothic prop. Mangrove-as-memory-archive refigures standard swamp trope. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—pays off in resonant closure. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not derivative.</comment>
