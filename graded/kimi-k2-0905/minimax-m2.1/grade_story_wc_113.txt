<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena’s grief-anchored refusal to leave the pit is credibly rooted in eleven years of identity and the uncanny return of Marco’s handwriting; the cello case prop and her knee-deep wade to the piano show embodied risk. Yet the interior register drifts into abstract mission-speak (“instrument of its revelation”) that blurs the cost she actually pays—no irreversible loss is staged beyond wet shoes and a spectral chat. The final renunciation—walking away while the lanterns keep flickering—earns a quiet stasis, but the contradiction between “had to do” and the lack of tangible consequence keeps her arc just short of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain is legible: rising water → program bleeds → reveals cipher → Elena plays → ghost message received. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no penalty. The water-as-reveal mechanism is externally magical but internally consistent; closure is Earned Stasis—she leaves, carrying the cost of irreversible knowledge. Persistent constraint (flood destroys the physical score) shapes the final tactic and images, satisfying the 9+ quick test; only minor slack appears in mid-story exposition recaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floodwater depth is tracked beat-by-beat; gilded balconies reflected in black water and the dry piano platform constrain Elena’s path and final position. Lantern flicker supplies the sole light source, directly timing her chords and the pulsing water. The opera house’s historic weight is filtered through Elena’s professional eye, never tourist-catalog. Environment forces her choice to climb onstage and later to abandon the lanterns, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode Marco’s message before the flood destroys it—tightens once: water rises, ink bleeds, she must play now. Her agency drives escalation; she chooses to stay, wade, play, and ultimately leave. No coincidences resolve tension; the flood complicates but never rescues. Cost is conceptual (knowledge of buried secret) rather than visceral, capping entry into 8.8+ bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—music as wordless bridge between living and dead—emerges through water-activated notation, dissonant chords, and the final unstruck resonance rather than didactic statement. The concept of “spaces between” is literalized in micro-tonal intervals and the pit’s liminal architecture, reweighted when Elena exits into silence. No tidy moral is pronounced; instead, the ending image of receding floodwater transmits ambiguous responsibility. The ghost’s code lands as conceptual cost, satisfying resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person keeps psychic distance tight to Elena; perceptual signature privileges sonic and tactile detail over visual clutter. Syntax lengthens during discovery, compresses at the climb-out, mirroring emotional crest and release. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she understood”). The slight register lift in “instrument of its revelation” is the only hairline slip under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong variation in sentence length and paragraph shape; clauses carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (water as cathedral mirror). One mixed image—“water damage spread like living things…in spreading constellations”—is fleeting. Density stays high; no scaffold sentences dull the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Flood-as-reveal and ghost-encoded program fuse two familiar tropes into a fresh causal engine; the micro-tonal “intervals between keys” gives the concept musical specificity. Risk-taking is moderate but successful—disaster becomes seance without breaking plausibility because the magic is confined to ink chemistry. The premise could only occur in this drowned opera house with this cellist, passing the transformation test.</comment>
