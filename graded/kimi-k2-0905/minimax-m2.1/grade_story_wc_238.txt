<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleanor’s fear-of-failure silence is embodied in the throat-tangle of “loosened strings,” and the apology is a credible renunciation that costs her the last seconds of contact; the six-year avoidance is stated rather than dramatized, so the interior contradiction feels slightly second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: perfume cue → archive descent → flickering contact → apology → timed cutoff; the “imperfect miracle” current is externally supplied but accepted as premise, and the final “sharp, clean break” image pays the cost under a Resonant Reconfiguration lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orchard roar and violet-glass glint are filtered through Eleanor’s guilt-narrowed attention; the sheet-music folders as “letters never sent” charge the final silence, though spatial anchoring inside the basement is skimmed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—deliver apology before chainsaws—tightens when the current flickers and the apology becomes the last possible act; the cost (permanent disconnect) is legible in Margot’s dissolve and the falling tree.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvage after ruin emerges from the aborted symphony and the orchard’s felling; the perfume’s garden-ghost reweights “belonging” without moralizing, though the sisters’ shared history is sketched more than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical compression (“gossip-column exorcist,” “electrical hum of something trying to bridge”) teaches its cadence early; perceptual signature stays consistent, and the static-laced dialogue differentiates Margot’s voice without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative layering is dense but patterned, never clogging the final image; “chainsaws cough” and “loosened strings” are precise, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “gossip-column exorcist” who chronicles the dead’s unfinished scandals is a fresh angle on after-life contact; merging it with a dying orchard and half-written symphony synthesizes tropes into a singular emotional engine.</comment>
