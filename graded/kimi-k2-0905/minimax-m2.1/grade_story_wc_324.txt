<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena’s grief-work expertise is vivid, but her interior contradiction—professional skepticism vs. need to believe—stays summarized; we never see a micro-choice that costs her. The final run to the atrium is action without visible trade-off or risk, so the “heroism” feels attributed, not earned. Vera’s single beat of handing over the aid is poignant yet purely functional; no secondary pressure complicates Elena. Closure hinges on hearing the message, not on Elena paying a price for transmitting it, so the change is Vera’s, not the protagonist’s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dead don’t need answers, only witnesses—an insight that reweights Elena’s job. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (pulse → whisper → location) tightens the stake rather than forcing external turns. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. The cost is present yet diffuse (Elena’s worldview shifts), so the beat satisfies the 9+ quick test only partially.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mist, mercury glass, and the hearing-aid-as-micro-setting constrain visibility and acoustics, shaping how Elena listens and moves. Sensory selection favors hush and mercury reflections that mirror the “spaces between beats,” integrating atmosphere with theme. The atrium’s spatial logic tracks cleanly across the final exit. Environment does not alter tactics in the climax, capping entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elena locate a voice for Vera?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: static → pulse → whisper → location, each layer raising emotional cost. No reversal or trade-off is demanded of Elena; she listens, then runs. Because agency is observational, the tightening is felt more than chosen, keeping the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: grief’s true need is not explanation but accompaniment. Subtext lives in the hearing-aid’s impossible persistence and the final line about “threads that simply need following.” No moral is stated; the reweighting is imagistic. A hair of sentiment lingers in “some heroes never intended to be heroic,” slightly diluting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s perceptual filter—ink-pool shadows, moth-wing pulse. Syntax lengthens and softens during listening beats, then fragments in the run, mirroring attention. No head-hopping or register drift. Voice is consistent but not yet idiosyncratic enough to breach the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; most sentences do two jobs. Occasional lyric uplift (“shadows pooled like spilled ink”) risks prettiness yet serves mood. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. A few adjectival stacks (“impossible lightness,” “gray silence”) slightly dilute peak clarity, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” is a fresh occupation that reframes grief-work as forensic listening. The heartbeat-in-hearing-aid device fuses tech and haunt without exposition dumps. The concept commits fully; no late rule changes. While the trope of the liminal hour is familiar, the specificity of auditory relics gives the piece memorable lift.</comment>
