<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The registrar’s patience and belief in “presence itself” are credibly grounded; the choice to draw in the final beat visibly costs him his detachment. Interiority is character-specific (“ambiguously clear” worldview). The micro-choice to return Mira’s ticket/hand-touch is earned, but the prior beats are mostly receptive—he watches, pockets, polishes—so the decisive shift feels late. Still, the arc from passive keeper to active participant lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored symbols (ticket doodles, lens, crystal walls) tightens toward the hand-touch that refracts trust across the forecourt. Closure is Charged Poise—registrar’s first drawn reply crystallizes new possibility while the approaching crowd refracts stakes. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. Cost is legible: the ledger remains wordless, the registrar’s anonymity forfeited.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt, rain-beaded glass, and smudged projector lens supply tactile, selective detail filtered through registrar’s “ambiguously clear” bias. Micro-setting (counter, ticket surface) constrains the only physical action—hand-touch. Objects (ledger, lens, doodles) carry plot function; their states change (lens “heavier,” ticket gifted). Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Environment does not merely mirror mood—it enables the new communicative order.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can transparency survive once words fail? Escalation is textural—each symbol (Mira’s circles/line, registrar’s mirror-in-mirror) deepens density until the hand-touch refracts trust into communal possibility. No reversal, but one meaningful tightening: registrar shifts from observer to responder, costing anonymity. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; cost visible in final crowd advance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—“honesty freed from calculated words”—emerges through image chain (smudged lens, doodles, mirror recursion) rather than statement. Subtext resides in gesture: hand-touch > any symbol. Final image of registrar drawing for the first time reweights premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will images corrode like words did? Complexity upheld.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: glassy surfaces, light refractions, held breath. Syntax lengthens in reflection, shortens at hand-touch. No dialogue; no head-hop. Filter verbs serve voice (“I watched,” “I understood”). Diction stays within registrar’s quiet, custodial lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm modulates with emotional crest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with shifting parts. Figurative language is selective—“water droplets like held tears” appears once, not stacked. No loops, no scaffold. Strong verbs (“trembling,” “cutting,” “squeezed”) and concrete nouns. One paraphrase risk: “transparency” repeated three times in close succession, but each use shifts context, so momentum holds. Closure line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-linguistic dystopia via concert-ticket iconography feels specific rather than trope-rehash. The projector-lens heirloom and “ambiguously clear” motif offer fresh inflection. Conceptual risk—story without spoken words—pays off in legible closure. Could swap crystal forecourt for another glass architecture, so setting specificity is slightly soft, but overall synthesis is memorable.</comment>
