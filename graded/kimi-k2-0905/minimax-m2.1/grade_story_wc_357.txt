<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cora’s curiosity-as-hunger is vivid, embodied in the opening palm-on-glass beat and the irreversible decision to touch the arrow. Interiority stays specific and contradictory: wonder v. fiduciary duty, pilot competence v. superstitious certainty. The final renunciation lands with visible cost—she seals the viewport on profit and carries silence instead—earned by the prior tactile vision of accelerated decay. Only the “eleven seasons” résumé line feels résumé-flat amid otherwise taut micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ascending water, hanging foliage, bell-grind of stone) deepens stakes without causal zig-zags until the arrow bloom compresses time. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrow stays, her knowledge leaves, cost crystallized in “second skin” and “ordinary miracle.” No orientation drift; who/where/when settled by line 4. One micro-scaffold: “She would leave...as the others had done” states the choice just after dramatized clasp—minor but visible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, braided water currents, and porous stone are not backdrop—they pilot the ship: she “guides the small craft by the ascending water flows.” Ironwood tree becomes micro-setting that literally hosts the arrow key. Sensory triangulation (violet haze, crystalline question-mark water, bell-grind of stone) is filtered through pilot priorities, never tourist catalog. Final anchoring of “ordinary sounds” reweights the miraculous into lived environment, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“source of resilience”—signaled early and sharpened by inversion hourglass. Agency manifests in tactile choice: reaching through viewport to seize glowing arrow; stakes tighten when bloom shows planetary self-healing she could commodify. Escalation is accumulative: each surreal image ups the temptation until renunciation forecloses profit. Cost is visible: she swallows the secret, alone, while Kestrel descends empty-handed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—resilience as shared guardianship—emerges through echo chorus, never declared. Broken weapon re-seeded as life-key reframes violence into caretaking; her refusal to extract it literalizes the theme. Final smile at “ordinary miracle” reweights earlier wonder/hunger dichotomy without moralizing. Subtext of collective stewardship vs. solo profit lingers in the hush after bells fade.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Cora’s perceptual filter: pilot jargon, botanical precision, synesthetic metaphors (“pressure in her teeth”). Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments during time-bloom, then levels for stoic renunciation. No dialogue, so voice carries all melodic cargo; diction stays within her cockpit lexicon. The whirling silence is heard through her bones, not explained—pure perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence variety is deliberate: long aerial coils for drift, staccato bursts for bloom eruption. Mixed metaphors are functional (water as clasped hands, stone as ribs) because unified by pilot-body scale. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Only nit: “crystal-line question marks” edges cute, but image justifies itself by sync with inversion logic and is never repeated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gravitic inversion orchard is fresh, yet core surprise is systemic: ecosystem weaponized into renewal kit. Arrow-as-fountain flips colonizer trope into stewardship test. Risk of surreal gravity planet is fully committed to, not decorative. Could not swap setting without collapsing causal chain—water navigation, bloom acceleration, echo guardianship all depend on this exact physics.</comment>
