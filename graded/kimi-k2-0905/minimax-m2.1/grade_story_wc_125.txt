<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s “ethically playful” streak is shown only in back-story summary; the grotto scene itself gives her no boundary to test, so interior contradiction stays theoretical. The final renunciation is credible because the rope’s glow externalizes the cost, but the beat is one beat too quiet—no micro-choice inside the moment that dramatizes the loss of either option. Still, her voice is specific enough to lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the restarted spiral makes the refusal legible and the rope’s new luminescence carries felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each spiral layer deepens the stake rather than causing a new external event. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. The only drag is a 40-word reflective block that recaps prison back-story already implied; it slightly dilutes the final tightening.</comment>

<comment>Terra-cotta dust, starlight cracks, and the pool’s mirrored silver are filtered through Mira’s pattern-seeking eye, so every sensory note doubles as epistemic tool. The rope’s fibers literally constrain her hand placement while drawing, satisfying the 9+ gate. One clause (“rust-colored clay that once lined the roads”) drifts into tourist-brochure diction, but the glitch is microscopic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“stay human observer or merge”—is signaled early and tightens once: the rope’s glow signals the invitation is expiring. Under the Accumulative lens the deepening is sufficient; no extra reversals required. Cost is visible (glow, restarted spiral) but not yet viscerally painful, so the beat stops just short of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the spiral’s refusal: translation itself becomes the last human art. No character states the moral; the final image reweights the premise by showing that choosing to describe is still a form of participation. The energy beings remain unknowable, preserving productive ambiguity. One stray sentence (“freedom was not the absence of walls…”) edges toward aphorism but is saved by the tactile context of the rope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder, adopting her poet’s synesthesia (“starlight… like something alive”) without ever breaking filter. Syntax lengthens under contemplative pressure, then snaps into the short final clause “by beginning the pattern again,” mirroring the spiral. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on perceptual signature alone—and succeeds. The only minor slip is one adjective pile-up (“rough and patient warmth”) that momentarily softens the verb drive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric but information-dense: each sentence layers physical detail and conceptual stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (starlight as thread, time as texture) and never stall momentum. One paraphrase loop (“pattern… spiral… pattern”) is forgiven because the repetition is the point. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift in the final third—clears the 9+ hygiene bar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The post-human invitation framed as a poet’s metadata dilemma feels fresh; the spiral-as-cognitive-map device turns a familiar transcendence trope into concrete ritual. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot—but the piece commits fully. A half-point deduction because the energy beings themselves remain generic luminous entities rather than a specificity we couldn’t swap out.</comment>
