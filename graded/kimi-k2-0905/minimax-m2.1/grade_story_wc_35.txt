<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Miriam’s interior contradiction—needing to unload centuries of grief yet refusing to swallow it herself—is dramatized in the embodied act of cooking against coral. The micro-choice to serve an empty room a tagine of reconciliation shows her hierarchy of values at cost. Closure’s “sturdy brittle” fatigue is legible payment. Dialogue is absent, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; solo POV baseline met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens: each coral contact and counter-dish thickens texture until the final exhausted sunrise reweights meaning. Orientation is immediate; the pavilion’s logic is taught through tactile discovery rather than exposition. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pavilion lighter, Miriam cracked, cost felt in “sturdy brittle.” Persistent constraint—the gift that once isolated her now depleted her—shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ice-coral architecture, lamb-apricot steam, and moonlight liquid all filter through a chef’s sensory hierarchy; no tourist catalog. The pavilion’s tidal grief basins and honey-cake forgiveness function as micro-setting objects that literally absorb and reweight emotion, constraining her tactical choices beat-to-beat. Spatial choreography is clean across the three-day ritual. Final rust-gold sunrise recharges the coral palette, crystallizing the cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: survive the pavilion’s remorse without being subsumed. Escalation is textural—each coral touch swells the emotional load until the counter-cooking must match intensity. One meaningful tightening: when she realizes she can “smooth” rather than absorb, options narrow to three days of ritual endurance. Cost is visible in the closing “sturdy brittle” fragility; no coincidence is used to resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme of compassionate metabolization emerges through specific culinary-ritual acts rather than assertion. The coral-as-palimpsest image and the final sunrise reconfigure meaning without moralizing: sorrow is not erased but sanded to endurance. Ambiguity remains—she is both stronger and cracked—inviting reflection beyond the page. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Miriam’s synesthetic palate; perceptual signature is consistent (“taste memories in food—not metaphorically, but literally”). Compression taught early (“thirty years reading flavors”) licenses lyric density later. Free-indirect diction (“she had learned better than that”) remains within chef lexicon; no head-hopping. Rhythm accelerates under coral contact pressure, then exhales at sunrise closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned—culinary and marine metaphors interweave without mixed clashes. High information density: one sentence often performs sensory, emotional, and world-rule work. One paraphrase loop detected (“each formation a memory made solid… stored remorse”) costs −0.2; artifact does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef + coral remorse-repository is a fresh synthesis; trope of empathic absorption is retooled through gastronomic counter-emotion rather than passive suffering. Tidal pool analysis repurposed as grief cartography feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky architectural premise (ice palace under desert) is justified by internal logic and pays off in tactile ritual. Transformation test passes: story collapses without chef-specific craft.</comment>
