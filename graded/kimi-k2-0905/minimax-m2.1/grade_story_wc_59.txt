<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and character-specific (“colder brass railing… nostalgia”), but the prince’s shift from destroyer to integrator is confessed rather than dramatized: “he understood at last” tells the reversal. The egg warms in his hands—nice embodied cue—but no micro-choice on the page actually risks or costs him anything. Still, the contradiction between filial duty and emergent compassion is felt throughout, keeping him above the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the egg’s golden instructions reprice the mission from sabotage to synthesis, cost is the foreclosed path of easy tyrannicide. Causal chain holds—journey → chamber → decode → new purpose—though the “assemble” beat is retrospective summary rather than on-page effort. One transition (journey to chamber) is clean; orientation is anchored by word 80. Meets lens test (Causal) without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Suspended palace, rusted chandeliers, and copper-scented air are filtered through the prince’s fatigue; every descriptor tilts toward loss. The egg’s sky-blue remnant is a micro-setting that literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is secure—rails, sarcophagi, dome—guiding his movement to the last sealed chamber. Selective sensory economy keeps momentum while layering tonal bitterness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty or end the machine”—is signaled early and tightens when the egg reveals symbiosis instructions, foreclosing the kill-switch option. Pressure is coherent but single-stage; no new obstacle after entry, only revelation. Cost is conceptual (inheritance of integrator’s burden) rather than visceral, capping entry below 8.8. Still, the shift is protagonist-driven and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the egg’s repricing: survival may require mechanical partnership rather than purity. No moralizing line states this; the stained-glass birds and mechanical songbird accumulate into the final symbiosis image. Bittersweet ache persists—beauty will never be natural again—creating plausible ambiguity. The concept integrates with the prince’s filial conflict, avoiding abstract sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is elegiac, synesthetic (“air tasted of copper and nostalgia”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under discovery, mirroring pulse. No dialogue to test, yet narrative voice carries subtextual regret. Diction stays within royal-educated lexicon without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences pivot on semicolons and em-dashes to create cadence breath. Occasional adjective stacks (“mechanical flowers frozen mid-bloom”) flirt with excess but serve wonder. One paraphrase loop: “hypothesizing about everything” is repeated twice without new angle. No mixed metaphors; closure line is clean. Density is high—most lines perform double duty—keeping the piece above 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Post-subterranean extinct-egg premise feels fresh, yet the “ruin-quest-revelation” arc is archetypal; specificity of copper-wing butterfly and fossilized sky-blue shell transforms trope. Integration of Genesis Engine as preservation-vessel rather than villain offers non-obvious moral calculus. Risk is moderate—lyric exposition over action—but coherence rewards the gamble. Could notswap egg for any McGuffin; its color and warmth rewire theme.</comment>
