<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her brushstrokes sync to echo-rhythms, the coin burns in her pocket—but the climactic “conversation” is more asserted than embodied; we’re told she now “completes” the dialogue rather than shown a final, costly micro-choice that seals her renunciation of certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s acoustical rule-set is repriced—restoration becomes co-authorship—and the cost is felt in her relinquished certainty; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first echo to final brush-lift without lapse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parabolic stone, seven-fold echo, and hobo nickel are inseparable from Elena’s shifting tactics; the coin’s weight in her palm literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore vs. co-create—tightens once the coin reweights the acoustics; escalation is textural (density of echoes) rather than causal, but a visible price is paid when she abandons her original certainty, foreclosing the “fill-the-gaps” path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of receptive creation emerges through echoed sound and paint layers; no moralizing, only the final image of brush held in charged pause, inviting reader to hear the unfinished chord.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric, textured third-person stays close to Elena’s perceptual filter; syntax lengthens and contracts with echo-durations, sustaining a singular rhythmic signature without scaffold.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; only minor loop—“seventeen years restoring murals, painting color…”—and one mixed metaphor (“like light bending through water” beside “ripple back”) keep it from 9+.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Acoustical architecture + Depression-era hobo nickel + fresco restoration yields a fresh synthesis; the garden’s echo-curve and the coin’s carved violinist feel inevitable in hindsight, not ornamental.</comment>
