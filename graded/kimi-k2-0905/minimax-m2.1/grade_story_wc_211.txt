<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Seraphine’s interior contradiction—relishing silence yet yearning to refill it—peaks when she literally presses memory to skin; embodied cost (temple pressure) is subtle but present. Micro-choice lineage is clear: climb, settle, press, remain. Earned renunciation of ordinary sound-archive work for a covenant with the dead satisfies 9+ test, though emotional palette stays within “velvet disquiet” without deeper body shock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the dead keep their word” reweights the foghorn’s silence with felt archival responsibility; the cost is the scribe’s acceptance of permanent listening. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—each sensory layer (wax, orchard, languages) densifies until meaning flips. No causality break; BRR at ~25% is interleaved with present micro-choices and cues, so no cap applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orchard-as-micro-setting constrains her posture (“settled herself among the roots”) and supplies the final olfactory cue (“smelled of salt”). Specificity is selective—gnarled apple, brass tower, amber wax—filtered through archivist priorities. Spatial tracking is tight for single-POV rooftop perch. Environment’s role in charging the final image is clear, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hearing the promised oath—tightens when silence becomes mandatory; the only option left is receptivity. One decisive intensification: pressing wax to temple forecloses passive nostalgia and opens floodgate of dead voices; price is lifelong vigilance. Agency is attention-based rather than action-heavy—appropriate to lens but softens visible cost compared to physical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-contract emerges through concrete events: obsolete foghorn, child’s recording, tablets nobody remembers. Final line gives non-literal answer—smile charged with “velvet disquiet”—showing covenant accepted without moral. Subtextual irony: technology dies so ancient voices live. No thematic echo or moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly elevated diction stays within a philologist’s plausible lexicon; rhythm lengthens during immersion then snaps to short final sentence for poise. Perceptual signature—“silence like pressure behind her eyes”—is character-specific. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Compression (“expectation悬在半空”) is taught early enough to feel purposeful rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from measured opening to breathless accumulation without template cadence. Figurative layer (“amber light through a window left ajar”) is controlled to one per beat, avoiding overwrite penalty. One scaffold paraphrase loop (“backward through…backward through…”) is minor and thematically apt, not obscuring closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of rooftop orchard, defunct foghorn, and archival wax feels fresh and inseparable from this character. Prophecy trope is inverted—fulfillment requires listening, not heroic action. Specific detail (Ugaritic, Linear B) prevents generic “ancient voice” cliché. Slight risk in lyric compression pays off; synthesis seems inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
