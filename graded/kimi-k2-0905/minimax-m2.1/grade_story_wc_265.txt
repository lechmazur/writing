<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cyrus’s interiority is lyrical but consistent; the “hum of insight” gives his perceptions a concrete signature. Yet he never makes a micro-choice that risks anything—the gear is received, the doorway simply opens—so the change feels bestowed rather than earned. Cost is aesthetic, not personal. Voice remains coherent, but passivity caps the arc at “strong,” not exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each morning’s new clearing and gear incrementally deepen pattern until the final resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Transitions across sleeps are legible via repeated cue (“different clearing,” “small gear”). Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—no “back to return to.” One beat could tighten causal linkage (why this gear now?), but the pattern pays off cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest is rendered with tactile specificity—brass teeth, rusted springs, tin leaves singing minor key—each detail filtered through Cyrus’s philosophical attention. The sonic hierarchy (“aspen aluminum, oak iron”) becomes the tool that predicts and then unlocks the tangle, so environment actively shapes tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays exact; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes—reconcile externalized mind-jungle—are declared early. Pressure escalates texturally: vines thicken, rust accumulates, melody darkens. Yet Cyrus never confronts an irreversible trade-off; the tangle parts once the gear is merely placed. Escalation is atmospheric, not agentive, keeping tension vivid but below the 8-band threshold where cost visibly forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual externalization emerges through iterative images rather than statement. Final doorway reweights prior gear and forest motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity—“probable miracles”—lingers as lived paradox, not abstraction. Could sharpen subtext in one beat showing what insight costs him bodily, but resonance is solidly earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to Cyrus’s sensorium: philosophical diction, musical metaphors, rhythmic cadence that mirrors the hum. Syntax stretches under pressure (“the wild frontier of his mind was here, was everywhere…”) without losing clarity. No head-hop; distance stable. Distinctive texture sustains throughout, cresting in the final luminous sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Varied sentence rhythm, high information density, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is dense but patterned (musical/ metallurgical) and taught early, so payoff justifies presence. One clause (“questions themselves had grown teeth and memory”) verges on overgrowth yet fits the POV. Clean copy; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consciousness-as-mechanical-jungle is fresh, fully committed, and extrapolated to sensory detail (tin leaves singing minor key). Synthesizes Calvino-esque material thought with new sonic keyhole. The risk—lyric stasis—nearly occurs, but final reconfiguration avoids mere prettiness. Specificity makes the concept inseparable from this narrative; swap metals and the story collapses.</comment>
