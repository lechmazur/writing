<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “small smile” and palm-pressed chart show embodied contradiction—but the text never forces her to choose between exposure and safety; the final stitch is still observational, so renunciation cost is only implicit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new thread crystallizes her stance to carry stories forward, cost legible in “echoed silence” and frost already forming; lens holds Accumulative with pattern taught early and deepening cadence at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory, eternal candle, and raised stitching function as micro-setting that constrain her method and charge the final image; autumn frost reweights the stake by literalizing time running out—no other location could supply this.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—record truth before coup—tightens once: from reading charts to actively stitching “what could be,” foreclosing her invisibility; price is felt in the candle-lit exposure and frost, though no external obstacle confronts her on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—silenced histories embroidered into light—emerges through constellation-as-archive and final thread of possibility; no moral is stated, only the crystallized image of stories pressing against glass, inviting reflection on who gets remembered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric, textile-saturated diction (“silver filament,” “whispered secrets”) stays inside Elara’s perceptual signature; rhythm modulates from languid cataloguing to the clipped final stitch, teaching the pattern and paying it off without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density—almost every sentence layers metaphor with causal information; occasional ornamental clustering (“echoed silence...voices...suppressed...buried”) barely nicks clarity, never touches the final beat, momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Spy-story trope flipped: embroidery as espionage, candle-flame as metadata reader; specificity of stitched constellations encoding lost testimony feels inevitable, not gimmicky, because every image is routed through Elara’s tactile POV.</comment>
