<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective love vs. self-protective refusal—play out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, placing the tooth). The final renunciation (refusing to ID the body) costs her societal closure yet is fully earned via the luminescent constellation image. Interiority stays concrete, though one moment of therapy-speak (“cleft in certainty”) nicks perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the tooth’s glow reweights meaning rather than triggering causal turns. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no orientation debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—constellation pattern charges the prior maternal fracture with undeniable conceptual cost. One ellipsis could be tighter, but closure is intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden, fountain, and tooth as micro-setting constrain every move; the hedge literally funnels her to the basin. Sensory triage (cold stone, calendula scent) mirrors internal thaw. Spatial choreography is clean; Triton statue recurs to mark stillness. Environment charges the final image—constellations projected onto stone—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she convert eighteen years of maternal fracture into something the replacement child can carry? Pressure tightens once via the tooth’s activation—no reversal, but options reconfigure. Cost is felt: she forfeits official “resolution.” Agency drives the final stance; coincidence is absent. Enough for 8+ but lacks a second pressure spike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern, not statement: bones set poorly remember injury—constellations remap fracture into navigation. The ending refuses moral binaries, offering charged poise instead of lesson. Subtext in “unwanted returned letter” body quietly reweights bureaucratic indifference. One abstract noun cluster (“conceptual repricing”) is avoided on-page, preserving resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinction: morally serious but lyrical register, controlled long sentences that breathe with maternal reckoning. Perceptual signature filters every detail through bone-setting memory. No dialogue, so voice carries all; rhythmic rise to the laugh line is earned. Filter verbs appear twice but are voice-motivated; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences perform the slow kneel then star-burst lift. Information density high—each line does two jobs (setting + memory). One paraphrase loop (“never quite...never fully”) is minor. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Artifacts do not touch closure, keeping 8+ viable.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fae-changeling trope is inverted: maternal love for the replacement becomes the heroic struggle. Constellation re-mapping of a baby tooth feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking lies in quiet lyric refusal of plot violence; coherence never wavers. Small deduction for familiar ministry bureaucracy backdrop.</comment>
