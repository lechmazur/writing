<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—palming the phonograph to “read” reversed sound, the hush-filament turning from wall to door. The passage from numbness to somatic re-awakening is embodied beat by beat; the final resolve to teach others is earned and carries visible cost (her lifetime of normal hearing is gone). Koren remains functional, but his silent guidance is consistent with mythic mentor brief. No epiphany clichés; the emotional arc scales to word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken needle/filament of hush crystallise into a new sensory grammar, cost is felt (“she would never hear the way she once had”). Causal chain intact: deafness → seek Koren → backward phonograph → somatic enthrall → re-steering life. Orientation anchored by 120 words, single scene, one transition-free arc; speculative backward-sound rule taught early and paid off. No causal or continuity breaks; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cavern is vivid but never catalogued: skins hanging like “graceful rows,” light filtering through stone cracks, phonograph wood warming under palm—all filter through Maren’s tactile bias. The drum-maker’s space actively supplies the reversed-sound tool that enables the final reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift. Selective sensory detail mirrors her silent world, reinforcing rather than decorating action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“defeat emotional numbness”—signalled in first paragraph; each reversed song tightens the possibility of feeling until the filament “sings,” a meaningful cadence shift. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal: density of somatic vibrations replaces rising external stakes, appropriate to lyric lens. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure coherent. Cost legible on-page at climax; viable for 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as sovereign medium rather than privation. The payoff image—“the filament…sang, in a language she was only beginning to learn”—reweights every earlier hush reference with conceptual cost. No moralising, no binary sentiment. Subtext of bodily listening versus auricular runs quietly through tactile beats. Complexity maintained; ambiguity feels purposeful rather than evasive.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Maren’s perceptual gear: tactile metaphors predominate, verbs like “coax,” “chip away,” syntax breathes with her slow re-awakening. Lyric elevation stays within a music-teacher’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; narrative voice keeps rhythmic variation under pressure. POV stable; no filter-verb stacks. Distinctive perceptual signature evident (“architecture of her silenced world”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense, doubling duty: “time seemed to pool rather than pass” seeds cavern stasis and emotional stagnation. Occasional poetic compression (“the air itself felt audibly muted”) is earned by pattern. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with crank-winding and vibration surges. A single scaffold cliché—“like a tide receding from shore”—is minor. Closure sentence clean; no figurative muddle touching final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise flips familiar disability/recovery arc: music consumed backwards through bone conduction offers non-obvious sensory logic. Broken needle as enabler rather than impediment reframes defect into gift without therapeutic platitude. Accumulated tactilebeats create fresh pedagogy of silence. Risk-taking is coherent, not gimmicky; speculative rule fully committed to. Could not swap element without collapsing mechanism. Hindsight inevitability achieved.</comment>
