<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Interiority is rich—“holding became the pause itself” is a character-specific epiphany—but the only micro-choice on-page is listing another advert; no contradictory impulse or embodied cost appears. Motivation is declared, not dramatised under pressure; hence the arc feels observed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“time is the space between breaths”—with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the lens. However, the beat is delivered in exposition, not dramatised action; causality between fragment-handling and insight is weak, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Emerald silo equations and green-glass light recur, charging the final image; the fragment itself acts as micro-setting that “does not age,” constraining her perception. Selective sensory detail stays filtered through POV bias—equations “twisting into new shapes” mirrors her cognitive loop—without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stake—“understand the texture of time”—is clear early; pressure tightens once when she writes a final listing and comprehension “settles into her chest.” Yet the tightening is delivered as summary, not a choice that forecloses an option; cost is conceptual, not visibly paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the reweighted fragment: measurement versus felt experience. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralising—“the silo humming its low frequency hum that was less sound than feeling”—offering resonant ambiguity grounded in specific objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a distinctive lyric cadence—“numbers stopped meaning what they used to”—taught early and held consistently. Perceptual signature is biased toward temporal synaesthesia; syntax lengthens and compresses with contemplative pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; ellipses are legible and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; sentences avoid template cadence. Occasional stacked modifiers—“emerald and eternal, holding its broken treasures”—stop short of purple; no loops or scaffold obscure causality. High information density; each sentence advances atmosphere or insight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Combines time-ruin sanctuary, fragmented urn, and cryptic classified ads into a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Could edge higher with a more visceral final cost.</comment>
