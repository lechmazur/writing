<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s interior contradiction—needing isolation yet suffocating inside it—is embodied in her handling of the ring and the final step outward; the micro-choice to open the door is earned. However, the “former self” apparition functions more as thematic mirror than second character, so status/relationship pressure is absent and the arc is largely monologue. Still, the renunciation of absolute withdrawal carries visible cost as the sanctuary walls crumble. Voice stays coherent, though a few abstract labels (“slow suffocation”) slightly dilute embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the decisive act of stepping through the threshold reconfigures her options and is charged by the fading boundary and cold ring—cost is felt. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each image (ash, clasped hands, gasping double) tightens the density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; who/where/when is anchored within 60 words. One minor loop—“sanctuary…sanctuary”—does not touch the final beat, so the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The charcoal sanctuary functions as micro-setting: its crumbling wall literally enables the final exit and constrains earlier stasis. Sensory triad—cold brass, starlight, ash taste—filters through the keeper’s bias toward thresholds. Spatial choreography is clean: ring found, wall touched, door opened. The environment’s decay mirrors internal pressure without overt symbolism, and the final starlight recharges the opening “burned bridge” image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breath vs. isolation—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the apparition dramatizes suffocation inside the same sanctuary once deemed safe. The keeper’s agency drives the single reversal: she chooses to maintain the threshold rather than let it vanish, stepping out. Cost is legible—loss of hermetic peace, exposure to the world. No external coincidence; pressure is purely situational and accumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ash-to-starlight progression: thresholds must be tended, not abolished. Subtext lives in gesture—clasped hands of the ring versus the keeper’s final unclenched step. No moralizing line tells the lesson; the image of crossing a door made from former burns reweights the premise. Ambiguity remains: return may still kill her, but stasis certainly will—complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the keeper’s perceptual signature—ash, bruise-colored brass, starlight “suffocating breath.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures in the final clause to mimic the threshold breach. No head-hopping; the apparition is read solely through the keeper’s interpretation. Register never drifts into academic abstraction; diction stays elemental and tactile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from measured cataloguing of ash layers to the short release of “She did not resist.” Figurative density is high but patterned—bridge, burn, breath—teaching the reader early. One scaffold pair (“she had learned that love could suffocate…”) is strategic summary, not loop. No mixed metaphors; bruise-colored brass and gasping double remain coherent. Final line lands with propulsive snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “shadow keeper who tends her own burned bridges” premise reframes boundary-setting as ecological maintenance rather than mere self-care slogan. Using a doorknocker shaped like clasped hands to re-teach connection is fresh, yet inevitable given the bridge fire. Risky lyric compression is sustained without losing clarity. While echoes of “burn bridges” idiom exist, the ash-to-starlight reconfiguration transforms the cliché into lived ritual.</comment>
