<comment>Elara’s compulsive honesty is the one trait that actually pressures her choices (she can’t soft-pedal the truth to the city), and the moment she admits “they won’t believe me” while holding the riddle shows interior conflict on the page. Mira functions as a catalyst rather than a crucible; the child’s dialogue is too adult and neatly diagnostic (“You preserve wonder in routine”) so relationship pressure reads authored, not earned. The final micro-choice—reading the riddle aloud atop the tower—directly grows from her trait and visibly changes the city’s energy flow, paying the cost of public exposure that her candor makes unavoidable.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the riddle read aloud re-weights the entire premise, making wonder the new grid-fuel while the cost—Elara must now preach what she used to merely record—lands in the final image of drones stirring. Causal chain is clean: blackout → Mira arrives → matchbox riddle → tower reading → grid flickers. Orientation anchors by line 3, and the drone-beehive rule set stays consistent. Only nit: “the revelation came not as a sudden flash but as a slow dawn” tells the turn instead of letting the humming air dramatize it, a minor softening just outside the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>Copper spire, internal threads, and the cracked central reservoir are tactile, choice-relevant details; the tower’s silence after the climb directly mirrors Elara’s fear of being unheard. “Nectar dusk” risks lyric cliché but is saved by the mother-of-pearl box that catches the same honey-violet light, turning sky color into object gleam, a nice convergence. Spatial choreography holds: booth → stairs → reservoir apex, bodies never float. World rule (bottled atmosphere as currency) is learned through weighing action, not lecture, satisfying economy bias.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—keep the city alight—tightens when the reservoir cracks; the secondary personal stake—Elara’s credibility—collides when she realizes only her truthfulness can rekindle wonder. One meaningful escalation: reading the riddle shifts the locus of energy from harvested static to visible awe, foreclosing her anonymity. Cost is legible: drones stir, but she must now become a public “preacher” her former self would have feared. Agency is present; no coincidences resolve the blackout.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Wonder as civic utility emerges organically from the failing mechanic of drone-collected lightning, never sermonized until the final riddle, which itself is a performative act rather than an authorial footnote. The matchbox reframes every prior weighed jar as a missed deposit of awe, a clean conceptual repricing. Theme resists moral binaries: the city isn’t evil, just depleted; Elara isn’t savior, just the only one who can’t lie about the fix. Final image of lights flickering on offers quiet resonance without tidy uplift.</comment>

<comment>Third-person keeps unobtrusive distance, but the diction—“copper spire tarnished by decades of storms,” “bile of truth”—carries Elara’s understated awe. Sentence rhythm lengthens during reflection then shortens on the stairs climb, mirroring breath. Mira’s speech is the lone voice leak: seven-year-old diction should fracture grammar, yet she delivers thesis lines intact. Otherwise perceptual signature stays consistent: Elara notices weight, light, and the hush of empty reservoirs before anyone else.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: “collected static charges pilgrims brought from the hills” does triple duty—world rule, character task, and foreshadowing of wonder-as-fuel. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical or relational detail. Figurative language stays spare except the nectar dusk, which recurs only twice and is justified by sky color. Clean grammar, no simultaneity errors, pronouns track across child/toll-keeper shift.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of electrical grid failure with spiritual wonder-deficit feels non-obvious and internally coherent; bottled atmosphere as currency is a fresh economic metaphor that actually cashes out narratively. Riddle-as-software-patch risks twee, but the piece commits: the city’s lights reboot only after wonder is broadcast, making the idea integral, not decorative. Small freshness bumps: tower toll booth as confessionary, grandmother posthumous hacker. Could edge higher if Mira’s voice carried child specificity instead of wisdom-dialogue.</comment>
