<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Yuki’s interior contradiction—net-mender practicality versus moon-lit metaphysics—survives every beat; the whisk-hand habit, parapet touch, and whistle are embodied micro-choices that externalize her hierarchy of values. Static position and no second character keep relational/status bullets off the page, but her renunciation of explanation with her father (last paragraph) carries a felt relational cost that caps the arc. The only bar to 9+ is the absence of a second live pressure source on-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared by density of net/moon/firefly patterning; closure is a Charged Poise crystallized in the whistle callback that reweights “hidden effort” with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 50 words; no teleporting props; causality remains internal-consistency stable. The final image of warm whisk in hand after the cold stone is the exact sentence where cost lands, satisfying the 9+ cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment> parapet, rain-cooled stone, and moon-path paddies function as micro-setting that constrains her literal stance and metaphorical sight-lines; the whisk’s bamboo prongs serve as mobile “setting” charged in the final image. Sensory triage (smell of washed earth, firefly flashes on wet leaves) is filtered through net-mender priorities. Spatial choreography is clean in the single location; weather state affects thermal choice to descend. Environment, body, and tool all participate in the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“see invisible threads of hidden effort”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through pattern accrual: moon paths, net grammar, father’s ignorance, firefly grief-joy. No external antagonist, but the risk of remaining unseen herself intensifies until the whistle act crystallizes her stance with on-page cost (vulnerability of “grown woman calling to ghosts”). One meaningful deepening sufficient for 700-word piece; price is legible in final image, meeting 8.8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: mending as reverence, patterns as living grammar. Whistle reprise converts childhood memory into adult ethical stance without declarative moral. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—“pattern complete itself around her”—that reweights prior nets, moon paths, and hidden labor. No thematic echo or final-paragraph moralizing; ambiguity about whether father ever learns sustains complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is net-mender noticing tension, knots, and shimmering courses. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to the staccato “thin, ascending note” of the whistle. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“seemed to listen”) are POV-motivated and consistent with her reflective bias. Prose texture distinctively fuses maritime precision with lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Mixed metaphors are intentionally braided (nets, moon paths, fireflies) under taught accumulative pattern, so coherence holds. No scaffold, no filter-verb clusters in peak beat. Opening and closing lines perform double duty—anchor voice and reweight motif. Information density high; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pattern.</comment>

<comment>Female net-mender philosopher is fresh entry point; combining tea-whisk heirloom with fishing-net ontology creates specific synthesis unavailable by swapping names. Risk-taking in quiet, observational arc without external plot violence pays off through accumulative pattern that still lands cost. No close echoes of canon scenes; transformation test fails if nets → any craft, but moon-path/firefly ecology keeps it particular. Boldly commits to lyric accumulative structure and fulfills its implication.</comment>
