<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tapping ritual, the atlas relic, and the memory of bleaching all feel lived-in and specific. The moment she stops tapping and invents a new rhythm is a credible micro-choice that crystallizes her shift from observer to participant. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the story stays within single-POV safety. Interior contradiction is present—hope vs. grief—but could be pushed one beat further under pressure to hit the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the new coral colony reweights the premise that “paths disappear” into “paths transform,” with the atlas coastline now permanently erased yet biologically rerouted. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: the buoy data pattern break is the because/therefore trigger that reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the final image—her father’s obsolete map now literal detritus beneath a station that is itself “perpetually between states.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The station as micro-setting constrains every action: buoy cables, console, seabed anchorage, drifting currents—all tactile and leveraged for plot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices temperature, salinity, and acoustic feedback, not tourist visuals. The torn atlas page functions as mobile micro-setting that evolves from nostalgic relic to obsolete artifact, charging the final image. Weather/environment causally affect choice when redirected currents enable the deep-coral settlement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—whether extinct migration paths can re-open—tightens when data reveals a living coral scouting party in impossible depths. Escalation is one meaningful deepening, not reversal, fitting Accumulative lens: knowledge shift from “lost forever” to “rerouted” narrows her emotional options to a new, risky hope. Cost is conceptual—she must now bet her career credibility on an unverified colony. Agency is observation/attention that forecloses despair; sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as “photographs of temporary truths” reframed by biology’s own remapping. No thematic echo sentences; the atlas page’s final re-weighting does the argumentative work. Subtext in the tapping shift—from measurement to conversation—implies science surrendering to listening. Ambiguity is preserved: the colony may still die, leaving her stance crystallized but unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person lyric close achieves perceptual signature: “something perpetually between states of being” mirrors her own suspension. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“as if the reef had sent out a scouting party”) then shortens during data beats, matching emotional respiration. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction control—no corporate register drift. Free indirect cleanly fuses: “She began tapping again, but differently.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings avoid template cadence. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphor density is purposeful—cemetery, scouting party—paid off in closure image. Minor elevated diction (“confluence,” “calcified”) is justified by scientific POV; does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-fiction that refuses apocalypse tropes, instead locating renewal in bathyal darkness. Torn atlas page as emotional MacGuffin transforming from nostalgia to epistemic obsolescence is non-obvious. Risk in quiet ending—no rescue mission, only stance shift—pays off via Charged Poise. Coral as “scouting party” personifies ecosystem without anthropomorphic overreach.</comment>
