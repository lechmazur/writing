<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized in her decoding of Marques’s note and her instant tactical pivot to the pigeons. The interiority stays concrete—fifteen years of storm journals transmute into witness, not abstract virtue. Her final resolve feels earned because the text lets us watch her price the risk against the jasmine scent she stands to lose. Minor slip: “credibly curious mind” is label-speak in the epiphanic paragraph (−0.3).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: because her data threaten the ministry, therefore she is followed → she escapes laterally → she chooses to act. The moment she rolls the parchment into the tube is a visible Decisive Change with felt cost (the courtyard calm she is about to lose). One hairline scaffold: “progress laterally” is repeated verbatim from prompt; does not break causality but keeps it shy of 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The courtyard is not decorative: its quiet fountain and jasmine wall supply the sensory stakes she defends. Copper roof and dying sun are tactile tools that frame the pigeons’ release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from gate to aviary to desk. Weather imagery (“soft purple wash”) is filtered through her professional gaze, charging the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect truth vs. personal safety—is signaled by the tailing and tightened when the tube is sealed. One meaningful tightening: the realization that her own data endanger her converts observation into action. Cost is visible—she forfeits the dusk tranquility she cherishes. Could have pushed higher if the ministry’s counter-pressure had been shown on-page rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: meticulous record-keeping becomes moral resistance. The shift from data-as-archive to data-as-weapon reweights the storm journals without overt thesis. Final image reframes “quiet” as the thing being risked, not the thing preserved. Avoids explicit moralizing; only mildly dinged by the prompt-echo phrase “nurture integrity in solitude.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays anchored in Elena’s perceptual filter—meteorological metaphors, sensorial hierarchy of stone warmth, jasmine scent. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Syntax mirrors her cartographic mind: long, clause-rich sentences that breathe during reflection then tighten into two-word decision beats (“She would not hide.”). Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is academic diction outside her lexicon (−0.2).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse atmospheric detail, backstory, and stakes (“seventeen leather-bound volumes… uncharted territory”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates—latinate cadence for meditative dusk, staccato prepositional chains for evasion (“through narrow alleyways, circling the old cathedral twice”). Alliteration and assonance serve mood without purple drift. Clean copy throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: meteorological archivist turned whistle-blower via carrier pigeon—specific, non-obvious synthesis. Industrial-waste masquerading as plague is familiar, but the weather-data angle reframes it. Risk taken: trusting a lyric, almost pastoral opener to carry political thriller stakes pays off in tonal clash that charges closure. Not quite transformative enough to feel inevitable in hindsight; still, memorable voice and occupation elevate above template.</comment>
