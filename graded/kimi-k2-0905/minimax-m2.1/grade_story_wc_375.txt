<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven duty vs. fear of repeating erasure—are embodied in the trembling charcoal hand that finally moves toward canvas; the lock’s weight in pocket and “charcoal crescents” keep past complicity alive in the body. Micro-choice to kneel and begin painting crystallizes renunciation of her former gate-keeping with visible cost (she forfeits her identity as mere documentarian). Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, mineral taste and prismatic shadows render emotion. Closure choice earns its beat because every remembered discouragement has been dramatized earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s first stroke rewrites the姊妹 power dynamic and accepts perpetual ethical debt; cost is legible in “I begin” under the ancestral gaze of an unfinished face. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (charcoal, lock, crystal light) deepens thematic density until the final shaft re-weights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 7 (who, where, when). One minor nick: the diary coordinates appear once without prior cue; still, they function as inherited trigger, not coincidence, so causality survives.</comment>

<comment>Crystal cathedral acts as both gallery and accuser: shifting refracted light literalizes “auroral sorrow,” forcing Mira to confront the palette she once muted. The broken lock’s fused tumblers mirror her creative block, constraining whether she can grip a brush without self-reproach. Sensory triangulation—taste of mineral rain, weight of dead petals, charcoal grit beneath nails—anchors body inside living geode, no visual catalog. Final spotlight on blank canvas quadrant proves environment actively choreographs the climax.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—will Mira re-enact silencing or restore Elena’s vision?—tightens when unfinished grandmother portrait confronts her with half-erased identity. Stakes escalate through accumulative sensory density, not external antagonist; each pulse of quartz light ups moral glare until remaining option is public self-indictment via paint. Protagonist agency drives turn: she kneels, forfeits former detachment, accepts lifelong comparison with dead sister’s bolder palette. Cost is felt immediately—the blank side of the face will now bear her confession, not Elena’s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as revelation vs. suppression: art exposes what love rendered unsayable. Subtext lives in gestures—fingernail charcoal as stigmata of critic-turned-accomplice. No moralizing line; instead, final image of hand poised over void re-weights earlier disapproval into ethical remainder. Emotional after-effect is contrition made tactile, avoiding sentimentality through mineral chill and prismatic decay.</comment>

<comment>First-person voice carries forensic precision (“manufacturer, weight, failsafe never engaged”) suited to portraitist mnemonist, then modulates into reverent hush amid crystal columns. Syntax lengthens with clauses mirroring refracted light; paragraph rhythm breathes between sense fragments. Perceptual signature is color-as-morality: she catalogs wavelengths the way she once audited Elena’s saturation. No head-hop; lyric elision (“I begin”) is earned and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose exhibits high density—each sentence layers metaphor, memory, and physical cue without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors avoided: lock tumblers = fused joints = creative paralysis stays consistent. Near-closure line “earth’s own watercolor” is concise, registers taste-borne inspiration, no purple drift. Occasional Latinate elevation (“prismatic tears,” “mnemonically gifted”) fits narrator’s self-distancing intellect; does not obscure causality.</comment>

<comment>Fresh take converts grief excavation into spelunker’s art restoration; crystal womb as hidden atelier feels inevitable yet未被过度使用. Specificity of charcoal under fingernails and fused lock tumblers rescues “artist’s blockage” trope from cliché. Risk of lyrical compression pays off—final stroke implied, not itemized—without clarity loss. Could edge higher if premise carried an additional socio-cultural inflection beyond family dyad.</comment>
