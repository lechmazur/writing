<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marek’s interior contradiction—yearning for Elias while pruning toward acceptance—is embodied in the tactile micro-choice of lifting the compass and shears. The slow-spoken trait is shown through deliberate pacing of action, not label. Cost is legible: he renounces pursuit, accepting permanent absence. Interiority stays concrete, though the “cerulean regret” label edges toward diagnostic speak (−0.2).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer and object reweights the stake of unspoken apology. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—compass pointing inward, bonsai snip—charged poise with felt cost. Orientation anchored by word 50; no drift. One pattern break: lace pattern’s shifting message intensifies regret without causal turn, sufficient for sub-800-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-rain islet breathes through Marek’s selective attention—wet earth, salt, palm rhythm—each detail filtering his slowed heartbeat. The compass and lace function as micro-setting, constraining his gaze and hand. Final snip under clearing sky recharges the opening green, now touched by light. Environment never catalogued; every sense beat serves the internal tilt toward release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the color of unspoken apologies”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: compass needle steadying over chest redefines the quest from outward search to inward acceptance. No external antagonist; escalation is textural deepening. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forfeits reunion for internalized forgiveness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring blue imagery that slips from literal sky to emotional hue, landing on “opening toward light” without moralizing. Lace-as-message and compass-as-anchor reweight from cryptic clues to instruments of self-confrontation. Subtext breathes in silence and wind. Final image crystallizes apology as sky after storm—complex, unresolved, yet luminous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is slow, horticultural, attuned to micro-shifts in light and wind. Syntax lengthens and shortens with Marek’s breath-rate. No dialogue, so voice unity rests on interior cadence which holds. Filter verbs (“he thought”) are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm ebbs and surges like post-storm breeze; sentences vary from 5-word fragments to 35-word coils without pattern fatigue. Figurative language is selective—needle like unanswered questions, lace like secret in water—never stacked. One paraphrase loop: “the color of unspoken apologies” appears twice; trimmed one would raise density. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information yield.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bonsai discipline with ghost-ship compass and antique lace feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable. Trope of lost lover returns transformed through tactile horticultural metaphor. Risk taken: no dialogue, pure lyric accumulation; coherence maintained. Specificity of post-rain islet light keeps it from generic meditation.</comment>
