<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus compulsive witness-bearing—are alive in every beat. The anesthesia haze lets her body speak a language she must translate, turning her own trauma into work; the moment she touches the cast she’s already breached her own membrane. Her decision to return the cast to the grandmother costs her the last physical trace of the child’s testimony, a renunciation that hurts because we’ve felt her need to hold evidence. Interiority stays concrete: “brain coral fragment cool against her palm” anchors thought in nerve and temperature, never drifting into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elira presses her palm to the cast one last time, accepting the ache as the only homeland left. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each linguistic fragment layers density until the final touch reweights the stake from “understand” to “carry.” Causality is lyric but legible: the Wolof smudges exist → Elira translates → the grandmother weeps → Elira forfeits the cast, her private archive. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by word 60 and the misty atrium remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The atrium’s mist, fountains, and “eternal, misty embrace” are not backdrop but recovery technology—softening sound, forcing whispered diction, making the cast a resonant surface. The coral fragment micro-sets the scene in her palm: living architecture built from damage, constraining her choice to keep or surrender the cast. Twilight and fog compress visual range so the child’s miniature drawings and purple-marker scripts feel luminescent. Spatial choreography is flawless: gurney arrival, bedside lean, final press of palm all track without ghosting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible by paragraph 2: can Elira translate her own scar tissue into testimony that matters? The meaningful tightening occurs when she deciphers the Wolof—suddenly the adult consolations (“You are brave”) are overwritten by the child’s witness of orange skies and metal-tasting water. Cost is felt: she surrenders the physical archive, forfeiting future re-translation. Agency is interior but decisive; no coincidence rescues or deflates the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific act of translation itself: every act of witness erodes the translator. The coral fragment and the cast are living reefs of damage—both grow by accretion, both must be released back to the sea of other lives. No moralizing; the final image of “lotus-hearted ache” is an earned conceptual repricing: beauty that floats on murky water. Subtext lives in silence—Fatima never speaks; her fingertip touch is the only verdict needed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elira’s drug-blurred sensorium: sounds arrive “from distant shores,” light is “strained.” Perceptual signature is translator-precision—she notices script loops, ink color, wrist-edge pressure—never generic hospital haze. Syntax elongates then fragments under anesthesia, mirroring the blurring world. No dialogue from Fatima, a deliberate choice that keeps the child’s interior off-limits, forcing Elira’s voice to carry both griefs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric but disciplined: “edges blurring, sounds arriving from distant shores” varies rhythm without purple overload. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds either sensory or emotional information. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“she understood”) rather than scaffolding. The closing line “ache that was lotus-hearted and ancient” risks poetic inflation but is earned by prior coral/reef imagery and carries undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of medical recovery spa + war-zone translator + child’s graffiti testimony is fresh synthesis, not prompt checklist. The coral fragment as living metaphor for scar-tissue architecture is specific to this voice. Risk: lyric anesthesia voice could slide into vagueness, yet restraint keeps it legible. If names/places were swapped the emotional arc would fracture—proof the premise is irreplaceable.</comment>
