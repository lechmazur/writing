<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically particular—"gravity-defying curse that marked her as different"—and the tablet-driven retracing dramatizes a hierarchy of values (integration > escape). Yet the cost of her "periodically eternal" fracture is asserted rather than embodied; no micro-choice on the page visibly hurts her. Still, the final line’s shift to agency ("she would be the one who had dropped it") earns a credible renunciation of passivity. Passes quick test but emotional jeopardy stays abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last image reweights the premise—she claims authorship of the ripple. Causality under the Accumulative lens coheres; each shard adds density until the final cadence crystallizes meaning. Orientation is taught early (viaduct, tablet, suspended moment) and pays off. Persistent constraint (fractured selves) shapes every beat; cost is felt in the darkening brightness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The viaduct’s post-rain glow and the tablet’s shuffling runes are handled tactilely; the bridge functions as micro-setting that literalizes the "between drop and ripple" interval. Sensory selection stays urgent—stone pulsing, runes writhing—mirroring her fragmenting identity. Spatial choreography remains stable while she floats above the stones. Meets 9+ gate: the glowing stones charge the final image of controlled ripples.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integration of splintered selves—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each fracture she re-enters. Pressure escalates by density (darkening brightness) rather than causal turns; the final cadence narrows options to "this time, she would be the one." One visible cost: surrender of singular selfhood. Meets quick test for Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fractured identity emerges procedurally—each shard visited reconfigures meaning without thematic labels. Final ripple image offers non-literal answer: authorship over dispersion. Ambiguity lingers—will control annihilate or complete her? No moralizing; particulars carry resonance. Charged Poise ending reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric compression is taught in the opening clause ("between the drop and the ripple") and sustained; patterned elision ("periodically eternal") stays legible. Perceptual signature is consistent—runes shift "when she wasn't looking," a POV-specific noticing. Rhythm modulates with stress: long sentences for suspension, clipped final line for agency. No head-hopping; voice remains singular and urgent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers time, body, and object. Figurative language is selective ("stone pulsing as if remembering") and keeps physical logic intact. No loops or scaffold; varied sentence openings propel the lyric rhythm. Meets quick test; minor poetic abstractions never obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Time-travel-as-self-therapy is familiar, yet the procedural-generation tablet that rewrites its own instructions feels non-obvious and specific. Risk-taking in nonlinear mosaic pays off: fragments accumulate rather than serialize, heightening thematic coherence. The "darkening brightness" trope is transformed from cliché into lived constraint. Synthesis seems inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
