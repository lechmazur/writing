<comment>Miriam’s interiority is textured—her scientific lens on grief feels lived-in, and the chrysalis-in-pocket micro-choice keeps her present. The contradiction between guilt and her mother’s explicit absolution is held simultaneously in the foam-tracing beat, not summarized away. Final stance shift is earned: the emptied chrysalis re-read as completion rather than abandonment carries a visible cost because she pockets it again before standing, sealing the conversion. Voice slips once into generic “symphonic” abstraction, but body and motive stay coherent.</comment>

<comment>Closure hits as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chrysalis reweights from relic to warrant of transformation, foam spiral supplies the catalytic image, and the cost is the permanent absence of the mother she can now carry differently. Causal chain is lean but intact—email → ravine → foam insight → pocketing—with no teleporting props. Single-scene orientation is anchored by word 80; braided ravine and snowmelt date the moment. One micro-turn suffices under Accumulative lens: density of foam imagery tightens until pattern break delivers the re-cognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Ravine functions as micro-setting that constrains stance: the confluence literalizes “braided” paths and supplies the foam she must physically trace to reprice loss. Details are filtered through polymer-chemist perception—surfactant vocabulary, molecular vantage—keeping description purposeful. River high with snowmelt is named early, tracks causally (more foam → more pattern), and charges the final image. Spatial ground holds: knees dampen, pocket hand returns, no floating body.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—signalled in second paragraph and tested by the empty chrysalis she still carries. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each foam spiral adds density until the pattern itself forces the re-cognition that separation = emergence. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt supplies coherent pressure. Cost is legible: she gives up the hope of retrospective forgiveness and accepts transformed continuation instead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the chrysalis-to-foam axis: completion looks like emptiness from the outside. Subtext operates in the silence of the missing butterfly—absence as presence. Final image of braided streams running separately yet held in one body offers non-literal answer without moralizing. One hairline slip: “symphonic in its chaos” flirts with abstraction, but the foam physics re-anchors immediacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Miriam’s chemist sensorium; surfactant diction and spiral-tracking syntax are character-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in first half, shorter percussive fragments during foam epiphany. No head-hopping; pronoun discipline clean. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Closing sentence’s braided syntax mirrors fused concept, showing prose-as-character control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—each sentence advances image or concept. One scaffold detected: “patterns in the foam were extraordinary—spirals within spirals” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch closure. No mixed metaphors; technical terms accurate. Final line earns its length because cadence carries the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: using polymer chemistry and foam physics to reprice grief stages feels non-obvious. Chrysalis-as-completed-not-abandoned inverts typical resurrection trope. Integration with biodegradable research legacy links profession to mourning without contrivance. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than plot pyrotechnics—but coherence justifies the choice; could push further into lab-specific imagery for higher band.</comment>
