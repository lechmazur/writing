<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is thick and embodied—her palm on vibrating glass, the compass rose pulsing against her chest. Contradictory impulses (guilt, wonder, duty) coexist in real time rather than alternating. The final micro-choice—sketching the sky “not as it was but as it might be”—pays the accumulated cost of her pariah status and is credibly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “true north was not a destination but a way of moving” reweights the whole premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through iterated silence/sketch beats until the final cadence shift. The persistent constraint of temporal exile shapes every tactical move, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observation deck functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the residual anomaly vibrates the glass, her body absorbs the faint tremor, and the window itself becomes the tool through which she re-visions the sky. Specificity is purposeful—silver pencils, containment fields, compass applique—each enlisted in the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightened when the glimpse forces her to redraw the sky. The cost is visible: she forfeits the old certitude of “true north” as location and embraces perpetual navigation. Agency is interior yet forecloses return to pre-shutdown innocence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative sketching ritual rather than assertion: each stroke renegotiates humanity’s place in stretched time. The final reweighting—true north as direction in the soul—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the shutdown’s moral ledger stays open, inviting counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s perceptual signature—selective attention to vibration, star wheel, inherited pencil strokes. Rhythm accelerates under pressure (“sudden vision that sliced…”) then breathes into longer cadence for closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within her scientist-poet lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “heartbeat of a thousand calculations” collapses an era into one clause. Metaphors stay coherent—compass rose, blade of light, stretched fabric—without self-contradiction. No looped stems or synonym churn; each sentence advances stance or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: temporal-stretch astronomy merged with generational sketchbook ritual. The compass heirloom re-enters not as token symbol but as perceptual filter that literally re-orients cosmic navigation. Risky lyric accumulation paid off when closure re-prices “true north” as ethical stance rather than coordinate.</comment>
