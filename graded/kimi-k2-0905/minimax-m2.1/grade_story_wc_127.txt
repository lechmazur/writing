<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—craftsman’s pride vs. emotional self-infection—plays out in real time through the act of inhaling her own counterfeit. The final exhale is a micro-choice that costs her the comfort of denial; the “affectionate detachment” is embodied, not labeled. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Meets 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses in scene + earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain: design → self-test → grief-subsumption → renunciation. Closure is Earned Stasis: she foregoes the illusion of whole truths and accepts perpetual half-lie craft; cost is the fresh grief now resident in her body. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“amber grotto at dusk”). Lens holds: causal linkage narrows options to “work is never finished, only suspended.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Amber glass walls, ethanol reek, and static-charged blotter petal function as micro-setting that constrains the only possible action—self-inhalation. Light bending like “honeyed whiskey” is filtered through Vera’s sensory priorities. Spatial choreography clean: bench → petal → nose → exhale. Environment charges the final image: grotto glows amber as she accepts perpetual suspension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she withstand the grief she manufactures?—tightens once: the inhale forecloses the option of remaining emotionally untouched. Escalation is causal: because she tests on herself, she must carry the grief forward. Cost is legible in the final sentence (“the work was never finished, only suspended”). No coincidence; pressure is coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: useful lies vs. unbearable truth. Subtext lives in the blotter petal—an object that absorbs and transmits feeling yet remains only paper. Final image reweights premise: half truths are whole lies, but necessary ones. No moralizing; resonance is felt through the exhale that releases yet retains grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s perceptual signature: static electricity as “tiny electric admissions,” grief that “rearranges the furniture of her interior world.” Syntax mirrors craft precision—long accumulative phrases that tighten into the final short sentence. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Psychic distance stable; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening lyrical dilation contracts to staccato final clause. Metaphors are coherent—amber, whiskey, static—each returns with shifted charge. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. High information density: “grief…meant something had mattered enough to lose” does triple duty—theme, emotion, cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Counterfeit empathy as olfactory drug is fresh; execution grounds it in tactile detail (static-charged blotter). Risky second-person infection of narrator pays off: craftsman becomes first victim. Concept follows implication without flinching: useful fiction as emotional prosthesis. Not a twist story; insight feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
