<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—furious serenity vs. self-silencing—are dramatized in embodied beats (hand on rail, timer in palm, breath-counting). The final renunciation of waiting is earned by the prior causality of storm-stripped pretense and the timer’s metronome of exile. Interiority stays concrete, but one beat drifts toward diagnostic self-label (“cartography of scars”) without immediate embodied cost, clipping the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the vigil ends not by external permission but by her reclaiming motion, visible in the mist-written verses. Causal chain holds—storm → mask-slip → re-cognition → writing—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-transition (pocket → timetable → envelope) could be cleaner, but orientation is anchored by 120 words and closure recharges the timer/timetable tandem.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory dome, darkroom timer, and bus timetable form a micro-setting triad that physically constrains her choices: timer paces breath, timetable hides forbidden text, glass surface becomes slate. Lightning’s white burst is filtered through her censored retina, turning environment into weapon and mirror. Weather escalates from external threat to internal permission, charging the final image of verses written in condensation that will evaporate—an irrecoverable first publication.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice vs. permanent silence—tightens when the storm strips away pretense and the sealed envelope becomes a live grenade she must either drop or hurl into language. One meaningful deepening: realizing she, not the censors, has held the pause. Cost is legible in the irreversible act of writing on mist, a medium that self-erases, trading permanence for immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the act of naming is resistance, but only when the named wound is owned in public space. Subtextual turn: scars shift from map to manuscript, from private legend to public transit. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing—verses that vanish as they’re spoken—reweighting “publication” as fleeting gesture rather than ink, a cost Mira accepts without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains fierce perceptual signature: astronomical metaphors, photographic lexis, bus-route memory. Rhythm accelerates with storm strobe, then rarefies into breath-timed fragments, mirroring her shift from exile to utterance. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon of celestial and darkroom argot. One clause slips toward academic (“conceptual repricing” tenor) but recovers quickly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: sentences layer metaphor, memory, and motion without paraphrase loops. Figurative bursts cluster near lightning beats, pattern-taught by storm flicker, paying off in mist-writing coda. Minor scaffold: “counting seconds into meaning” echoes prior “counting syllables into truth,” but the reprise is purposeful, reweighting craft itself. Filter verbs nearly zero; strong verbs drive momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The censored-poet trope is refreshed by photographic darkroom tech and bus-timetable smuggling, grounding abstraction in tactile process. Storm as confessional is familiar, yet here it becomes the printing bath that develops latent text. Risk taken: verses spoken to air and written on evanescent glass—publication as vanishing act—feels inevitable in hindsight. Synthesis is specific enough to resist name-swapping.</comment>
