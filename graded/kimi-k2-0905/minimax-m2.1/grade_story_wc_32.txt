<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—priest-turned-alchemist clinging to a relic she once broke—drives every micro-choice; the final snap is earned by seventeen years of iterated failure shown, not told. Emotion is embodied in frost-numbed hands and breath that refuses to mist, avoiding diagnostic labels. The “stoic sensitivity” trait surfaces once as a label but is otherwise dramatized through controlled ritual gesture, keeping the slip minor. Renunciation lands with visible cost: empty hands, spent fire, destiny interrupted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: the second snap ignites unnamed-colored flames and releases seventeen years of borrowed energy, cost paid on the page. Causal lens holds: each failed approximation logically narrows to the subtraction insight that fuels the final act. Orientation is anchored by word 45 (ember nexus, violet twilight, three fire pits). One minor retroactive cue—“she had carried this relic for seventeen years”—is cleanly embedded in present action, so no cap applied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crozier’s amethyst glint and the frost-creep across stones are filtered through Mara’s precise alchemical attention, turning setting into a crucible that constrains her ritual choices. Violet twilight and “frozen bloom” serve double duty—atmosphere and thematic mirror—without tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, unwrap, pyramid-build, second snap, stand and leave; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (crozier, embers, frost) actively shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interrupt a destiny of repeated failure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the crozier refuses to burn, forcing the subtraction insight. One meaningful turn: the recognition that release, not addition, is required immediately forecloses the preservation path. Cost is legible in the ashes of the crozier and the “empty hands” that follow. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Creative destruction emerges through specific event: the bishop’s crozier—symbol of spiritual guidance—must be re-broken to birth unnamed fire, reweighting sacrifice as liberation. Subtext operates in silence: no prayer is spoken, only the crack of silver. Final image of emptied hands offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. “Frozen bloom” motif recurs only twice, each time charged by action, avoiding tokenism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person luminous close-up maintains stable distance; no head-hop. Syntax elongates during contemplation, then fractures into short clauses at the snap—“snapped it again into three pieces”—mirroring internal shift. Diction stays within an alchemist’s lexicon (vivify, transmuter, catalyst) without academic bleed. Perceptual signature is consistent: color-starved twilight, frost geometry, metallurgical attention to silver stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates breath with ember glow versus frost snap; no template cadence detected. Sentences carry double duty: “The flames caught instantly, impossibly, rising in colors that had no names” advances action, stakes, and conceptual break in one sweep. One mixed-metaphor risk—“withered flower” of metal—reads intentional, fused to Mara’s priest-memory, and does not blur causality. Zero paraphrase loops; high information density maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Alchemist-breaking-her-own-relic is fresh mythic ground; the inversion of “vivify” from resurrecting matter to resurrecting self avoids trope recycling. Seventeen-year iterative failure shown via single night’s subtraction epiphany compresses time without expositional cheat. Frozen bloom as both meteorological edge-state and emotional stasis offers specific, non-portable image. Risk in lyric compression pays off: closure image would collapse if any detail were swapped.</comment>
