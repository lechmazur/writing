<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maruk’s interiority is concrete—his “grim satisfaction in how little oil such work consumed” crystallizes frugality under pressure. The single contradiction—empirical habit versus willingness to risk speech to the unknown—drives the final beat. Cost is visible: he stays silent at dawn, renouncing explanation, a foreclosed path that stings. No stock phrasing; the flaw is the slight off-page feel to the covenant renewal (more reported than embodied), keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each archive shard adds density until the candle-grid pattern breaks into resonance. Closure is a Charged Poise—palace still standing, stars “closer,” new rulers unaware—cost is the astronomer’s lifelong silence. Persistent constraint: he must never boast or break the covenant, a price that shapes the final smile. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop observatory tiles become the micro-setting that literally vibrates underfoot, constraining the final action. Palace corridors are mapped by number-grid, turning architecture into star-chart—specific, tactile, impossible to swap. Twilight between regimes is filtered through Maruk’s skin: “winter cold” settles in bones. One minor hedging: “ancient Babylonian” is never named on-page, but Mesopotamian echoes (clay tile, desert edge) suffice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—palace survival—tightens when schematic use proves the forgotten covenant is real. Single meaningful deepening: the tile is not curio but key, narrowing options to “speak or let city fall.” Agency is endurance/silence at dawn, a visible forfeiture of acclaim. Cost is legible: eternal secrecy, felt in the smile he never shares.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: empirical frugality accidentally erases the very devotion that sustains order.Encrypted love poem to an alien pattern-mind reframes science as courtship. Final image reweights earlier material—constellations now feel complicit, not distant. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether the guardian is benevolent or merely contractual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person紧coupled to Maruk’s perceptual signature: numbers, oil quantities, star angles. Rhythmic control heightens during incantation—short clauses mimic tile rows. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Filter verbs only where voice-motivated (“seemed to whisper” matches his scholarly caution).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density—“palace where he had served three kings now stood in uncertain twilight” does three jobs in one line. Metaphors stay coherent: twilight as political & literal, resonance as sound & contract. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating circular propulsion. One hairline slip: “footsteps” in Chinese characters jars momentarily, but context teaches the alienation effect, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magic-square astrological covenant treated as literal service contract. Court astronomer encoding love poem to a pattern-consciousness reconfigures both math and occult. Risky structural choice—entire conflict in reflection and archive—pays off because the final vibration is physically dramatized. Not 9 only because “between regimes” setting is broadly familiar; specificity lies in tile mechanics, not geopolitics.</comment>
