<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Warden’s voice is lyrically specific—hair tangled with pages, eyes “pale luminescence of margins.” The ache is embodied, the final micro-choice (walk forward) emerges from prior reflection; cost is the seventeen winters surrendered. Interiority risks rarefied abstraction (“dimensionally homesick”) yet stays anchored to pendant heat and fog. Just shy of 9: no contradictory on-page impulses, but the turn feels more epiphanic than wrestled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: mist density, pendant warmth, and word-seeds layer until the guardian’s stance crystallizes—“waiting becomes preparation.” Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the boundary of light reweights from prison to threshold with felt cost (years lost). Orientation clear by ~70 words. One pattern break—pendant arrival—taught early. No causal chain, none required under lyric design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen mist garden is rendered through guardian’s body: ice bench numbs, pendant burns scalp, pages scratch inside hair. Environment constrains the final choice—she can only leave when mist “parts slightly,” proving setting is antagonist and ally. Sensory triage favors touch over sight, matching feral POV. Micro-setting (pendant as portable hearth) charges the closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she convert exile into departure? Pressure accumulates via sensory intensification—cold, then impossible pendant heat, then thinning mist. One tightening: mist shifts from imprisoning veil to “generous boundary,” foreclosing perpetual vigilance. Cost is the seventeen winters already spent; future cost is the unmapped beyond she now must enter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: guardianship is not hoarding but learning to “make friends with uncertainty.” Pendant reprises burned-library past; final image of turning a page elsewhere reweights loss into transmission. No declarative thesis; resonance lives in gesture—tucking pendant into hair alongside saved words. Avoids pseudo-profundity by staying rooted in tactile specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained lyric-fugue: long vowels, hyphenated nouns, recursive clauses mimic mist drift. Compression (“time moved like honey through gauze”) teaches pattern early; payoff in final clause “foggy lucidity” that fuses opposites. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays tethered to guardian’s synesthetic body. Minor risk of monotiny in cadence, but variance arrives via shorter closing sentences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line craft is dense yet breathable; figurative layering supports, not obscures, the arc. No loops or scaffold; each image advances atmosphere or interiority. Metaphors stay internally coherent (mist as breath, pendant as heartbeat). Occasional elevated diction (“dimensionally homesick”) is voice-motivated; register holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Feral librarian exiled in frozen mist-pavilion is fresh synthesis; pendant as portable hearth/library relic offers new mnemonic tech. Risk taken in lyric stasis pays off via accumulative pressure rather than plot reversals. Could swap names yet core emotional algorithm—archivist becoming pilgrim—remains unique. Avoids genre pastiche by anchoring magic in bodily cost.</comment>
