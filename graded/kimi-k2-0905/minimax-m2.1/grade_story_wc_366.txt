<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s reticence and observant warmth are shown through silent action—reading the stone stacks, pocketing the sea glass, stacking the seven stones. The grandmother’s loss and the inherited pull toward lighthouses give her a believable, emotionally anchored motive. The final act of stacking is a concrete, costly choice that dissolves her grandmother’s presence, earning the change. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no diagnostic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lamp reignites as Maren’s sea-glass-weighted pocket empties her grandmother’s unfinished grief into the beam. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each stone stack intensifies the pattern until the seven-stone tower rekindles the light. Time, place, and POV anchor within the first 120 words; no orientation debt. The ending image carries undeniable conceptual cost—she leaves with “heavier pockets of meaning,” foreclosing her former silent detachment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse interior is built from tactile, lived particulars: feverish stones, fossilized prayers in the walls, the ghost-heat of the dead lamp. Micro-setting objects—sea glass, stone stacks—constrain every major choice and charge the final image. Weather and tide are filtered through Maren’s professional eye; no catalogue tourism. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and stones track cleanly up the spiral stairs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: give the dead sailors a witness so the lamp will guide the living again. Pressure escalates through each new stone stack; the seventh stack becomes the decisive, visible trade-off. Cost is felt—Maren surrenders her grandmother’s talisman and her own silence. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: remembering the lost is the price of guiding the next. Subtext lives in gesture—stacking stones instead of speaking, offering sea glass instead of sermons. The final image reframes earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity is honored: the sea still takes, the light still warns, but the ritual of witness now carries weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: barnacle shifts, gull-call variations, the lamp housing’s cold glass. Syntax grows shorter under the lantern’s fever heat, mirroring breathless ascent. No head-hopping; Ashford’s smile is only ever surface. Voice texture is maritime, reticent, and rhythmic without template cadence.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate. Figurative language is spare and precise—no stacked metaphors in peak beats. Information density is high: one sentence can deliver sensory detail, backstory cue, and causal link. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no scaffold artifacts in closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of stone-stack semaphore + haunted lighthouse + inherited grief feels fresh, not trope-checklist. The anonymous letter chain is literalized as balancing act, not exposition. Specificity: Craghead Light, Tuesday-night outage, seven stones for seven sailors—details resist swap-out. Risk: quiet lyric resolution instead of spectacle; coherence holds.</comment>
