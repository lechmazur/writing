<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile intimacy with the press and her amber-pause backstory give her a sharp, idiosyncratic core, but the story keeps her interiority at a reverent distance; we watch her “feel” and “remember” rather than wrestle contradictory impulses in scene. The final micro-choice—setting the type to print the released whisper—lands as a gentle continuation of habit, not a charged renunciation or risk, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personal. She is vivid, but not yet put under relationship pressure or forced to pay a price that would make her unforgettable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frost-to-bottle-to-press sequence forms a clean causal spine: pattern read → object found → rupture executed → new page composed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the Library’s rule-set literally rewrites itself in cloud-syntax, visible cost paid in the shattering frost and the emptied bottle. Orientation is swift—glass orchard, floating floor, cloud-sea all named by line 6—so no penalty applies. One minor slack: the “section that had not existed before” appears without foreshadowing, a soft teleport rather than earned rupture, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass leaves, crystalline trees, and ink-sweating spines are sensuously precise and filtered through Elara’s print-craft attention. The letterpress itself functions as micro-setting: its un-negotiable metal anchors both atmosphere and final action. Cloud-sea patterns visibly reconfigure after the rupture, proving the environment charges the closing image. Only the “reading alcoves” remain a postcard glimpse; they neither constrain choice nor return with altered meaning, preventing the 9+ lift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a compressed eternity be responsibly released?—is signaled early via the frost-syntax. Pressure tightens once the bottle is in-hand: the press offers one irreversible path, foreclosing safe containment. The rupture’s expansion is irreversible and legibly costly (shattered frost, sweating shelves), satisfying the 8+ band. However, Elara’s agency is largely receptive—she reads, carries, lowers the bar—so the escalation feels orchestrated by the world rather than forced by her trade-offs, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of preservation: to keep something forever you must let it leave the bottle and become unreadable, ever-spreading language. The final image of new cloud-patterns silently reweights every prior mention of “compressed histories” without moralizing. No motif is paraded for its own sake; frost, bottle, and press all converge on that single idea. The concept is coherent yet slender—one elegant turn rather than a layered ambivalence—so it stops just short of the 9-band resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle-distance, mirroring Elara’s tactile reverence: “ran her fingers across the raised type” is immediate yet hushed. Syntax lengthens and compresses with the moment—short beats for the press drop, cascading clauses for the whisper’s release—showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; perception stays strictly hers. The register never drifts into workshop-ese, sustaining a hush appropriate to sacred machinery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory image, world-rule, emotional charge (“the glass orchard shuddered as the frost patterns shattered”). Metaphors are kept rare enough to avoid purple drift; when they appear (“dreaming whales”) they are brief and apt. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances either knowledge or atmosphere. A single mixed moment—“rupture came not with sound but with expansion”—slightly muddles sensory logic, a hairline slip keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of letterpress mechanics with post-negotiation metaphysics feels freshly specific: metal that “does not dream” against reality that bargains. The bottled whisper pre-dating the Negotiation reframes familiar “bottled memories” into cosmological scale without exposition dump. Risk is taken and paid off: the Library literally rewrites itself in visible cloud-script, a final image that could not exist without the premise. The synthesis is inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry, meriting the 9-band.</comment>
