<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Yara’s lightning-given plant-sight and buried fear read through concrete micro-choices (silence at the greenhouse bench, tremor when the kite appears). Grandmother-granddaughter status shift is staged cleanly: Yara yields narrative control to Anya’s insurgent cue, their joint hand-clasp crystallizes the cost of abandoning secrecy. Interior contradiction—tradition vs. transformation—stays active in scene, not abstract. The embryo’s pulse answers their intent, so the closure choice is earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to unseal is irrevocable, embryo warmth signals conceptual cost, plants’ hush confirms stakes have reconfigured. Causal chain holds—lightning gift → kite map → greenhouse chamber—each because/therefore step narrows options. One unobtrusive time-jump (dawn arrival) is anchored by fogged panes and hot-spring steam. Orientation beats the 120-word checkpoint; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ash-heavy air, resin glare, and geothermal steam are filtered through Yara’s synesthetic plant-sense, not listed. The greenhouse itself functions as micro-setting: glass fogged by breath and mineral vapor, temperature shifts speaking in plant color—details that guide her final yes. Spatial choreography tracks kite drift through broken pane to bench-top without drift. Hot-spring plume re-enters at closure, recharging the “breath of the earth” motif that mirrors the embryo’s pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break or keep the ancestral seal—announced when Anya labels reburying “implanted destinies.” Middle beat: plants scream, Yara realizes the kite is a map; this tightening forecloses neutrality. Final hand-clasp embodies the trade-off: safety of silence vs. responsibility to evolve. Cost is legible—once chamber opens, secrecy can never be restored; volcanic landscape already proved consequences of ignored warnings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges through seed, amber, and greenhouse imagery rather than thesis lines. “Implanted destiny” is literalized in the embryo but re-weighted as cultivar, not curse, by the closing warmth. Subtextual irony: keeping the gift hidden was itself a planted destiny, now uprooted. Final image—genetic promise pulsing in resin—answers the thematic question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Yara’s plant-hearing perception; temperature-color synesthesia gives a distinct signature. Syntax lengthens under revelation pressure, then fractures into short imperative (“Help me read”) mirroring her shift to action. No head-hopping; Anya’s insurgency is shown through gesture and reported speech, not interiority. Dialogue is minimal, goal-driven, idiomatic to inter-generational tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with beats: dense lyrical stacking in plant-chorus paragraph, then clipped motion once decision forms. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or sensory pressure. Metaphors stay sensory-grounded (plants “scream” as temperature spikes) and internally consistent. Proofing clean; punctuation around em-dash dialogue tags is standard.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusing botanical empathy, volcanic post-catastrophe, and biotech archaeology feels novel yet inevitable. Amber-trapped hybrid embryo reverses typical “forbidden relic” trope into forward-looking agency. Kite as vector for genetic map recontextualizes child’s toy into evolutionary tool—specific to this world. Risk in blending eco-fantasy with biopunk pays off because every element constrains the final choice.</comment>
