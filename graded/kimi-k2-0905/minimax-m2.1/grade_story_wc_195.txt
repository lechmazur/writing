<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aldric’s guilt-shut interiority is vivid (the vow slips out “without conscious intention”), but his metamorphosis from mute grief to “shivering bliss” is asserted more than embodied; no contradictory impulse complicates the pivot, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative lens is taught early (star-fruit, frozen poses) and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: when the last string snaps the greenhouse—and the knight’s three-year stasis—dissolves, leaving him bearing “weight and worth beyond any earthly kingdom.” Cost is unmistakable in the vanishing orchard and the unsnapped marionette; causality stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Phosphorescent fruit and hook-suspended puppets create a tactile, night-saturated micro-cosmos; the greenhouse never slips into white-room syndrome and its glow literally enables the final act by illuminating the strings. Yet the orchard itself never actively obstructs or resource-shapes Aldric’s choices—it is atmosphere more than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can possibility be re-inhabited?”—is clear, and the single deepening (reading the vow aloud) tightens the spell, forcing Aldric to animate the puppets. Escalation is gentle, accumulative; no visible price is extracted from Aldric during the dance itself, so pressure feels aesthetic rather than endangering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story’s after-image—possibility once wooden now carried inside—emerges through puppet-motion and orchard-dissolution rather than dictation; the marionettes’ “frozen stars” reconfigure from decorative into existential weight. No moral is pronounced, yet the re-pricing of regret into imaginative duty lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance consistent; diction (“alchemical orchard,” “waking insects”) is elevated but stays within Aldric’s courtly lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long languid clauses mirror his fatigue, then crisp verbs (“unsnap,” “fall free”) mark the release—without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences do multiple jobs (“The factually mystical quality… seemed to have imbued them…”) though occasional modifier stacks (“phosphorescent luminescence”) verge on pleonasm; no loops or mixed metaphors obstruct the final image. Clean mechanics support momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms the shop-worn “broken knight healed by wonder” trope by making the healing agent discarded toys of dead children refracted through alchemical botany; the puppet-as-anchor-of-unlived-futures feels fresh, inevitable in hindsight, and the greenhouse’s century-long night frames it with mythic compression.</comment>
