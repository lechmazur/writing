<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Father Thomas’s interiority is textured—his chaplain past informs micro-choices (hesitating over the spring, remembering Marcus) and yields a credible renunciation (hidden inscription). Yet the emotional contradiction promised by the rubric is only summarized (“wondered whether fixing…too simple”) rather than enacted in scene. Cost is present but soft: no visible fallout or risk to him. Still, the occupation-specific detail and the final act of sacral repair lift the portrayal above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ticking heart + unheard blessing reweights grief into quiet continuance; the woman’s imminent realization supplies felt cost. Causal chain intact: second-opinion ethic → delay → inscribed gift → melodic release. One minor scaffold: “He thought of Marcus Webb” paragraph is pure retrospective tell; it tilts stance but stalls present pressure. Still, the ending image pays off the pattern and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-window micro-setting succeeds: west-facing sun angle, bench tool order, and velvet case constrain attention and echo confessional light. The shop’s proximity to bakery/tailor is named but never used, a missed tactile opportunity. Heart-as-setting functions better—brass catching light guides the final inscription decision. Overall selectivity beats white-room, but environment never actively endangers or resource-blocks the repair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to sanctify mechanical repair into emotional restitution—surfaces by paragraph 3 and tightens once: hesitation → inscription → restored melody. Micro-turn is credible but singular; no further narrowing or price (money, reputational, physical) is risked. Pressure is situational and lyric rather than adversarial; sufficient for sub-800-word arc but not scalding. Cost is off-loaded onto the daughter’s future tears, not the protagonist’s skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: grace as unearned, non-score-keeping restoration. Hidden inscription sublimates apology into action without preachiness. Final melody answers the Marcus beat in wordless tonality—an earned non-literal answer. Only debit: “grace isn’t about deserving” line flirts with thesis-statement; rescued by placement mid-story and immediate dust-mote image that re-embodies it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Free-indirect diction mirrors Thomas’s deliberative cadence—long sentences for rumination, clipped fragments at tool point. Light imagery recurs with变异, sustaining poetic texture without monotony. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero; filter verbs (“he noticed”) are sparse and purposeful. Perceptual signature is strong enough to hit 9-band save for one stock phrase: “vibrant hush” (prompt-mandated) appears twice, slightly self-conscious on its second outing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; no template cadence runs. Metaphors are coherent (ledger, dropped coin, storm-light) and sparse enough to avoid purple clutter. One paraphrase loop: “always changing, always revealing” repeats the prior clause’s essence; minor −0.2. Otherwise high density—each sentence advances image or moral calculus. No artifact touches the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of prison chaplain + clockwork restorer is fresh; neither persona is used generically. The “second opinion” ethic repurposes a medical trope into sacramental mechanics. Hidden inscription device avoids easy sentimental payoff by remaining unseen. Risk is moderate, not radical; concept could travel to another craftsman but Thomas’s vocation-specific guilt lens gives it memorable tilt.</comment>
