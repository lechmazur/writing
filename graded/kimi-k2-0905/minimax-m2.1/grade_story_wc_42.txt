<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and sensorially grounded; the narrator’s grief and craft knowledge feel lived-in. Micro-choices (lifting the camera, refocusing on the hand) visibly trace the shift from fixation to acceptance. The father promise acts as a credible wound, but the “sage” self-label feels slightly grandiose for a solitary man who never interacts; still, the arc earns its renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the spinning hand’s persistence is the tightening agent, reweighting the stake from “stop time” to “let motion move through me.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—camera clicks preserve motion without arresting it, crystallizing the new stance. Cost is legible: forty years of waiting are conceded irretrievably. Causality holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory glass, thin air, and lunar glare are filtered through repairer’s tactile priorities—lens cloth, gummed gears, condensation rivers. The clock hand and camera function as micro-setting objects that constrain final tactic. Spatial choreography is tight; no floating props. Final image recharges these anchors, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the ephemeral without crushing it”—is signaled early and tightens once when the lens pivots from clouds to spinning hand. Escalation is density/cadence driven: tremor → leaf sound → shutter clicks; options narrow to acceptance. Cost is the irrevocable loss of the father-return fantasy. Agency is internal but visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: letting go is not surrender but learning to orbit the ungraspable. Recurring images (spinning, falling leaf, lunar indifference) reweight at closure without moralizing. No thesis statements; resonance is imagistic. Complexity acknowledged—grief is neither vanquished nor romanticized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: optical metaphors, repairer’s diction of “geometry of broken things,” rhythmic mirroring of the hand’s relentless whirl. No dialogue, hence no convergence risk. Compression and lyric pattern are taught early and paid off; final line cadence is controlled, recharging “luminous ache.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every metaphor serves atmosphere or theme. opening/closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive. Only hairline slip: “ancient脾气” code-switch feels unmotivated, but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—astral-camera repairer above clouds—feels fresh, yet emotional core (grief vs. transience) is universal. Leaf-as-method synthesizes orbital physics with Zen gentleness; risk heightens meaning without gimmickry. Transformation test: story fails if clock hand replaced by generic timer. Specificity and bold lyric structure earn the high band.</comment>
