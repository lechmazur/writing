<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Miriam’s motivation is legible—her lifelong devotion to analog stories drives every action—but she never faces a hard choice or contradiction; the reawakening simply happens once she activates the room. The grandmother’s heir is a functional prop, not a crucible. No cost or renunciation lands on Miriam, so the arc is flat. Still, her embodied odd-hour rhythm and tactile attention to the scarf keep her from abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle CR: the scarf’s luminosity re-weights “analog memory” from private loss to shareable artifact, with conceptual cost—once reawakened, the story must leave the library again. The hyperbolic room is the causal engine, but the library itself, not Miriam, supplies the decisive turn; her ritual is observational. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern build → density shift → re-pricing. Orientation is swift and topology is taught early, so no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The impossible corridors and inward-curving walls are not picturesque garnish; they literally compress the scarf’s aura into visible geometry at the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Salt scent and teal silk provide cross-sensory anchoring without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography stays clean even when Euclid is violated. One minor slip: “observed solitude” is asserted more than dramatized through patron blocking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can this scarf’s stories be re-embodied?”—is signaled early and deepened when the weave brightens, narrowing possibility from loss to legacy. Yet Miriam undertakes no trade-off; pressure is ambient, not personal. Escalation is textural (color shift, wall glow) rather than tactical. Sufficient for the length, but no visible price is exacted from the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory survives in physical touch, not digits—emerges through material verbs (clutched, woven, pressed) and the final glowing fold, never sermonized. Subtext flickers in the woman’s silence and Miriam’s preference for night: both avoid daylight’s data glare. Ambiguity is preserved; the library may gift or confiscate. Avoided thematic echo; no character recites the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is erudite yet hushed, mirroring a librarian who dreams in topologies: “Euclid would have wept” is precise, not showy. Long sentences curve like the halls, then tighten for the ritual beat, showing rhythmic control. Free indirect style stays clean; no head-hop. Dialogue is minimal but idiolectic—“You found it” carries reverence without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid descriptive coils to the staccato of “She was not afraid.” Information density is high: one sentence fuses architecture, emotion, and myth. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay consistent (space-fabric, fold-memory). Minor filter verb (“seemed to respond”) but forgiven inside a POV who measures tentatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusing hyperbolic geometry with ancestral textile memory feels fresh; the library’s math literally stores narrative thread. Risk is taken—architectural conceit could have collapsed into gimmick—but the payoff keeps the concept embodied. Not quite 9 because the emotional pivot depends on an external visitor rather than an irreversible librarian choice. Still, specificity (“teal silk worn soft by decades of handling”) supplants generic magic.</comment>
