<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mira’s phosphorescence and skepticism are vivid, but her interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the shift from doubt to resolve is smooth yet cost is only lightly felt. The “earned stasis” lands, but the beats of refusal are narrated summary, not pressured choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breadcrumb-fountain shard adds density until the final release reweights meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (memories freed, Mira’s stance recalibrated) with conceptual cost legible in the dimming glow. One minor loop: “patience of starlight” image repeats without intensification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fountain detritus, cracked tiles, algae-green serpents—selective sensory hits evoke neglect and constrain Mira’s slow excavation. The stained-glass box itself functions as micro-setting, its shifting mosaics guiding her tactile method. Final image of the arm-less statue mirrors the relinquished burden, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—signaled early; pressure escalates through incremental unstick steps, each fountain tightening methodical focus. No live option is foreclosed; cost is atmospheric rather than tactical. Sufficient for length, but price remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient understanding versus easy answers emerges through pattern of fountains and sidereal imagery; no moral is stated. Final “deflating dusk” image reweights earlier glow without sermon. One soft echo: “mysteries simply refused to resolve” flirts with thesis language but is earned by prior beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains coherent distance; diction (“sidereal patience,” “defiant hush”) is consistently elevated, justified by Mira’s star-measured worldview. Rhythm modulates—long accumulative sentences mirroring slow erosion, then shorter releases at memory lift. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence shapes, high information density. Two adjacent “patience” clauses near midpoint loop concept without new pressure. Metaphors coherent; no mixed vehicles. One template cadence: three successive “she...” opens in paragraph 5. None of these touch the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Memory-capture box + breadcrumb trail across dead fountains feels novel yet inevitable. Conceptual risk—sidereal patience as lived method—pays off in closure image. Could swap city name, but box mechanics and glow-skeptic fusion are specific enough to resist generic retread.</comment>
