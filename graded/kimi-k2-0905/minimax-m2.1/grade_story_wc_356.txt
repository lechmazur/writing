<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kalia’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. the stillness the corpse flower demands—is dramatized through daily micro-choices (breathing through aversion, steady harvest). The final renunciation of raw ambition is earned by the months-long causality of scent-based endurance; the cost is legible in the single-line journal entry and the wildflower doodle that replaces the spiral. Only cap is the off-page “three weeks” summary that keeps the endurance from being fully embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: elderflower → wrapping-doodle → corpse-flower pollen pattern reweights ambition into serenity. Closure is a Charged Poise—the wildflower doodle crystallizes the new hierarchy with undeniable conceptual cost (she will never again rush for recognition). Orientation anchored by word 60; no因果 breaks; single time-jump “three months” is cued by “turning of the tide’s thought.” Persistent constraint (hyper-sensitive nose) shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mosshaven’s rope-ladder altitude and greenhouse air are filtered through Kalia’s olfactory bias, constraining every move. The hanging gardens, rain-washed bark, and fermenting flower directly shape her breathing tactics and final pollen harvest. Micro-setting (velvet pouch, dark seed, purple petal) doubles as tool and charged image. Final reprise of “wildflower” links treetop canopy to internal bloom, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform ambition into serenity—tightens once when the bloom’s rot forces her to inhale what revolts her, foreclosing the old rush-for-cures path. Escalation is textural: scent density increases until it reweights her value system; no coincidence. Visible cost is the surrender of “next remedy, next recognition” (stated in text). Could edge higher if one mid-scene loss (tool, time, social credit) had altered tactics earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of doodled spirals→wildflower: transformation through patient endurance of what first repels. Subtext in the wrapping-paper interior drawings embeds memory into mundane material without exposition. Final CR reweights patience from adage to lived necessity. No moralizing; resonance is wholly imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kalia’s perceptual signature—“olfactorily sensitive nose,” “scent-memory,” “ghost of elderflower sap.” Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments slightly during scent assaults, matching breathing rhythm. No head-hop; Elder Sholomi’s dialogue carries subtext (“turning of the tide’s thought”) without invading POV. Distinct aromatic lexicon persists to final wildflower doodle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances scent, emotion, or ritual. Figurative language is spare and organic—“ghost of elderflower sap,” “purple-black like a bruise healing.” Information density high: one line of journal compresses three months of tacit learning. Final paragraph’s quiet cadence earns read-aloud poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: corpse-flower cultivation repurposed into an olfactory coming-of-age; wrapping-doodle folk ritual gives tactile ancestry to introspection. Risk in basing climax on smell rather than action pays off via sensory stakes. Transformation test fails if relocated to ground-level clinic—treetop air and scent concentration are integral. Specific angle feels inevitable yet unseen in prior published work.</comment>
