<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s embodied knowledge of the labyrinth and the coin-as-intention weight give a lived-in interiority; her ‘whispers’ creed is dramatized through two on-page micro-choices (sending workers, facing Reyes). Yet the interior contradiction expected for 9+ never surfaces—no moment where her creed costs her personally or where she doubts it. Closure is Earned Stasis, but the cost is communal, not intimate; the personal stake plateaus rather than deepens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory shard adds density until the final “whispers worked” crystallizes a reweighted social order. Orientation anchored by 80 words; transition at the silent radio hand-off is clean. Closure is Charged Poise: Reyes concedes, Mira descends again, coin warm—cost is the perpetual labor she embraces. No artifact obscures causality; every beat is a because/therefore of attention and trust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Container corridors groan, pool light, swallow sound—each descriptor doubles as navigational intel that Mira exploits. The coin’s brass warmth and the maps’ cloth-soft creases micro-set the body-as-setting rule. Final image of violet storm-light on steel recharges the opening fog-groan; environment directly shapes the tactic of whisper-network. Meets 9+ gate: container geometry constrains every exit decision and charges the last catwalk stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“whispers vs. official channels”—is signaled in the first third and tightened when the radio dies for good. One meaningful deepening: Reyes appears on the catwalk to concede, proving the whispers’ efficacy and foreclosing his authority claim. Cost is legible: Mira’s perpetual return to the maze, coin warming like inherited duty. No secondary reversal, but the single turn is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: old attention outlives high-tech hubris. Coin, key, and folded maps form a quiet triptych of inherited knowing vs. futile mastery. Final image reweights the premise—technology stays silent, flesh-and-voice network endures. No moralizing; resonance lives in the violet flicker on steel and the coin’s inherited warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tight third-person hovers just above Mira’s perceptual floor: “steel groaned in fog” is seafarer idiom, not writerly garnish. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under catwalk tension. Reyes’ single line carries concession subtext; no dialogue over-explains. Voice stays consistent; no POV leakage or filter-verb bloat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from muscular (“She unfolded her maps on a crate…”) to lyric (“light pooled in unexpected corridors”) without purple drift. Zero loops, zero scaffold; each clause adds sensory or causal data. Metaphors (mycelium, sea-goat) are sparse, taught early, paid off. Final paragraph cadence slows to match dawn-after calm—rhythm engineers emotion without announcing it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Geomagnetic blindness forcing a port evacuation by footfall acoustics feels fresh; the whisper-network as counter-infrastructure is specific to this maze. Coin-without-lock and maps-soft-as-cloth invert expected tool utility, reinforcing theme. While “storm shuts tech down” is familiar, the acoustic cartography twist and inherited attention economy make the synthesis non-obvious.</comment>
