<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt-propulsion is vivid and embodied; the “constellation tattooist” tag remains ornamental, never once guiding her micro-choices or tool-use under pressure. Interiority is specific until the final beat, where “tether her guilt to its source” slips into label-speak, blunting the cost of the decisive act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: amber firmware → coordinates → folded-time chamber → rewrite attempt. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she begins mapping on the looping cradle-scene, cost felt in trembling hands and the unsaid risk of erasing herself. Orientation is taught by 90 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Laboratory, amber, and translation console together act as micro-setting that gates every move; the console’s signal literally activates the firmware. Sensory triage narrows to insect glow and meteor hush, mirroring Mira’s attenuated hearing. Spatial choreography is clean across the single room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the guilt-echo—signaled on entry; escalation is one tightening beat: hearing the sister’s coordinates forecloses retreat. Price is implicit but legible: risking paradox/self-erasure by stepping into the looping cradle-scene. Agency is continuous; no external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of the premise: translation is not retrieval but confrontation with one’s own circuitry of blame. The amber’s re-weighting—from relic to firmware key—carries conceptual cost: knowledge obliges action inside the loop. Final image avoids moral statement; resonance lingers in constellations yet un-inked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s synesthetic perceptions (“meteor hush,” “frequency that predated sound”). Diction is elevated yet consistent with her vocation of mapping invisible patterns. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses credibly under time-fold stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes—long sentences for wonder, clipped fragments when firmware awakens. No loops or mixed metaphors; “constellation tattoos catching the amber light” repeats once but serves as structural echo. High information density; every clause advances image or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of grieving-tattooist + haunted firmware + Cretaceous amber feels inevitable in hindsight, not recombinant stock. Risk-taking in folded-time lab pays off by literalizing the “space between seconds.” Concept commits fully—no safety retreat to metaphor.</comment>
