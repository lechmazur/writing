<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miriam’s vocation and obsession are vivid, but her interiority is mostly summary (“she had learned…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice on the page actually risks anything or forfeits an alternative, so the final “discovery” feels observed, not earned. The only embodied beat—falcon landing—doesn’t force a decision that costs her. Earned Stasis is hinted but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the leaf + symbol reweight her map and confirm the convergence, cost felt in the “long uncertainty” now ending. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—patterns of condensation, archival marginalia, falcon return—tightening into a single crystallizing image. No orientation debt; geography and timeline clear by ~100 words. One scaffold loop: “the way moisture gathered differently…” appears twice with no new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Outpost, lake, and frost function as micro-setting: the buckled railing and condensation on the glass actively guide her interpretations and final insight. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through cartographer’s gaze—temperature differentials, ice cracks, indigo cloth—never tourist catalog. The leaf’s alpine origin is the only off-stage detail, but it arrives as evidence, not postcard. Final image of water seeking level reuses setting to reconfigure meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the mythical convergence—signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each archival scrap, condensation pattern, and now the falcon’s cargo thickens the possibility she is right. No live reversal or narrowing option occurs on the page; the beat is confirmatory, not crucible. Cost is conceptual (years of dismissal) rather than a tactical loss dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: maps are living texts rewritten by patient attention, truth accretes like frost. No moralizing; the final image lets water find its level—an unspoken answer to her quest. Ambiguity remains—symbol still unread—so theme resists tidy closure. Leaf/condensation recurrence is functional, not ornamental, reweighting meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent cartographer’s diction: “temperature differentials,” “polyglot’s phrasebook,” “watersheds dismissed as myth.” Rhythm modulates from long analytical sentences to the staccato of falcon arrival, mirroring her pulse. No filter-verb stacks; perception stays embodied in cold glass, ruffled feathers. Voice is distinctive without self-conscious flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence advances atlas, atmosphere, or inference. Only minor loop: “the way all things… find where they belong” abstracts what the image already shows. Metaphors are disciplined—condensation as rivers, frost as clock—never mixed. Read-aloud rhythm breathes at beats of arrival and recognition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Falcon-borne cartography is fresh; convergence-as-origin merges myth and hydrology without exposition dump. Archival marginalia and condensation-reading feel specific to this narrator, not generic scholar. Risk is quiet—no violent reversal—but specificity of indigo cloth, dog-eared polyglot page, and leaf from a single meadow lifts the piece above template. Could swap alpine leaf for another endemic species without breaking arc, hence not indispensable.</comment>
