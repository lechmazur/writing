<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and consistent with the “reader of the in-between” idiom; the lens fragment functions as a concrete micro-choice engine. Yet the grandmother’s deathbed hand-off is relayed rather than dramatized, so the emotional cost is inherited, not freshly earned on page. Still, the final act of wearing the relay visibly crystallizes the inherited flaw into vocation, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lens reframes the protagonist from keeper to conduit, cost legible in the “beam of pure intuition aimed at nothing and everything.” Accumulative lens holds: seventeen years of forgetting tighten into one charged image. Causality remains intact; no orientation debt; transition from stall to painting rotation is the single taught pivot that deepens pattern rather than breaks it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rooftop market is sketched with selective sensory economy—sideways painting, map-seller, musician—each detail filtering through translator-perception. The lens fragment itself serves as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Environment does not merely decorate; it supplies the hidden painting that re-weights the stake. Enough to clear the 9- gate, but the city below stays generic, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—inherit or refuse the Keeper’s relay—surfaces by paragraph 3. Escalation is accretive: each stall vignette thickens the intuition beam until the painting forces the single renunciation-of-ignorance. Cost is felt when the protagonist “unfastened the clasp… let the fragment hang free,” foreclosing ordinary anonymity. One tightening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of generational guidance emerges through refraction imagery rather than thesis: relay, lens, corridor, beam. Final image re-weights “honoring overlooked histories” from archival duty to active continuation, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtextual silence around the Keeper’s death keeps ambiguity productive. One minor echo risk—“the only history that mattered”—skirts proclamation but lands inside POV idiom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a consistent perceptual signature: light moves “strangely,” objects carry “unspoken weights,” the city hums “its unaware song.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under recognition—“The moment, apparently, was now.” No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final refraction. Dialogue is minimal but idiom-true to alchemist argot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from reflective cadence to crystalline closure without scaffold. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—each beam or corridor image advances the translator metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing sentences book-end with “elusively tangible,” now redefined, showing patterned control without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “magical heirloom” trope and re-casts it as vocational relay rather than destiny weapon. Rooftop alchemical market feels specific to this world-layer; hidden painting mechanic is fresh, not wand-ex-machina. Conceptual turn—“not a keeper of memory, but a continuation”—is non-obvious and grows naturally from lens imagery. Risk distinction warranted for sideways painting reveal (+0.3).</comment>
