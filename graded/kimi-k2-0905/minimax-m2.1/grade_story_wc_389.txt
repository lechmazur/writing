<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“loneliness crystallise into hope” is earned. The contradictory loyalties (science vs mystic) are dramatized in her choice to press palm to glass, not merely asserted. Flaw: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A; cost is conceptual (variant allegiance validated) rather than visceral. Still, the variant stance is embodied and drives the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: each radio fragment tightens her resolve, “because/therefore” chain intact. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—portico cracks, prophet enters, reweighting all prior solitude. Cost is legible: the glass she trusted shatters, foreclosing retreat. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory is not backdrop but pressure engine—lightning “boiled below her like a grey ocean,” narrowing escape routes. Cobalt glass functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its fracture is the decisive physical act. Sensory economy favors sound (static hiss) and tactile cold, matching isolation theme. Spatial choreography stays clean as she crosses from console to portico.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: validate her variant allegiance before the scattered houses unite. Escalation via each radio fragment that foretells “child of storms,” tightening options until she must act. Cost: the portico’s destruction, sacrificing her only filter. Agency sits in her deliberate palm-to-glass move; coincidence complicates storm but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “old ways/new ways” fracture, crystallized when ancient glass births the future prophet. No moralizing; final image reweights prior solitude as necessary compost for new light. Subtext of betrayal by both science and mystic circles lingers without exposition. Resonance is conceptual yet felt—variant allegiance vindicated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: radio static as “dying wasps,” lightning as “veins/rivers,” diction stays within Elara’s scholar-hermit lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentary syntax as storm peaks—“like bells” single-line crescendo. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Free indirect slips are clean; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high but pattern-taught early (lightning = veins = rivers), paid off in portico bloom. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; each figurative layer reweights stakes. Sentence variety offsets any purple risk. Final image “figure made of storm and starlight” is precise, not vague glitter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of radio prophecy + cobalt glass + variant allegiance yields fresh angle on “lone oracle” trope. Prophet arrival through shattered time-glass is non-obvious yet inevitable from established physics. Risk-taking (lyric, not explanatory) heightens awe without obscuring causality. Specificity of grandmother-forged glass anchors myth in tactile artifact.</comment>
