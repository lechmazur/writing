<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation and back-story are vividly particularized; the childhood memory flashback crystallizes motive. Yet her interiority stays in luminous, slightly detached metaphor—“the interlaced hush…settling like fine dust”—which can read as performed rather than felt under peak pressure. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the choice to finish unravelling is never seriously doubted, so the final “Earned Stasis” costs less than it could. Still, her perception governs every image, making the character line indivisible from the texture of the piece.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands via Charged Poise: the released spirit mirrors child-Mira, re-weighting her lifelong task in one image, cost felt in the audible shatter of accumulated silence. Causal chain is lean but intact—binding fails → reverse-knot ritual → revelation. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Only the slightest causality wobble: the elder’s “confession” hints at collective guilt yet never translates into tangible obstacle or price for Mira, keeping the beat just shy of decisive tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sanctuary is sensuously lived-in—shards casting “fractured rainbows,” ropes “swollen with salt.” Every descriptive stroke doubles as emotional filter, never pausing the hand that unknots. Spatial logic holds; the single-room choreography is clear. The prism light re-appears at closure, charging the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the trapped spirit—signals early; agency is continuous (each unpicked knot). Pressure escalates texturally: the hush breathes, shimmer grows, options narrow to the last knot. Cost is implied rather than concrete—no tool lost, no social risk—so the tightening stays lyrical, not visceral, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—liberation through dismantling, masks and nets as false faces—emerges entirely through action and image; no statement of thesis. Final reflection re-prices Mira’s vocation without moralizing. Particulars (prisms, salt-stiff rope) carry universal weight; ambiguity lingers about fishermen’s guilt, inviting re-reads. The resonance feels earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s sensorium: “she understood…she felt.” Syntax lengthens and relaxes during unravelling, then compresses at the snap of the last knot, mirroring breath. Metaphorical density is high yet internally coherent, never breaking POV lexicon. Voice-driven elision (“the secret they had shared…”) is taught early and paid off, keeping distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template drumbeat. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—light broken/redirected echoes spirit/mask parallels. Scaffolding is minimal; one paraphrase loop (“remembered being new…remembered why”) is acceptable within lyric pattern. Closing clause “some truths could only be revealed in the breaking” borders on thematic summary but lands as image-charged aphorism, not clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fishermen’s net as imprisoning mask feels fresh; ritual unpicking rather than mending upends reader expectation set up by “mask restorer.” Synthesis of maritime folklore, optic physics, and after-life etiquette is specific to this text. Risk is taken with near-abstract spirit reveal, yet it remains legible under the accumulative lens. Not quite breathtakingly new, but memorably individuated.</comment>
