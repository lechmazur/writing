<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is richly embodied—grief “translated” through skin, bark read as Braille—yet the decisive shift from seeker to carrier-of-stillness is asserted more than dramatized; no micro-choice on the page visibly seals the renunciation, so the cost feels lightly assigned rather than paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of ascending/descending notes tightens the emotional map until the forest’s hush delivers a Charged Poise—Elara’s tearful stand at the stillpoint reweights all prior sensation and forecloses further seeking with undeniable felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Ultrasonic forest and platinum ring work as micro-setting: every tactile detail constrains her non-visual navigation and charges the final inward radiance of the ring; spatial choreography stays exact—bare feet read insect earthquakes, bark Braille guides descent—so environment literally shapes each step and the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the stillpoint—signaled early; pressure escalates via musical interval drops that materialize sorrow underfoot, narrowing her path to a single held breath; absence of external antagonist is replaced by rising internal stakes, cost legible in the final weeping stand that ends the quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of stillness as navigable terrain emerges through sensory pattern, not statement; the closing “quiet blaze that illuminates not the path ahead but the traveler herself” reweights the entire journey into a resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at psychic distance that matches blind perception; rhythmic cadence taught early (“trees sang in registers only the truly blind could navigate”) pays off in the final hush; diction stays within Elara’s sensorium, no register drift, poetic compression remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is patterned and justified—liquid metaphors for sound, mineral for memory—no mixed vehicles; occasional echoing stems (“each ring a year, each year a story”) verge on template cadence but occur early and serve incantatory build-up; closure image remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind cartographer mapping affective topology through sonic dowsing; platinum compass as memory alloy translator is new, yet grounded in tactility; risk-taking in lyric time-suspension succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure reconfigures meaning rather than evaporating into vagueness.</comment>
