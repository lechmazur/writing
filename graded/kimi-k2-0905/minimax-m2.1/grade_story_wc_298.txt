<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—clutching the burned card while trembling, yearning to fill soul-holes yet recognizing the irreversible price—are rendered in embodied, non-generic interiority. The final renunciation (sister absorbed, joy vacated) is fully earned by the orchard’s visual proof of cost. The only micro-slip is “fiercely gentle resolve” used twice, slightly abstract; still, motive tracks cleanly to the closing image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tarot’s fall re-weights the bargain, the sister-tree glows, Elara exits with hollowed joy forever legible. Causal chain holds—card bought → orchard reached → sacrifice activated—under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each bone-root image thickens density until the golden apple beat crystallizes cost. Orientation anchors by line 5; no teleporting props or late rule patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop; silver roots threading skulls constrain Elara’s foot placement and literalize the bargain’s cost, charging the final grafting of sister into trunk. Torch half-light narrows perceptual field, filtering notice to glowing fruit and warm card—objects that decide fate. Spatial choreography remains stable; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover sister’s spirit—announced early; pressure tightens once as golden fruit reveals transference price, foreclosing resurrection. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she drops the card, accepting permanent joy-excision. Cost is on-page and irrevocable, meeting lens criteria.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “honored absence” emerges from concrete vegetal imagery rather than thesis statement; the closing line that holes are “inlayed, not patched” re-configures prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: reader cannot decide if the bargain ennobles or diminishes her—exactly the complexity sought.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a rhythmic, slightly liturgical cadence consistent with ritual setting; diction (“trammel,” “communion”) stays within Elara’s esoteric lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under torchlight to match breath-rate. One clause (“architecture of being”) edges toward abstraction but is saved by bodily context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; strong verbs (“snaked,” “warped,” “hollowed”) minimize adjectives. Figurative layers serve thematic density without clutter; no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Only micro-loop: “fiercely gentle” repeated; not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Underworld orchard grown from corpses is fresh, yet anchored in mythic precedent; tarot-as-currency particularizes the economy. Final inversion—sister becomes tree, grief becomes literal root system—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in abstract noun-phrases occasionally flirts with overwriting, but specificity of bone-threaded roots grounds it.</comment>
