<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s professional gaze and methodical documentation are vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“reminder of pattern recognition”). No micro-choice visibly costs her anything; the climax is pure cognition. The patch never re-enters action to refract motive. Competent, but the arc is observation, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pattern she reads rewrites the “accident” into engineered convergence, with the fog-writ wind-marks as felt cost. Causal chain holds—survey → data → reclassification—under Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (entry → amphitheatre) is clean. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Container geometry, rust streaks, and wind-tunnel howl are tactile and steer her survey path. Fog density measured against bolt-rattle integrates environment into method. Final image of wind-writing on metal recharges setting as text. Container labyrinth visibly constrains her movement and thus the data set—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the hidden pattern—tightens when the vortex’s bolt-loosening force gives visceral confirmation. One meaningful deepening: evacuation flips from panic to deliberate cultivation, narrowing her moral option to expose it. Cost is implicit but legible: the town’s silence becomes collateral she must now carry. No second reversal, but single intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—catastrophe as readable, possibly authored, convergence—emerges through wind-sorted debris, not lecture. Final image of “hidden mathematics demanding payment” reweights prior cargo-shift data into moral ledger. Ambiguity lingers: is she witness or abettor? No moral spoon-feeding. Patch motif underused; slight deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s instrument-filtered perception; anemometer readings replace emotional exposition. Syntax lengthens under fog, shortens under vortex—rhythmic mimicry of pressure. No head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“singular convergence”) risks register drift but stays within investigator lexicon. Distinctive, controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description plus data value—maintaining momentum. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“fog…held breath”) are sparse and purposeful. One mixed vehicle: “wind…into a weapon” is abstract but brief. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match crystallizing dread. Clean, efficient, near-publish level.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Takes standard disaster-investigation frame but reframes evacuation as intentional pattern-cultivation, giving fresh moral tilt. Wind-sorted debris as forensic text feels novel. Container labyrinth repurposed from backdrop to active conspirator. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent but not radically destabilizing. Fresh enough for literary venue.</comment>
