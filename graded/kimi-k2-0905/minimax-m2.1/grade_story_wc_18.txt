<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is evocative—her certainty of foot and purpose—but we never see contradictory impulses collide in-scene; the “synchronized breathing” choice is reported, not dramatized, so the final endurance feels pre-ordained rather than paid for. No visible cost or micro-choice alters her hierarchy of values on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror shows “glass mountains” and reweights the premise, with fog-bound orchard as persistent constraint. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift replace because/therefore—yet the sextant’s prior emotional stake is only told, not tested, so the cost is more conceptual than felt; still, lens holds and image reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ruined conservatory, gnarled apple trunks, and fog-as-membrane are continuously filtered through Mira’s glass-maker gaze; the broken sextant’s brass arms physically frame the final mirror, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (workbench, breath on glass) constrains the breathing method, anchoring the speculative mechanic in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the mirror hold the runaway dream?—is signaled early and tightens once as glass and breath synchronize, but the beat is narrated summary, not an on-page fork that forecloses an option; pressure accumulates lyrically rather than causally. Cost is conceptual (erasure of boundary) rather than a tangible forfeiture felt by Mira in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emergent theme of permeability—mirror as membrane, fog as half-world—grows from concrete particulars; final image of dissolving glass mountains reweights the astronomer’s lost dream without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis, but theme remains slightly abstract because the dream is never particularized beyond “glass mountains.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—selective attention to glass, frost, orchard stones—and rhythmic sentence stacks mimic breath pattern; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinct texture in phrases like “mist in permanent embrace” and “lattice of tiny crystals,” yet syntax remains controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual duty—image and concept—without scaffold; only minor loop occurs (“boundary…erasing boundaries”). Metaphors stay coherent within fog-glass membrane logic. Strong read-aloud rhythm and precise noun choice; no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing broken navigational instrument with dream-catching mirror offers fresh angle on threshold-objects; orchard-outside-time and breath-glass synchronization feel specific to this voice. Risk is lyric/textural rather than plot-twist, but transformation stays grounded in Mira’s craft. Could edge higher if dream content were more particularized.</comment>
