<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s grief is embodied through tactile ritual—polishing, folding, watching the lantern-dream—so the interior engine is vivid. Yet the “luminous torment” tag is repeated instead of freshly enacted in the final beat, blunting the cost. The micro-choice to keep folding another crane does foreclose hope of release, so the renunciation is earned, just not freshly gut-punching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polished gem and folded crane thickens the pattern until the lantern replays the lost shadow, reweighting grief. Closure is a Charged Poise—she begins the next crane with no illusion of recovery—cost felt in the eternal twilight that keeps glowing. One causality hiccup: the basilica commission is dropped without on-page consequence, a minor loose linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Tea-garden steam, crystalline leaves, and dream-lit basilica glass are filtered through Mira’s selective attention, never touristic. The lantern itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains her: she must keep feeding it cranes or the dream dies. Final image reuses the violet/amber twilight first seen on the workbench, now internalized—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep the dead dreaming just a little longer”—tightens once when she refuses the basilica and again when she folds the next crane, narrowing her life to perpetual repetition. Cost is legible: eternal servitude to the lantern. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the pulse inside the glass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated images of containment—gem, crane, lantern—showing that preservation is also confinement. No moral is stated; the final crane-fold lets reader feel the double edge. The “luminous torment” refrain almost over-articulates, but its final whisper is subsumed into action, so resonance survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance that matches Mira’s trance; syntax lengthens and contracts with the polishing rhythm. Diction stays within her craft lexicon—valley fold, cloud-sea—without forced elevation. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable; sentences carry double duty—mood and information—without scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“gray morning like smoke from a candle she'd forgotten to extinguish”) risk purple, but the cadence is pattern-taught early and sustains. No loops or paraphrase beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dream-recording lanterns and grief-folded cranes synthesize fresh magic from familiar origami/memorial tropes. The inversion—ascension equals descent—anchors world-logic without exposition dump. Risk lies in the lyric stillness; it pays off because the final image is inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
