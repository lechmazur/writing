<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Thalassor’s shift from certainty to questioning is vivid, but the interior work is narrated rather than dramatized; no embodied contradiction plays out in a single beat. The diver moment is too brief to test his new stance under pressure, so the cost feels vicarious instead of personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the statue renounces guardianship for witnessing, ampoule fades in palm, cost legible. Accumulative lens holds—images layer until meaning reweights—but causal tether is light; the diver encounter is consequence, not catalyst, so tightening is modest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kelp forests, anemones, and oyster pearls are filtered through Thalassor’s evolving lens, each doubling as metaphor and lived fact. The garden’s contradictory ecology materially shapes his epiphany; the ampoule’s purple fade charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. embrace contradiction—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accretion of memories, but no beat forces Thalassor to act or surrender a concrete guard-duty tactic; the diver scene complicates without narrowing his options, so cost remains conceptual rather than tactical.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: certainty as cruelty, contradiction as life. The foxglove duality and coral’s animal-mineral paradox reprice the premise without moralizing. Final image of “keeper of questions” offers resonant, non-literal answer; ambiguity stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric, oceanic cadence taught in opening line and sustained; telepathic diction stays mineral-cold yet curious. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent—stone-filtered, tide-paced. Minor filter-verb clusters (“he began to see”) but voice remains singular and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe with variable rhythm; metaphors (tapestry thread, light through water) are restrained and coherent. One paraphrase loop (“both...both...”) and slight scaffold in epiphany paragraph keep it from 9.0, but no figurative muddle touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Living statue gaining sentience through accumulated death-whispers feels fresh; foxglove-as-epistemological-weapon is specific rather than ornamental. Risky accumulative structure taught early and paid off, though reef-setting tropes are familiar; the conceptual reweighting rescues inevitability.</comment>
