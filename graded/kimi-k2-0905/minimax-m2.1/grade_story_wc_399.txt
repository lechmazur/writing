<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s half-mask and peripheral-seeing trait are vivid, but she never makes a micro-choice that costs her anything; the walk is observational. The interior contradiction between “seeing too much” and “truly important seeing” is announced, not dramatized. Because no boundary actually shifts or breaks during the patrol, the promised “endurance with cost” stays conceptual. The final beat is a restatement of motive, not a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle re-affirmation—“the echo would still be there to answer”—a Charged Poise that reconfigures nothing and exacts no visible price. The causal chain is purely iterative: she walks, tends, remembers, will walk again; no option narrows. The prophet’s absence is backstory weight without present leverage. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the cadence swells but never tightens, so the ending feels like a pause, not a turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dunes that “murmur,” sand grains that “rearrange themselves,” and a pavilion roof woven from impossible plant fibers give tactile otherness. The kinetic parapet is sensed through palm-pressure, making the desert a living instrument Mira must play. Spatial anchors hold: patrol route, pavilion center, buried mechanism. Only the “conjured clearings” remain un-located, a faint blur in an otherwise sharp map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“lines are forgetting themselves”—are declared early but never tested on-page; no boundary slips or threatens to. The single pressure point is her own fatigue of purpose, not external opposition. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the patrol ends where it began. Cost is asserted (“someone had to remember”) but not dramatized, keeping escalation flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-boundary-tending emerges through sand, echo, and repetition rather than thesis. The final image of a future child hearing the echo offers resonant continuity without moralizing. Yet the piece circles the same insight three times, thinning subtext. Ambiguity is present but not charged, because no alternative stance to Mira’s is staged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: left-side excess, right-side trust, peripheral awareness. Syntax lengthens and breathes with dunes, then contracts inside the pavilion’s “whisperfield calm,” mirroring her shift. No head-hop or register drift. The lyric cadence is consistent, taught by line one and sustained to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet economical: “sand grains rearranged themselves at certain hours” does triple sensory, temporal, and uncanny duty. Occasional softeners—“seemed to grow,” “almost comprehensible”—slightly dampen authority. No loops or mixed metaphors; one paraphrase loop (“the prophet’s words continued to echo…”) is forgiven for incantatory effect. Overall rhythm supports momentum without purple drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic boundary-walker tending living desert geometry feels fresh, but the prophet-as-absent-god and memory-keeper trope is familiar. Innovation lies in kinetic parapet and peripheral-seeing as practical craft, not metaphor. Risk is moderate: no structural experiment, but world logic is confidently inhabited. Specificity of sand-murmur and plant-fiber roof lifts it above generic eco-mysticism.</comment>
