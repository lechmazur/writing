<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present but stays summary-level (“buried talent… garden to be cultivated”); no embodied micro-choice under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (“she would leave… carry them”), satisfying the 9+ test structurally, yet the beat itself is narrated, not dramatized, keeping it just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s permission-vocabulary reweights her stance toward her gift; cost is felt in the pain of sudden memory. Causal linkage holds: buried talent → seven nights refusal → seed-question → permission → decision to exit. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift at the glowing stone tightens the stake without fracture. No orientation debt; all anchors clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain constrains every move: infinite shelves channel her wandering; the velvet-wrapped stone’s feather ridges mediate the pivotal touch. Micro-setting (glass fingertips, mercury eyes) charges the final image. Environmental detail is selective, sensory, and POV-filtered; no tourism. Meets 9+ gate: the stone’s texture directly shapes the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remembering without fear—is signaled early and tightens once when she plants the seed-question; the stone’s glow forecloses refusal. Cost is legible: pain of memory floods back immediately. Escalation is single-point but sufficient for 600-word scope. No reversal, yet the deepening reweights options under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (visions still substitute reality) shapes the exit decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: home as language one learns to speak with one’s whole being. The stone’s permission-vocabulary reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and tactile image; no thesis stated. Final image reweights the opening wound—remembering shifts from injury to vocation. Complexity lingers: she leaves sanctuary to risk prophecy in the world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “digestive tract of knowledge,” “mountains of letters like feather.” Perceptual signature is glass-mercury bias—light, reflection, translucence—never head-hops. Compression (“seven nights… eighth night”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with pressure: short declarative at climax. Dialogue brief, subtextual, keeper’s voice carries storm echo. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong information density; most sentences double-duty. One paraphrase loop (“lost language… language of her ancestors”) costs −0.2. Mixed metaphors absent; rhythm varies, paragraph cuts clean. No scaffold or filter stacks. Figurative language is sparse under peak beat, avoiding purple. Minor loop keeps it sub-9; closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses oracle, living library, and lithic linguistics into non-obvious synthesis. Feather-textured stone as translation engine feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (mercury-glass seer, mountain-bookstore) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity throughout: “architecture of grief,” “vocabulary of healing.” Transformation test fails if names swapped—detail is irreplaceable.</comment>
