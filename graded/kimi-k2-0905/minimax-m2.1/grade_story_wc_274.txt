<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the weight on her chest—but the moment of decision is abstracted into “she initiated the transmission” without micro-choice detail. Still, her contradiction (duty vs truth) stays live and the cost lands as the networks sing. A hair more embodied final beat would push 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: letter arrives → truths crack belief → she transmits. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the networks awaken, silence shifts to held breath. Orientation within 120 words; no lens drift. Could use one sentence of concrete consequence preview to hit 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Library-as-body: cryogenic vaults, humming floor, snow-muffled silence all filter through Kira’s sensory hierarchy. The setting constrains—only she can unlock the networks—and the final image reweights the quiet from shroud to breath. Micro-setting (crystalline interface) handled on-page. One more tactile beat with the interface would nail 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs reveal—tightens when the letter’s contraband truth cracks her mythology. Escalation is causal: reading → internal rupture → transmission. Cost is legible: the quiet transforms, networks sing, she forfeits her custodial identity. A sharper external jeopardy hint would lift higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme—history as curated silence vs living truth—emerges through the letter’s reweighting of “enemy.” Subtext lives in the lovers’ hidden signatures beneath official lies. Final image of silence becoming breath offers resonant non-literality. Avoids moralizing; one fresher metaphor could edge 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kira’s perceptual filter; diction (“cryogenic stasis,” “contraband truths”) suits archivist precision. Rhythm swells from hushed clauses to the final network-song cadence. No head-hopping. One stray adjective (“dizzying quiet”) nudges toward telling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence shapes, high density. No loops or scaffold. Figurative control mostly clean; “small apocalypse demolishing mythology” is vivid but stacked. Closure sentence lands cleanly. Minor: filter verb cluster (“seemed to muffle”) could trim.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Frozen-archive-as-panopticon feels fresh; lovers-as-enemies twist is canon but reframed through cryogenic preservation. Specific detail—crystalline interface, temporal stasis—grounds the concept. Transformation test passes: story collapses without archive silencing. Risk is moderate; a bolder structural rupture could add +0.3.</comment>
