<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the need to keep forecasting—stays embodied in fever-raw mouth, trembling hands, aurora-lit frost. The smudge-touch is a micro-choice that tilts her stance; grief’s weight is measured in the exact moment she swallows it and issues the warning. Earned endurance costs her the last of her self-exculpation, foreclosing the escape route of resignation. All motivation stays strictly character-bound; no therapeutic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s fingers on the keys crystallise a new operational stance—“certainty as collection of margins”—with felt cost (the swallowed stone of guilt). Causal linkage holds: because she touches the smudge → therefore reweights certainty → therefore transmits the warning. Accumulated aurora/illustration imagery reconfigures meaning without external resolution. Persistent constraint: the storm she once mis-read now becomes the first she faces under her new epistemic rule, cost locked into the frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Mountain station, frost-laced window glass, and the smudged botanical print each constrain choice: the print’s paper texture is the pivot beat; the glass pane once salvaged by Elena now frames Mira’s decision. Weather console and pressure read-outs supply tactile, lived-in detail that alters tactics—she types only after reading the drop. Spatial choreography is immaculate: cot → console → illustration → console → aurora-lit storm. Environment charges the final image: auroral grief-light on the smudge becomes the lasting visual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she bear to forecast again after killing Elena—tightens when pressure plummets and the aurora flares. Tightening beat: touching the smudge narrows her options to “warn or flee”; she chooses warn, price = permanent self-indictment kept conscious. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (aurora timing) but does not resolve. Cost is visible: her throat swallows old terror along with the stone of truth, now legible in the final broadcast.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: forecast error as swallowed stone, flower outlasting storm, aurora as pale grief. Subtext in the smudge—Elena’s imperfect human trace—reweights guilt into forgiveness without moralising. Final image (auroral light on smudge) offers non-literal answer: truth can be held gently, not gulped. No abstract thesis stated; resonance lingers in the gray mark lit by green fire.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature: copper mouth, branching frost-rivers, “station’s steel bones.” Syntax compresses under fever-aftershock—fragments like “Her mouth tasted like copper and regret”—then lengthens as certainty re-anchors. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Distinct rhythmic control: fever-fragments vs. steady forecast diction mirrors her swing from doubt to operational poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay physically coherent: aurora as curtain of pale grief, frost as branching rivers. High density—“fever’s absence,” “stone of grief,” “ damaged antenna” all carry double duty. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with pressure; no overwriting in climax. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological fault-tolerance + botanical illustration + aurora-lit grief yields a quiet sci-fi of epistemic ethics. Risk in lyric stillness pays off: storm arrives off-stage while climax occurs at console and paper smudge. No derivative templates; oracle trope is re-cast through artisanal detail (salvaged window-glass frame). Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
