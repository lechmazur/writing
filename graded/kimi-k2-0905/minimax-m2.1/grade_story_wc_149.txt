<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s sorrow-soaked endurance lands as a lived contradiction—ghost who cherishes life, debtor who bestows gifts. The bead-clutch, veil-trail, and chill-bloom causally chain her penance to the gardener’s transformation, so the final release feels earned. One minus: centuries of off-stage penance are summarized rather than dramatized, muting micro-choices that could sharpen present stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: each ghost-touch thickens pattern until silver sap and tears reweight meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—the instant gardener’s tear acknowledges inherited curse/ gift; cost is legible (“loving venom enter her bloodstream”). Orientation crystal by ¶3; no lens break; causal chain intact; persistent constraint (debt) shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass greenhouse, artificial moons, silvering sap, and frost-ferment air supply tactile constraints: bead warms against glass, roses react to chill—setting directly enables beat-level changes. Selective sensory triage keeps momentum. Final image of night pressing its face to glass re-codes earlier dome imagery into imminent threshold—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“awaken scions or debt never ends”—signaled early and tightened when ghost-touch forces silver growth; one visible price: gardener unknowingly accepts lifelong servitude via venom-blood. Under Accumulative lens intensification is a pattern-swell, not reversal; sufficient at this length. No coincidence; escalation coherent; options foreclose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—life-debt and loving harm—emerges through graft, venom, and tear rather than statement. Ambiguity survives: is gift salvation or trap? Final tear reconfigures reader’s weight of “loving venom,” achieving Conceptual Repricing. No sermonizing; complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric, winter-cracked cadence taught in paragraph one and held; perceptual signature (“smoke refusing to rise,” “luminous coffin”) remains ghost-bound. No head-hop; psychic distance stable; compression (“She had been white once…”) economical. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses drift, short bursts solidify at climax when bead warms. Voice serves pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density lines (“alchemical roses bloom faster in her wake”) advance both atmosphere and causality. Metaphors interlock rather than compete; no mixed vehicles in peak beat. One minor scaffold: “before the fire, before the smoke…” paraphrase could trim, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm deliberate and intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ghost-orchard trope made specific by alchemy-graft economics and centuries-installment debt; loving venom as growth catalyst reverses typical life/death binary. Risky lyric escalation pays off in silver-sap image. Synthesis feels inevitable after first paragraph yet not predictable.</comment>
