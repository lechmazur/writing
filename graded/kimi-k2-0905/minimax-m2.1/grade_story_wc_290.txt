<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and inherited duty are embodied in trembling hands and forward motion; the compass-warmth gives a tactile link to Grandfather that justifies pressing on. The final beat—“passages of possibility”—shows a credible, earned shift from terror to defiance, the cost being the lifelong fear she must keep carrying. Interior voice stays specific, avoiding therapy-speak; only slight over-naming of emotion (“mounting panic”) keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: fear → compass cue → organ paralysis → memory trigger → key retrieval → stance flip, all on-page. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tunnels re-perceived as “passages of possibility” carries conceptual cost—she now bears the key and the silence-breaking duty. Orientation and lens are clear by 120 words; one minor lull during the organ description slows momentum but doesn’t break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stone cold, narrowing walls, amber-lit compass, crystallized-silence alcove—details are filtered through claustrophobic attention and steer action. Impossible geometry is shown via Elara’s disorientation, not exposition. The compass re-appears at climax to guide the final discovery, satisfying the 9-band constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the key or surrender to earth’s forgetting—is signaled early and tightened when the organ’s dirge halts her advance, forcing a choice: retreat or claim inheritance. The tightening costs her residual innocence; she exits knowing future descents are now obligatory, not optional. One clear escalation suffices under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion against oblivion emerges through spatial warping and the continuing organ hymn rather than exposition. Final re-perception of tunnels reframes the earlier “terrible pull” into voluntary custodianship, reweighting silence vs. story without moralizing. Image of compass-warmth and lone organ crystallizes the argument organically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s body and perceptual quirks; diction—“mounting panic,” “origami made of shadow”—matches her anxious lyricism. Rhythm swells then contracts with organ notes, mirroring her paralysis and restart. No head-hopping or register drift; minor repetition of “stone” and “cold” slightly dulls high-band shine.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“clawed,” “fold,” “pulse”). Occasional modifier stacks (“impossible geometry,” “crystallized silence”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; one instance of near-paraphrase—“personal affront” / “weight of stone and soil”—drops it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “spatial mutiny” premise refreshes classic descent-into-earth trope; the continuing organ beacon left by an unknown predecessor adds eerie logic. Compass-as-key-finder fuses profession relic with magical utility, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present but moderately safe; still, specificity of claustrophobic perception keeps it memorable.</comment>
