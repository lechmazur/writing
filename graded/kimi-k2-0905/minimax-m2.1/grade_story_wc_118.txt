<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “oddness” is evoked rather than dramatized; he never makes a micro-choice under pressure that reveals interior contradiction. The final hopeful turn (“perhaps there were still dreams enough in stories”) is asserted, not earned by an on-page sacrifice or risk. His motivation to “collect stories walls have heard” remains static; nothing forecloses an alternative path, so no cost is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing—tapestry dragons pulse, hinting stories might rekindle dreams—visible on the final line. Causal chain is thin: reading Miriam’s diary does not alter Elias’s tactics; it merely confirms his hunch. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases but never tightens options, so pressure stays flat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Reclaimed-silo library is concretely anchored—curved concrete, wheat ghost-smell, iron fireplace mouth—each detail filtered through Elias’s relic-attuned gaze. The tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting: it warms in his hands, re-weighting the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment supplies both tools (diaries) and mood, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can stories reboot dreams?—is declared early but never tested by an on-page obstacle or irreversible choice. No middle beat narrows options; Elias simply keeps reading. Cost is conceptual only (world stayed cracked), not personalized or paid. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, so pressure plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—narrative as last antifreeze against cosmic frost—emerges through accreted images of ash, cracked skies, and gold-thread dragons. No moralizing line spoils the resonance. The medieval tapestry reappears with altered charge, supplying a quiet reconfiguration. Ambiguity lingers without confusion, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is scholar-tactile—“language of ash,” “brass tools,” “bronze quiet.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then tightens into a single hopeful clause at exit, mirroring mood. No register drift or filler filters. Voice-driven elisions (“the silence of the post-dream world pressed”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with discovery—long sensuous sentences for archive work, staccato clause for the sky-crack realization. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds texture or knowledge. One mixed metaphor (“sky hung at an impossible angle”) is allowed; it doesn’t tangle causality. Final line is clean, propulsive, and recharges tapestry image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dreams as depleted fuel source is fresh; dragons reframed as failed guardians reverses trope without meta-winks. Post-dream antiquarian in a grain silo library feels specific, not interchangeable. Conceptual risk—stillness as climax—lands coherently. No derivative scaffolding; the synthesis earns its novelty.</comment>
