<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—her ritual with the pen, her comfort with doubt, her tactile tracing of contingent echoes—and the final recognition is earned by the patient attention we’ve watched. The “confidently uncertain” trait is more than label: it governs her non-standard method and the cost of remaining at this outpost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test narrowly missed, but motivation stays consistent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bent signal is revealed as a response, re-weighting exile as filtration, not failure. Cost is felt in the earlier career derailment and the ongoing isolation; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern-break of the folded echo reframes her exile into purpose. Causality holds: the anomaly filters, her method listens, recognition arrives. Line-level artifacts do not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is not postcard scenery; it literally warps signal paths, forcing her contingent method and supplying the final “refining” metaphor. The pen functions as micro-setting—its weight in her palm anchors several beats and its memory charges the closing idea that tools filter wisdom. Sensory economy is tight: amber light, dried nib, radio-fold imagery, all filtered through her interpreter bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning from noise—tightens when the folded signal resists standard isolation; her contingent method is the only path left, narrowing options. Escalation is incremental but coherent: each failed protocol raises the cost of trusting her dismissed technique. The final recognition that the signal is a response reweights the stake; the price is the years already lost and the future spent listening at the edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reframed mistake: filtration rather than failure. The anomaly, the pen, and the signal all act as filters that remove noise until meaning remains—no moralizing line spells this out. Final image of sitting with the universe’s breath offers quiet conceptual repricing: exile becomes elective vigil. Ambiguity lingers—who answered?—but the emotional after-effect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual signature—radio-fold origami, amber light on obsolete nib—without head-hop. Syntax breathes: long sentences for patient listening, fragments at recognition. No dialogue, so voice carries idiom through her internal lexicon (“celestial signal interpreter,” “confidently uncertain”). Register stays within her professional reach; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence advances character, image, or concept; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and taught early—“origami made of radio waves”—then pays off at closure. Rhythm modulates with attention: patient accumulation mirrors the unbending process. Minor over-modulation in “strange comfort settled over her like a familiar blanket…” but it lands the emotional beat without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: exile-as-filter rather than punishment, signal-as-conversation rather than message. Gravitational anomaly as narrative loom is a non-obvious synthesis of hard-SF premise with lyric interiority. Risk stays conceptual, not structural; freshest inflection is the anomaly refining rather than distorting. Could edge higher if the anomaly’s rules had been exploited even more surprisely.</comment>
