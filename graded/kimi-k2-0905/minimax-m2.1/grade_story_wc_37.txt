<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “shattered mirror” mind shown through tactile ritual—but her contradictory impulses remain summary (“laughed and wept”) rather than dramatized in the decisive beat. The final self-dispersion is motivated, yet the cost reads abstract because the prose tells “she became less whole” instead of rendering the felt erasure beat-by-beat. A single on-page micro-choice under final stress would have lifted this into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the released dawn refracts through the shattered mica, charging the realm with hope while Elara’s identity is the price—an unmistakable before/after. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each re-wound strip of song thickens the pattern until the cadence break of shattering glass reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early by the phosphorescent greenhouse; no causal or spatial drift intrudes. One tightening beat suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mica greenhouse saturates every beat—phosphorescent roots, crystalline shards, refracted dawn—guiding Elara’s ritual and finally constraining the cost (the windows must shatter for light to escape). Selective sensory triage narrows to touch and sight under crisis, keeping detail purposeful. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from aisle to Heart-Tree to imploding walls. Micro-setting (the silver bark she swaddles) functions as the crucible object that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore dawn—signals in line 2 and tightens once: the Binding Chant’s final note forces the trade of Elara’s fragmented self for collective hope. Agency is present (she chooses to sing), pressure escalates through the dimming Heart-Tree and trembling panes, and the cost is legible on-page as her identity pours outward. No reversal is required at this length; the single deepening satisfies Accumulative escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as communal ligament versus individual identity. The refracted dawn reweights the earlier “woven dawns” motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in the silenced songs and the cracked mirrors—communal fracture literalized—yet the final image keeps meaningful ambiguity about whether a realm that needs such sacrifice deserves sunrise. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s fractured perception; diction (“wounded heartbeat,” “ghostly phosphorescence”) mirrors her splintered cognition without purple overload. Rhythm accelerates into the shatter sequence, then crystallizes in the short closing sentence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught early and paid off in the refracted dawn image—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“shattered mirror… mirror cracks”) is allowable motif reinforcement rather than scaffold. High information density; each line performs dual duty of atmosphere and causal preparation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “mirror world without sunrise” trope is revitalized through alchemical botany and memory-cloth song-weaving, specific to this voice. The sacrifice-of-self-for-collective-light arc feels inevitable yet non-generic because the mechanics (mica refraction, song-strands) are uniquely integrated. Risk in lyric density pays off: the final reconfiguration could not swap places with any other fantastical setting without breaking the logic.</comment>
