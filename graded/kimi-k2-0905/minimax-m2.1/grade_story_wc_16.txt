<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and musically inflected, but the prose occasionally over-articulates her emotions (“hope rise like a melody”) rather than letting tremor or breath show. The 3-yr estrangement is felt, yet Elian remains an off-page silhouette until the final beat, so the relationship-as-crucible pressure is inferred, not dramatized. Micro-choices (uncorking, writing) are present and tied to the promise-keeping motive, earning the cautious smile at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the manuscript is decoded, silence breaks, and mutual tears price the reunion. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of language imagery builds to cadence shift rather than causal dominoes—and the pattern holds. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty applied. One structural soft-spot: the eleven-year stake is asserted, not evidenced in-scene, so the time-scale cost is more abstract than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The Extinct Language Archive is rendered as hush, amber lamplight, and raised glyphs under fingertips—selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s phonological obsession. The glass ink well re-appears and warms in her hand at the climax, charging the final image, so it satisfies the micro-setting 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; she never drifts into white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore collaborative truth after silence—is signaled early. The middle tightening is the act of writing the prophecy: one mis-stroke could shatter trust, a credible point-of-no-return. Cost is present (ink warms, years of credibility on the line), but because the Council or external consequences stay off-page, the escalation feels internal and contained rather than expansive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language as covenant, honesty as survival requirement. The final cadence reweights prior images (ink, silence, symphonies) without sermonizing. No thematic echo violations; the concept stays implicit in the fugue metaphor and the tearful reunion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical yet precise register that matches Elara’s synaesthetic ear. Syntax modulates—long breathless clauses build to short cadences mirroring musical resolution. No head-hopping; Elian’s interior is responsibly left opaque until dialogue. Filter verbs are minimal and justified by the perceptual lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphors stay within sonic/lexical field, no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase loops (“silence … quiet resonance … held-breath”) dock 0.2. Rhythm is intentional; read-aloud flow works. No artifact appears in the final third, so 9+ remains open for other categories.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Dead language that kills itself by requiring honesty” is a fresh twist on the forbidden-text trope. Embedding it in linguistic harmonic theory and synaesthetic music elevates the concept above typical decoder puzzles. While archives and estranged mentors are familiar, the fusion with musical grammar and the glass ink well as resonant object particularizes the treatment.</comment>
