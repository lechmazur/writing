<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—scavenger pragmatism vs. spectral self-negotiation—are dramatized in embodied beats (camera lifts, booted steps on impossible water). The final renunciation lands with felt cost: she accepts “exhaustion, too, is a kind of peace,” foreclosing redemption. Interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic speak (“failure is ordinary”) but stays grounded in concrete sensorium. Ghost-as-status dynamic is cleanly staged, no second character needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: camera stills, lagoon holds, ghost watches—options reweighted without tidy repair. Accumulative lens holds: each collected fragment layers sediment into the final stasis. Orientation is taught early via physics-defying lagoon, waiving anchor penalty. One causality hiccup: camera suddenly “catches” all stories at once—slight teleport, but the image crystallizes the rule-shift rather than breaks it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon/cloud-carousel dyad is not backdrop; it constrains every step (boots on water, sky-music residue). Disposable camera wheel doubles as micro-setting that charges closure when it “finally went still.” Sensory economy is lyric-selective—“ribbons of melody that unraveled upward like smoke”—yet tactile. Spatial choreography stays coherent across paradoxical geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the ghost cede the right to haunt?—tightens via accretion of overheard failures. No external antagonist; pressure is ontological: each fragment adds weight to the camera literal and metaphorical. Cost is legible when Mira admits she carries “other people’s abandoned futures.” A single deeper tightening would punch into 8.8+ territory, but escalation stays within accumulative logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse cartography of scavenging abandoned dreams; no explicit thesis, only image-argument. Final reconfiguration—exhaustion as peace—reprices ambition itself without moral tag. Subtextual irony: the cartographer-voice never mapped anything; the scavenger ends by refusing to chart her own wreck. Quiet ending earns resonance through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: “water that should have been” cues paradox-tilted attention. Rhythm modulates from long breathless cadences to the final clipped stillness, matching lagoon’s fracture. Diction stays within lexicon of seasoned scavenger—“salvage,” “sediment,” “plastic teeth.” No dialogue to contaminate voice; internal monologue avoids filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and musical; metaphors are self-consistent (smoke-ribbon music, sediment in plastic). One scaffold loop near midpoint—“fragments... fragments... fragments”—but it serves accumulative pattern, not artifact. No mixed metaphors in peak beat; camera stilling is literal and symbolic simultaneously. Opening/ending lines are ear-tested for cadence punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating scavenger negotiating her own ghost above a stalled cloud-carousel is non-obvious synthesis. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off in charged final image. Conceptual integrity never retreats from surreal premise; specificity keeps it from gimmick. Familiar “haunted by self” trope is retooled through material detritus of overheard ambitions.</comment>
