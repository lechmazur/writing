<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s patience and wariness feel lived-in; the watch-fob as tactile heirloom anchors her motives. Yet her interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“what it meant to capture the sound of trust breaking”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final micro-choice—risk keeping the fob—reads more as thematic echo than as a value hierarchy forced by prior causal beats; cost is implied, not felt. Still, her perceptual filter stays consistent and specific to a smuggler’s child.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fob warms, sunrise nears, and Mara faces the audible fracture of trust—an imagistic RR with conceptual cost. Causality holds: each false start tightens her willingness to stay, so the final standoff is earned. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity. The only drag is a mid-scene loop of “learned patience / watched rhythm” that slightly stalls escalation before the scarred woman appears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pirate market is evoked through sensory triage—salt, kerosene, creaking planks—filtered by Mara’s practiced gaze. Rotting-pier geography stays coherent; exits and lanterns track. The fob serves as micro-setting that finally charges the image. Weather and tide remain background; no world-rule contradiction, but environment never actively constrains her tactical choices beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve truth about father vs. surrender his lucky fob—tightens once, at the final hand-off. Each failed meeting raises the sunk-cost pressure; the scarred woman’s arrival crystallizes the last option. Agency is present: Mara voices the refusal, feels the fob warm. Cost is conceptual (she may now “capture the sound herself”) rather than tangible; that slightly blunts the felt price needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited trust and its audible fracture emerges through the fob’s frozen hands and the market’s enforced silence. No explicit thesis; final image reweights “curiously steadfast” into a curse Mara may now own. Subtext in the woman’s smile and the warming metal invites multiple readings—inheritance as burden or empowerment. Ambiguity is purposeful, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s sensory filter; diction—“truce of hush,” “copper jewelry and smoked fish”—carries smuggler argot without caricature. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences collapse into whispered dialogue, mirroring rising light. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, and mostly propulsive. One paraphrase loop (“learned patience… watching rhythm”) and a mixed metaphor (“laws felt different—stretched thin like tarpaulins”) slightly dull the edge. Otherwise sentences carry double duty; no filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final paragraph lands cleanly without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar noir tropes—underground market, missing bootlegger parent, talismanic keepsake—are refreshed by the sonic metaphor of “capturing the sound of trust breaking” and the warming broken clock. Risk lies in the lyric, accumulative structure; it pays off in the sunrise image that reconfigures steadfastness as liability. Specificity of salt-rot planks and bottle-message dead-drops keeps the world from feeling generic.</comment>
