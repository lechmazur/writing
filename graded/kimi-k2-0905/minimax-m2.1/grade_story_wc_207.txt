<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation and gift are concretely anchored in micro-choices—walking the factory floor, uncorking the vial, choosing not to sell—and her final renunciation at the lagoon is earned by this quiet, consistent pattern. Her “sensible eccentricity” is shown through sensory stillness rather than label, and the psychic cost of abandoning her trade is felt in the last empty vial. Interiority stays character-specific, never sliding into therapy-speak. Only the absence of an explicit contradictory impulse in-scene keeps this just outside the 9+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she refuses to capture the lagoon’s scent, foreclosing her lifelong profession with visible cost—the empty vial lowered but not filled. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each smelled relic layers urgency until the pattern breaks at the lagoon, reweighting the stake from acquisition to surrender. Causality is intact; the compass psychometry triggers descent, factory closure enables access, and no off-stage shortcuts appear. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “She would not return.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Factory floorboards, rising water table, phosphorescent basin—each setting detail is filtered through Elara’s scent-oriented perception and directly enables or constrains action. The cracked compass and empty vial function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; descent path tracks cleanly. Environment is not merely vivid but instrumental in the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the ultimate petrichor—is signaled early and tightens once: the lagoon offers nothing to bottle, forcing renunciation. The single deepening under Accumulative lens is decisive; options narrow from trade to silence, price is the forfeiture of her life’s work, felt on-page. No reversals needed; the coherent pressure of scentless completion is sufficient. Cost is visible and scales to length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the limit of cataloguing experience versus inhabiting it. Subtext resides in the unfillable vial—an image that reweights every prior collection without moralising. No thematic echo is spoken; meaning is charged through the final gesture alone. Ambiguity lingers yet feels coherent, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect clings to Elara’s scent-biased perception, sustaining a hushed, patient rhythm that modulates into cathedral echo at the lagoon. Syntax remains controlled, no filter-verb clutter; diction stays within her artisanal lexicon. No dialogue, therefore no voice contamination. Prose texture itself enacts the “resonant hush” tone, paying off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“industry has exhaled its last” performs double duty for sound and meaning. Information density is high; each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or action. Line-level craft is exemplary under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses scent-memory, psychometry, and subterrain exploration into a fresh configuration; the “petrichor collector” is not a trope recycled elsewhere. Risky choice to make the climax a refusal rather than acquisition succeeds because groundwork is laid from paragraph one. Specificity of limestone pump shutdown and wool-threaded expedition beard prevents generic slide. Feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious on entry.</comment>
