<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“gripped reality loosely…clutching water”), but the keeper is a passive witness; no contradictory on-page impulses or rising-stakes choice appear, so the required “earned renunciation/change with cost” is absent. The final stance remains unchanged from the first paragraph, giving the piece a static rather than arc-driven protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: cyclical movement between library/refuge, accumulating weight of seasons. Closure is a Charged Poise—the keeper seated “at the intersection,” paper swan in lap—where meaning is re-weighted but no path is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual (endless witness) not viscerally felt, keeping it below 9-band. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causal reversals occur, but coherence is maintained by lyrical pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Catacombs, vines, dripping pipes, and the obsidian chamber are rendered with sensory economy; micro-settings (body, tool) don’t constrain choices, so 9-band gate fails. Spatial choreography is clean; the river fault and paper portal are anchored without contradiction. Atmosphere and decay mirror the theme of composted knowledge effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unjudging witness of slow decay—is declared early and never tightens; no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Escalation is absent; the piece accumulates texture rather than pressure. The obsidian silence offers healing, but this is benefit, not cost, undermining tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge, like ecosystems, must rot to regenerate; silence repairs the observer. Final image of “crumbling peace” re-weights earlier decay as completion, not loss. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Loss of urgency in stakes keeps it below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic, clause-layered syntax that mirrors the keeper’s drifting attention (“across the drift of untold seasons”). Diction stays within plausible keeper lexicon; no head-hopping. Compression (“they unfolded…”) is taught early and paid off; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open differently, paragraphs breathe. High density: one line can set scene, reveal character, advance concept (“vines threaded…ecosystems had emerged”). Occasional elevated diction (“cryptic folds,”“conceptual repricing”) slightly overshoots keeper voice, minor −0.2. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold sentences; props track.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Decay-as-regeneration and origami portal feel fresh; silence as active healer is evocative. Conceptual risks (no plot, static character) are coherent but reduce memorability versus character-driven innovation. Ending reprises “crumbling peace” with new weight—inevitable in hindsight, not startling.</comment>
