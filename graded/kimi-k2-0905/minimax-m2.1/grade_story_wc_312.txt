<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mage’s “lukewarm” magic is not a label but a lived limit that dictates every tactical choice; his decision to let water-drip pace the repair grows out of embodied patience and paternal memory, culminating in a renunciation of spectacular power that costs him permanent bell-duty. Contradictory impulses—self-doubt vs. cosmic duty—coexist inside single beats (“earnestly naive enough to believe…wise enough to recognize”), satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell’s first post-repair ring re-tethers village to sea while the mage accepts lifelong servitude; cost is legible in the aching arms and the “faint drip” that now underlies every future peal. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drip-pattern density increases until meaning reweights; no causal gymnastics, no orientation drift, no late-rule patch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct’s color-shifting stone and carved drip channels are not backdrop; they supply the only tool the mage uses and charge the bell’s final glow. Micro-setting (the bell itself) constrains temperature choices and literalizes the “brittle devotion” concept, satisfying the 9+ constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—“fish had stopped coming”—and tighten through the mage’s iterated drip-application: each droplet is an irreversible spend of thin magic that forecloses faster, flashier repair. Escalation is textural: pattern density (drip → crack narrowing → village silence lifting) reweights abundance without external coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via the inverse heroism of inadequate means: patience outperforms potency. Final image—“faint drip of water wearing down stone”—reconfigures the premise without moralizing, letting the cosmic balance stay fragile and contingent. No thesis statement, only embodied particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to the mage’s perceptual filter; syntax lengthens under fatigue, contracts during micro-choices (“He gathered…began to apply”). No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; “lukewarm” recurs as rhythmic refrain without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances drip-count, body-cost, or bell-state. Metaphors stay inside POV lexicon; no mixed vehicles. Final clause (“patient and eternal, gentle and unstoppable”) is earned cadence, not purple overlay.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Takes the hoary “chosen one” trope and inverts it: success because power is mediocre, not despite it. Dripping-rate as repair method feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk is taken and paid off in closure image.</comment>
