<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation-driven interiority is vivid and consistent; her tactile empathy with buttons gives her a single, sharp lens. Yet the story keeps her in pure witness mode—no contradictory impulse or micro-choice ever risks failure, so the arc is flat. The final “return to cataloging” feels inevitable but cost-free, limiting earned change. A single beat where she mis-files a button and fears she’s silenced a voice would have opened the full 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the High Seers accept her living system, reweighting prophecy from sealed scrolls to breathable cloth. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern-build through catalogued fragments until the canyon echo reframes meaning. Cost is conceptual but legible: prophecy loses fixity, and Elara’s life-work becomes Sisyphean stewardship. One causal gap—why the jar was ever mis-shelved—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The amber warehouse breathes through Elara’s fingers: dust motes in “unearthed silence,” honeyed walls that aren’t lit, cliffs that “hold breath.” Buttons as micro-setting constrain her taxonomy and charge the ending when the canyon echo re-weights them from relics to seeds. Proper-noun economy is impeccable—Veleth, Third Age, Canyon Echo—each reused to anchor depth. Only the canyon itself stays off-stage, preventing full environmental pressure on her body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are intellectual: will her button-archive be deemed trivial? Pressure tightens once the canyon echo threatens to confirm that fear, then deepens when the pattern she unscrambles reframes prophecy itself. The tightening is single but meaningful—her taxonomy shifts from antiquarian to world-shaping. Because she never risks loss of position or voice, the cost is conceptual, not visceral, capping the upper band.</comment>

<comment>Wisdom through humble fragments emerges organically; no character lectures us. The canyon echo’s whisper re-prices the entire archive, letting theme resonate without moralizing. Final image—“unfinished stories into her careful hands”—crystallizes the stance: knowledge stays open, relational, tiny. The lack of counter-theme (does any wisdom deserve forgetting?) keeps it just shy of 9+ complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Elara’s synesthetic perception: silence “settled like dust,” buttons “hum.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under discovery—“She opened it”—creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is unmistakable. The elevated diction (“temporal manipulation,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly overshoots her artisan lexicon, holding it below 9.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: world-build, escalate, and echo motif—“buttons that held a mother’s last gift” layers emotion and theme in one breath. Figurative control is tight: canyon echo as “between memory and possibility” is exact. Minor scaffold: “she could sense…she could feel” repeats the conditional frame. No mixed metaphors, no loops in the closure beat; the prose sings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Reframing prophecy through discarded buttons is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the premise could not survive substitution. Risk is taken in the quiet accumulative structure—no villain, no chase—yet tension holds. Familiar tropes (oracle, archive, whispered prophecy) are inverted into breathable, anti-monumental wisdom. The concept commits fully, delivering an image that feels both ancient and newly unearthed.</comment>
