<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation and worldview are vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted (“stolen / borrowed”) rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The final smile registers as beatific completion, not costly renunciation; no visible flaw complicates her craft. The man’s shift is observed from outside, so the emotional price lands on him, not her, keeping her arc inert. Earned stasis is hinted but not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the poured moonbeam re-weights the man’s future, crystallized in the garden-of-camellias image. Causality is lyrical‐textural: each beat accumulates sensory density until the final re-interpretation. Orientation is swift; the emerald station, amber light, and lone bench are anchored by word 80. The cost is felt in the man’s “heaviness lifting,” but Mira’s own stakes never tighten; that keeps the piece just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emerald glass roof, bruised amber light, and the wooden bench function as micro-setting that guides camera placement and body posture. The moonbeam jar’s liquid silver constrains the decisive technical act. Sensory triage matches urgency: visual dominates, but hush of steam and scent of flowers sharpen the hush before closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift or white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mira reveal an untravelled path without violating her ethic of “borrowing.” Pressure mounts through accumulating light loss; the sunset’s fade is the tightening clock. The pour of moonbeam is the single decisive escalation that narrows options—once done, the portrait is fixed. Cost is displaced onto the subject; her own risk remains theoretical, capping intensity at 7.6.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—seeing versus appropriating the unlived life—emerges through imagistic repetition of camellias, moonlight, and train departure. No explicit thesis; final garden image reweights the man’s past choices without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is revelation gift or theft? The refusal to answer charges the after-effect. Mira’s credo recurs once too often, a faint echo that nicks the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Mira’s perceptual signature: flower code, light viscosity, destiny as audible whisper. Syntax lengthens and softens under golden-hour sentiment, then compresses at the pour—“liquid silver” snapped by train hiss. No head-hop; man’s interior is inferred only through visible relief. Voice modulates with scene temperature without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: long breathy clauses mimic lingering light, then shorter fragments at train arrival. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—every metaphor returns to light or flora, avoiding mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“seventeen years perfecting…”) is forgiven as vocational mantra. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Golden-hour thief who steals futures with moonbeam emulsion” is a fresh synthesis of photography magic-realism. Flower-code mechanics are specific, not token folklore. Risk—lyric stillness without external antagonist—pays off through accruing visual tension. Concept commits fully; no late retreat to realism.</comment>
