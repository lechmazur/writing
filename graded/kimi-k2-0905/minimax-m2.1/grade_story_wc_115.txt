<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s skeptical bent and hunger for confession are cleanly dramatized through micro-choices—crawling into the tunnel, lingering on the wheel, finally speaking. His interior contradiction (rational disbelief vs. need for absolution) remains active in-scene and drives the climax. The swallowed-truth motif is embodied, not labeled. Cost is felt in the hush after he speaks, but the beat is a hair under-physical; a sharper bodily cue would clinch 8.5+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final hush reweights every prior beat and forecloses Marcus’s silence forever. Causal chain holds—forum tip → hatch → wheel → ghost shift → radio → confession—each step shrinking options. Orientation is secure by word 80. The wheel turns without touch: one irreducible fantastic pivot; accepting it is the price of admission and the story commits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Tunnel’s wet brick, beaded wheel, and crackling radio are filtered through Marcus’s urb-ex gaze; every detail either obstructs (crumbling mortar, drop) or offers affordance (wheel, radio static). Micro-setting works: the wheel’s wooden beads, preserved yet rotted, mirror his own swallowed truth. Environment constrains the final gesture—no exit except speech into the dark. Slight over-reliance on visual; one more non-visual cue at climax would nudge 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—burden of an unspoken truth—tightens when the ghost shift forces Marcus from listener to speaker. One meaningful escalation: radio voices multiply until silence demands his own confession. Pressure stays situational but coherent; coincidence (wheel moves alone) complicates, does not resolve. Cost is conceptual—privacy of silence forever lost—visible in the hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: confession as communal release across time, mediated by derelict machinery. Subtext resides in the radio static—anonymous pain seeking witness—until Marcus becomes both witness and confessant. No moralizing; the final image reweights the premise without statement. Ambiguity lingers: was the shift real or psychosomatic, but the thematic charge is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature—measured, cataloguing, quietly desperate—persists under pressure. Syntax lengthens during the drowsy shift, then fractures at the climax, mirroring altered consciousness. No head-hopping; diction stays within urb-ex lexicon. One clause drifts toward academic (“liminal quality of the moment”) but recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective and paid off (“darkness had grown thicker,” then literalized by shift). Filter verbs minimal; verbs strong. One mixed metaphor (“electricity in his chest” beside “warm blanket”) barely grazes clarity. Closure line breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar urb-ex + supernatural confession is refreshed by the late-night psychic-hotline collage and the beaded valve wheel as portal. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: industrial relic + anonymous radio grief = private absolution. Risk taken in the unmotivated wheel turn; story earns it by prior atmospheric density. Not epochally original, but specific and memorable.</comment>
