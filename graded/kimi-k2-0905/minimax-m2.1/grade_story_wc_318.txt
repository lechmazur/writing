<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s solemn mission is evocative, yet all interiority is abstract—“he understood,” “he had learned”—so we never see contradictory impulses collide in real time. His only micro-choice is pulling the cord, an action repeated without escalating risk or revealing new layers of self. The piece insists on grief but dramatizes no moment where grief costs him anything concrete, so the ending’s “traces would rise” feels wished-for rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure wants to be Resonant Reconfiguration, but the final image—laughter possibly returning “when the time was right”—is conditional, off-stage, and unpaid. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pull adds sonic texture, yet no pattern break or cadence shift tightens stakes; the last pull is interchangeable with the first. Orientation is clear, but causality remains slack because the house’s grief neither resists nor adapts to the sound waves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The echo-chamber tunnel is vividly sonic—sound “bounced back upon itself, multiplying and twisting”—and the leaf-blower’s off-key roar is tactile. Yet the household interior is a white-room: no doorway, stair, or object is touched or navigated, so the setting never constrains movement or charges the final image. Atmosphere excels, but the tunnel alone can’t carry the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore lost laughter”—is declared early, yet grief is static; it neither escalates nor pushes back. Each blower pass is texturally louder but causally identical: no discovered limitation, no new consequence, no narrowing of options. Without a visible price paid by either house or healer, pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sound as tender erosion of unspeakable loss. The half-sung lullaby refrains without moralizing, and the final off-key echo carries quiet conceptual cost—the healer must keep returning forever. Still, theme never deepens past its initial equation; no counter-reading or moral complication accrues.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person voice sustains a liturgical cadence—“macerate the stillness,” “mechanical resurrection”—that fits the mourner-priest stance. Syntax lengthens and contracts with engine wheezes, creating a perceptual signature anchored in tool and body. No head-hop or register drift; the diction stays inside the POV’s solemn lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is musical—internal rhyme, assonance, varied sentence length—yet every paragraph restates the same connotation of grief-in-echo. “Macerate the stillness” recurs four times, becoming template cadence. Several sentences open with participial clusters that create simultaneity errors (“With his first pull, the machine sputtered to life…”) and stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The leaf-blower-as-symphonic-cure is fresh, and the off-key lullaby slipping through “cracks perfect pitch would have bounced away” is lovely specificity. Yet the concept stays in one lyrical gear; no secondary invention complicates or reframes the premise. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but the payoff image replays the opening conceit unchanged.</comment>
