<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—“weight of her people’s dispersed memories” lands—but she never faces a contradictory impulse in-scene; the dream simply gives her the answer and she accepts. No micro-choice alters her course after the ascent, so the final “trust” feels inherited, not earned. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the embodied cost of carrying memory is kept tactile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory layer (hue of moths, scent of thyme, bloom-flower’s spiral) thickens the texture until the seed-dream reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—knowledge scatters like seeds, a conceptual cost that forecloses archival control. Orientation is clean by line 5; causality is loose but coherent under the lyric pattern. Monsoon deadline provides tightening cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridge, bloom-flower, and seed itself operate as micro-settings that constrain ritual placement and timing; every detail is filtered through Mira’s professional gaze, never touristic. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: scent of thyme is noticed only when boots crush it under deadline pressure. Seventeen-shade sky rule is taught early and recurs without exposition dump. Spatial choreography is flawless across the single continuous ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim eroding collective memory—is signaled in paragraph two and intensifies by monsoon clock. No reversal occurs; pressure accumulates via sensory density and temporal contraction. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: loss of single-vessel control. Sufficient tightening for 800-word lyric arc, but lacks a visible trade-off that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory survives only when released from archival certainty. Final image of seeds scattered across open minds reconfigures the opening premise without moralizing. No echoic thesis statement; meaning is carried by the bloom-flower’s spiral and the monsoon’s cleansing. Ambiguity lingers—will dispersal save or further erode culture—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mira’s skeptical-reverent sensorium; diction—“empirical whimsy,” “hue of possibility”—is character-specific. Rhythm accelerates uphill, contracts into crystalline final sentence. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are rare and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; no loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is patterned—color, scent, spiral—teaching the reader early. Occasional elevated register (“crystalline moment of doubt”) is earned by elevated stakes. Final clause “empirical whimsy and found it sufficient” risks self-conscious cleverness but lands inside Mira’s professional idiom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Reality-checker profession and knowledge-fruit seed feel freshly synthesized; neither trope is stock. Core insight—memory must be scattered, not stored—reverses archival instinct without preachiness. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in closure image. Some phrasal echoes (“forgotten crops,” “forgotten generations”) verge on template but stay within tolerance.</comment>
