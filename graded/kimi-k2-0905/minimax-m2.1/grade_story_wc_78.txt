<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prophet’s interiority is sensorial, embodied, and consistent; the single on-page choice—striking water in tempo with the wave—crystallizes her hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ gate fails, but the earned smile in darkness signals cost and renunciation of safe silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final smile accepts the endless, costly labor of translation; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—each dub strike deepens density until the night-time cadence reweights the stake. Causality holds; no orientation debt; the price is felt in the pulsing arm that must keep playing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating driftwood orchard, bare feet on rolling logs, and the mallet-as-percussive-tool constrain every strike and balance choice; the setting is inseparable from the music made. Blue-hour light and salt scent are filtered through the prophet’s acoustic priorities, charging the final image of restless euphony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: transmute oceanic chaos into human-heard harmony. Escalation is textural—each dub layer tightens the sonic web until the wave-cymbal crash becomes the irrevocable last note that forecloses silence; cost is the eternal obligation to keep listening/playing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation is endless, imperfect, yet ecstatically necessary. The dub fractal becomes a metaphor for human meaning-making; the final smile reweights earlier strikes from mere sound to existential duty, leaving resonant ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance; syntax lengthens and shortens with wave rhythm, diction stays salt-stung and wind-specific. No head-hop; perceptual signature is acoustic-first—“edges glowing faintly with the last remnants of daylight” is heard as much as seen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence mirrors the surf-music; sentences vary in length, no template runs. Only minor filter-verb cluster (“she had learned to read…” twice) keeps it from 9+. Metaphors stay maritime-consistent; no mixed vehicles in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating xylophone-orchard and dub-prophecy synthesize weather-reading, percussion, and fractal acoustics into an inevitable, unrepeatable image. Risky concept is fully committed to; no retreat into generic sea-mystic tropes. Removing any core image collapses the story.</comment>
