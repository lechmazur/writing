<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Maya’s competences are vivid—headphones clamped, pencil scratching charts—but interiority leans paraphrastic (“she understood now…”) instead of simultaneous contradiction under pressure. The final choice is causally earned yet the felt cost is declared (“her cautious hope transformed”) rather than embodied. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices are present but emotionally monovalent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: subsonic manipulation detected → charts consulted → counter-frequency calculated → interference reversed, with visible campus thaw as Decisive Change. Orientation is swift; closure carries cost via the dawn antenna tremor and her exhaustion. One non-closure lapse: “they had discovered…” shifts to omniscient exposition mid-scene, slightly blurring lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Radio booth is tactile—cold coffee, dusty console grooves, humming relic—yet astral overlays (“spaces between stars”) edge toward generic awe. Physical layout stays coherent; the charts act as micro-setting, constraining tuning choices. Final antenna quiver gives concrete feedback. Weather/proximity of protests outside could tighten spatial pressure more.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim student agency from hidden manipulation—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: dawn deadline forces her to risk frying the ancient array. Cost is visible: stiff muscles, cold cup, station groan. Escalation is linear, not multi-turn, sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening-as-resistance emerges through action, not sermon. Subtext: communities carry natural frictions; malignant harmony can weaponize them. The refrain of “whispers” reappears at closure, reweighted from threat to vigilance. Avoids explicit moral; complexity acknowledged via “tricksters would try again.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Maya; perceptual signature blends radio tech argot with cosmic diction. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for star-listening, clipped clauses during tuning. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness judged on narrative prose alone, which maintains consistent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Strong sentence variation and density; occasional abstract qualifiers (“very, very old”) dilute urgency rather than sharpen. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent (fever, seeds, skeleton) without mixed collisions. One paraphrase loop: “interfering with the interference.” No scaffolding obscures causality, but peak beat could slice two adjectives for propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mashes campus-protest realism with cosmic-frequency horror; synthesis feels specific, not checklist. Astronomical harmonic weaponization is fresh angle on “outside agitator” trope. Could swap names but not core mix of radio tech + star acoustics + social fracture. Takes tonal risk with “ethereal grit” and largely lands it.</comment>
