<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete, character-specific, and embodied (e.g., “brightened disquiet that tingled along her spine”). Her contradictory mix of custodial duty and bewilderment drives every beat; the micro-choice to whisper the forbidden question earns the final image and carries visible cost—she can no longer remain merely bewildered. No stock phrasing or therapy-speak appears; competence is balanced with genuine struggle. The only hairline slip is a slight over-articulation of inheritance mechanics in paragraph 4, but it never flattens emotion or motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cameo’s image crystallizes, reweighting the premise—Mira now “understands,” inheritance complete, path foreclosed. Causality holds: because she asks the prescribed question, the blank yields its image; the persistent constraint (nonlinear, unbreakable legacy) shapes every tactic. Orientation is clear by word 96; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible on the final line: she is “no longer bewildered,” a cognitive and emotional forfeiture paid on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The astral orchard, pistachio cameo, and sealed bathroom each act as micro-settings that constrain choice: only the bathroom blocks the trees’ maddening hum, giving Mira a pocket to risk the question; the cameo’s impossible weight governs when and how she speaks. Sensory triage is POV-filtered (she notices radiation-seal integrity before décor). Details interleave with action; no exposition dump. Spatial choreography is clean; the dome’s geography remains constant. Environment directly charges the final image—the cameo glows under fluorescent light—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she complete the inheritance?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the cameo arrives. The single meaningful escalation is her decision to voice the forbidden question; this irrevocably narrows her status from caretaker to knower and produces the visible cost (loss of bewilderment). Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; coincidence does not resolve. One beat suffices at this length; the tightening is meaningful and irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: knowledge is a hereditary trap whose price is the loss of protective uncertainty. No moral is stated; the final image of “understanding” reweights all prior bewilderment without sermon. Motifs (trees, cameo, bathroom sanctuary) recur only when they constrain choice or accrue new meaning. The reader is left to weigh whether understanding is worth the cost—an ambiguity that lingers legitimately.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mira’s perceptual signature: she registers radiation leaks before emotional tone, notes impossible object weight before metaphysics. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses at the whispered query, matching pulse. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her curator lexicon. The voice is distinct, consistent, and modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse but precise (“time moved like honey through a sieve”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. Rhythm varies from languid reflective rolls to the sharp one-sentence whisper that triggers closure. Opening and closing lines are image-based, propulsive, and free of boilerplate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The nonlinear inheritance via pistachio-shell cameo feels inevitable yet fresh; the bathroom as philosophical crucible is an off-beat ritual that deepens rather than quirks. Conceptual risk—cosmic orchard on an asteroid—commits fully without winking at reader. Specific detail (fruit humming below human hearing, cameo lighter than air yet dense) prevents generic anywhere/anytime drift. The synthesis is singular; removing any core element collapses the logic.</comment>
