<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Calyx’s obsession is palpable and embodied; the twenty-year wait and bodily ascent chart a credible arc from fear to mastery. Interiority is rich (“blazing with a fire that had been latent too long”), but the beat where she presses the marking lacks a micro-choice that shows cost—success feels pre-ordained. The prism-minded trait is repeatedly dramatized, yet no contradictory impulse tests her, so the change reads as triumph, not crucible. Still, the single-POV default is exceeded cleanly and the final stance is foreclosed with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inverted patterns resolve into a “way of thinking” that reweights all prior knowledge, cost paid in the one-hour forfeiture and future solitude. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent: each upward-falling image thickens density until the final reconfiguration. The 120-word orientation anchor is met at word ~70 (“serpentine grotto’s mouth”), waiving any penalty. One soft spot: head archivist prohibition is mentioned but never surfaces as live obstacle, so the return feels pre-approved rather than risk-forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The grotto itself—upward-falling water, black-lantern shadows that rise—functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and supplies the key markings. Selective sensory detail (warm stone under palm, silver ribbons of mist) is filtered through Calyx’s prism-perception without tourist clutter. Spatial choreography holds across zero-gravity traversal; no impossible positions. Environment directly charges the final image: the glowing pattern spreads “like fire through dry paper,” making the reconfiguration legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“lost methods of preservation against time’s erosion”—is signaled early and tightens when the one-hour clock begins. Escalation is textural: each inverted image adds density until the markings resolve, narrowing options to “perceive or lose.” Cost is visible: she pays with twenty years of exile and the imminent retreat of the patterns. Agency is present but could be sharper; she follows mist-shaped letters rather than forcing a choice that endangers the prize.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge demands perpetual vigilance, not static storage. The doodle seeds, once seen, germinate into a prism-mind that forever splits memory—an earned, non-moralizing insight. Subtext operates in the upward fall itself: forgetting is gravity’s normal pull; remembering requires inversion. Final image reweights the Acrid Codex from forbidden relic to living syllabus, resonance achieved without stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, and prism-specific: verbs like “serpentined,” “clandestinely luminous,” and syntax that coils like the cave itself. Psychic distance stays tight to Calyx; no head-hopping. Patterned elision (“seeds of vigilance had finally sprolved into bloom”) is taught early and paid off at closure, legible under Accumulative lens. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses drift upward, shorter beats mark the final ignition—controlled without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. Information density is high—each line advances image, character, or concept. One paraphrase loop appears (“like being born into air, like crossing a threshold while remaining somehow still”) but serves lyrical reinforcement, not slack. No mixed metaphors or register drift; figurative language stays within the POV’s arcane lexicon. Proofing error: “sprolved” is likely a typo for “sprouted,” but the neologism is contextually legible and pattern-consistent, so only a hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses library noir with zero-gravity folklore—fresh yet inevitable. The inversion of sediment into script flips the archive’s foundational metaphor: memory is not buried but levitated. Risk is taken: lyric overload could have drowned clarity, yet the piece keeps causal trace. Specificity of the “tower with no base” doodle and prism-perception prevents swap-out; story collapses without these exact images.</comment>
