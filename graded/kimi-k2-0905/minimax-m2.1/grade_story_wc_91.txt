<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is luminous and particular—her noticing of the lightning-bug light “spelling something” shows perception shaped by a life of giving away everything. Yet her choices are largely observational; the only micro-choice on stage is uncorking jars she already decided to carry. The text asserts she “had become” transformation, but this culmination is asserted rather than dramatized through a final, costly act. Interior contradiction is present (destitute yet luminous), but escalation of motive-to-action stays off-stage, capping the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the eclipse apex plus released bugs create a Charged Poise—Mara stands in earned stasis, having foreclosed wealth and comfort, now re-centered as conduit of light. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of collected light → release → recognition that “transformation is…a continuous becoming.” Orientation is swift (black-sand beach, volcano's breath within 120 words) and causality-free design holds. Cost is felt in the final image (“destitute and luminous”), satisfying the 9- gate even without a causal turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Black sand, warm from the volcano yet cool enough to walk, is tactile and stakes the body between fire and tide; the twelve glass jars function as micro-setting that literally constrain choice (she must uncork them now). Sensory selection stays urgent—hum of sand, cold light of insects, tide's hesitation—mirroring internal vigilance. Spatial choreography is immaculate: jars line the beach, lightning bugs spiral up, volcano rumbles, eclipse darkens without confusion. Environment plus recurring object together charge the final image, meeting the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—emerges early and tightens once: from walking with questions to the hush moment when she “could read the message clearly.” No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and cosmic. The release of bugs is the single decisive act that reweights meaning, showing visible price (light given away forever). Cost clarity is unmistakable; however, only one meaningful turn occurs, holding the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of continuous becoming emerges via the lightning-bug motif (saved light released at convergence) rather than exposition. Subtext whispers through silence, ash drawings, monks’ nets of “silver words,” inviting reflection on passive agency. Final line “That was enough. That was everything.” offers resonant non-literal answer—value found in purposeless grace. No moral is declared; complexity survives, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at lyric distance yet filters every image through Mara’s perceptual signature—cold light “spelling,” transformation “like water through fingers.” Syntax lengthens then compresses in sync with eclipse hush, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue, so voice remains pure narrative, consistent in diction and metaphor. Elision (“the火山's distant breathing”) is purposeful compression, taught by context and paid off in calm recognition; zero head-hopping, meriting near-top band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but coordinated: each sentence layers task—advancing image, stakes, and atmosphere simultaneously. Metaphors stay coherent (light as captured stars, transformation as water/fingers) and avoid muddle. Occasional elevated phrasing (“prophecy walking itself out through her willing feet”) fits the lyric register and is earned. No loops, scaffold, or register drift appear in final third; read-aloud rhythm breathes with eclipse cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “destitute philanthropist” releasing bottled star-light on an eclipse beach fuses familiar elements into a fresh constellation; trope of accidental prophecy is inverted—Mara never tries to fulfill, yet walks the ordained shore. Specificity anchors novelty: black sand’s dual temperature, monks catching words in nets, ash-drawings by a child. Risk in lyric compression pays off in coherent closure. Slight deduction for conceptual proximity to eco-parable templates, but transformation through passive stewardship still feels non-obvious.</comment>
