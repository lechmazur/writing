<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is botanist-precise yet never clinical: her “slow form of dying” line fuses profession and fear. Contradictory drives—cataloging control versus bodily surrender—coexist inside single beats. The phone call converts observation to confession, but the leaf-handling micro-choices leading up to it feel slightly under-cranked; another tactile beat would push her over the 9-line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly in Earned Stasis: she does not sell, yet the cost—admission of fear to Sarah—rings on the page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm-damaged vines refigure meaning without causal reversals. The linden leaf motif is seeded early, re-priced in the final image. No orientation debt; timeline and geography stay crisp inside greenhouse/trellis perimeter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Wet moss, trellis drips, and chlorophyll scent are filtered through Vera’s taxonomic gaze, making environment double as diagnostic tool. The trellis itself constrains her final insight: she reads the vines’ “circuitous” regrowth while literally standing beneath them. Micro-setting (leaf in palm) supplies the charged object that migrates to the closure image. One decimal shy of 9 only because storm-season sky could compress one adjective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rootedness vs. transplantation—tightens when grant approval paradoxically threatens her stasis. Single deepening beat: releasing the leaf onto the beam externalizes surrender without fixing the conflict. Cost is present (shaking hands, phone-call vulnerability) but not yet irrevocable; escalation plateaus rather than spikes. Enough for high-band, not the visceral pinch that buys 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Metamorphosis theme emerges through plant behavior manuals: growth after damage models human late-life change. Subtext stays off-nose—no caterpillar metaphors until the call, and then it’s recalled experience, not sermon. Final image reframes prior botany data into emotional reconfiguration without explicit statement. Complexity intact: nursery remains unsold, change remains frightening, yet possibility curls upward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person prose carries Vera’s perceptual signature: Latin-laced diction, clause structures that mimic vine branching. Rhythm slackens slightly during reflective paragraphs but resurges in the trellis paragraph’s shorter bursts. No dialogue means voice evaluation focuses on free-indirect texture, which stays botanist-detached even at emotional crest—exactly her shield.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Strong density—most sentences advance observation and metaphor simultaneously. Occasional adjective pairs (“circuitously but sincerely”) feel editorial rather than urgent. Mixed-metaphor watch: “bruises spreading across skin” next to “slow form of dying” is saved because both map onto body/plant parallelism. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; closing cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Storm-season greenhouse as crucible for late-life reckoning feels fresh; botanic research grant arriving as antagonist rather than savior upends expected applause. Specificity of vine regrowth pattern distinguishes the piece from generic “nature heals” arcs. Risk is moderate—quiet interior rather than pyrotechnics—but coherent and committed.</comment>
