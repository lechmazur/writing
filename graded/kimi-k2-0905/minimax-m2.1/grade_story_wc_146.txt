<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Eliorn’s “infinitely patient” trait is more label than dramatized cost; she never falters, doubts, or pays a visible price for her patience, so the arc feels frictionless. The fork-warmth and foot-soreness are the only embodied costs, and they’re generic. Still, her perceptual filter is distinct and consistent, and the final smile carries a credible micro-choice to persist, earning a solid high-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the archway’s hum is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the town from mute to sounding, with the cost of 5 000+ aching steps still in Eliorn’s body. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (“seven thousand repetitions”) and held to the final cadence; each circuit thickens density rather than causal turns. No orientation debt; stakes and lens are legible by 120 words. The quiet payoff is earned, specific, and irreversible.</comment>

<comment>The ancient archway functions as both tuning peg and resonating chamber, constraining her method and charging the final image; the cobblestones underfoot supply tactile feedback that alters her pace and stakes. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through her ear-centric vocation—sound and vibration dominate, visual detail is spare. Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly through the repeated circuits. Environment is not backdrop but instrument; this meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—revive the town’s frequency—tightens through the accumulative pattern: each footstep increases sympathetic resonance, narrowing the gap between silence and hum. The visible price is her aching legs and the fork’s warmth; the conceptual price is the irrevocable commitment of 7 000 steps. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cobblestones first buzz back, reweighting the stake from possible folly to imminent awakening. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidences intrude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: communal memory is a physical vibration that can be re-taught to stone. The fork, arch, and footfalls form a quiet parable about caretaking as acoustic labor. No moralizing summary; the final image of the smiling listener beside humming stone re-prices patience as audible activism. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone actually return?—but the ecological argument (one town’s silence sickens others) is cleanly embedded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Eliorn’s sensorium; every noun is chosen for resonance (“velvet moss,” “ironwood limb”). Syntax lengthens and contracts with her cadence, mirroring the slow build of frequency. No filter-verb stacks; perception is concrete and embodied. The voice never explains its own metaphors, trusting the reader to feel vibration as meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—advance loop, deepen texture, and echo sound patterns (“rhythm of markets, children, and funeral processions”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each repetition of “seven thousand” accrues new weight. Figurative language is disciplined: every metaphor is acoustic and testable (stone humming, fork warming). Read-aloud rhythm is propulsive yet patient, enacting the story’s method in its own syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—reviving a ghost town through sympathetic footstep resonance—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Tropes of abandoned villages and chosen saviors are subverted by acoustic science rendered as ritual. The ironwood fork cut from the blighted tree turns a clichéd “chosen tool” into a living relic whose past is audible. Risky accumulative structure pays off when the final hum feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Her cryptic nature is signaled early (“those who still remembered the old words called her cryptic”) and pays off in the final smile that withholds explanation. The trait shapes her solitude and method—she speaks names aloud but never defends her plan. Cost is visible: she alone bears the 7 000-step burden. Removing the cryptic remove would collapse the story’s hush.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fork is handled in opening beat, mid-walk strikes, and final warmth; each touch reweights meaning from tool to living conduit. Its ironwood origin ties personal past to town past. Final warmth is a measurable, embodied cost. Story logic fails without this specific resonator.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Concept is not backdrop but engine: every step is a tactic to reverse the dying. Stakes escalate from “mute town” to “region-wide infection of silence.” Closure unit is the moment the town begins to re-sound. Remove revival and the plot evaporates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Label appears twice, but patience is demonstrated through the 5 000+ steps already walked and the remaining 2 000 she still commits to. Trade-off is implicit: she forfeits speed, comfort, and possibly recognition. Could be stronger if a single moment tested her patience near failure, but the accumulative proof is visible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rebuild is literalized as sonic reconstruction; each circuit lays new frequency into stone. The action drives every beat and supplies the final hum. Without the repeated footfalls, the town stays dead.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Method is announced in first third, demonstrated in every circuit, and rewarded in the closing hum. Mechanics matter: cadence, weight, and number of steps are specified and linked to resonance math. Story collapses if method were drumming or singing instead.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Ancient archway is introduced as tuning peg and returns as first resonator that hums back. Its stone constitution affects her route and timing. Micro-setting use: she must pass beneath it each circuit to lock frequency. Replace with generic gate and the acoustic logic frays.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>“Before the collapse” frames stakes but is never tracked as a live clock; no countdown or external threat intensifies. Time is dilated into steps, not hours. Functional but not urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Desire to restore shared balance is stated and dramatized: she accepts personal ache to heal regional “wound in the landscape.” Conflict appears in the cost to her body and seasons. Final smile acknowledges the price yet endorses the trade. Motivation is inseparable from every step.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Wild hush” is seeded in line 1, modulates through eerie emptiness, and crystallizes in the charged silence just before the arch hums. Tone carries the final image: a wild quiet that now contains its opposite. Coherent and indispensable.</comment>
