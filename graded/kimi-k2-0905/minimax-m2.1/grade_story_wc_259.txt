<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—"anguished joy rise in my chest"—but the narrator’s contradictory impulses (scholarly possession vs. surrender) are asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choice; the final surrender is foreshadowed yet feels pre-decided, trimming cost. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the dance spirals density until the boundary dissolves, landing a Charged Poise with felt cost ("I would emerge changed"). Orientation is clear by word 80; causality is interior but coherent. Closure is valid, though the cost is more declared ("burden and blessing") than shown through a persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bronze pagoda, saffron veil, and shifting-symbol walls are tactile and POV-filtered; the prism’s refracted rainbows evolve from description to participatory tool during the dance, charging the final image. Micro-setting (veil as second skin) constrains movement and captures light—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator seize or release the atoms—tightens when the dance forces surrender; escalation is textural (density of motes) rather than causal reversal. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is legible as self-dissolution. No external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—nostalgia as living energy that must be freed—emerges through the dance’s progression rather than statement; the final image of the narrator becoming "forbidden knowledge" reweights prior scholarly greed without moralizing. Subtext of letting-go vs. hoarding is sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice is consistent: long breathy sentences, tactile diction, prism-light imagery. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Patterned repetition ("I circled… I completed") teaches the spiral form and pays off in the final dissolve. Register stays within the scholar-mystic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence length; occasional modifier stacks ("luminescent dust motes caught in a draft") verge on purple but serve the ecstatic mode. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor edge ("hollow shell of some great creature") does not dull the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: physicalized nostalgia + anti-pattern dance + bronze prism archive feels novel yet inevitable. Risky lyric escalation succeeds; no derivative echoes. Concept commits fully—no retreat to metaphorical safety.</comment>
