<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—prizing heritage yet choreographing compromise—surfaces in concrete micro-choices (pocketing the chip, chalking each symbol). Embodied tension (stone “grounding her in purpose”) keeps sentiment from sliding into label-speak. The final endurance—continuing to paint dawn messages—accepts cost and forecloses retreat, earned by the prior beat of watching investors parade. Grandmother memory works as credible spur without convenient omniscience; flaw (naïve optimism) remains live.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s chalking widens from lone act to insurgent lattice, crystallizing community stance with felt future cost (privatized canals). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—symbols layer until pattern reweights meaning; no causal reversals needed. Orientation complete by 60 words; spatial anchors stable. Cost legible in last line: “ready” implies tomorrow’s confrontation she may lose. Minor slack: no concrete sabotage choice yet, so just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating carnival evoked through motion and sound that filter Mira’s priorities; raft creak vs glass platform opposes old/new economically. Micro-setting objects—stone chip, chalk pigments—constrain tactics and appear in closure image, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy respected: urgent night narrows to tactile chips, distant calliope. Proper-noun economy keeps “Verada,” “Flotilla District,” “Market Hall” distinct without parading extras. Spatial choreography clean across docks, ferry, food stalls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Comment> Dominant stake—community survival vs privatization—signalled early; graffiti campaign is one visible tightening that narrows options (“tomorrow, the investors would return… ready”). Agency is continuous organizing act with stamina cost on-page (“continued painting messages into the night”). No fake antagonist required; pressure coherent. Escalation textural: each new symbol thickens network density and forecloses anonymity; price paid is sleepless exposure and stone shard as evidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—collaborative memory vs market seizure—emerges via graffiti resurrection, never abstract lecture. Subtext in chalk circles and spirals lets readers decode threat themselves. Final image of music matching heartbeat offers quiet but charged answer: culture as living pulse, not commodity. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity persists about whether code can truly stall capital. Slight redundancy in “foundation” metaphor (stone + community) is the only soft echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skewed to cartographer-like noticing (“mapping the geography of displacement”). Prose rhythm mirrors Mira’s orderly intuition—paratactic catalogues of symbols, then elongated clause as hope swells. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Compression (“music shifted… deeper, more urgent”) teaches pattern of rising sonic heartbeat that pays off in closure line. Register stays within plausible inner diction of cultural liaison.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence variation strong; alternating short declaratives with imagist fragments propels night momentum. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. Concrete verbs—“creaked,” “gleamed,” “pressed”—anchor abstractions. Metaphors organic (“floating diamonds”) and consistent across paragraph. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory cue, social cue, and symbolic plan. Copy clean; only nit is optional comma after “gifts” in penultimate sentence but rhythm still clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Raft-city gentrification is familiar territory, but encoding resistance into carnival ornament cipher feels fresh and specific. Stone chip reborn as tactical token transforms common relic motif. Risk of static observation offset by on-page choreography of chalk under dock lanterns—turns tourist spectacle into insurgent template. Synthesis of Venice-like setting, crypto-graffiti, and insider-outsider mediator offers non-obvious angle that would survive name-swap test. Could edge higher with sharper sensory twist unique to float-plank acoustics.</comment>
