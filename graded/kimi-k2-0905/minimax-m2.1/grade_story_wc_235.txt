<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicler’s voice pulses with interior contradiction—driven to impose order yet addicted to the very dissolution of time. His jealousy of the self at the pine table crystallizes a credible split inside a single psyche, not just a narrative trick. The “feral nostalgia” is not merely named; it claws through every beat, warping his perceptions and actions. Only the lack of an external relationship crucible keeps this from topping the band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the scroll’s saturation with ink mirrors the narrator’s own irreversible saturation by time-sickness. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the grave mutates from terminus to waystation, reweighting mortality itself. This reconfiguration is paid for by the visible cost of surrender to dreaming (“I will let the feral nostalgia take me”). Pattern was taught early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll operates as micro-setting: its absorbency, scent, and surface literally drink the narrator’s words, constraining how and when he can write. Mountain cabin functions as sealed pressure vessel—frost on window, pine table, sap crust—each detail filtered through a mind that can no longer separate memory from dream. Spatial anchors (valley below, frost window, pine table) remain coherent. The scroll’s final state is inseparable from the ending’s re-priced concept of death.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the fight against dissolution of self across timelines. Escalation is textural: each paragraph thickens the chronotopic soup—moss growing in fast-forward, birdsong rewinding, colors unseen in waking light. Jealousy of his own past self is the visible price that forces surrender. One meaningful tightening: acceptance that the grave is a waypoint, not an ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of lucidity: to see the machinery of consciousness is to be mangled by it. The scroll’s final state—saturated, tear-stained—physicalizes that wisdom without stating it. The ending image (grave learning to speak) reweights mortality from dread to continuity, resonating off earlier “neither quite alive nor entirely dead.” No sermonizing; the conceptual repricing does the thematic work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV sustains a distinct perceptual signature: time-stammered syntax (“three days ago, or three decades from now”), tactile metaphors (“like a wounded animal surrendering its secrets”). Internal distance modulates—compression under temporal vertigo, lyrical expansion at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled. Non-standard punctuation limited to em-dashes, consistent with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long narcotic sentences for dream-drunk passages, staccato fragments at jealous climax. Metaphors stay internally coherent (lighthouse illuminating rocks, Möbius strip of recursive meaning). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Only minor overworld in one descriptive stack keeps this below 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fuses time-sickness memoir with gnostic horror of self-knowledge; lucid dreaming as chronicler’s disease feels fresh. The grave that already bears your name yet remains mutable is a non-obvious reframing of mortality. Jealousy of one’s own past self as narrative engine risks gimmick but is grounded in sensory particularity. Final image—grave learning to speak—carries undeniable conceptual charge that could not exist without every prior particular.</comment>
