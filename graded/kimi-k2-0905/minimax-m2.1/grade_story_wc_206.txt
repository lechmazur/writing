<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cassian’s caretaker-mentality is consistent, but interiority leans on abstract summary (“weight of every note…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choice at the tether beat is present yet emotionally muted—his smile registers but no opposing impulse is dramatized. Earned stasis is credible (lifetime spent), yet cost feels diffuse because the covenant’s personal price is told, not freshly tasted in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands: the orchestrion sounds again—clear Decisive Change with felt cost (decades of work crystallize into one note). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of gathering light/melody intensifies toward cadence shift. Orientation is late—who, where, when appear ~130 words in; waiver fails because delayed anchors do not pay off at closure, so −0.3 applied. Causality is interior-textural rather than because/therefore plot, acceptable under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: its “wilts near dishonesty” rule constrains Cassian’s need to speak work aloud—visible tactical pressure. Selective sensory detail (copper goggles, tremor in watch) grounds POV without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The chamber’s acoustic personality mirrors interior stakes; however, it does not materially alter the final tether move—thus held below 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim light stolen by midnight—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: last silver wire connection narrows options to now-or-never. Cost is conceptual (lifetime spent) but not viscerally fresh on the page; price is retrospective summary. Escalation is textural accumulation of light particles; under Accumulative lens this suffices, yet pressure never spikes—remains steady lament.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: patience vs irretrievable loss; final thin note reweights prior silence without moralizing. Subtext in “mending what isn’t torn” implies emotional labor unseen. Recurrent rust/covenant motif returns charged in final heartbeat image. Avoids tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers whether light can ever fully return. No late thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited voice remains stable; perceptual signature leans auditory (“whisper of sound,” “tremor within its small heart”) fitting repairman POV. Syntax grows lyrical yet keeps cadence control—no drumbeat monotony. Occasional elevated diction (“crystalline melodies,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges beyond plausible worker lexicon but reads as stylized mythic tone, consistently maintained. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong information density; most sentences dual-purpose (action + atmosphere). Figurative runs frequent but pattern-taught early (“patience of centuries,” “dust seemed to shrink”) and paid off in final bloom image—no closure obscurity. One paraphrase loop: “silent since the theft, its pipes empty of breath, its bellows collapsed like sleeping animals” triples silence without additive pressure → −0.2. Otherwise clean mechanics, no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: music-box restorer who repairs intangible songs via honesty-forging room. Conceptual risk—fantasy of rust covenant and captured moonlight—commits fully without mid-stream rule change. Could stray close to “quiet artisan saves world” template but particularized through acoustic micro-world and covenant specificity. Not radically unprecedented, yet vantage feels individual and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
