<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—the ripple-mark skin, the stone against her ribs—yet the climactic “invitation” of the bloom is slightly too serene; a sharper cost (pain, vertigo, forfeiture of sight?) would have sealed the arc. Still, her decades-trained sensitivity and the bodily payoff give a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (cracks, ice, stone pulse) thickens until the null-point silence lands as Conceptual Repricing—cost is the lifelong map-skill spent/emptied into the void. Spatial anchors and chronology are legible by line 6; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harmonic caves act as resonant instrument: temperature gradients, fracture topology, and the echo-stone’s glow all constrain how/whether silence can bloom. The spiral-ice “micro-setting” directly shapes the final tactic—no swap-out possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate usable silence—tightens once: spiral pattern proves null-point exists, Mira’s tone + stone catalyzes it, foreclosing future use of her trained voice (cost implicit in “ancient purpose fulfilled”). Pressure is coherent, single deepening sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet as radical resistance emerges through fracture-reading and bodily cost rather than statement; final “nothing-song” reweights all prior noise without moralizing. Could edge higher if subtext showed what she must now abandon to guard the bloom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited keeps strict psychic distance; diction (“hammered repose,” “nothing-song”) is POV-true to a mapkeeper who thinks in vibration metaphors. Rhythm swells and falls with sonic pressure; no head-hop or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty—e.g., “crack patterns spread like frost…each fracture telling the story” fuses image, backstory, and tension. Zero loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; high-density without purple overload. Closure line is clean, luminous, unforced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Bloom of hush” as inverse physics—silence that repels energy beings—feels fresh yet inevitable given resonance logic built early. Risky lyric compression is taught by line 3 and paid off; no derivative echo.</comment>
