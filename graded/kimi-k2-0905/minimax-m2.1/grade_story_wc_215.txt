<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is atmospheric—“tranquilly perceptive” is asserted more than dramatized—but her micro-choices (sitting, rising, digging, cradling) do track a coherent arc from observer to keeper, and the final lap-weight of the box lands a cost. The absence of contradictory impulses in-scene keeps her just short of the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mira’s silent acceptance of the covenant forecloses departure and is charged by the ghost’s fade and the box’s impossible weight. Accumulative lens holds—density of light, glass, silence tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The apiary’s ribs, amber glass, and cracked earth are filtered through Mira’s bias; every visual detail later re-appears inside the stained-glass box, turning setting into keepsake. Environment materially constrains the only action—she digs where the ghost points—and the final image is charged by that same ground. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“someone must remember”—is signaled early and tightens once when the ghost gestures toward the dig site. The tightening is single but meaningful: refusal to leave becomes binding covenant. Cost is conceptual yet legible in the box’s weight. Could use one intermediate beat of resistance to reach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of silent inheritance emerges entirely through image—bees, glass, ash—never named as thesis. Final image of the box “heavy with the eloquence of silence” offers non-literal conceptual repricing that reweights every prior visual. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what remembering will demand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Mira; perceptual signature skews toward light, texture, and negative space. Rhythm modulates—long accumulative sentences build density, then short clauses at the ghost’s appearance create intake of breath. No filter-verb stacks; diction remains within recluse lexicon. Distinct without showiness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: each metaphor (ribs, moth wings, amber pools) returns in the box image, preventing decorative sprawl. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed vehicle—“weight…pressing against her ribs” alongside “impossible lightness”—knocks 0.2, but clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper ghost is familiar, yet the covenant of silence preserved in stained-glass is fresh. Risk lies in the quiet lyric refusal of plot, but coherence under accumulative lens keeps it from gimmick. Transformation test passes: the specific triad of bees–glass–mute oath would collapse if details genericized.</comment>
