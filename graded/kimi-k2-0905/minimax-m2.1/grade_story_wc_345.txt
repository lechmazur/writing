<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira’s gentle persistence and the settlers’ gradual shift from survival-mode hoarding to open-handed collaboration are sketched with warmth, yet everyone remains a touch archetypal (“kind eyes,” “frightened child”). No one faces an interior contradiction that complicates their newfound generosity; the change feels communal rather than personally costly. The ghost’s motivation is clear—she wants the bell rung—but the settlers’ hinge moment is more emblematic than individually embodied. Still, the ensemble’s micro-choices (Eli teaching, Lena giving) align cleanly with the stakes and earn the closing rain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: chalk messages, shared labor, and finally the bell’s resonance layer density until the sky answers. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration— the bell’s ring re-weights the nebula and the community’s self-image, with felt cost in the decades of neglect they must now admit. Orientation is established by line 3; no penalty. One tight deepening suffices and is delivered when the bell summons real weather, crystallizing the “brambled hope.” Causality stays associative rather than because/therefore, but that is legit under the Accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating stone arches, silver-leaf canopy, and mist-drop bell tower are selectively detailed and return to charge the final image. The brass bell’s green tarnish and the cracked yet passable paths give tactile history; the arches “lean closer” during restoration, integrating setting with beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects settler pragmatism—fruit colors first, then tool usability. Environment directly enables the climax: the bell leverages cloud proximity unique to this orchard sky. Meets 9+ gate: the bell-as-tool constrains the final action and reconfigures stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is communal belonging versus ongoing ecological neglect; signaled early with “strangers into family.” Escalation is textural: each chalked coordinate and restored flowerbed adds moral pressure until the bell ring becomes inevitable. The visible price is the sweat and vulnerability of shared labor—Lena’s relinquishing hoard, Eli risking authority. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening that reweights their identity from survivors to stewards. Cost is legible but lightly felt; could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: collectivity as irrigation—people, like butterflies, need scheduled tenderness. Subtext lives in silent chalk, green patina, and the unspoken fear that the sky might ignore them. Final image of rain on new wings offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids tidy thesis yet flirts with thematic echo when “brambled hope” is named; slight ding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays consistently lyric, with sentence rhythms that elongate during garden work then tighten into single-clause relief when bell rings. Diction leans pastoral-lyric (“nebula of respite,” “stone clouds”) but stays legible and pattern-taught from opening. No dialogue, so voice distinction untested; perceptual signature is communal settler pragmatism filtered through wonder. Filter verbs sparse; no head-hopping issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical but occasionally overwritten: “fruit in colors found nowhere on Earth” is tourist-catalog vague; “scheduled tenderness” mixed-metaphor straddles mechanical/organic. Some template cadence in tripled participles (“had watched… had watched… had grown”). Information density good—each sentence layers history or sensory cue. No loops in final third; closure image remains clear. Registers minor metaphor muddle, not fatal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fuses solarpunk reclamation with soft ghost story; irrigation bell summoning weather from stone arches feels fresh and inevitable. Trope of ghostly guide is inverted—she needs them as much as they need her. Specificity of chalk-at-dawn messaging and butterfly phenology anchors premise. Risk-taking in quiet, cooperative climax pays off; no derivative punch-line. Transformation test: could not swap orchard planet for farm village without collapsing worldlogic.</comment>
