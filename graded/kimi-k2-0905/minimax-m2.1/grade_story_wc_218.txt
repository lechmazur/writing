<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—her fingers on the wire, the ladder’s rung, the diary’s worn leather—but the diagnosis never complicates her calm; no contradictory impulse disturbs the single note of acceptance, so the “earned cost” gate stays half-open. The copper-wrap micro-choices visibly enact her value hierarchy, yet the scene lacks a final fork where renunciation or risk could crystallize cost. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, lifting the profile into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wind through copper-wrapped branches re-weights her impending death into continuity, cost felt in “she would not live to see the full flowering.” Accumulative lens holds—each copper coil and diary sketch layers density until the final cadence reconfigures meaning without a causal reversal. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity breaks the lens. One scaffold tic (“she had been slowly remodeling…”) is minor enough to leave the 9-band gate ajar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The living pillars, copper wire, and diary function as micro-settings that constrain every motion; the ladder’s elevation literally re-views the orchard, charging the final image. Sensory selection filters through Maren’s arborist gaze—moss temperature, wire tension, branch give—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating props or impossible shifts. Environment directly shapes the stakes: the orchard’s slow time reframes her six-month sentence into continuity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finish the remodel before death—is signaled early; pressure tightens when weakness fuzzes her grip on the ladder, a micro-turn that costs steadiness. No reversal follows; instead, the wire keeps winding, accumulating density under Accumulative lens. Cost is present but incremental (stamina, time) rather than a foreclosed option; the escalation plateaus just below the 8.8 gate. Still, agency remains hers, and the stakes stay viscerally tethered to the wire in hand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges unsaid: architecture as mutual listening across species and centuries. The copper coil becomes a silent language whose meaning is repriced when the wind makes it sing back at the end—an image that reweights all prior wire-wrap beats. No moral is declared; the diary’s legacy question lingers in charged poise. Ambiguity is purposeful and contained within the orchard’s slow temporal frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual band—copper conductivity imagined as conversational, morning warmth read through moss. Syntax lengthens and relaxes to match unhurried motion, then tightens into tactile particulars under ladder strain. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within her lifelong island lexicon. Voice is distinctive yet transparent enough to let the final image resonate without authorial nudge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening strategy; rhythm breathes with the ladder climb then settles into the hush of the final line. Figurative language is spare and grounded—“geological formation,” “vine tendrils”—never overwrought. One paraphrase loop (“she had inherited… from her mother, who had inherited…”) costs −0.2, but it sits mid-story and does not touch closure. Otherwise, high density and propulsion maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The copper-wire-as-language conceit feels fresh yet inevitable, growing organically from real arboricultural practice and sacred-architecture lore. Combining terminal illness with slow orchard time reframes death as conductive redistribution rather than loss—an angle that avoids sentimental trope. Specific botanical and geological details anchor the concept; removing the island or the wire collapses the entire narrative logic. Risk is present but measured, keeping clarity intact.</comment>
