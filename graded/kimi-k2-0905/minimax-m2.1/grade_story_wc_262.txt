<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is richly concrete—her psychometric gift is shown through tactile, synesthetic beats (“hum of unused love vibrating”). One contradiction is staged: she arrives to “find” yet ends by renouncing extraction, the cost legible in her quiet exit. The lone flaw: the renunciation is voiced in abstract editorial (“some stories…only witnessed”) rather than dramatized micro-choice; still, the embodied tears and the final stair-descent supply enough visible price to satisfy earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: emotional residue layers thicken until the final image reweights the stake—Mira leaves the film untouched, a Charged Poise that makes “unused love” an undeniable permanent resident. Causality is interior and cumulative rather than event-based; each vision beat deepens density until the refusal crystallizes option. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure cost is legible in the final sentence: she carries “the particular peace that comes from witnessing an ending finally allowed to rest.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting: jagged reel edges, brittle film, rotting seats—each object is handled and constrains choice (she handles, then renounces). Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s psychometric bias—touch and vibration dominate over visual cataloguing. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the hidden canister under the false floor is tracked from concealment to discovery to re-concealment. The final image recharges the “hushed thunder” motif, giving the booth itself vocal agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens through visionary accretion rather than external opposition; each recovered image narrows the option of ever removing the love. Agency is cognitive/ethical: the decision not to extract the film is the single narrowing turn, paid for with the tears she wipes away. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is whether knowledge entitles theft. Cost is visible and conceptual: she forecloses her own mission, embracing perpetual custodianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific metaphor of undelivered letters as architectural space—“thresholds the sisters had stood before and then walked away from.” Subtext is carried through mirrored renunciations: Clara renounces delivery, Mira renounces revelation. The final image answers the core question—unused love needs no audience—without moralizing. Recurring “hushed thunder” motif reweights from ominous to tender, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person adheres tightly to Mira’s perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors (“quiet violence of hushed thunder”) and spatial mapping syntax. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; rhythm modulates from long accumulative sentences to the staccato final clause of renunciation. Patterned elision (“half-whispered, half-sung”) is taught early and paid off in the final “quiet violence.” Filter-verb count is minimal; immediacy remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “unused love vibrating” is kept consistent through sonic/tactile extensions. Density is high: “words…woven into the very air” performs scene work while staying sense-bound. Final line cadence mirrors the hush it names, earning poetic closure without purple inflation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Freshens the “abandoned theater” trope by reframing it as an emotional battery; the psychometric conceit is familiar but fused with spatial cartography (“emotional architectures in three dimensions”) that feels novel. The renunciation ending subverts expected artifact-recovery plots. Specificity of the Vance sisters’ half-written lyrics prevents generic swap-out. Risk in quiet lyric refusal is coherent and pays off in the final reimage of “hushed thunder.”</comment>
