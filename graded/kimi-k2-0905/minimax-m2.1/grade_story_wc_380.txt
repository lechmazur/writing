<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s lantern-lighter identity is more atmospheric label than lived vocation—she never handles a lantern or makes a work-choice under pressure. The exhuming of her mother’s grave-flowers is a vivid, value-laden act, but the deleted-memory quest stays interior; we watch her decide to “let the light in” without seeing a concrete, costly micro-choice that seals the change. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward poetic self-explication (“she finally understood…”) rather than dramatized contradiction in scene. Still, the filial grief and keeper lineage feel specific, and the final touch of the crystal carries embodied cost, earning a solid mid-8 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal touch reconfigures Mira’s identity and the town’s forgotten past with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (beached whale, salt crystals, coffee-ground map) layers density until the final crystalline silence reweights meaning. One minor orientation waiver: “the chamber beneath the lighthouse” appears late with no prior spatial cue, but the pattern pays off at closure so the penalty is waived. The cost is legible in the image of her mother’s living face trapped in salt—loss made permanent—meeting the 9+ quick test for closure quality.</comment>

<comment>Dock-side dawn, whale corpse, and salt-crystal labyrinth are rendered with tactile specificity: crystallized tears, gravity tugging at the sternum, coffee-ground spirals that double as nautical charts. The lighthouse basement arrives suddenly, but the micro-setting of the crystal chamber immediately constrains movement and choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy favors salt-light-gravity over visual panorama, reflecting Mira’s profession of tending invisible luminescence. Every described object either guides her descent or charges the final image; nothing is mere scenery.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recovering her mother’s deleted memory—surfaces early and tightens when gravity’s pull literalizes the emotional weight of forgetting. The coffee-ground divination provides one visible micro-turn that narrows options, steering her into the densest gravity pocket; the cost is the irreversibility of witnessing the sealed memory. Pressure escalates by accretion rather than reversal: each crystal she passes is a skipped beat of town guilt pressing on her chest. The ending does not reverse the stakes but crystallizes them, a valid Accumulative deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: deleted memories don’t vanish—they accrete into communal geology, waiting for a custodian willing to bear their weight. The whale’s death as involuntary confessional server is a fresh, non-allegorical image that re-prices the concept of forgetting. No character moralizes; the final “let the light in” is metaphorical action, not thesis statement. Resonance lingers in the sense that every seaside town secretly mines its own submerged archive of shame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter: salt taste as grief, gravity as filial obligation, coffee sludge as cartography. Syntax lengthens and liquefies during descent, then fractures into short clauses at the crystal touch, mirroring her held breath. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction (“luminescent fragments seeking shelter”) that remains consistent yet unshowy. The occasional poetic elevation is earned by the lyric premise and never drifts into self-parody.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean even when lush: every metaphor does double duty—salt crystals are both scenery and data storage. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances placement, image, or emotional charge. One mixed vehicle—“memories drifted… seeking shelter in the salt crystals”—is forgiven because the anthropomorphism is later literalized within world logic. Clause rhythm varies purposefully, propelling the descent without tripping the read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The whale-as-external-hard-drive for human shame is an image I haven’t seen; coupling it with a dock-worker who reads coffee grounds as nautical memory-maps feels inevitable yet unforeseen. The gravitational memory vault literalizes psychological repression without becoming gimmick, because the physics exacts a bodily price on the searcher. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation over plot reversals, and it pays off in a final image that reconfigures the entire beach opening. Specificity of roses-and-yarrow grave bouquet anchors the fantastical frame in lived grief.</comment>
