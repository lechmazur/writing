<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mirabel’s interiority is textured—her aromatic caution, the ritual of uncorking, her fear of understanding—yet the final beat leans into a summarizing epiphany (“she grieved…truly grieved”) that slightly over-articulates what the luminous image already shows. The brother remains off-stage; his absence is the crucible, but because he never appears, relationship pressure is inferred rather than enacted, capping the score just below the 8.8 gate. Micro-choices (perfume vial handling, deliberate footsteps) anchor motive, but the decisive interior shift is told more than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty vial + glowing bloom reweight the premise—grief is love’s persistent molecular trace—with unmistakable conceptual cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-turn driven; each sensory beat thickens the pattern until the ultraviolet reveal crystallizes meaning. One transition (past reflection on brother) is cleanly cued by the vial scent, keeping the lens stable. Orientation is secured within 120 words via “lantern broker,” “Conservatory,” “ultraviolet rays.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but pressure engine: extinct plants lean toward Mirabel, moss muffles footsteps, UV light exposes memory filaments—environment literally constrains perception and choice. Crystal vial doubles as micro-setting/tool; its emptying reconfigures the stake. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—scent > sight > touch—never cataloguing for its own sake. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions or props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: comprehend grief-scent link before the last light fades. Escalation is textural: UV frequency narrows options to “see or refuse to see,” then the bloom’s opening forces acknowledgment. Cost is conceptual—once she sees the molecular memories, ignorance is foreclosed; the vial is empty, the scent unrepeatable. No external antagonist; pressure is situational-coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: extinction, scent, and grief as love’s residue. No moralizing; the final image of the bloom-as-lantern reweights prior material without assertion. Subtext operates in gesture—uncorking vial, petals spiraling—never in thesis statements. Ambiguity is purposeful: brother’s journals undeciphered, love persists anyway.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-supple, syntax lengthens and contracts with UV exposure cadence. Diction stays within botanic-POV lexicon; “aromatically cautious,” “molecular memories” feel idiosyncratic yet precise. No dialogue, hence no register drift. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are sparse and earned; perceptual signature holds. Final paragraph modulates to elegiac rhythm without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer scent, light, memory. No scaffold loops; metaphors (“lantern itself now”) are coherent and sparse. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on image pivots. Peak beat (“the bloom stood open…”) keeps verbs strong, avoids purple overload. Copy-clean; no tense drift or pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—broker who trades light-that-reveals—feels fresh, but “memory in scent” nods to Bācker & Bōll territory; specificity of extinct-flower greenhouse saves it from template. Synthesis of botanic extinction + molecular grief is non-obvious. Risk is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-twist; boldness lies in refusing externalized action. Could swap bloom species yet keep arc, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
