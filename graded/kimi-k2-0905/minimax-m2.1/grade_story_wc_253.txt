<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her theatrical cadence, her self-loathing, her performative narration to fool the drones all read as individuated. Moral ambiguity is not just claimed but dramatized: she admits she “does not deserve to grieve” yet keeps carving memorials, a contradiction that charges every whittling beat. The final stance—blank-faced defiance—pays off the lifetime of performed neutrality, earning her Earned Stasis with visible cost (she forecloses both joy and sorrow). Secondary characters are absent, so relationship crucible is N/A; the score reflects single-POV depth only.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the Charged Poise beat—“I let my face remain perfectly, beautifully, defiantly blank”—reconfigures the mandate’s rule-set and carries undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: because she narrates, the drones pass; because they pass, she can keep whittling; because she whittles, she arrives at the blank-faced stance that crystallizes her survival. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of turbine shadows, pine curls, and drone hums tighten until the final image reweights the stake. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 30.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Farmhouse kitchen, turbine shadows sliding across floorboards, the knife’s curl “like a falling thought”—all tactile, selective, filtered through ex-performer’s eye. The dried bouquet and wooden rose function as micro-setting that constrains choice: keeping the illegal flowers forces the hiding-chest beat and fuels the whittling ritual. Wind turbines are not postcard backdrop; their rhythmic shadows time the narrator’s micro-choices and loom as the mandate’s secular cathedral. Final image marries body (blank face) and environment (turbine hum), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether she can preserve an unmandated interior life—signals early and tightens through each narrated mundane task that risks drone detection. One meaningful deepening: the bouquet’s illegal presence → hidden chest → wooden replica escalates penalty if discovered, visible cost in the time spent carving while turbines keep watching. Agency is incremental renunciation: she keeps giving herself away (voice, time, knife edge) to buy the right to remain blank. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but Accumulative lens legitimizes it; price is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete iterative pattern: every wooden replica memorializes outlawed grief while obeying the letter of joy law, reframing compliance as quiet sabotage. Subtext resides in silence—the drone hears voice frequency, not semantics—so the real rebellion is the unspoken grief inside the carved rose. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: blank face ≠ mandated joy, but a third state the regime cannot parse. No moralizing; the reweighting is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakable: theatrical timing (“The curtain falls…”), precise sensory metaphors, rhythmic control that mimics onstage delivery. Perceptual signature is sustained—she sees the world as props, lights, audience (turbines = “towering white forms”, shadows = “curtain call”). No head-hopping; single-POV remains stable. Compression taught early (“The knife descends…”) and paid off at closure. Filter verbs are voice-motivated; no register drift. Under peak stress the syntax fragments exactly as an actor counting beats: “This is my farmhouse… This is my hush…” yet stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences propel: each whittling line does triple duty—reveals process, escalates risk, textures grief. No synonym loops; “turbines” re-named only once (“towering white forms”) for variety without churn. Metaphors are clean and consistent (curl = falling thought, hush = remade silence). Paragraph cuts are purposeful; removing any would delete stage-direction timing. Opening and closing lines bookend with mirror cadence, satisfying read-aloud ear. One minor scaffold: two consecutive sentences beginning “The turbine hum…” could merge, but it does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: happiness dystopia + theatrical performer + whittling as resistance feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Small memorial carved from mandated joy centers the emotional logic without allegorical flattening. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than set-piece rebellion; coherence rewards the risk. Turbine shadows as surveillance spotlight transforms eco-tech into gothic stage lighting—specific rather than trope echo.</comment>
