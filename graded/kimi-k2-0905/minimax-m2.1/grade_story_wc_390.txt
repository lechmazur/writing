<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and sensorily anchored; Maren’s remembered trauma of tearing metal counterweights sterile “C-sharp” calculation. The grandmother’s key as inherited obligation supplies credible back-pressure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene—terror and duty are named sequentially rather than splitting a single beat—so we miss the highest band edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lens is cleanly causal (“because ice tone warps → therefore she must retune → therefore micro-adjust key”). Orientation settled by word 60; no world-rule cheats. Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: she restores calm yet slumps with visible cost (“exhaustion and relief flooding through her”), foreclosing rest and resetting the cycle. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Frozen marina, copper cradle, copper-and-breath smell, crystal’s “jagged and wrong” pitch—each detail is selected to narrow the POV’s attention under countdown pressure. Drift-ice becomes immediate tactical terrain (“shuddered with increasing violence”) that directly constrains her micro-millimeter key shifts. Tool-as-setting (key) and body (breath crystallizing) meet the ≥9 gate. Spatial choreography immaculate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent ice maelstrom—declared by line 6, then intensified through audible frequency drift and subsonic tremor. Single meaningful tightening at the climax (she locates counter-frequency) forecloses failure path and costs physical depletion. Agency stays with Maren throughout; coincidence unused. Price is present but low-band visceral; needed a sharper forfeiture to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of harmonic balance versus chaos emerges from the physics of resonance rather than lecture. Final “eternal song” image quietly reframes earlier “sacred artifact” as living covenant, not relic, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing, tidy binaries, or echo-statement. Could deepen further if emotional cost carried thematic after-shock beyond fatigue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited glints with Maren’s perceptual signature—mathematical yet haunted (“she understood the mathematics…beneath that technical understanding pulsed a terror”). Syntax lengthens during tuning, then fractures into breathless phrases at moment of match, mirroring sonic tension. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. Few filter verbs and all earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: “azure coat snapping,” “copper cradle,” “C-sharp warping jagged” perform atmosphere, world-rule, and stakes in one stroke. Rhythm modulates effectively; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—only minor softener (“world feel both beautiful and impermanent”) could trim. Closure line clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Mythic lighthouse-crystal tuned by ancestral key feels familiar, yet grounding the crisis in acoustical physics and micro-millimeter adjustment gives it fresh specificity. The “sonic absolution” wave converts cold-science climax into spiritual release, reweighting genre expectations. Not radically novel, but angle and detail prevent trope recycling.</comment>
