<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—needing her brother yet resenting the “curse”—is vivid, but no embodied micro-choice under pressure shows this warping her actions. The emerald card stays a passive talisman; she never has to risk or renounce it, so the final beat feels observed, not earned. “Blissful aberration” is asserted, never dramatized as a limit that costs her on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog, card, and voice accrete until the final Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by 62 words, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—“both trapped… and impossibly free”—with conceptual cost legible. However, the escalation is only one soft tightening; no option is foreclosed, so the beat never deepens beyond mood shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fog-thinned bay and rotting carnival ship are sketched with selective sensory economy; the emerald card serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors hold; weather and vessel affect mood but never constrain tactics—Mira could be on any pier. The garden is promised, not placed, so environment stays atmospheric rather than instrumental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the garden of forgotten names to “recapture something”—is declared early but never tested; no tangible cost or narrowing of options occurs. The single micro-turn is the voice growing “clearer,” yet this intensifies atmosphere, not pressure. Because agency stops at pressing the card to her chest, escalation is poetic rather than consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The twin-as-palimpsest premise generates a coherent theme of identity-as-multiplicity, emerging through image rather than说教. The closing paradox of “trapped… and impossibly free” offers a resonant non-literal answer, but the lack of dramatized cost keeps the reweighting cerebral. Subtext stays implicit; no pseudo-profundity, yet insight remains thin because experience is summarized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—fog as “veil being lifted,” card “rippling like water.” Syntax swells and contracts with cadence, no head-hopping. Diction skews poetic but remains within her brooding register; occasional elevated Latinate choices (“unkindled solace”) feel slightly self-conscious yet consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and largely loop-free; figurative language is disciplined, no mixed metaphors. A few echoing stems (“shared memories,” “shared history”) create low-level scaffold, not severe enough to dull closure. Information density is high; sentences advance atmosphere and premise simultaneously. Minor over-decoration in adjectives (“abandoned joy,” “phantom passengers”) keeps it below elite polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The conjoined-twin consciousness and carnival-ship-as-psychic-seance are fresh syntheses, not trope rewarming. Specificity—emerald card, garden of lost names—feels idiosyncratic rather than quirk-for-quirk’s-sake. Conceptual risk is moderate; execution safe, not boundary-pushing. Proximity check: no close echoes of canon scenes; premise would collapse if names/places swapped, signaling authentic vision.</comment>
