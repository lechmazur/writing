<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract—tremor of certainty, aesthetically driven heart—never grounded in concrete bodily contradiction; no micro-choice is charged under pressure, only soft recitations. The “decision” to walk through is pre-given by the ban-lift, so no visible cost or flaw complicates the crossing; she ends exalted with no earned friction. Character remains atmospheric rather than individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: each column dissolves by lyrical accretion, culminating in Charged Poise as the atrium hum swells. Orientation is immediate; closure is legible—she leaves carrying the new poem. Yet the cost is ambient, not protagonist-wagered; no persistent constraint shapes later tactics, so the reconfiguration feels gift-like rather than paid-for.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Cobalt atrium, frozen lake, quartz columns—each sensory layer is filtered through the photographer’s eye, guiding what she notices (glass-like ice, refracted light). The humming quartz actively dissolves in response to her verses, so the setting is agentive, not backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean; light and sound evolve with her steps, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes are perceptual liberation; pressure tightens via cumulative lyrical dissolution rather than external opposition. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes walls were mental constructs. No visible price is exacted—crossing costs neither sweat nor sacrifice—so escalation feels tonal rather than consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—sacredness as invitation, not prohibition—emerges through recurring cloud-shadow imagery and the paraphrased prohibition. Final image of poet carrying “always meant to be crossed” reweights prior sacredness without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit; no late thesis states the lesson, allowing reader reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistently lyric, photographic, painterly—cloud-shadow, fractured glass, lantern-moth hush—maintaining perceptual signature. Syntax flexes with long breathy clauses that mimic reverent approach; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; register remains within poet’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; stacked metaphors (cobalt light, fractured glass, lantern-moth hush) verge on density but serve the accumulative design. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. One paraphrase loop: “what was sacred is becoming...” triple repetition is purposeful chant, not artifact. Closure sentence is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Freshens the “forbidden sanctuary” trope by making dissolution perceptual and poetic rather than heroic. Cloud-shadow photographer as protagonist gives a non-obvious lens on boundary codes. The colonnade that hums back is an inventive animate architecture. Risk stays lyric-quiet, but coherence sustains the gamble.</comment>
