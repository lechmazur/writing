<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is character-specific—dream-pressed cartography, pulse-listening—but the final “transcend” is an unearned leap; no micro-choice or contradiction is dramatized on the page, so the cost feels asserted, not embodied. Still, her embodied attention to the seal and bunker wall keeps her above stock mystic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds: each sensory pulse, seal-glow, and ink-bleed thickens texture until the directive flips from command to answered questions—an effective CR with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; the closing transcend is more label than image, but the reweighting of “decaying directive” lands cleanly under the chosen lens.</comment>

<comment>Vine-draped concrete, copper storm scent, and the shifting seal create a tactile micro-setting that guides gesture (hand in groove, pedestal alignment). The bunker breathes with her heartbeat—an environmental mirror that charges the final image; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—“reach the threshold before the directive decays”—tightens through storm countdown and seal luminosity; the flip from protocol to answered questions is a meaningful deepening. Yet the price is purely conceptual; no lived resource is forfeited, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inversion of instruction: questions precede answers, paths choose walkers. The motif is handled through concrete texture (bleeding ink, shifting seal) rather than statement, and the ending’s conceptual repricing invites counter-readings without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is taught early (“precisely playful geometries”) and held; perceptual signature is consistent—dream-cartography, pulse-listening, copper scent. Syntax modulates with storm crescendo; no head-hop or register drift. A hairline slip: the final “transcend” is abstract, but voice control elsewhere is exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density—concrete, pulse, seal, storm packed into single beats. No loops, no scaffold; figuratives are spare and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates with wind, then crystallizes in sourceless glow. Minor template echo: “this very…” triad, but it serves mantra cadence and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dream-activated bunkers and mutable directives are familiar tropes, but the emotional cartography angle and the inversion of decay-as-answers give a fresh inflection. Specificity of seal geometry and pulse-listening keeps it from generic mystic fare; risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
