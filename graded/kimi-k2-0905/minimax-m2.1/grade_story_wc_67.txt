<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—the deliberate smash, the precise ash ritual—yet she never fully exposes contradictory impulses in-scene; the porcelain act feels pre-decided rather than wrestled with. The Renunciation lands (she carries fragments out), but the emotional cost is relayed more as textured description than as a forked choice we watch her survive. Still, her perceptual signature (“charcoal portrait ash scatterer”) threads every beat, keeping her above archetype.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative lens is declared early (transform by burning) and tightens through each added layer of ash until the final Charged Poise: gallery dark, mask glowing, reader left holding unanswerable questions with her. Causality is interior but legible—porcelain destroyed because stories kept shifting; ash poured because eyes could never be drawn; departure chosen because understanding is accepted as fragmentary. Cost is unmistakable in the last lines: “weight of everything she would never fully understand.”</comment>

<comment>Gallery, chair, porcelain shards, and scattered soot form a single, evolving micro-setting that literally supplies the materials of ritual; every description funnels into Mira’s hands. Light change from “scattered” to “dimming” tracks emotional cadence and forces the final exit. Porcelain’s former domestic safety is weaponized into cutting shards, a concrete constraint that charges the closure image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—make an honest vessel for a grandmother who eluded her—remains clear, but escalation proceeds by accretive metaphor rather than narrowing options; once the mask is built, no further obstacle or trade-off complicates the burn. The final beat still lands a cost (she leaves carrying unknowable fragments), satisfying the lens, but pressure plateaus after the mask is complete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “mirage of safety” surfaces only as overt label once, yet every image—china shattered, ash darkening hollow cheeks—reconstitutes that concept into felt contradiction. Theme emerges wordlessly: love builds illusions truth must dismantle, and art survives as residue, not likeness. Closure reweights it; the gallery absorbs the last light, making the reader experience vanishing rather than decoding a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance tuned to Mira’s synesthetic habit of thought—“porcelain glowed with its own diminished heat.” Rhythm lengthens and contracts with ritual phases, no head-hop, no filter clutter. Diction stays within her artisan lexicon; occasional cadenced repetition (“never quite captured… never could”) reads deliberate, not algorithmic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each clause layers sensory or symbolic weight without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent; ash “veins” fit porcelain fractures. A single faint echo (“something approached that Mira could not see” / “something that could be released and thus preserved”) is the only recyclable stem and does not graze the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing funerary ritual with broken-china mosaic feels fresh, and the reversal—portrait destroyed to fill mask—twists familiar memento tropes. Emotional specificity (grandmother stories that drifted each retelling) anchors invention, preventing gimmickry. Risk lies in quiet interiority, but coherence of image chain keeps it from evaporating into abstraction.</comment>
