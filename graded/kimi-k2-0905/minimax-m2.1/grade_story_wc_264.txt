<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s guard-for-hire stoicism and dreamless sleep are stated more than dramatized; the single micro-choice (refusing the merchant) is coherent but not costly enough to feel like earned renunciation. Interiority is evocative (“I cultivate the sparks”) yet leans on abstract self-explanation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she “found her staff” is the only externalized beat; more physical risk or hesitation would sharpen motivation. Still, the lens of accumulative endurance holds, and the final stance is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s “sparks” line crystallizes her stance, reweighting the chess-clock pause from abstract relic to conceptual price under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift (who, where, cargo named by line 5), causality is loose but coherent—each beat adds atmospheric density rather than because/therefore turns, appropriate to this lens. The merchant encounter supplies one tightening micro-turn that forecloses sale without blood, satisfying the single-deepening rule. Cost is conceptual yet felt: she shoulders the archive’s unmeasurable weight and keeps hope suspended.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glowing moss dune, ash-sand, and divergent archive are rendered in selective, POV-filtered strokes that constrain movement (cart jolts on hidden root, light folds hide merchant). Sensory economy favors pale-blue luminescence as both obstacle and resource, charging the final “broken lullaby” image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the short scene; no geography drifts. World rules remain consistent: wave-function charm is metaphorical but internally stable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect cargo vs. temptation to sell—is signaled early and tightened once in the merchant beat; refusal narrows her future options without violence, visible conceptual cost. Pressure is accumulative: the archive’s weight and the clock’s frozen moment deepen rather than escalate through causal turns, fitting the chosen lens. No reversal beyond the single refusal, which is sufficient at this length. Stakes stay personal and legible; world-destruction remains backdrop rather than telescopic inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: how to keep hope alive after finality—expressed through the paused clock and “cultivate sparks” reply, not authorial thesis. Subtext of commerce-in-extinction lands in the merchant’s burnt-paper eyes and grief-fractured smile. Final image reweights the glowing moss from pretty backdrop to living lullaby-mending, supplying conceptual repricing without moral statement. One near-prompt echo (“after the last forest burns”) is spoken diegetically, so allowed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction of “dreamless freight guard” and “wave-function charm” feels idiosyncratic yet consistent. Rhythm modulates from long associative sentences to crisp dialogue refusal, mirroring the beat shift. Merchant’s voice is distinct—wind-through-flute timbre—without stealing focalization. No head-hop or register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and imagistic; sentences multi-task (worldbuild + move body + charge metaphor) with minimal scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“broken lullaby finally learning to mend itself”) is earned by prior moss-light pattern. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no drumbeat cadence. Opening and closing lines carry precise sonic weight without purple inflation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The freight-guard who ferries unmeasurable archives via quantum-tinged superstition feels novel yet inevitable; burnt-world chess-clock-as-hope is a fresh synthesis. Conceptual risk—lyric stillness over plot pyrotechnics—heightens resonance without obscuring stakes. Specificity of bioluminescent moss colonizing ash-dunes anchors the abstraction. Transformation test: swap any element and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
