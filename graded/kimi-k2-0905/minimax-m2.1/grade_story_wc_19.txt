<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—hunger for open sky vs ingrained bunker fear—are dramatized in her micro-choice to place the doll on the railing beside the impossible sprout; the final resolve to “build something different” carries visible cost as she accepts returning to the bunker tonight. Interiority stays embodied (“second skin too tight and too loose”) and avoids label-speak. The porcelain doll’s pulse against her heart supplies an externalized beat of change that justifies the Earned Stasis. One hairline slip: “breathing in both directions at once” drifts toward abstraction at peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the hour ends, gravity reasserts, Mira chooses to carry the gilded hush back inside the bunker—an on-page renunciation with felt cost (“solidarity that felt like promise rather than constraint”). Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens: each silence she samples adds density until the sprout/doll image crystallizes her new stance. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“father’s bunker”). No meaningful lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The xenial trellis above cloud-deck functions as micro-setting: altitude prevents normal plant growth, so the green shoot’s presence constrains Mira’s concept of limitation itself. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and filtered pale light, mirroring her attenuated attention after years of concrete. Spatial choreography is coherent—palm on barrier, feet lift, doll placed on railing, gravity return. One minor slip: “clouds drift beneath her feet like sleeping sheep” is the only visual cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collect flavors of different silences—tightens when the gilded hush proves incompatible with bunker life; the hourglass of inverted gravity supplies escalating pressure. Agency: she actively places the doll beside the sprout, a micro-turn that accepts exposure as growth medium. Cost is legible: she must descend back to the bunker tonight, carrying a silence her father will never understand. Could edge higher if the sprout faced an immediate threat that forced a riskier choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: exposure vs shelter reframed so limitation applies to fear, not to life itself. Subtext resides in the doll’s survival centuries underground—implying cultures that once chose openness. Final image of a future trellis “where the only thing limited was the fear of opening doors” reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy binary; ambiguity lingers about how she’ll fund that trellis under her father’s roof.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Mira’s—geometry of concrete, language of sealed doors. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“threaded with the susurrus of invisible growth”) then compresses at gravity’s return, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. One clause drifts toward over-precision—“intangibly tangible presence” repeated twice; still, pattern is taught early and justifies itself as paradox she must parse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, high-density; most sentences perform two jobs (advance + image). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphor check: “gilded hush” and “silence like sleeping sheep” coexist without contradiction. One filter-verb cluster (“she realized that limitation could mean something else”) is strategically placed at the insight beat and does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inversion garden above clouds plus porcelain time-capsule doll yields a fresh angle on post-bunker emergence; trope of “escape from shelter” is retooled through sonic rather than visual liberation. Conceptual risk—gravity inversion for only one hour—pays off by forcing a crystallized stance rather than a physical escape. Specificity of “collecting flavors of different silences” prevents generic feel. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving integration.</comment>
