<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “quiet laugh” in the pavilion crystallizes the earned shift from obsession to reverence—but the micro-choice that seals her arc (picking up the brush) is only implicit, softening the cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the revelation happens to her rather than forcing a visible forfeiture. Still, the artist-through-perception construct is specific and avoids diagnostic self-talk, satisfying the 9− quick test for single-POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the postcards, frost tracings, and hidden glass layers thicken pattern until the cathedral-window map reweights the stake—beauty blooms unseen—delivering a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (her mural turns “true,” not decorative). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“amber pavilion”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. One minor causality gap: the lunar-cycle mechanics are inferred, not shown to alter any on-page tactic, but the closure beat itself is legible and charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Environment and micro-objects actively constrain: the cathedral glass’s hidden layers literalize the night-bloom secret and dictate the final shift in her painting; frost etchings act as tactile interference that redirects her gaze. Sensory economy is excellent—October light “scattered…in warm, fragmented showers” fuses vision with temperature. Pavilion, postcards, and glass all return in the closing image, cleanly meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—need to grasp why flowers bloom unseen—tightens once: the glass map reconfigures her quest from curiosity to stewardship. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of hidden beauty) rather than visceral; no tool, time, or social price is visibly forfeit, keeping the score below 8.5. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens but leans on epiphany more than compressed choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely—“the quiet courage of blooming unseen”—never sermonized; the final image of spring bulbs “preparing their own quiet performance” reprises and reframes the stake. Subtext is carried by glass layers and postcard silence rather than authorial commentary. No thematic echo penalty; insight is earned through sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “color consumed her canvases” mirrors artist cognition; cadence swells and contracts with light changes. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Diction skews slightly literary (“umbra,” “salvaged piece”) but remains within an artist’s plausible lexicon; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the accelerating clause that ends the revelation paragraph.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>High density—single sentences layer time, light, and metaphor: “October light…scattered…in warm, fragmented showers.” Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk: three successive “that” clauses in the cathedral-window sentence, but cadence mirrors the stacking glass layers, so the repetition reads purposeful rather than algorithmic. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Night-blooming botany + cathedral-window star map is a fresh synthesis; the leap from lunar etch to painterly acceptance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric horticultural mystery—but execution is specific rather than quirky. Loses the final 0.2 because the grandmother’s curator role is off-stage, reducing lived idiosyncrasy.</comment>
