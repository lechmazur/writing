<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but floats above embodied choice; the “quietly persistent” trait is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-decisions. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; the wrong turn, singing, and halo retrieval happen in passive wonder. The final resolve to build is announced, not forged under pressure, so the cost feels prospective, not paid. Meets the 9+ quick test only weakly—no causal friction visible on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the halo fragment reframes his craft and future carousel, cost is implied but not yet concrete. Wrong-turn mechanics are magical realism without setup, so causality is situational/lyric rather than strictly causal; lens holds by accumulation. Orientation clears by ~130 words; no penalty. One meaningful deepening—the halo discovery—reweights stakes; sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity is strong: sawdust/velvet, moss under boots, silver-grey light all filter through the carpenter’s wood-wise attention. Abandoned train and oasis are sketched with economy; space remains coherent across the single continuous scene. The halo fragment serves as micro-setting that will charge the future carousel, meeting the 9+ gate. No weather or modern-world slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is declared early but never tested by opposition; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No visible price or option foreclosure occurs on-page; escalation is a single lyrical lift at the halo. Acceptable for accumulative mode, yet barely clears the bar for felt cost. Agency is contemplative, not decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of repair-through-silence emerges through image chain: frozen smiles → broken halo → song → future carousel. No moralizing statements; meaning stays implicit. Final image reweights earlier “frozen” motif toward motion, achieving resonant reconfiguration. Could climb higher if silence-as-possibility had been contested rather than peacefully accepted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains distinct carpentric diction—“hands that knew wood the way others knew words.” Rhythm modulates with long breathy sentences that mirror misty hush, tightening only at the song. No dialogue, so voice coherence is high. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful; perceptual signature remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; mixed metaphors are rare. One scaffold loop: “not an absence but an invitation… not a void but a promise” paraphrases twice. Figurative language clusters in the halo paragraph but does not obscure causality. Final third is clean; 9+ still possible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Combines abandoned circus, broken halo, and silent craftsman—fresh synthesis. Wrong-turn-into-oasis risks fairy-tale convenience but stays legible under accumulative lens. Emotional risk is modest; wonder trumps danger. Specific carpenter idiom prevents generic feel.</comment>
