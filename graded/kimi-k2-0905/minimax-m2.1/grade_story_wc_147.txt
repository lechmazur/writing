<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward performed awe (“lonesome and splendid all at once”) rather than embodied contradiction; the surrender is moving yet feels predestined, muting micro-choice under pressure. The grandmother’s warning supplies motive, but Marina’s override of survival instinct is asserted, not dramatized in a beat we can test against her panic. Still, the final fusion carries a palpable cost that satisfies Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: “because” chain (vial → scent → memory → mechanism → vessel) lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—her individual death transmuted into collective afterlife. Orientation is swift: diver, temple, oxygen clock all inside 120 words. The oxygen countdown evaporates once perfume replaces air, but the story teaches this rule change before closure, so no cap triggered. Closure cost is visible: “she would live… not as herself but as something greater.”</comment>

<comment>Kelp curtains, sunken marble, extinct sea-creature reliefs—details are selective, tactile, and filtered through a diver’s narrowed attention. The temple’s glowing twilight directly supplies the final image’s charge, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography holds as she hovers, finds the altar, triggers the mechanism. One slip: “ Marina羲悬” diacritic drops after first line, a micro-continuity glitch.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—individual survival vs. becoming archival vessel—tightens exactly once when she unscrews the vial, forfeiting air for memory. Escalation is linear, not recursive, but the price (loss of self) is legible and irreversible. No antagonist beyond environment, yet the temple’s pressure feels coherent. Lacks a mid-course complication that could push tension above 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of ephemeral beauty preserved through personal annihilation emerges via image (perfume as memory liquid) rather than statement. Final line reweights “gathered hush” from abstract mood to literal vessel, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries: civilization’s trap is also its gift. Minor echo of “gathered hush” twice in opening paragraph feels purposeful, not redundant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction—“robes sweeping across marble,” “breath of centuries”—is elevated yet consistent with mythic register. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Rhythm swells organically under pressure, no template cadence. One lyrical overreach: “tenderness of a lover’s farewell” briefly swaps filter to romance cliché, but recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphor stack (“silver and gold,” “songs into the void”) sustains pattern without breaking causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Occasional elevated nominalizations (“renunciation,” “ephemeral”) fit mythic tone. Final paragraph could lose one adjective (“brilliantly illuminated”) without loss.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Underwater memory-archive summoned by scent is fresh; avoids typical mermaid or Atlantis tropes. The perfume-as-key and civilization-as-vessel conceit feel inevitable in hindsight, seeded by grandmother’s warning. Risky choice to let protagonist die off-page is fully committed to, not hedged. Slight proximity to “sunken cathedral” imagery keeps it from 9+ apex.</comment>
