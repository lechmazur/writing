<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mira’s motivations are clear and consistent—preserving stories, resisting the famine, and choosing the risk of a covert broadcast. Interiority is textural: “turning the scattered papers … into ghosts of their daytime selves,” but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; her stance is steady rather than tested. The micro-choices are all preparatory (adjusting the dial, beginning to sing) rather than a fork that costs her a path. The ending lands as Charged Poise, yet the cost is atmospheric rather than a decision we watch her pay; we infer danger, we don’t feel her relinquish a live alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the instant she sings, the dust stirs and the mist listens, reweighting the world as a place where stories can still sprout. The “story famine” rule stays intact, no soft reset. Under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens, the density intensifies as song, dust, and fog converge; one clear tightening suffices. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible, but the final image (“the dust in the corners began to stir with something that might have been anticipation”) makes the cost legible. Early orientation passes—Mira, ember alcove, candlelight within 30 words, no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The micro-setting—alcove, candle, short-wave dial glow, coal brazier—directly constrains her tactics (must hide the amber light, must work small). Mist functions as living audience, pressing the windows, a pressure that grows with the broadcast. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Mira’s copyist ear: “every note preserved was a story saved,” not visual spectacle. Final image charges the same setting: dust motes in that very alcove become the medium of rebirth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will stories survive?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened only once, when patrol proximity is re-asserted by the hidden dial light. Agency is continuous preparation rather than a decisive fork; the singing itself is the first on-page risk, but it is also the ending beat. Cost is atmospheric (discovery could mean death), yet not dramatized as a concrete forfeiture. Sufficient for this length and Accumulative lens, but the absence of a visible price keeps it from 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “memory is a living broadcast”—no moralizing lines, only images: dust grains as archive, lyrics as camouflage, mist as congregation. Subtext works through gesture (wrapping the dial in cloth) and inversion (song as weapon of peace). Final image reprises the dust motif, now animated, re-weighting the premise without stating a thesis. Avoids tidy maxim; complexity resides in the reader’s sense that tomorrow’s patrol could still erase everything.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: musical metaphors (“airwaves had gone quiet,” “every note preserved”) color every observation. Rhythm modulates—long, breath-filled sentences during set-up, then shorter pulses as she “adjusted the dial … began to sing.” No filter-verb clutter; perception stays embodied (“she barely noticed anymore”). Compression in closing line is purposeful, mirroring the hush of illicit transmission. Dialogue is absent, appropriate to solitary scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry density: “copying orchestral scores with the patience of someone who believed that every note preserved was a story saved from vanishing entirely” performs three jobs (world, motive, stakes). Figurative layer is selective—mist as slow waves, dust as memory—never floods the beat. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge; no artifacts in final third. High-band clarity is sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic setting driven not by violence but by cultural starvation; piracy = lullabies. Dust as archive is specific to this tale; removal would collapse the conceptual engine. Risk in choosing lyric, almost quiet climax is rewarded by originality. No familiar plot retread; emotional core feels intimate yet globally resonant.</comment>
