<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—obedient archivist vs. clandestine savior—remains sharp throughout; every micro-choice (slipping into the service entrance, deciding to wade the lagoon) is filtered through the same “quiet, careful” identity. The key’s fit in the hidden lock crystallizes a lifetime of inherited resourcefulness; the cost of exposure is felt in the moment the stone begins to grate. No other characters on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Eleven-year invisibility is credibly strained, not abandoned, by the final descent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s descent into the ancestral archive reweights her former invisibility into visible insurgency, cost made legible by the sirens still sweeping overhead. Causal chain holds: audit exposure → map-read in puddle → key turns → shaft opens → original histories found, each beat tightening options. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) settle within first 60 words; no debt. The inferred lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selective, urgency-filtered detail: the “amber-lit streets that streetlamps couldn’t touch” externalizes Mira’s practiced shadow-use; the mineral scent and warmth of the lagoon guide her knee-level decision to wade. Micro-setting (the worn key’s teeth, the false-natural stone lid) directly constrains her next muscle movement. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible body positions. One slip: “auric” is repeated twice, but the lagoon’s glow recurs as charged image at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of suppressed truth vs. regime erasure—signaled in paragraph 1 and escalated by audit exposure; the puddle-map discovery is the single meaningful turn that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: once she lifts the stone slab, return to invisibility is impossible. Escalation is linear, not deepened by secondary reversal, but sufficient at this length. Agency is hers; luck complicates (audit) but does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: palimpsest city, stubborn lagoon, grandmother-smoothed key—no abstract sermon. Final image of scattered star-codes reframes her former invisibility as future dissemination network, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral statement. Indifference as tyranny is dramatized, not labeled. One near-fail: “the tyranny of indifference” flirts with thesis-speak, but the phrase is buried mid-story and instantly grounded in the archive’s living evidence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Mira’s perceptual filter: “whisper in the vast marble halls,” “shadows the streetlamps couldn’t touch”—syntax stays spare, slightly clinical, matching archivist precision. No head-hop. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses under sirens, matching heartbeat. One elevated word “vector” is justified by Ministry jargon she would know. Free-indirect moment—”stubborn as memory itself”—is earned. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences fold archival sabotage into taxonomy, grandmother lineage into key history. Figurative control tight: no mixed metaphors, no purple. One paraphrase loop—“regime had tried to drain it twice… lagoon had reappear each time”—but the repetition enforces stubbornness motif, so waived. Sentence rhythm varies from curt archival listings to liquid lagoon longues. Zero typos, zero simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic filing clerk + insurgent archivist + inherited urban speleology feels novel yet inevitable. Palimpsest city and self-healing lagoon literalize memory resistance without allegorical excess. Grandmother-to-granddaughter relay avoids lone-savior trope. Risk of “defunct key opens secret vault” is offset by geological specificity and prior family lore. Ending refrains from sudden super-weapon discovery; archive’s existence is seeded early via “hollowed texts.”</comment>
