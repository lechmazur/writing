<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s arsonist origin and off-grid life read as backstory labels; the Archive years are summarized, not dramatized. No contradictory impulses play out in scene; the final “promise fulfilled” is declared, not cost-earned. Interiority defaults to abstract “analytically intuitive” tellings rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Mira stays to preserve rather than burn—paid off on the final image of emerging with documented truths, a conceptual cost legible under the Accumulative lens. Orientation who/where is delayed ~180 words but the disorientation is later functional (lost city), so the penalty is waived. Causality between tapestry fragment → portrait → hidden cache is tight; the “three-year” ellipsis is told, not shown, softening the final weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The Archive’s murals-as-language, smoke-scarred lanterns, and portrait mechanics supply concrete tactile detail that constrains her search tactics. Sensory balance favors texture of paint-splinters and ancient smoke over tourist catalog. At 9+ gate: the self-portrait’s hinge mechanism materially shapes her discovery and thus charges closure—meets test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover vs. hoard knowledge—is clear; pressure is textural accumulation (each new mural layer) rather than a tightening fork. No beat narrows her options or forces trade-off; the portrait opens on first touch. Cost is conceptual (years spent) but not dramatized on page; escalation stays accretive, not decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as insurgent archive versus controlled library—emerges through accreted images of burned vs. buried collections. Final image reweights earlier arson as precursor to preservation, avoiding moral lecture. Subtext stays implicit; no redundant thesis stated. Ambiguity survives: knowledge freed yet buried anew, giving aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains steady distance; diction “volcanic tenderness” supplies signature without purple drift. Compression (“seventeen months…three years”) is strategic, keeps momentum. No head-hopping; POV knowledge disciplined. Rhythm modulates between propulsive cataloguing and still portrait beat, reinforcing focal bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: each sentence advances premise or image. Few near-loops (“knowledge…knowledge”) but phrasing generally varied. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “she realized…she understood” summary pair; doesn’t touch closure. Clean grammar, precise spatial choreography inside chamber.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Combines contemporary censorship (fee-based libraries) with prehistoric art-language archive, yielding fresh synthesis. Vandalized self-portrait as lock mechanism is inventive micro-device. Risk—elliptic 3-year gap—keeps lens coherent without gimmick. Not radically unprecedented, but angle and emotional charge feel specific, memorable.</comment>
