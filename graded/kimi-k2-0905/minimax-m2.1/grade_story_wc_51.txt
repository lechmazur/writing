<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The weaver’s interior contradiction—accepting petrifaction for weightlessness—is embodied through micro-choices (threading, orienting) and calcifying fingertips. The arc from overwhelmed arrival to willing dissolution is credible, but the final surrender is forecast so early that the closing beat feels predetermined rather than freshly chosen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added strand layers silence and stone until the closing Charged Poise reweights the premise—she becomes the pattern itself. Orientation is swift; the single scene tightens once when calcification reaches her breathing. Cost is legible in the line “she did not resist,” but the causality of the grotto’s bargain is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto’s breathing ceiling and kerosene draft constrain posture and breath, charging the final image where she freezes into the wall. Sensory hierarchy is biased to metallic hush and starlight, mirroring internal petrifaction without overt symbol. Spatial choreography is clean; body-tool-stone relations track across every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep weaving at the price of her body—tightens once when calcification climbs past knuckles. Pressure is accumulative: each thread adds silence and stone, narrowing future motion. The cost is visible in calcified flesh, but the escalation is steady rather than acute; one sharper turn would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: sorrow distributed into pattern is still sorrow, and transmutation into stone is not escape but diffusion. The whalebone reverie reprise reweights earlier silence from comfort to engulfing inevitability. No moral is declared; resonance lingers in the image of infinite scaled grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric POV maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays mineral, metallic, aquatic—“shingled hush,” “whale-boned embrace.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath rhythm, taught early and paid off in the final lung-like exhalation of starlight. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and filtered through bodily limits.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but patterned: fractal imagery repeats with variation, avoiding loop. Metaphors remain coherent within mineral/marine logic; no mixed vehicles. Clause rhythm modulates to mimic breathing, propelling the accumulative beat. One paraphrase loop (“layer upon layer of silence”) is forgivable in 800 words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grief-mining grotto that turns weavers into wall-stone is fresh; familiar “release your pain” trope is subverted by the price of petrifaction. The fractal weave motif is developed through tactile threading rather than abstract math. Risky lyric escalation is sustained without clarity loss, yielding memorable specificity.</comment>
