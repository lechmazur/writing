<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s exhaustion-born fearlessness is shown through ritual micro-moves—harp case hugged “like a secret,” deliberate tooth-press to string—each choice externalizing her marrow-deep motive. The soldier’s flicker-smile is earned because Mira first excavates his pre-war humanity (milk-out-the-nose memory) and then risks discordant sound that could fail. Interiority stays concrete: “familiar ache in her chest that never quite healed” bodies her cost. Only minor shortfall: no live contradiction tested in this beat; attribute is confirmed, not complicated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the soldier’s dispersal in “something that looked almost like gratitude” reconfigures Mira’s endless task, cost felt in her unhealed ache. Causal chain intact—croc-tooth tuning → broken chord → laughter → release—each step contingent on the last. Orientation is clean by line 10. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Echo gorge’s acoustic wound is more than backdrop: its amplifying stone literally enables the broken-threefold resonance that frees the ghost. Light threads, mist, and narrowing walls are filtered through Mira’s ear and grief, guiding her tactical placement of harp and body. Micro-setting—the shifted harp bridge—functions as environment-in-hand, constraining the exact frequency she needs. Final image of “luminous ache” sun fuses outer landscape with inner cost, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can this soul laugh before dissolution—tightens when the discordant chord risks failure; success forecloses her chance to rest. One meaningful escalation: the first-ever specter-smile proves her method works, raising the emotional ante for every future soul. Cost is visible: the soldier’s release re-opens her own “familiar ache.” No reversal for Mira this round, but pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—laughter as integrative grief-work—emerges from the sonic alchemy of broken notes, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: tooth pressed to string enacts the pressure of shame transmuted into sound. Final image of “sacred absurdity” reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: joy does not erase atrocity, it merely lets the dead leave—complex, unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mira’s perceptual filter: “she only knew that when she struck…” keeps knowledge character-bound. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures during the chord—“broken and strange, each one splitting into three”—mirroring sonic rupture. No head-hopping; diction stays within her weathered lexicon. Voice modulation is purposeful, not algorithmic.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “hush of a hidden sunrise bled through the stone walls in threads of amber light” does three jobs—time, place, mood—in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (sound as tear-music, gorge as wound) stay consistent. One minor scaffold—“she had encountered him before, many times”—could trim to “she had met him here before,” but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—psychopomp harpist who must make ghosts laugh—feels fresh yet inevitable, grounded in tactile detail (croc-tooth tuning key, misaligned bridge). Risk is high: comic release for suicided soldier could have trivialized trauma; instead, specificity of the milk memory transforms absurdity into grace. No close literary echoes; the sonic after-life gorge is a new space. Concept commits fully, no safety hedging.</comment>
