<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s inherited calling and her solitary vigil in the drowned university are rendered with tactile interiority; the moment she kneels to lift the scorched diaries, curiosity and obligation lock into one embodied motion. The final sketching in the dark crystallizes a credible endurance that costs her solitude yet feels earned by the preceding attention to Ashworth’s echo. Minor: the “acute sensitivity” label is stated once before it is dramatized, but the body-quick reactions that follow override the lapse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensuous layer (ivy breath, ink ghost, negative emulsion) tightens the stake of remembering until the unfinished echo-chart passes from Ashworth to Mira with undeniable conceptual cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the walls “begin to dream aloud,” reconfiguring her isolation into continuity; the cost is the unending, unshared labor she now accepts. Causality remains intact: every beat of discovery follows because the fire died too soon and because Mira chose to keep listening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Granite, ash, ivy, and brass lenses are filtered through Mira’s professional gaze; the cold fireplace and the negative strip act as micro-settings that literally enable the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: we track her boots on worn stones, knees on cinders, negative held to dying light. Weather (the advancing green, rain through the roof) is causally linked to the survival of the diaries and thus to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the building’s dream before it dissolves—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when Ashworth’s partial map passes to Mira. The middle tightening occurs when the half-burned pages force her to improvise with the film negative, narrowing options from “read” to “recover or lose forever.” The price is the recognition that the task is endless; this is legible in the final image of her sketching into darkness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as an unfinished relay across ecological collapse—emerges through the specific objects (negative, ivy, ash) rather than exposition. The ending’s image of walls dreaming aloud offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Ashworth’s question, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext of intergenerational caretaking is carried in the silent transfer of the incomplete chart.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly aligned to Mira’s perceptual hierarchy: she notices what a cartographer of echoes would—footstep-worn stones, chemical behavior of negatives, ivy's hush. Syntax lengthens and softens during discovery, then compresses into short declaratives as light fails, mirroring her shift from excavation to acceptance. No head-hopping or register drift; the single moment of elevated diction—“conceptual repricing”—is contained within Ashworth’s diary voice, not the narrator’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “leaves pressing against shattered windows like curious animals” performs atmosphere and stakes in one stroke. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, character, or pressure. Figurative language is spare and tested—mixed metaphors are avoided even when science and mysticism intertwine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The corridor-echo cartographer concept feels freshly minted yet internally coherent; the negative strip repurposed as palimpsest reader is a specific, low-tech solution that deepens world logic. Climate-collapse setting is familiar, but the notion that buildings dream their lost occupants via half-burned marginalia offers a non-obvious emotional angle. Risk is taken and paid off: the ending refuses triumphant recovery, opting for charged continuation that reweights solitude as stewardship.</comment>
