<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective caretaker vs. risk-taking witness—co-exist in the granite moment; Maya’s unprompted hand-touch crystallizes earned trust. Reflection is tied to present eclipse stimuli and alters her micro-choice to stay silent, satisfying BRR. The final squeeze carries visible relational cost, but the interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak (“nurture lifelong wonder”) that blunts edge under peak pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the returned sun and linked hands reconfigure meaning with undeniable emotional cost felt in the squeeze. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (shadow, breath, hair relic) deepens stake density until the hush itself becomes the decisive reweighting. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no causal breaks. The eclipse coincidence complicates rather than resolves, satisfying lens guardrails.</comment>

<comment>Granite outcropping, manzanita, white sage, and ancient oak are filtered through Elara’s body and ukulele, constraining her seating circle and chord choice. Eclipse light shift directly governs when she lowers the instrument and chooses silence. Final image of ordinary brightness re-returned recharges the ridge’s liminal status. Micro-setting (silk-wrapped curl in pouch) charges the closing memory-link but never physically alters action, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve wonder without forcing it”—tightens when totality demands absolute silence from Elara; her renunciation of sound forecloses her usual therapeutic tool with visible professional cost. Accumulative pressure mounts via shadow density and children’s gaze rather than causal reversals, sufficient for 600-word frame. The hand-touch micro-turn reweights options: silence has succeeded where music might have failed. Cost is legible on page, though escalation is gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of protectable wonder emerges through eclipse silence and hair relic, never sermonized. Final image of returned brightness re-prices the curl: future growth, not nostalgia, is the true keepsake. Subtext in Maya’s spontaneous touch out-argues any statement about connection. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in shared breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a warm, melodic cadence that modulates into spare, breath-synced syntax during totality. Perceptual signature—sound-as-tactile, light-as-breath—stays character-locked. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she felt the familiar ache”) and paid off in closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer light, child gaze, and internal pulse. Rhythm shifts from lullaby cadence to short declarative hush at totality without template monotony. One mixed metaphor—“silk prison” for baby curl—clashes with nurturing tone, minor artifact. No loops or scaffold; closing line reuses “ordinary magic” but reweights it legitimately.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Eclipse-as-therapy-session trope is refreshed through refusal to play: silence becomes the intervention. Hair curl evolves from nostalgia token to future-facing wager, a non-obvious re-pricing. Ukulele plus relic plus cosmic event feels inevitable in hindsight, not checklist. Risk is quiet—renunciation over spectacle—but coherence stays intact.</comment>
