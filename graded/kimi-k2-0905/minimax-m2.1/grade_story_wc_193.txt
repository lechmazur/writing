<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya’s distrust of promises is anchored in a single past wound; it drives every micro-choice (answering the text, clutching the bolt, stepping inside). The mirrored-self beat externalizes her interior contradiction without therapy-speak and forces her to witness her own survival cost; the tear-streaked acceptance is causally earned. Flaw: “virtuously mischievous” is asserted twice but never allowed to complicate a decision on the page, so the trait stays label-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: scam trauma → text lure → bolt retrieval → farm arrival → quantum payoff. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bolt’s re-weighting from kitsch relic to crystallized belief is legible, and the “lighter” final line shows felt cost. Orientation is clean by 120 wds; lens stays causal throughout. Non-closure nit: the other Maya is introduced late yet given climactic exposition without prior seed, a minor teleport that keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mushroom farm is sketched with electric-earth scent and motion-tracking glow; the environment actively stages the confrontation. The bolt operates as micro-setting, its threads “digging into skin” to guide grip and decision. Lighting shifts mirror internal pressure without overt symbolism. One spatial gap: we never learn how the two Mayas occupy the same junction—floor, wall, distance—so choreography momentarily floats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she trust a promise again?”—is signaled early and tightened at the bolt-glow beat where refusal becomes impossible. Protagonist agency is present (drives to farm, speaks text, holds bolt), and the price is witnessing her own trauma, an irreversible reframing. No external antagonist needed; pressure stays internal-coherent. Escalation is single-arc rather than layered, adequate for 750 wds but not richly complex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of promise-as-pressure crystallizes through the bolt-diamond metaphor; the final image reweights “broken expectations” into “something brilliant” without moralizing. Subtext runs through object handling and mirrored self rather than exposition. Ambiguity lingers: is the quantum promise benevolent or just another scheme? The refusal to answer charges the after-effect. One thematic echo line (“promises could be traps”) is stated outright in paragraph one, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tight to Maya’s skeptical perceptual filter: numbers rearrange, fungi “track her like curious animals,” metal threads feel like “tiny teeth.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under threat; no filter-verb stacks. The lyric glitch signals (“words arriving from slightly different moments”) are taught early and paid off in the crackling dialogue. Voice remains distinct and pressure-calibrated; minor repetition of “promise” vocabulary is intentional motif, not monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—information duplexes without scaffold: “pressure tasted like anticipation and copper.” No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; metaphor vehicles respect physical logic. Rhythm breathes with beats, accelerates at bolt-translucence. One register spike: “Conceptual Repricing” feels academic against visceral imagery, but it appears only in final clause and does not blunt momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing pyramid-scheme trauma with quantum mysticism yields a fresh angle on betrayed hope; the bolt-as-diamond engine is specific and non-transferable. Risk in the doppelgänger device pays off by literalizing self-witness. Tropes (mysterious texts, glowing farm) are re-skinned through Maya’s scam radar, keeping them from cliché. No close echoes of famous scenes;concept commits fully without late rule cheats.</comment>
