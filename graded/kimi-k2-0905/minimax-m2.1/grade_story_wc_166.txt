<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “architecture of her bones” and “salt of her former world” poeticize memory without embodying contradiction. The renunciation lands as a serene given rather than a choice fought in scene; no micro-choice shows cost before the shoulder-touch. The mortal woman remains a silent canvas, so relationship pressure is absent. Still, the dancer’s alien sensorium and the final lightness sell a credible shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tide-images and garden hush tightens toward the ink-transfer. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—anchor dissolves, exile becomes arrival—cost legible in “lighter than the dust.” Orientation clear by line 4; no causal break. One shard, one POV, one transitionless scene meets scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Twilight garden, pale flowers, moonstone speck—selective sensory triad that constrains the ritual beat. Micro-setting (hollow of palm, shoulder skin) doubles as arena. Starlight on dust charges the final image. No spatial drift; bodies track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she surrender the tides forever to write the verse? Pressure escalates through sensory accrual, not external opposition. The tightening is the breath-three-times beat that commits the last tide-dust; option foreclosed. Cost visible as “anchor dissolve,” but secondary stakes (mortal’s fate, ban enforcement) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme: exile as voluntary metamorphosis, not loss. Emerges via tide/garden mirroring and the final re-weighting of “return.” No moralizing; silence of mortal woman invites reader to fill gap. Avoids tidy profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through dancer’s alien perception: “water finding its level,” “obsidian grace.” Syntax lengthens and shortens like surf, teaching pattern early. No head-hop; mortal’s recognition rendered as external gesture. Register consistent, elevated yet ocean-worn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Figurative density high but patterned; moon-tide metaphors repay at closure. One scaffold: “three years since…” sentence triplet could compress. No mixed vehicles; “salt in rain” dissolve is precise. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fantasy of nostalgic ban + tide-dancer tattooist feels fresh; avoids chosen-one cliché. Conceptual risk: cosmic verse on skin could read gimmicky, but specificity of moonstone dust and fledge ritual grounds it. Image of exile-as-arrival reverses expected sorrow. Not quite transformative, but memorable.</comment>
