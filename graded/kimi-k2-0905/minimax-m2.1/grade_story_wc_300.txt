<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Margret’s interior contradiction—career-long fixation on concrete safety vs. the cave’s invitation to vulnerability—is concrete and embodied (“something crack in her chest”). Micro-choice to lift the pearl crystallizes her re-valuation and costs her prior professional detachment; the etched shells visibly re-weight her stance. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Voice remains coherent and specific to her evaluator lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each new reflection inside the crystals deepens the central stake (walls vs. connection) rather than causally reversing it. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pearl ascending becomes the container of confessed hopes, reconfiguring Margret’s future duties with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image—“the first crack had been made.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal cave functions as micro-setting that literally collapses the bunker’s wall and reframes choice; the pearl’s light charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through evaluator POV—rust, quartz crunch, refracted rainbows—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the ladder descent and pool approach. Weather absent but irrelevant; no credibility dings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—walls vs. connection—tightens when the collapsed floor forces Margret to confront the confession archive. Agency: her decision to lift the pearl forecloses her prior emotional bunker; price is the loss of professional anonymity now carrying private souls. Escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens: each shell read adds luminous weight to the pearl. No coincidence resolves; cost is on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern—walls / shells / light—rather than assertion. Final image of “first crack” offers non-literal answer to thematic question without moral tag. Subtext operates in silence: the hush after she lifts the pearl carries the cost of future exposure. Ambiguity lingers: will the archive broadcast heal or shame? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is evaluator-bent—everything measured against safety codes. Diction stays within her lexicon (“certification manual,” “air filtration capacity”). Rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses as light intensifies. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Free indirect style clean; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data + thematic overtone (“cultivated—that much was clear…became a small, contained sun”). No mixed metaphors; “cathedral of crystal” is singular image, not stacked. Scaffold screen: only one paraphrase loop (“walls when it should have learned to knock them down”) but it is intentional refrain, not artifact. Closure image unblurred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise flips bunker trope into emotional speleology; freshness lies in coupling doomsday architecture with confessional archive. Transformation test: story collapses without evaluator POV + pearl light reweighting. Risky crystalline cavern accepted without exposition because pattern taught early (“formations that refracted her light”). No close echoes of famous scenes. Specificity: shells etched with anonymous apologies feels new.</comment>
