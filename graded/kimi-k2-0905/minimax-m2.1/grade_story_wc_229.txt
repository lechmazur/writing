<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—salt-granite under palm, jasmine cutting ego—and her renunciation of prayer for “a vibration that had no name” is a micro-choice that visibly costs her old certainties. The causal chain from vial → scent → lens → ship is clean, but the “screaming tenderness” line drifts into label-speak at the exact climax, softening the embodied contradiction needed for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the logbook line “The whispers were right” reweights the entire premise, making the lighthouse’s song a new rule-set with undeniable social cost for every sailor who will now expect darkness to answer. Causal lens holds: jasmine drop → purified intent → beacon reframed → ship turns; the 30-year blank page is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics and image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, salt-worn granite, and brass lens housing are tactile tools that constrain Mira’s grip and guide the vibration outward; the night-scent garden is not backdrop but the enabling resource that charges the final image. Micro-setting qualifies: jasmine vial + lens housing together function as the “garden at night” condensed into portable catalyst. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and final image—meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can whispers reach farther than shouts?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Mira forsakes audible prayer for silent vibration; the Cost Proof Test is satisfied by the ships’ visible turn within the hour. One meaningful escalation under causal lens: thermal chaos → jasmine cut → intent purified → beacon retooled → sailors saved. Price is conceptual but legible: Mira crosses a threshold she can’t uncross, as the logbook will now expect whisper-miracles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely through the recurrence of “frequency,” “vibration,” and “song” until the final reconfiguration reframes communication itself as non-verbal tenderness. No moralizing; the logbook line acts as resonant image rather than thesis. Ambiguity lingers—did the sailors turn because of physics or faith?—embracing complexity without false equivalence. Slight deduction for “screaming tenderness” echoing prompt language a touch too literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp—Mira notices stone temperature, cork origin, lens brass coldness in character-specific hierarchy. Rhythm accelerates across the beacon-turn beat: clipped sentences mimic pulse then elongate with jasmine release. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she felt” appears once to anchor embodied perception, not pad).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“salt-worn granite beneath her fingers” does sensory and character work in one stroke. Mixed metaphor risk in “wounded stars” but saved by consistent light/sound duality. Cadence shifts mirror thermal pressure → cool release. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not exposition. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the single drop of night carry the reverb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse as sonic instrument + jasmine as anti-ego solvent + apprenticeship as rite-of-passage feels inevitable yet new. Risk of “frequency that smooths human hearts” could slide into pseudo-science, but text keeps it metaphoric and character-bound. Proximity check: no close echoes of well-known lighthouse tales; the grandmother lore is localized to this tower. Conceptual integrity holds—no late rule inventions.</comment>
