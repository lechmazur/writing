<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s cellular grief for vanished species is viscerally embodied (“ghosts in her blood”), but the moment of decisive agency—her choosing the unborn-creatures atlas—is slightly under-written; the causal hinge from passive witnessing to active midwife is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual rather than corporeal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: rising tide → floating books → mirrored selves → new atlas forms a seamless cadence shift. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—extinction repurposed into genesis—visible when “the brass sundial’s hum rose…in welcome”; the price is the eternal burden of bearing extinct memories, felt in the final choral image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brass sundial, tidal water, and marble underfoot are tactile instruments that steer every beat; the sundial’s atomic reflectivity literally fractures her thousand selves onto its surface, charging the final image. Cloud-high library rules stay consistent—books rise like fish, water is saltless knowledge—while spatial anchoring stays crisp even as water reaches knees.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into generative connection—tightens when the unknown atlas surfaces; the tide’s literal lift mirrors her emotional lift, forcing the choice to midwive future species. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual haunted memory (“chorus…singing not in mourning but in welcome”), a felt price under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>The theme that extinction is a womb, not a tomb, emerges solely through image chain—mirrored selves, unborn atlas, welcoming chorus—never sermonized. Final reweighting is non-literal and resonant; no tidy moral is asserted, only the crystallized stance that grief must birth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric-elevated diction (“atomic reflective surface,” “reincarnation memory”) is anchored in Elara’s scholarly, centuries-old interiority; rhythm swells with tide cadence, then compresses into the final choral hum. No dialogue, so voice unity remains unbroken; perceptual signature is consistent—she sees knowledge as marine life, time as light fracture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Figurative layering is dense but purposeful, pattern-taught early (“water carried no salt, only knowledge”). No mixed metaphors; clauses stay clean, propulsion high. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) is marginally above POV vernacular, but the grandiloquence fits a 300-year librarian speaking of cosmic memory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal library as memory-womb, extinction midwifery, and the sundial that refracts past/future selves synthesize into a fresh emotional theorem: the archivist of loss is the obstetrician of the unborn. Conceptual risk is high yet fully realized; no retreat into safe sentiment.</comment>
