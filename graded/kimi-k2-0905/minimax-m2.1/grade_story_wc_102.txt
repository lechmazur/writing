<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is vivid—body-level memory of salt, trembling hands—but the “camera obscura artist” identity is mostly label; we never see her actually adjust aperture, mix chemistry, or solve a problem the tool poses. The decisive breath-rhythm choice feels arrived at rather than struggled through; no micro-choice visibly risks failure or forfeiture, so the cost is inferred, not embodied. Still, the saffron-robed past-life grief is specific enough to lift her above stock. Strong interior contradiction present, but second half slips into therapeutic summary (“rhythm of healing”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: unused love is released, viaduct exhales—Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by word 60; no penalty. Causality inside the memory bleed is slightly elliptical—why this viaduct, why tonight?—but the pattern teaches early that “breathing calls the light,” so the final transfer is earned. Drive lens holds without contradiction; no teleporting props.</comment>

<comment>Wisteria scent, firefly altitude, and stone temperature are filtered through Mei’s perceptual bias—she smells sweetness “made denser by evening mist,” a tactile POV detail. The camera-obscura box, silk pouch, and Kwan Yin tear function as micro-setting that literally channels the light tendrils; environment constrains the final tactic. Spatial choreography is flawless: apparatus balanced, tear lifted toward stones, no impossible positions. Weather and bloom press in, mirroring internal softening without overt symbolism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“to heal unused love”—is signaled by paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: breathing shifts from shallow to mourning to acceptance, narrowing options to “receive and release.” Cost is conceptual but legible—she permanently carries the transformed current back into the world. Agency is present (she angles the lens), yet the beat is more receptive than risky; no credible loss of tool, stamina, or social credit is dramatized, keeping it just below top band.</comment>

<comment>Theme of love as recyclable energy emerges through image-chain: liquid pearl → light tendrils → new-flowing radiance; never sermonized. Final image reweights the premise—love is not stored in afterlife but in architecture waiting for a lens—achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext of “pilgrim of sparks” stays implicit; no thesis line recycles the prompt. Avoids sentimentality by keeping grief sensory (salt on tongue) rather than abstract.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains clean distance; perceptual signature is painterly-light: “twilight settled like a held breath,” “fireflies rose like the thoughts of earth.” Syntax lengthens then compresses with Mei’s breathing, mirroring uptake/release. No dialogue, so no register clash. Filter verbs are few and motivated (“she understood then”). Occasional lyric loft (“liquid pearl”) stays within an artist’s plausible lexicon; rhythmic control is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath-unit sentences in twilight description, then clipped fragments under pressure (“elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere”). Information density high—one sentence often does description, interior, and world rule. No paraphrase loops; however, “something like mourning and then transformed into something like acceptance” is a near self-paraphrase that softens the climax, tempering the score. Figurative logic stays coherent; no mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Camera obscura as spiritual memory-catcher is fresh; unused love cached in stonework is a non-obvious synthesis. Past-life bleed via breathing cadence repurposes a familiar trope into actionable mechanics. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation could have slid into syrup—but specificity of Kwan Yin’s tear and saffron robes keeps it particular. Not radically groundbreaking, yet angle feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
