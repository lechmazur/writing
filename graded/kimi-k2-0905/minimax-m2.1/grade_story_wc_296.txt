<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s isolation, interior contradiction, and embodied shame feel specific; the “miscast spell frozen in crystalline confession” gives his flaw a concrete price. Yet his emotional arc is narrated more than dramatized—only the final seed-planting shows a micro-choice with cost, so the turn from hubris to acceptance is told, not tasted. Still, the guardedness and gift-of-finding shape his tactics and keep him credibly flawed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the spell froze, therefore Kaelen returns; because he unbends and walks expanding circles, therefore the dome cracks and the seed can feed. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the vortex becomes a still pool, his shame becomes soil, and the cost—“older than he had expected”—is felt in the mirrored face. One mild paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from the 9 band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard-vortex is never mere backdrop: the petrified trees groan, the cursed water dissolves spell-shards, the moss-slick rocks force barefoot choreography. The ice dome literally refracts his failure back at him, charging the final image when the pool reflects only the man who rose. Spatial tracking stays coherent; no orientation debt. Micro-setting (seed, bare feet, mirror-pool) constrains every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is reversal of magical failure; pressure escalates via the widening circles that crack the dome—one tightening mechanic, legible cost (his aging reflection, the eaten flesh-residue). No antagonist needed; coincidence only complicates. The turn is his alone, foreclosing the path of eternal shame. Missing only a sharper material price on his body to enter 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ice-to-soil arc: failure as fertile ground, mirrors that hide falls. No explicit moralizing; the final image of the pale shoot reweights “warlike serenity” into growth that feeds on death. Subtext in the seed’s origin (harvested from a corpse) quietly complicates redemption. Slight risk of thematic echo in “what mirrors don’t show” line, but it is earned by prior pool-gazing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate keeps tight psychic distance; perception skewed toward tactile earth-magic—“moss-slick rocks,” “flesh-eating seed” feel Druid-specific. Syntax lengthens then shortens with vortex rotation, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Filter verbs minimal; the one visible “he realized” is justified as explicit insight after long solitude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the vortex: longer sentences for swirl, clipped fragments at crack. Metaphors stay physically coherent—ice as confession, rainbow shards as fragmented pride. One scaffold loop: “finding was not the same as fixing / finding the wound did not heal it” could compress. Otherwise density high; nouns concrete, verbs strong, no thesaurus drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Frozen confession as literal ice-dome, spell-failure converted to carnivorous horticulture—fresh synthesis of familiar eco-fantasy tropes. The expanding-circle method externalizes an internal shift without artificial rule changes. Risk taken in quiet, lyric ending rather than magical duel, and it pays off by reconfiguring shame into soil. Could edge higher if the seed’s prior victim tied back to Kaelen’s own guilt.</comment>
