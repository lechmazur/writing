<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s exiled-chess-tutor identity is sharply embodied: her fingers “winnow” the tapestry the way they once probed pieces, and the border she decodes is literally her own scandal rewoven. The interior contradiction—guilt vs. conviction that the sacrifice was teachable—drives every micro-choice, and the final stilling of her hands shows earned renunciation with cost. The only flaw: the “fierce repose” tone is named more than dramatized in body language, so the hierarchy of values feels slightly abstract at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative lens holds: each frozen tableau adds density until the tapestry decoding act breaks the pattern and reweights Mira’s guilt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her story literally re-woven, the village restarting—visible in the first raindrop and the resumed motion of the child. Orientation is immediate; no因果链 breaks. Cost is felt: she forfeits the self-loathing that had kept her in exile. The ending would hit 9+ if the price were sharpened by an external witness or irrevocable act rather than internal quiet.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the frozen market square, suspended mid-game, functions as a literal board where Mira is both piece and player. The platinum labyrinth’s “gleaming coils” mirror the tapestry’s spiral of threads, charging the final image when she folds the rewoven story beneath her arm. Sensory hierarchy is tutor-biased—she notices pattern, weight, strategic spacing—so every detail serves both characterization and theme. Rain awakening the villagers provides causal environmental shift that externalizes her thaw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness vs. public condemnation—tightens via the accumulating frozen tableaux that refuse her absolution. The single meaningful escalation is the discovery that the tapestry records her disgrace; decoding it becomes the decisive act that restarts time. Agency is pure attention and renunciation; cost is the realization that she alone kept herself frozen. Stakes would prickle more if the village’s thaw carried social risk (will they blame her?), but the internal pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the value of teaching sacrifice itself becomes the moral reconfiguration. The tapestry’s frayed border literalizes the way narratives unravel and reweave truth; the final fold under her arm is the quiet answer that some games are won by refusing to play for victory. No moralizing line mars the close; resonance lands in the rain-soaked stillness. The concept of “woven hush” reweights from decorative motif to epistemic tool—silence as the space where meaning is re-stitched.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, rhythmic, tutor-cold: “delicate curls” of breath, “amber of stopped time,” “spiraling construct of metal wires.” Perceptual signature notices strategy, pattern, sacrifice; metaphor stays inside that lexicon. Syntax lengthens for suspended time, shortens when rain restarts motion—rhythmic control matches arc. No head-hopping, no register drift; the few adjectives (“vast and terrible”) are earned by folk hyperbole. Could ascend to 9+ with one surprising sensory twist that breaks the chess-master lens—smell, temperature—during the pivotal decoding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence music is deliberate: parallel “always twisting, always arranging” enacts the fidget habit; clause elongation mirrors frozen duration. No loops, no scaffold, high density—every line advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (labyrinth = sky-reflecting board; tapestry = narrative board). Minor overwriting in “suspended spell” and “gleaming coils” but these are pattern-taught early and recur with payoff. Proofing clean; punctuation wielded for rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of chess pedagogy, time-frozen village, and tapestry-as-case-file feels singular: the metaphoric system is totalized rather than bolted on. The idea that exile is a village where time stops until you reweave your own scandal is fresh mythic logic. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal turns—pays off because closure reconfigures meaning rather than plot. Could nudge 9+ if the labyrinth’s geometry secretly matched the chess opening she taught the boy, making the pattern feel mathematically inevitable.</comment>
