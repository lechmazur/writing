<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is sensor-rich and glass-maker specific; the shift from hunted to hunter is credibly seeded. Still, the moment of resolve (“she understood finally”) is narrated rather than dramatized, softening the cost of her new stance. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene—grief simply “loosens” without visible friction. Meets the 9+ test only partially; the final choice is declared, not earned on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the ledger tucked to her heart reconfigures her from prey to pursuer with conceptual cost legible. Accumulative lens holds: frost patterns and ledger notations tighten into a single usable map. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalties. The turn relies on an off-page jump—“she understood finally”—rather than a causal beat shown; this keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Canyon acts as micro-setting: frost-rimmed sandstone constrains movement and literally reveals the smugglers’ routes. Temperature differential (sun-warmed wall vs. creeping frost) mirrors her internal thaw without overt symbolism. Ledger strip as handled object carries topological memory of fire, charging the final image. Environment does not directly block or enable the final decision, so misses 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn evidence into actionable pursuit—tightens once when frost-etched paths decode the ledger. Protagonist agency drives the escalation: she chooses to read the land and reverse roles. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence, embrace of violence implicit in pursuit) but not yet visceral. Enough for the length, but lack of tangible price on-page holds it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “truth surviving fire” emerges through glass-making metaphors and the singed ledger; no overt thesis stated. Final smile reframes suffering as luminous transformation, offering resonant non-literal answer. Complexity acknowledged: she steps toward violence cloaked in beauty. Avoids moralizing, but frost–ledger linkage feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s artisan perception: light, flow, fracture. Syntax lengthens and contracts with temperature imagery; no head-hop. Diction stays within glass-worker lexicon (“molten glass,” “inner fire”). Minor cadence repetition in “frost patterns told her things” / “patterns in the morning frost” but not enough to dull voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, sensory, high-density; most sentences do two jobs. Occasional modifier stacks (“delicate crystalline veins”) flirt with overwrite but keep within lyric allowance. No loops or scaffold; temporal sequence clean. One mixed image—“light breaking through glass” for a smile—slightly strains physics, nudging down from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of forensic frost-reading with glass-artist gaze feels fresh; turns familiar revenge arc into meteorological detective work. Ledger-as-palimpsest and frost-as-ink are specific, not quirky. Transformation test fails: core plot still works if she were a potter reading mud cracks. Risk is moderate, not bold; earns solid mid-high band.</comment>
