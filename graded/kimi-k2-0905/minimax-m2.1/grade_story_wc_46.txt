<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is concrete—tracing walls by feel, weighing sea glass against lost constellations—but the arc drifts toward summary once the pearl arrives; the pivotal “realization” is told more than dramatized, muting the embodied cost of choosing to stay and shine rather than ascend. The seventeen-year exile is vivid, yet the final stance crystallizes in exposition, not a visible micro-choice that hurts. Still, her flawed, light-hungry voice is particular and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grotto becomes a living constellation, the price being permanent earthbound service. Causality holds—gem-polishing skills earned in exile convert loss into shared luminescence—though the hinge turn (“she understood immediately”) is narrated, not dramatized. Orientation is secure within 120 words; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the final image reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is tactile, damp, mist-alive; stone curvature and salt-star scent constrain movement and frame the pearl’s glow as the only “window.” Selective detail—kelp basket, cold wall ridges—mirrors Elira’s internal narrowing, then expansion. The setting functions as micro-environment that literally channels light; without its serpentine turns the scattering effect would be impossible. It meets the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—how to remain radiant without wings—surfaces early and tightens when the clouded pearl offers a test of skill versus memory. One meaningful deepening occurs: polishing reveals trapped starlight, forcing a trade-off between private nostalgia and communal illumination. Cost is visible—she forfeits return to sky, accepts perpetual cave-bound service—but the escalation is narrated in gentle summary rather than a sharp beat of choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: exile can be repurposed into a different radiance. No moralizing; the final image of “quiet communion” between pearl and distant stars reweights the premise without abstraction. Subtext lingers in the question of whether shared light compensates for lost flight—ambiguity is charged, not tidied. The sea-glass motif subtly shifts from souvenir to lens, reinforcing theme through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elira’s somatic perception—fingers reading stone, salt-air taste—syntax grows longer in calmer beats, shortens when the pearl first gleams. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Diction poetic yet within her plausible lexicon (“earthbound star watcher”). No dialogue to test voice divergence; internal register remains coherent and unmannered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tension; sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts clean. Figurative language is selective—“pearl of stillness”—and does not clog high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold: “the morning everything changed began like any other” is a stock opener; “reflectively vibrant” appears twice without variation. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors; momentum stays fluid to the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Familiar arc—fallen angel finds new purpose—feels fresh via gem-polishing astronomer and light-sharing without fire. Specificity of grotto optics and sea-glass spectrum rescues the story from generic redemption template. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over causal reversals. Synthesis is coherent, not gimmicky; transformation test passes—only this character’s polisher-patience could convert exile into lantern.</comment>
