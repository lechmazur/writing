<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Threnody’s patience-versus-vengeance contradiction is implied but never enacted in-scene; she annotates, smiles, and endures, so the choice is static, not pressured. No micro-choice alters her tactics after the first paragraph—she merely continues writing—so the “endless vigil” feels predetermined rather than earned. Cost is elegiac rather than personal, keeping the arc elegant but bloodless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the constellation pause crystallizes the trap and the promised future reaction, reweighting centuries of quiet labor with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin—no because/therefore beat after the ink setup—but the accumulative pattern (annotations → future blood reaction) holds under Accumulative lens. A single tightening turn is sufficient at this length; the final “graceful collapse” line pays off the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Library is textured through Threnody’s bodily scale: shelves tower, moss traces reader-bones, marble softens—details filter her dwarf-titan POV and justify stealth choreography. Iron-gall ink constrains the only tactical choice on the page (what she writes, where), so tool-as-setting passes the 9+ gate. Spatial track stays clean; no impossible drift between stacks. Atmosphere supports the hush-of-revelation theme without ornamental overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose pretender—declared early and never wavers. Pressure deepens via density: each added annotation thickens the latent accusation, reweighting the stakes under Accumulative lens. No visible price is extracted from Threnody herself, only deferred triumph, so cost is conceptual, not visceral—sufficient for 8.0 band but not higher. One meaningful tightening suffices and occurs when constellation pause signals the trap is now irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-erosion emerges through recurrent water/drift motifs and the ink that cannot be erased; no character spells it out. Final image of “graceful collapse” re-prices the premise: justice is geological, not heroic. Ambiguity is preserved—no sermon on legitimacy—yet the emotional aftereffect lingers. Subtext in marginalia-as-weapon is elegant and memorable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Threnody’s perceptual signature: “diminutive titan,” “regally unpretentious,” “whisper” locomotion. Syntax lengthens into cadenced rolls that mimic temple breathing, then snaps short for the smile—rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hop or register drift; diction stays within her arcane-librarian lexicon. Voice is distinctive enough to carry the lyric accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; metaphors (dust motes like memories, marble softening into curves) align with entropy theme and do not clog causality. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“constellations pause in their eternal dance”—is allowable poetic license. Final line earns its cadence and recharges “graceful collapse” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Freshness lies in weaponizing marginalia via biological ink that only true blood can reveal—an inversion of the chosen-one trope. Library-as-time-capsule is familiar, yet scale mismatch (child-titan in crumbling immensity) gives new visual charge. Concept commits fully to slow-motion justice without flinching. Risk is moderate but coherent; no late gimmicks.</comment>
