<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sera’s vocation and inherited duty give her a coherent through-line, but interiority stays summary-level (“she understood now what she must do”) instead of dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment of borrowing time; the emotional cost is asserted rather than embodied, limiting depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: vanishing cadence → grandmother’s clue → pendant-enabled breach → restored echoes; the stolen moments visibly cost the giant’s dream (time borrowed → cadence freed), landing a clean Earned Stasis with conceptual price. Orientation is swift and the single transition up-canal is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rooftop canals narrowing to the resonance chamber supply tactile geography that guides paddle speed and mirrors mounting hush; the vibrating wall-carvings and glowing pendant act as micro-setting that directly constrain/enable the rescue of sound, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—city’s acoustic heartbeat—escalates as Sera approaches the choke-point chamber; borrowing dream-time tightens options because each stolen fragment risks waking the giant, a visible trade-off that narrows her margin and attaches price to success.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation-through-intervention emerges from concrete beats: cataloguing extinction, reclaiming lost rhythm, accepting temporal theft as stewardship; no moralising, just the charged final sketchbook image that reframes her lifelong documentation as active resistance against silence.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Sera’s perceptual filters—pale moth, water stutter, pendant chill—without POV drift; syntax lengthens during calm reflection, tightens into clipped clauses when cadence falters, creating rhythmic fidelity to the acoustic stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and largely loop-free; occasional adjective stacks (“suspended emptiness that seemed to hold its own weight”) verge on purple but occur outside the peak borrowing beat, so clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Channelled waterways above towers, dream-mined time, and sound-taxidermy feel freshly synthesized; the infinity pendant repurposes a stock symbol into a tuning fork for temporal larceny, making the fantastical premise feel inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
