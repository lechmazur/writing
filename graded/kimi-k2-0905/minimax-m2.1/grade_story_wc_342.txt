<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s face-blindness is more a label than a lived contradiction; it never complicates a single beat or limits her choices under pressure. Interiority is vivid (“the tree’s slow breathing”) yet remains lyrically external; we glimpse no clashing impulse or visible cost when she decides to paint the sky. The final renunciation—leaving without claiming recognition—carries conceptual cost, but because the choice is summary, the emotional price is inferred rather than embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct enough to lift the portrait above stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred: each beat advances because Mira acts on the coin’s cue. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the painted ceiling reweights “limits” into “different scales of perception,” a cost legible in the imminent demolition. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; one soft spot is the guild politics paragraph that tells rather than tests stakes. Escalation is single-curve but sufficient: the approaching wrecking ball tightens time and choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The oak-library is tactile—dry smell, spiral shelves, grain breathing—every detail filtered through Mira’s pattern-seeking gaze. The coin’s indentations function as micro-setting, constraining brushstroke and sky-placement; its worn surface literally guides her hand. Spatial choreography is flawless as she climbs, pries, paints, exits. Final image of overlapping sky-configurations would collapse if any prop were swapped—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve knowledge under erasure”—is signaled early and sharpened by dawn deadline. One meaningful tightening: the distant demolition growl collapses infinite pattern into final painted arc. Agency is present in every beat; the cost is the coming loss of both tree and artwork, felt as “heightened stillness.” No escalation flaw, though coin’s power could have confronted her with a harder tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—“preservation as transformation, not copy”—emerges through coin → ceiling transmutation, never stated. Final image reweights the premise: sky-mirrors inside doomed walls make conceptual cost undeniable. Subtext in silent handling of coin and absent crowd keeps focus on perception vs. recognition. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the phrase “limits did not exist.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush yet disciplined free-indirect style: “fractally precise architecture underlying all apparent chaos” is diction Mira would plausibly internalize. Rhythm swells then compresses to match nightlong craft; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is unmistakable—star-mappings felt as indentations, never as faces. Voice remains stable under pressure; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence does two jobs: “scholars had climbed its internal spiral staircases to reach shelves that spiraled upward like the rings of growth themselves” fuses setting, history, metaphor in one breath. Minor scaffold emerges in “patterns” repetitions, but pattern is diegetic, not artifact. No mixed metaphor; opening and closing images book-end cleanly. A lone paraphrase loop (“she understood this principle instinctively” following similar thought) prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The face-blind portraitist who paints not faces but star-configurations inside a dying tree-library is a fresh synthesis; trope of “last scholar’s mystery” is retooled through pattern-translation rather than treasure. Fractal precision as both character trait and craft method feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risk in lyric stillness pays off: demolition silence becomes audible inside the prose. Specific detail—coin worn smooth by centuries, dawn growl distant—grounds concept in sensory reality.</comment>
