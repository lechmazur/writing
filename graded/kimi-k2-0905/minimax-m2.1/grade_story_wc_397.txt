<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the parasol tip as tactile anchor keeps her present. The “fold in patience” decision arrives off-stage, so the decisive pivot feels reported rather than dramatized. Micro-choices in the wreck-trawling beats show loosening grip, but no contradictory impulse actively fights her exit plan—risk arithmetic is one-way. Enough specificity to reach high band, yet the final stance is already secured before the scene starts, trimming cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: drifting ice, wreck debris, and repeated handling of the parasol tip thicken the stake of “learning endings” until the held-then-released breath closes. Orientation clean by 80 words; single time-step holds. Closure is Charged Poise—options re-weighted, cost felt in the loosened grip. Persistent constraint (appointment in Switzerland) shapes every beat; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is viscerally mapped: bell-like collisions, wind direction, harbor walls. Body-tool (parasol tip) acts as micro-setting, constraining her to stay tethered until she voluntarily lets go. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors narrowed life-scope; no wasteful catalog. Spatial choreography remains coherent in single walk-to-edge scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—acquire the “sound of approaching endings”—is signaled early and deepens through tactile wreck work. One meaningful tightening: handling the parasol tip shifts from tether to farewell token, foreclosing retreat. Pressure stays accumulative; no external antagonist needed. Cost legible in final loosened grip; option space narrows to single forward path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of endings-as-process emerges through ice imagery and trawling labor; no explicit thesis states it. Grandmother’s endurance vs. her release creates nuanced counter-reading. Final breath image reweights earlier “fold in patience” without moralizing. Subtext in volunteer silence and ice groans invites reflection beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through actuarial precision and post-diagnosis looseness. Syntax lengthens then compresses to mimic held breath, supporting final release. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Free-indirect texture stays character-bound, no filter clutter.</comment>

<comment>Prose exhibits rhythmic variation and high density; figurative language is selective, never floods a beat. No loops or scaffold detected; sentences advance image or pressure. Opening and closing lines frame voice and stake cleanly. One near-mixed metaphor (“fold in patience”) is minor; clarity preserved.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Euthanasia tourist” trope is refreshed via disaster-relief apprenticeship and ice-marina acoustics. Actuarial background gives unique perceptual lens without exposition dump. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in breath-close. Sufficient transformation to escape template feel.</comment>
