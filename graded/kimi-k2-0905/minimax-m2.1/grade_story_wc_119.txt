<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s ex-spy turned fortune-writer identity is vivid through tactile micro-habits (folding cookie wrappers like microdots) and interior contradiction, but the arrival of two off-page strangers at the end is accepted without an on-page micro-choice that costs him anything; the renunciation stays abstract, so the final cost is felt only generically, not personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias seals the official letter unread, cementing his refusal to re-enter espionage; the image of cooking the paper into paste literalizes the cost of forever closing that door. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard adds density until the final crystallizing gesture reweights the stakes. The two-strand structure (lighthouse present + mainland reverberations) is legible with a single white-space transition, satisfying Track B rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse, tide, and weather are filtered through Elias’s tradecraft eye (“current pulled toward these shores”), constraining his daily ritual and echoing in the final beam sweep; sensory detail is spare yet charged, never decorative. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5 and hold throughout, so Orientation Test is waived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining exile versus being reactivated—tightens once when the unopened summons arrives; the refusal is solitary, so pressure is conceptual rather than interpersonal, but the paste-making act visibly forecloses the option, satisfying cost under Accumulative lens. No escalation curve beyond that single beat, yet for this length the deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “open secrets” and redirected fate emerges through recurrent images of light, tide, and microdots, culminating in the silent sealing of the letter—an act that reweights espionage as just another form of prophecy. No explicit thesis is stated; meaning accrues via pattern rather than pronouncement, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect voice carries Elias’s cryptic precision: verbs like “orchestrated,” “transposing,” and “channels” echo spy jargon without slipping into pastiche. Rhythm modulates between long accumulative sentences and clipped fragments, mirroring the sweep-and-pause of the lighthouse beam. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to Elias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and information-dense; each image does double duty (“white finger pointing toward nowhere” localizes lighthouse and theme). Occasional poetic compression (“the current pulled”) is taught early and sustained, so it reads as voice rather than artifact. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor dull the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The spy-to-prophet conceit feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesized through tactile specifics (vinegar paste, microdot specs as paperweight) rather than gimmick. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity; the concept commits fully and pays off in the final image.</comment>
