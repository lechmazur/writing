<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied silence and her tactile relationship with the tuning-fork case give her a sharp, consistent interior voice; the moment she lowers the sensor and closes her eyes, her earned renunciation of sound-recovery for “listening by architecture” crystallizes with visible cost. The “capsize survivor” tag never converts into an on-page memory or flaw that complicates present action, so the interior contradiction stays more declared than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: each thermal reading layers emotional residue until the final image reweights silence itself as readable music. Closure is a Charged Poise—she gives up on sound-return and embraces “architecture of feeling,” a conceptual cost the prose makes legible in the last two sentences; causality keeps its shape, no late convenience.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Winterglass conservatory” is never just backdrop; the frost-lattice, frozen ferns, and pulsing thermal strata literally channel her method and supply the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as she crosses wings; cold/warm shifts act as both obstacle and archive, constraining where she can map next.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove silence measurable—tightens through rising thermal anomalies until the performance-hall “breathing” forces her surrender to a different metric; the price is the fork’s eternal muteness and her abandonment of sound-recovery. One meaningful deepening, no abstract escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges without label: art outlives medium; silence is just another frequency once re-imagined. Final image of “listening” through architecture reconfigures prior material without moralizing, achieving CR.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice stays stable, tactile, frost-attuned; syntax lengthens for rhapsodic catalog, then compresses into the final short beats. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature (heat as score, frost as notation) remains character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and information density, but front-loaded metaphor density (“musical notation frost,” “capsize survivor,” etc.) edges toward overwritten catalogue before the midpoint. No loops or mixed metaphors in the closing beats; clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic “Great Quieting” is familiar, yet re-casting thermal residue as musical score feels fresh and specific. The inversion—she abandons recovering sound—avoids expected triumph-of-music arc, giving the premise new weight.</comment>
