<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” trait are embodied through concrete ritual (night climbs, copying symbols). The final creative outburst is prepared by her obsessive pattern-work, so the renunciation of loneliness feels earned. Interiority stays specific: “canvas shoes silent,” fingers “trembling,” etc. Flaw: no contradictory impulse under peak pressure; she slides into epiphany rather than fighting it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: moon-touched brush → nightly copying → sudden fluent inscription. One tightening beat at 2 a.m. when daydream sharpens into legible vision; causality intact. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—paintings left for strangers crystallize her stance with visible cost (“good kind of tired”). Orientation anchors arrive by line 5; no penalty. Minor slip: “roused” declared rather than dramatized in real time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse-as-micro-setting constrains every move: jasmine air, moon through glass, silver brush catalyze the climax. Smog/yellow haze outside vs. clean moon inside mirrors internal shift. Spatial choreography clean: door slide, table placement, brush warmth tracked. Object meets 9+ gate: brush literally charges the final image with moonlit ink. Sensory economy favors scent and light over visual catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prove kindness leaves traceable marks. Pressure accumulates via repetitive failure to decode; waxing moon intensifies pattern until meaning breaks through. One visible cost: she forgoes sleep and abandons the paintings—material/time loss. No external antagonist, but internal loneliness acts as coherent pressure. Escalation is density-driven, not causal-turn driven, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative copying → communal gift: “kindness echoes even when its source is forgotten.” Final image of paintings left by door reweights earlier symbols as social currency, avoiding moral lecture. Subtext in brush’s transition from private talisman to public message. Avoids explicit thesis until final clause, and even that is embedded in action. Slight sentimental edge keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: moonlight “impossibly bright,” greenhouse air “saffron quiet.” Syntax lengthens during daydream influx, compresses at final inscription, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; river-district calligrapher remains external. Diction stays within plausible artist vocabulary; “waxing,” “philodendron,” “calligraphy” feel natural. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” line, but fits climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm: sentence length varies, paragraph breaks mirror heartbeat. High density: single sentence paints city haze, scent, moon, motivation. No synonym loops; “moon-tipped brush” returns with accrued meaning. Metaphors consistent (stars bleeding, saffron quiet) and physically coherent. One scaffold trace: “the kind that comes after…” clause could trim, but doesn’t touch closure. Opening and final lines frame and recharge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—insomniac artist, magical object, rooftop sanctuary—are refreshed via lost language as living social glue rather than esoteric puzzle. Moonlit daydream mechanism feels organic to setting and stake. Specificity of “river-district calligrapher,” “heat-pressed glass” anchors universals. Risk: ending leans communal uplift, safe territory, but execution keeps it from cliché. Fresh inflection: kindness as translingual graffiti.</comment>
