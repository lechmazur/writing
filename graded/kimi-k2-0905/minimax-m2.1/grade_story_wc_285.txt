<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured (“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest promise”) and the needle gives a tactile anchor, but no contradictory impulse is staged in real time; the wait is passive and the final step onto the barge merely restates what reflection already told us. Cost is abstract—no option is foreclosed on the page—so the arc stalls at observation rather than choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the barge acceptance reconfigures the promise from abstract burden to lived continuation, with conceptual cost (he’ll keep carrying, never arrive). Accumulative lens holds—density of fog, needle, ticking gutters layers until the final image reweights meaning—but the middle repeats the same reflection beat three times, slightly blunting the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog, ticking gutters, and the yarn needle function as micro-setting that constrains attention and times his wait; the river’s “ancient passage” is felt in the body. Selective sensory detail (auditory ticks, tactile needle) keeps the camera tight; no exposition dump. Spatial clarity holds as the barge glides in—environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—distill life to essence—signaled early, but pressure is ambient, not causal: no external complication or rising risk narrows his options. Escalation is a slow accretion of memory; the only “turn” is the barge arrival, which merely permits what he already decided. No visible price or option lost on the page keeps this below the 7-line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-carving emerges implicitly via the needle, gutters, and river; no moral is stated. Final image reweights the grandmother’s request as ongoing practice rather than destination. Ambiguity is fruitful—promise as palimpsest—but the repetition of “distill complexity” edges toward echo, not fresh resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, idiom consistent with a weathered coachman; perceptual signature strong (“stones like knuckles”). Free indirect slips once (“he had come to cherish”) but recovers. Rhythm breathes with fog pauses; no head-hopping. Voice stays distinct under low-pressure wait, though syntax flirts with self-parody in “ancient passage” line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary and cut cleanly. Occasional abstract latinate stacks (“conceptual repricing”) feel slightly above coachman lexis, but brief. No loops or scaffold; information dense. Metaphors stay coherent; one mixed ghost (“palimpsest whose original words had been scraped”) is forgivable and taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>River-crossing vigil with inherited needle is fresh enough, but central trope—old man waiting for internal permission—sketches close to standard “threshold guardian” arcs. Palimpsest metaphor gives a sharp inflection, yet plot never subverts expectation. Risk is muted; piece leans on lyric texture over surprise.</comment>
