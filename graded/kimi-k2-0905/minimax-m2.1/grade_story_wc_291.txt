<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s synesthetic “face-blind” gift is vividly anchored in sensory process and memory of her mother’s vanishing; interiority stays specific. Motive—awaken empathy, not solve crime—is coherent and stakes escalate internally. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; she never really risks anything tactile, so cost is conceptual, not embodied. Meets 9- boundary but lacks micro-choice that could fail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon → quarry → pigment → portrait accretes emotional density until final “exhale” reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: canvas rolled, fog lifts, cost is the quarry’s unchanging silence and Elena’s perpetuation of bearing witness; legible before/after for reader. Orientation clean; causality is associative, not beat-by-beat, yet pattern is taught early. One hairline slip: “lance” used as transitive verb without prior warrant, momentarily jars linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Quarry fog, ribbon silk, pigment order—each micro-setting item is filtered through Elena’s tactile bias and returns in the closure image of rolled canvas. Spatial choreography consistent; weather actively thins to echo release. Body-as-setting (palpating ribbon) constrains her perception and thereby the portrait’s geometry. No environment violation; detail refrains from tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is reviving family empathy, signaled early; pressure intensifies as ribbon residue must be “felt” into visibility. One deepening: shift from seeking bones to painting emotion narrows options and crystallizes her stance. Cost is legible—she assumes perpetual custodianship of others’ grief. Lacks external resistance or possible failure, keeping it from top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as vicarious mourning—emerges through accreted images of erosion, fog, and negative-space portraiture without explicit thesis. Ribbon reprise and quarry silence create conceptual repricing: absence becomes portrait. Final line “paint the truth that remained” resonates without moralizing. Minor abstraction in “architecture of emotion” phrase scarcely dims impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elena’s synesthetic lexicon—“stiffened silk like preserved skin,” “furrows of light”—maintaining perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: long breathing sentences for quarry expanse, clipped “She rolled the canvas” for cadence release. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within her plausible register. Clean, purposeful free indirect control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; metaphor density peaks only in meditative beats and pays off in final portrait image. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. One mixed metaphor cluster “furrows of light and shadow” borders overwrite but ties to quarry geology, forgiven. Grammar and sequence immaculate; pronoun tracking flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Synthesizing face-blindness with cold-case portraiture offers a fresh emotional angle on the missing-person trope. Concept executed without gimmick: methodical paint ritual grows organically from character wound. Quarry-as-blank-canvas metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyrical accumulative structure heightens resonance and lands safely.</comment>
