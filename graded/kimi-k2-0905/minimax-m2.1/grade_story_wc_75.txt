<comment>Maren’s curator-eye and bread-initial ritual give her a sharp, idiosyncratic interior engine; the final march toward the thaw-entrance is a credible, cost-laden crystallization of that identity. The beekeeper’s absence is felt more than he is dramatized, so relationship pressure is off-page, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The lens-to-bread-to-waterfall chain supplies a clean Accumulative/Textural arc: each motif re-weights survival into transmission. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maren carrying the B-loaf toward the roar—so the cost (exposure of the hidden city) is palpable even though the physical act is only one step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Waterfall-as-wall, emerald refraction, and mossy stone are knotted to action (lens-held-to-water, bread passed hand-to-hand), so environment constrains secrecy and later enables emergence. The grotto’s acoustic roar and thaw-runoff timing are used, not scenery, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—keep the arts alive vs. keep them hidden—tightens once: thaw melts the camouflaging ice, forcing the外露 decision. The price (possible discovery) is legible, but only a single deepening occurs; additional tactical complications would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively from initials-in-dough and prism-in-water: culture survives by being broken, shared, and refracted, never by being sealed. No character sermonizes; the final image of the single initial-loaf riding toward the unknown carries the re-priced concept with oblique cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Maren’s curator perception: colors fracture, artifacts “speak,” sentences lengthen when she catalogues, tighten when footsteps echo. No head-hop; lens-and-bread idiom is consistent and propulsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense but breathe: “rosewater dread” and “alphabet of sustenance” compress scent + fear + concept without flab. Only minor template cadence in the tripled “that” clauses when listing crafts; otherwise rhythm tracks the waterfall’s crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Initializing bread as clandestine archive feels fresh; emerald opera-glass as portable museum vitrine is an efficient synecdoche. The thaw-as-publication twist inverts standard “ice = safety” trope, earning its inevitability through prism-and-dough setup.</comment>
