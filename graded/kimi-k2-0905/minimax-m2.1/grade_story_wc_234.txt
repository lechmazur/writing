<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren’s shift from distillation to “letting presence remain alive” is legible and tied to the shell’s tactile reprise, but the interior contradiction is stated more than dramatized; micro-choices under pressure are limited to pressing the shell to her cheek—earned, but thinly embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: “the shell doesn’t hold the secret. We do.” The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—density of returns tightens the stake; the only drag is a 135-word delay before spatial anchor is fully nailed, but twilight/ember nexus cue arrives early enough to waive Orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the columella’s curve and cooling pocket-sun serve as the entire stage; their changing thermal states constrain when Maren can press or share the shell, directly charging the final image. Ember breathing and star-rise provide selective sensory economy—no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing “density of presence”—is signaled early; pressure mounts through accumulative returns rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: the shift from extraction to acknowledgment forecloses prior methodology with visible conceptual cost; price is legible but not yet viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges via shell spiral as iterative return; final reweighting (“we hold the secret”) avoids moralizing, inviting reader re-pricing. Subtext in Sera’s whisper and shared silence layers intimacy without overt statement—resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric compressions (“pocket-sun,” “mathematics of intimacy”) are taught early and repay in closure; perceptual signature filters every detail through Maren’s tactile epistemology. No head-hopping; distance clean. Rhythm modulates from expansive dusk cadence to hush of whisper—voice stays unitary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density—figurative language carries double duty (science + emotion). One paraphrase loop (“return to this nexus again and again”) and occasional elevated register (“logarithmic curves guided her research”) nudge beneath flawless, but clarity never breaks and no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Alchemical nexus + nautilus as palimpsest of presence offers fresh synthesis; risk resides in compressed lyric science, but particulars stay anchored to Maren’s skin and shell. Not radically novel, yet the integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
