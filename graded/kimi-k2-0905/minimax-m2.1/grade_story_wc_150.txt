<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is grounded in concrete sensations and micro-choices (clearing debris, clicking the gnomon home); her returnee identity and apple-linked grief are dramatized, not declared. The “warmly curious” stance is shown once, then abandoned for elegiac interiority—no contradiction, but the trait never complicates action. Cost is felt: she forfeits academic distance and accepts stewardship of the orchard, but the decision is quiet; the emotional price registers yet lacks a sharp external consequence on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dig reveals artifacts that thicken ancestral texture; the sundial’s birthmark match supplies a charged pattern-break. Closure is a Charged Poise—sundial re-set under the apple tree—re-weighting her exile/home axis with undeniable conceptual cost: she becomes the orchard’s next keeper. Orientation anchors within 60 words; the lens is taught early and held. One soft spot: the pandemic delay is told in summary, not activated as present obstacle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is tactile, odor-rich, and spatially coherent; the apple root cracking the ceiling becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Details are filtered through Mira’s bodily labor, never catalogued. Bone-and-root imagery mirrors her grafted identity; environment constrains her choice to carry the sundial upward, fusing stewardship to topography. No slips; specificity never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover erased lineage; pressure mounts as each artifact tightens the link between Mira and the gardeners. One meaningful deepening—birthmark on gnomon—forces her stance crystallization; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual: she accepts perpetual custodianship, trading scholarly detachment for ancestral service. Escalation is textural, not causal, but remains coherent under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical return emerges through apple/tree/root imagery; no declarative thesis. The sundial’s re-installation offers a non-literal answer: time resumes on ancestral terms, not modern metrics. Moral complexity is honored—she neither forgives exile nor denounces refuge. Final moonlit image reweights prior motifs without sermon; ambiguity lingers about whether enchantment is comfort or burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptions; diction is lyrical but remains within her plausible lexicon. Syntax lengthens during reflection, contracts during physical digs, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Only one instance of slightly elevated register (“conceptual repricing”-level abstraction) but it lands in a contemplative beat where it feels earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temps: long cadences for catacomb hush, clipped clauses when bricks tumble. Metaphors are organic (roots like veins) and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“interrupted journeys…interrupted once”) but it occurs early and is soon buried by fresh detail. Closing sentence cadence rises into liturgical resonance without purple drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Diaspora returnee + subterranean apple orchard is a fresh synthesis; the sundial birthmark twist feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than spectacle—but coherence is high. Tropes of ancestral burial and exile are re-rooted in living orchard metabolism, avoiding nostalgia. Could edge higher with a sharper external consequence; still, the concept lingers.</comment>
