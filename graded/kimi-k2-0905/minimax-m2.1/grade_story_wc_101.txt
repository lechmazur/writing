<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s gently-persistent trait is embodied in every beat—midnight runs, basket notes, bell-ringing—so motive never abstracts into label. The moment she watches Farouk kneel without prompting crystallizes her legacy stake and shows contradiction resolved in action. Interiority stays concrete: “particular grief of proximity” felt through lit valley, not declared. One decimal off 8.7 only because the grandmother hand-off, though evocative, is recalled summary, not dramatized choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: bell-ringing reweights exile from loss to continuation, cost legible in Mira’s tacit acceptance that sanctions may outlive her. Causal chain holds—anonymous runs → trust surplus → arbor gathering → mentorship pledge—each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation locked within first 70 words. One micro-transition (shift from past reflection to present arbor) is legible via bell cue. No teleport, no amnesia; persistent constraint of water-scarce ridge shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains: highest point limits visibility to guards, dictates midnight timing, supplies clay-ridge flowers for baskets. Sensory triage mirrors scarcity—cold metal bell, “stubborn earth” color, breathing settlement—never catalog. Spatial choreography clean: lights below vs ridge above track consistently; bodies ascend single path. Could reach 9.0 if one environmental feature (drought soil, patrol lights) had physically blocked an option during climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep memory alive during slow strangulation—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens through each beat: rations shrink, gardens test, anonymity risks exposure. Midnight runs create one visible price: Mira forfeits rest and safety, shown not told. Bell summons crystallizes stance; no coincidence, no fake reversal. Lacks a second irreversible forfeiture to push into 8.8 band, but single meaningful tightening satisfies short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-versus-erasure emerges wordlessly: silver bell evolves from heirloom to communal heartbeat, re-weighted at closure when ringing voices exile as forward-motion. No overt thesis statements; even “some things must ring” is grandmother voice, not authorial sermon. Final image of Farouk kneeling reframes mentor chain as living archive. Ambiguity preserved—sanctions end-date unknown—so resonance lingers without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perceptual filter: “lights of distant towns where abundance was merely rationed” carries her exact resentment. Rhythm swells with longer cadence at bell ring, then contracts to quiet shuffle, mirroring breath of crowd. Free-indirect slips cleanly into elder Mariem’s recognition without head-hop. No dialogue on page, so exemption applies; narrative voice alone carries subtext. Slight 0.1 deduction for one generic phrase—“impossible to ignore”—that momentarily flattens idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line density high: “metal so cold it burned” does image + backstory + sensory in five words. No synonym loops; each return of “gently persistent” accrues new contextual weight. Metaphor vehicles stay local—bell as whisper, ridge as altar—without mixed logic. One buried lead: “she understood finally” could be cut since next sentence already shows realization. Otherwise momentum breathes with paragraph lengthening at climax then quiet snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar sanctions/exile premise refreshed by focus on slow erosion rather than overt violence, and by using anonymous food-runs as insurgent archive. Silver bell repurposed from nostalgia token to resistance beacon; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail—terra-cotta color matching “stubborn earth”—roots allegory in geology, not placeholder. Risk taken in quiet climax with no confrontation, yet payoff lands via collective stance; earns +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
