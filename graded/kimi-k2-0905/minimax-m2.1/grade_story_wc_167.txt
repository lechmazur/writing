<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glazier’s interiority is textured—her “patience for the slow mathematics of water” feels particular—but she never makes a choice that costs her anything. The stone-throw is ritual, not decision; the day ahead is “small problems,” never sharpened into a stakes-bearing test. Without a micro-choice that forecloses a path, motivation stays observational, not dramatic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last ripple reaches the bank and disappears, reweighting the premise that “one becomes the other.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and cadence, not causal chain—and the final image carries conceptual cost: the ordinary world “reasserts itself” while she carries the pond’s lesson. The piece meets the 9+ quick test for closure with cost under its chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Harbor fog, warped window-glass, and the pond’s returning rings are sensuously etched and filter through the glazier’s glass-trained eye. The “prism atrium” is micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—“to illuminate value in the mundane”—stays abstract; no concrete test appears. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: the boat engine starts, day begins, but neither threatens nor sharpens her goal. Without a narrowing option or visible price, escalation remains flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through refraction imagery: clarity discovered inside imperfection. The pond rings reprise at closure, non-literally answering the thematic question. No moralizing—wisdom stays implicit, carried by the final ripple.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“water holds its breath”) and held consistently. Perceptual signature is sharp: glass seen as “cathedral colors,” fog as “accident of geometry.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for stillness, clipped fragments for engine intrusion. Figurative language is selective, never piled in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“each one distinct, each one connected”) but it serves pattern, not clutter; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: artisan who reads portents in pond ripples rather than horoscopes. Glass-as-prism trope is familiar, but anchoring it in pre-dawn harbor fog and glazier’s craft gives local specificity. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but payoff lands, so within-band bonus withheld.</comment>
