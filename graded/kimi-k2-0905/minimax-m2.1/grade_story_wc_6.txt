<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is sensuous and specific—black sand against her palm, the copper coin warming like an ember—contradictory impulses (restless vs. healer) stay active in scene. The final stance-crystallization (“chose every single day to be light”) is earned by the chain of micro-choices: kneeling, pressing sand, pocketing the coin, turning back toward the village. Cost is visible: she will keep walking into smoke that smells of her father’s arson. Voice never slides into diagnostic self-talk; grief is shown via bodily ritual, not labels.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: black sand → obsidian mirror → molten gold is the taught pattern that reweights the stake at the end. One continuous lagoon scene, 740 words; orientation anchored by line 4. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lagoon’s surface flips darkness into fire-light, crystallizing her grafted vocation with the felt cost of perpetual exposure to flame-smell. Persistent constraint—sand grains clinging to boots—will keep marking her return, a physical price that shapes future tactics.</comment>

<comment>Obsidian lagoon and volcanic sand are not backdrop but instrument: the sand’s heat-retention mirrors her own delayed grief, and the water’s light-absorbing surface supplies the final reversal image. Micro-setting (coin, turnout coat) constrains the beat where she presses warm sand to cheek. Spatial choreography is immaculately tracked: kneel-scoop-sift-pocket-rise. No encyclopedic dumps; every sensory pick is filtered through firefighter priorities (heat, weight, reflectivity).</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: prove scars can sing—i.e., that her father’s arson legacy can be transmuted into protective graft rather than inherited destruction. Pressure tightens once: the lagoon’s surface shift from black mirror to molten gold forces the final re-cognition that fire and water are the same dance. No external antagonist needed; the stakes are internal and vocational. Cost is the perpetual scent of smoke she will carry back to the village—felt, visible, irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via the metamorphic image sequence: volcanic destruction → black sand → mirror → molten gold = destruction transmuted into renewable vigilance. No moralizing; the final line offers a non-literal answer (“tracks of someone…emerged not unscathed but unbowed”) that reweights the entire obsidian/fire motif. Subtext lives in gesture: pressing sand to cheek replaces filial accusation with tactile elegy. Complexity acknowledged—she is still “healing,” not healed—resisting tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays rooted in Mira’s firefighter sensorium: sweat in canvas, smell of turnout coat, thermal memory of grains. Diction—“curdled into obsession,” “salt wind like a song”—is character-specific, not decorative. Rhythm swells and contracts with tidal sentences that mimic cloud migration. No head-hopping; grandmother and father appear only as memory objects filtered through Mira’s perception. Compression in final paragraph accelerates without voice slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; no synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent: sand “like powdered obsidian,” coin “glowed like an ember” both obey thermal logic. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Final clause triad (“not unscathed but unbowed, not healed but healing”) earns its parallelism as culminating cadence, not filler. Clean grammar; tactile verbs (“sift,” “press,” “clung”) keep momentum alive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist-daughter turned fire-warden, using volcanic sand as both inheritance and antidote. The graft metaphor is literalized through the coin’s hole—a drilled wound now strung for carrying. Cloud migration as external clock avoids weather cliché and becomes temporal canvas. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than plot twist pays off in final image flip. Could edge higher if midpoint tension had one external complicating beat.</comment>
