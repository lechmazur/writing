<comment>The quiet, ritualized competence of the watcher is embodied in the parachute-buckle tic and the finger-tracing of wind vectors; we feel the cost in white knuckles rather than labels. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where trust in his own numbers wars with the desire to break silence—so the arc is steady rather than sharpened. Still, the final release of the buckle shows a micro-choice that seals the night’s earned stasis and keeps the characterization above cliché.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: radio silence → recalculation → revised heading → safe emergence, each beat tightening options. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never drift. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the buckle loosened, storm behind, next watch already begun—cost felt in the ache of knuckles and the quiet hum of open channels. One hairline slip: the storm’s “shift” is announced rather than shown, a micro-tell that keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The arbor’s rail and roofless night constrain every action—charts blow, fingers numb, eyes narrow to star-burn—and the parachute buckle serves as micro-setting that alters stance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: temperature drop before color, static before shape. One minor over-indulgence in “anvil lit by moonlight on one side and dark as coal on the other” slows the ascent to climax by a half-breath.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s survival via silent guidance—tightens once when the front shifts and the watcher must risk a new vector. The revision of heading 270 is the single decisive turn that forecloses earlier plan; cost is the unspoken possibility of having been wrong. Pressure is coherent but only one deep tightening; a second micro-escalation (icing, fuel, altitude loss) could have pushed it to 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the moral geometry of distal responsibility: to bear knowledge you cannot act upon is still a form of love. Subtext lives in the radio’s quiet hum and the uncelebrated release of the buckle—no speech, no cheer, only the enduring stance. The final “soundless echo” reweights the opening trust without moralizing, achieving resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>First-person voice sustains a cool, stellar diction—“stars burn cold and close,” “weather patterns that moved like living things”—that feels particular to a professional sky-watcher. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence in reflective beats, clipped fragments during vector correction. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the only near-slip is the faintly literary “anvil lit by moonlight,” a phrase the narrator would probably not think, but it is isolated and does not contaminate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is tight: no paraphrase loops, no scaffold, high density—“static had swallowed every frequency” does double duty for sound and stakes. Metaphors are few, precise, and physics-loyal. One tiny simultaneity hiccup: “I pulled my charts closer, the paper yellowed with years of use, and traced…” implies three concurrent acts; a sequential reorder would sharpen. Well below the artifact threshold that would cap 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The premise refreshes the rescue trope by making the rescuer impotent to act except through mathematics and silence; the inversion feels specific and inevitable. Occupational detail (noctilucent observatory, wind-vector tracing) is lived-in rather than googled. Risk is modest—no structural experimentation—but the synthesis of meteorology and emotional stewardship is non-obvious enough to stand out in a competitive slate.</comment>
