<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—her memory of every letter, the tactile spiral of the nest—but the final pivot to “weaver of connection” is declared rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is staged on the page; the epiphany feels foregone. Still, her vocation and the embodied handling of the nest keep her above the 8-line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decision to build the public nest reweights her lifetime of anonymous labor into shared art, cost paid in the exposure of private words. Accumulative lens holds: storm → found nest → spiral pattern → installation idea, each beat adding density. The 120-word anchor is met; spatial logic clean. One tightening beat suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lotus temple, dripping rocks, lily-pad cups, and the nest itself are filtered through Mira’s alert attention; the “white prayer” image refracts back into her own vocation of word-prayers. Weather-wet stone and bruised-gold petals evolve with her mood without overt symbolism. The nest’s spiral geometry constrains her installation concept, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Mira convert her hidden archive into public meaning? Pressure tightens once: the storm-displaced nest gives her the form that will expose the letters. No reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; the pattern break (private → public) is sufficient. Cost is conceptual—her secrecy surrendered—and is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of anonymous connection emerges from the nest’s architecture and her letter-spiral without explicit statement. The thrush’s unknowing craftsmanship mirrors her own, reweighting anonymity as communal gift. Final image reframes prior secrecy as shared cradle. No moralizing; resonance stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical close-up maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“mathematical secret,” “prismatic quiet”) stays within Mira’s poetic cognition. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments for the nest discovery. No dialogue to test, so voice purity holds. Patterned elision (eleven years compressed) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Metaphors are coherent—“white prayer,” “vault of her memory”—and never stacked in crisis. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Information density high: each sentence advances image, memory, or decision. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the anonymous letter-writer trope into public art via avian architecture—fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specificity of the spiral nest and temple pond keeps it from feeling generic. Risk: lyric compression of eleven years into one beat, but pattern is taught and closure coherent. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
