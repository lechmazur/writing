<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s patience and quiet determination are shown through tactile ritual (hand on shell, whistle), but the interior contradiction between “knew better” and continued mapping is asserted, not dramatized in-scene; the final blow-and-glow is motivated but the missing mentor’s single ink dot feels thin as causality for her risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the whistle-act re-animates the shell, tightening stakes under Accumulative lens; cost is felt—the city may wake or collapse. Orientation is clear by word 80; one causal tightening is sufficient. The dot-pattern link is the only hinge that could be stronger, but it does not break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shell-road intersection, amber light, and motionless watchers are filtered through Mira’s cartographer gaze; the turtle-shell surface warms under her palm, guiding the culminating act. Micro-setting (her tools, whistle) constrains the final choice. Proper-noun economy is flawless; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find what the watchers overlook—signaled early; escalation is the rising thermal glow of the shell after the whistle, foreclosing passive observation. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false reversals. Cost is implicit in potential awakening, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of seeing versus being seen emerges through pattern-language versus watcher silence; the whistle’s reprise reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—wake or ruin—rooted in specific shell lore. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter; syntax is calm, patient, mirroring cartographer tempo. No head-hopping; diction remains within her lexicon. Reed whistle sentence is the only micro-stumble: “the sound emerged thin and reedy” states the obvious.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; opening anchors voice and stakes. Sparse figurative language serves atmosphere—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “patterns... pattern language... pattern-between” could compress, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Turtle-shell metropolis and cartographers who read bioluminescent spirals feel fresh; watchers as mute horizon silhouettes invert colonial-gaze trope. Specificity of reed-whistle three-tone code grounds the concept. Risk is present but not maximal—veers toward familiar eco-collapse mood.</comment>
