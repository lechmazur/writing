<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Iris’s solitary obsession is vivid—her seventeen-year lighthouse exile, backward clocks, and death-vision flight all ground her motive. Yet the yoyo’s hold on her is asserted more than dramatized; we see no micro-choice that shows the toy altering her hierarchy of values, only summary of weeks “careful analysis.” Interiority is poetic but loops: “unbearable to witness,” “precise and patient,” “bleak exhilaration” repeat instead of revealing new contradiction. The final renunciation lands (she pays with existential erasure), so motivation coheres enough for 7+ but lacks the lived beat-to-beat friction that would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse dissolves, hunger stone submerges, Iris exits past-tense reality—cost is the world itself. Causal chain holds: death-vision → exile → yoyo study → counter-spin → unmaking. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3), no teleporting props. The only drag is a single causality shorthand: “she had determined” compresses the pivotal insight that could have tightened escalation on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse, tide, hunger stone, and salt-sawdust workroom are textured and POV-filtered. The yoyo’s cold, gravity-defying string and backward-casting shadows function as micro-setting that directly enables the final unmaking, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One missed opportunity: the clocks themselves never constrain a mid-scene action—they decorate rather than complicate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evade carved fate—is signaled early and re-visited by the hunger stone. Pressure tightens once: the yoyo’s successful counter-spin dissolves reality, foreclosing retreat. Cost is total (self-erasure), visible in the dissolving walls. Escalation is singular but decisive; no reversal or complication beyond the final threshold, keeping it just under the 8.5 mark.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-habit and fate-as-manacle emerges through backward machines, carved dates, and the yoyo’s reversal. Final image—“a language that had no past tense”—reweights all prior particulars without moralizing. Subtext is carried in objects (hunger stone as collective warning, yoyo as coiled undoing). No thematic echo or abstract sermon; ambiguity lingers about whether liberation or annihilation was achieved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Iris’s perceptual filter: clocks “turned backward,” string “felt wrong,” light “cast shadows backward.” Rhythm swells from patient expository cadence to compressed final paragraph, mirroring the unwind. Diction is precise, slightly archaic (“weathered,” “scarred,” “latent radiance”) yet consistent. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; voice is singular and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful sentence variety. Information density high: one line often fuses image, emotion, and world rule (“salt and sawdust, cluttered with her neatly inventive constructions”). One paraphrase loop—“time’s natural progression… unwinded hours and inverted minutes”—dulls momentum slightly. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding; clarity survives the lyric compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing a yoyo with destiny-undoing is fresh; the toy’s historical innocence twisted into temporal weaponry feels inevitable once revealed. Backward-clockmaker in hunger-stone lighthouse is a specific, never-generic triangulation. Risky dissolution ending commits fully; no retreat to safe ambiguity. Conceptual integrity holds—every oddity (gravity-flip, reverse shadows) grows from the yoyo’s rule-set.</comment>
