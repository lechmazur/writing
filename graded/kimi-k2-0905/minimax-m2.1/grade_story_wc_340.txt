<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity is anchored early and drives the beat that opens the diary; her micro-choice to read instantly sharpens internal conflict. The renunciation at the end—silently returning the goggles—carries a quiet cost (betrayal of trust vs. compassion) that feels earned. Interiority is concrete when the symbols “rearrange themselves,” but once the text turns to summary of Jansen’s grief the embodiment thins. Still, the hierarchy of values is clear: compassion over curiosity, sealed with a visible gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira steps onto the deck cradling the goggles, knowledge reweighting her view of Jansen and herself; the cost is the secret she must now carry. Causal chain is tight—uneven ridge → pries → reads → re-hides—each beat tightening her options. Orientation is clean inside the elevator by line 4; the flash back/forward inside the diary is handled in-scene without breaking continuity. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the climbing car and refracted light density-build toward the crystallized final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The brass elevator, frost-latticed glass, and shifting ribbons of light are filtered through Mira’s inquisitive eye and constrain her moment of discovery (“sunlight fractured…” cues the cipher). The goggles act as micro-setting, handled twice and returned charged. Spatial choreography inside the lift is exact. While we get no wider ship detail, the selective focus serves the central beat; environment, body, and tool all participate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—whether to violate or respect privacy—surfaces the moment the compartment clicks open; pressure escalates as each decoded line raises emotional stakes. The mid-story tightening is the daughter entry, which makes the secret too alive to ignore and forecloses moral simplicity. Cost is felt: Mira gains empathy but loses the innocence of not-knowing. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—“finding the humanity concealed beneath duty and grief”—emerges through action and withheld speech, never named. The diary’s shift from loss to hidden joy reconfigures Mira’s perception of authority and service. Final image reweights the goggles from careless prop to vessel of tenderness without authorial comment. The story trusts the reader to feel the cost of silent mercy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction (“groans of the old airship,” “pale ribbons”) carries her warmth and precision. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during the pry/read beat, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, hence no voice drift. Free-indirect “wondering if she should…” is clean and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured but disciplined: strong verbs (“fractured,” “nestled”), selective metaphors, only one near-filter (“seemed almost to glow”) forgiven by POV uncertainty. Rhythm modulates; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. One mixed image (“sunlight… ribbons… glow”) in an otherwise high-pressure paragraph keeps it from the 8+ band. Closure line is crisp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The encrypted-diary-inside-goggles is a fresh hinge, and linking it to obsolete airline insignia grounds the world. Meridian Spire and Skyward Line feel specific rather than generic steampunk furniture. Emotional reversal—stern captain revealed as tender father—avoids melodrama via the servant’s limited intrusion. Concept doesn’t revolutionize genre but delivers an intimate angle that lingers.</comment>
