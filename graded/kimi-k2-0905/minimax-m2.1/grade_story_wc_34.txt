<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning to be heard yet performing to emptiness—drives every micro-choice; the final duet with the ghost costs her the last pretense of solitude, a renunciation earned by the bolt-plate cue and the seventeen-year solitude established early. The only bar to 9+ is that her physical risk remains abstract—no felt bodily cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each-song-layer thickens until the closing harmony reweights the premise—two balladeers fuse into one transmission, the cost is the irrevocable sharing of her private frequency. Pattern taught by word 150, closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: her voice is no longer hers alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flower-press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: its cold embossments steer her posture, its metallic resonance tunes the duet, and its reappearance in the final harmonic image crystallizes the merger of organic and mechanical memory. Mist-courtyard supplies liminal altitude but the plate is the tactile anchor that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single stake—make the ghost’s song audible—tightens when Mira’s own voice becomes the required medium; the lightning-thunder gap acts as an on-page clock that forces the final encoding beat. Cost is legible: surrender of her solitary aesthetic; minor knock for abstraction of physical stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmissible loneliness emerges through iterated signal metaphors—server farms, phosphor graffiti, harmonic overtones—never named, only modulated. Final reharmonization reweights solitude from refuge to shared circuitry without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person clings to Mira’s perceptual filter—"driftingly alert," "loose threads catching vibration"—syntax stretches in parallel with ascending melody, contracts between lightning and thunder. No head-hop; diction stays within balladeer’s lexicon, culminating in the fused "tinkersong wonder" coinage that pays off the taught pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with atmospheric pressure; sentences breathe longer during mist drift, fracture at electrical discharge. Two adjacent near-repeats ("sequences...sequences") and one mixed metaphor (" swallowed by the wind") keep it from 9+, but none occur in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consciousness-as-signal trapped in infrastructure feels fresh; grafting Victorian music-box relic onto server-farm haunt resists trope defaults. Risky lyric accumulative structure taught early and paid off in final harmonic image, transforming solitude into shared bandwidth with conceptual cost.</comment>
