<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—preserve vs. decide—grounds every beat; the button discovery crystallizes her renunciation of judgment in favor of witness. Emotion is embodied in tactile handling of archives, not labels. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Micro-choice to document the button with “reverence that bordered on prayer” earns stasis at visible cost: she accepts lifelong secondary agency. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the act of writing reweights her role and the button’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality intact—button triggers reflection which triggers documentation; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by word 60. Persistent constraint (cannot decide fate) shapes final action. Cost legible in final sentence; lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>File room as plantation house constrains Mara’s moral imagination—walls “remember” sounds—charging the closure. Brass button functions as micro-setting that narrows her stance. Selective sensory detail (dust patterns, softened edges) filters through archivist habit. Environment and object together charge the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to intervene in histories or merely preserve them. Button discovery supplies single deepening that reweights stakes—documentation becomes moral act. No antagonist; pressure is internal and systemic. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; cost legible in her acceptance of perpetual secondary role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through juxtaposition of bureaucratic erasure vs. artifactual mercy; no explicit thesis stated. Button’s journey from soldier to orphan reconfigures meaning of survival and continuity. Final documentation image invites reflection on who gets archived. Resonant without moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—cataloguing dust, reading metal like photograph. Syntax lengthens with cadence of reverence; no head-hopping. Diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon. Rhythm modulates under pressure of discovery; patterned elision absent, so no experimental penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“compass needle pointing toward a story”—no mixed metaphors. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts clean. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Foster-care archive post-emancipation offers fresh angle on Reconstruction’s orphaned children. Button as linchpin synthesizes military loss and civilian displacement into single artifact. No derivative premise drag; transformation test passes—story collapses without specific button transfer. Risk in lyric stillness heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
