<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s motive to unearth suppressed truth is vivid and embodied; his obsessive cataloguing of silt layers and refusal of “simple history” show a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—“I agonize over this evidence because it demands a price” carries both cost and contradiction without label-speak. The choice to keep working alone in the ruins crystallizes an earned stasis that forecloses an easier life on the surface; the price is felt. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the page, so the score stops short of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final paragraph reweights the meaning of the cog and sediment work—future readers will know someone resisted the lie; the cost is the narrator’s lifetime and solitude. Causal chain holds: each artifact recovered tightens his conviction that official history is false, therefore he must keep working even if he dies unknown. Orientation is anchored by line 3 with place, time (post-plague), and POV. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of silt and artifacts builds until the final reconfiguration. No slips touch closure; minor tightening could compress one reflective repetition to reach 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The brass chronometer cog functions as micro-setting; handled twice and charged in the final image, its “sharp teeth” become the emblem of precision that outlives both sea and state. Coral-encrusted streets and silt-filled plazas are filtered through the narrator’s archaeological eye, guiding choice—every layer he decodes commits him deeper to isolation. Sensory economy is excellent: “water-stained walls still bearing charcoal marks” collapses sight, history, and tool in one stroke. Environment constrains action—he works underwater, in ruined office, with limited air and light—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is epistemic—preserve truthful history against official erasure—signaled early. Escalation occurs through accumulative density: each recovered document narrows his future to solitary scholarship, raising the cost of abandonment. The tightening is textural rather than causal-turn, fitting the Accumulative lens; final “traces behind” crystallizes the irreversible stance. No visible resource loss beyond time/social ties, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it just below 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through sediment metaphor: history is not singular but layered, compressible by power; the cog re-weights this idea at the end, offering a non-literal answer—truth survives as metallic residue, not narrative. Subtext operates in silence of missing townspeople and the narrator’s refusal to speak to them; abrasive calm tone underscores that refusal is the only moral act left. No final moralizing; theme stays implicit in the image of future hands holding the cog. Ambiguity lingers about whether truth changes anything, meeting complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively erudite-skeptical, syntax long and clauses layered like silt, mirroring narrator’s stratigraphic mind. Lexicon—“chronometer,” “sedimentary layers,” “Conceptual Repricing” of history—never drifts above his scholarly station. Rhythm builds cumulative weight; final shorter paragraph snaps into quiet defiance, demonstrating modulation. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature is consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density without scaffold: single sentences deliver setting, backstory, and metaphor concurrently—“merchant guilds to evacuate their most valuable holdings” embeds causality inside texture. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and paid off (“sedimentary layers of story that accumulate like geological strata”). No loops or synonym churn; one near-repeat of “sedimentary layers” is thematically motivated. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, paragraph lengths varied. Closure line is sharp and cadence cleaned, satisfying ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: post-catastrophe story that rejects rebuilding narrative in favor of epistemic archeology—truth as sediment, not salvation. Chronometer cog repurposed from maritime tool to mnemonic resistance device feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk of static reflection is high, but accumulative structure justifies lyric mode. Could edge 8.0+ with slightly more specific artifactual detail that charges final image beyond the cog alone.</comment>
