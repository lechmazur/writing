<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority stays scholarly and calm, matching a lifelong lore-keeper, but the text never lets us feel a contradictory impulse—only serene certainty—so the final “I am a candidate” lands pre-decided rather than wrestled. Ruby warmth and mural recognition stand in for embodied crisis; no bodily fear or hesitation disturbs her pulse. Still, the lifelong study motive is steady and the renunciation of ordinary scholarship for guardianship is legible at cost of leaving the orchard behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: star-window → orchard → peel murals → throne/stair reveal → ascent, each because/therefore hinge tightening her future. Closure gives Decisive Change with cost: she forfeits mortal scholar life to become trans-dimensional custodian—“the bridge” duty materialises in crystalline spirals. One soft spot: the pavilion peel is the sole trial; no prior obstacle tests her, so escalation is thin until that beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard, waterfall, silver-bark trees, fossilised paint, and dawn-drain are vivid, selective, and filter through Elara’s archaeological gaze. Kaleidoscopic waterfall colour-shift directly mirrors the world-shift she must undergo, charging the final ascension image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across one continuous scene; no geography drifts. Meets 9+ gate: the fossilised mural colours constrain her method and charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“earn custodianship or lose the window”—is signalled early and tightens once: murals reveal she must surrender certainties step by step. Sunrise clock supplies visible price; failure equals entrapment between worlds. Because she meets no intermediate test, pressure jumps straight to the final peel; still, the dawn deadline forces the ultimate palm-press choice with felt forfeiture of her old identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-transformation emerges through paint layers and stair surrender, never sermonised. Final image of ascending at sunrise reweights scholarship into guardianship without moralising. Subtext stays in murals and orchard physics; reader invited to equate learning with stepping into unknowing. One echo of abstract “bridge” phrasing near end keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Elara’s calibrated perception; diction—“calibrated vision,” “fossilized colours”—sounds like a conservator’s log. Rhythm lengthens in descriptive passages, then compresses as dawn pales, mirroring urgency without head-hopping. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through narrated thought and sensory filter, maintaining a consistent scholarly hush. Meets 9+ quick test: perceptual signature is distinct and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet selective; no synonym loops or scaffold sentences. Mixed metaphors avoided—“crystallized light,” “fossilized colours” stay within material science register. One clause contains Chinese characters “炽热” instead of English “hot”; while comprehensible, it jolts the lexicon and knocks 0.2. Otherwise rhythm breathes with beats, information density high, and final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing archaeologist-POV with liminal tech-orchard feels fresh; “stairway of suspended moments” reframes ascension as epistemic surrender rather than conquest. Familiar tropes—hidden realm, wise seeker, unclaimed throne—are retooled through scholarly method and paint-layer trial. Risk in lyric pacing pays off via sunrise deadline. Not quite 9 because the throne’s architects remain archetypally vague.</comment>
