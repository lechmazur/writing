<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ex-roadie/antiques appraiser contradiction is vivid and embodied; the tactile handling of wood and grille cloth shows a man using craft to buffer grief. Interiority slips into label-speak (“confident uncertainty” repeated) yet the final micro-choice—to drive toward the amp—earns its cost because the cloth turns from talisman to question in the same beat. Motivation stays bound to loss and public shame; no knowledge leaks. The refusal to stay safe is credible, but the emotional arithmetic is slightly tidy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the decision to go to Elko reconfigures silence from refuge to possible re-entry, cost felt in the quarry wind that “feels larger and lonelier.” Causal chain holds—televised failure → loss of voice → amp message → choice—each because/therefore legible. One transition (office → memory → office) is clean; orientation anchored by word 80. No prop or information teleporting; the grille cloth and amp are properly seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quarry trailer as micro-setting constrains: thin walls let wind howl, making silence audible and the choice to leave harder. Sensory hierarchy is roadie-specific—wood grain, amplifier heat, mesh texture—never tourist-catalog. The Elko mention widens the map only after the present space is charged. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Marcus risk hearing the sound of belonging again? Pressure tightens once—from insulating with facts to the amp message that forces either further retreat or exposure. No external antagonist needed; public shaming and grief supply coherent pressure. Cost is conceptual but legible: silence as safe identity is foreclosed the instant he turns the phone back on.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: sound never dies, it only migrates—shown through amplifier, grille cloth, quarry echo. No moralizing; the final image of “new places to echo” reweights earlier silence without stating a thesis. Particulars (Reno blow-out, 2 AM crash) keep universality anchored. Ambiguity remains: possible renewal or deeper wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Marcus’s perceptual bias—sound as texture, value as number. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under decision: “He turned off his phone, then turned it back on” mirrors the wrestle. No head-hopping; diction within roadie lexicon. Filter verbs used sparingly and purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; quarry wind sentence stretches to mimic loneliness. No synonym loops; “confident uncertainty” is the only repeated stem and it is motif-driven. Metaphors stay coherent—echo valley, sound-dampening—none mixed. High information density: one sentence can deliver sense memory, fiscal fact, and emotional insulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of antiques roadshow fail with rock-roadie PTSD feels fresh; the amp emerging from an estate sale is an inevitable yet surprising gift. Specific detail—hand-scribed “For Marcus”—prevents swap-with-generic. Risk taken in quiet ending pays off. Could edge higher if the Ming-vase televised mistake had been dramatized rather than summarized.</comment>
