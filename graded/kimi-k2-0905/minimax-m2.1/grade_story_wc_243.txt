<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is rich—fear of proximity vs. need to examine—but no embodied micro-choice alters tactics; the photo kiss is gesture, not stakes-moving decision. Emotional layering is evocative yet static; cost is conceptual, not dramatized. Meets Q1 quick test partly: impulses coexist in scene, but final promise lacks visible price on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: new promise reweights preservation covenant with future-risk cost felt in “bridge between what had been and what might yet be.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of steeping/tea/darkening photo culminates in resonant reconfiguration. No causality break; orientation anchored by word 80. Would reach 9+ if a concrete forfeiture (time, tool, chance) were forfeited on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jetty flora, mineral locket taste, and closing petals supply sensory hierarchy that mirrors internal shift; environment constrains final gesture—pressing locket to lips in darkness—charging the closing image. Selective, POV-filtered detail avoids catalog; purple twilight and sea scent function as archive material. Meets 9+ gate: micro-setting (locket) alters final choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving small moments—signals early; single tightening occurs when she accepts breathing change rather than freezing it, narrowing future method. Escalation is textural density, not rising external threat; cost is conceptual, visible in promise phrasing. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but barely crosses 7-band without sharper tactical forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from tea-steep metaphor lineage: preservation as living infusion, not mummification. Final promise reweights “weight of small moments” from burden to currency without moralizing. Subtle shift from fear of proximity to embrace of flux offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo; no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is tactile-olfactory archivist: “walnut-ink,” “mineral tang,” “soft spaces between heartbeats.” Syntax breathes with cadence of steeping—long reflective clauses that contract into decisive final line. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Registers 9+ territory; minor 0.1 reserve for occasional elevated lyric diction (“haunted euphoria”) that slightly over-declares.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates gracefully; only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“gently thorough” echoed in adjacent clauses) cost −0.2. Metaphors cohere under photo/tea axis; no mixed vehicles. High information density: sensory, archival, familial data packed without scaffold. Closure image clean of artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar grandmother-locket motif refreshed through archival-ink lens and regenerative covenant idea. Synthesis feels particular to this voice; removal would collapse metaphor system. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but not boldly unconventional. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
