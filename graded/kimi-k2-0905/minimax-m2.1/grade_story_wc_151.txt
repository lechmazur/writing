<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet, ritualized drive is credibly particularized through micro-choices (flipping the clipboard, chalking the sidewalk, adding the postscript). The interiority stays anchored to sensory work, not abstractions. Cost is present—the dawn departure that will surrender the letter—but because the recipient’s reaction is off-page, the price is still somewhat prospective rather than fully paid; this caps the arc short of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed letter with the postscript “Vesper Lane is who you were…” reweights identity for both Eleanor and Maren, foreclosing anonymity at a felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early (ritual layering of names, codes, dawn light) and tightens into the final image of Maren stepping into the arcade morning. No orientation drift; stakes escalate through density shift rather than causal turns, satisfying the short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arcade’s neon hum, chalk glyphs, and “perpetual sunset hymn” filter through Maren’s perceptual bias, constraining her tactile workflow and timing. The clipboard functions as micro-setting, reweighted when she flips it to find the spiral code. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. One hairline slip—“Nowhere” on the return address verges on cute, slightly undercutting specificity—but not enough to break the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the power of slow names against instant erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Maren commits the irreversible postscript. The cost is legible: once mailed, the pseudonym can be traced back to her shrine, risking exposure. Pressure could sharpen further if an external antagonistic force (postal inspector, dawn intruder) tested her on-page; as is, the escalation is internal-density driven, acceptable under Accumulative lens but just shy of the visible-price threshold for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of identity-as-inscription emerges through the iterative acts of naming, coding, and posting; no character states it aloud. The final postscript reconfigures the premise: the pseudonym is not disguise but reclamation, inviting reader to reread prior marginalia as self-authorship. Ambiguity lingers—who will receive, what risk to Maren—without moralizing. The resonance is earned, specific, and tied to the closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Maren’s perceptual field: “neon tubes still hummed their perpetual sunset hymn” is her internal metaphor, not authorial flourish. Rhythmic control—long clause followed by clipped prepositional phrases—mirrors her patient precision. No POV leakage; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Distinct texture sustained under pressure; zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and sonic layering (“smell of concession-stand popcorn lingered beneath notes of paper and ink”) propel without purple overload. Figurative language is selective, never stacked in successive sentences. One scaffold echo: “carefully inventive” appears twice in close proximity; minor, does not touch closure. Otherwise high density, zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The conceit of an arcade-turned-post-office shrine for name-rebirth is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail (chalk codes, clipboard ledger). Familiar trope of identity-forgery is retooled through slow-mail ritual rather than cyber-slickness, making the nostalgia futurism organic. Risk in merging lyric reflection with plot is managed without obscuring causality. Could edge higher if the external world pushed back more palpably against her practice.</comment>
