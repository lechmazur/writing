<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vespera’s haunted caretaker persona is visceral; the shard-in-pocket ritual and mirror-work embody her “polished stone” arc. Interior contradiction—revolutionary fire vs archival custodian—plays out in micro-choices (covering mirrors while yearning to look). The earned renunciation at the end costs her the comfort of a single origin myth, visible in the final mirror-covering beat. Flaw: no second on-page character, so status crucible and dialogue bullets stay NA; still, single-POV depth meets 9- gate with embodied emotion under storm pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she forecloses the “single-story” future, choosing custodianship of multiplicity; cost is the solitude of bearing fragments without being cut. Causal chain holds—shard blood → mirror protocol → vision of fleeing founders → reframing of truth. Orientation anchored by line 9; storm arrival is the because/therefore hinge. Minor slip: “governing council” laugh-off is off-page summary; could tighten causality if shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid texture is selective—amber time-pools, brass storm pipes, reflective crystal walls—each element later constrains action (mirrors as buffers). Micro-setting of shard in pocket reappears to charge closure. Spatial choreography clean: eastern wing → heart mirror → eastern wall tear. Sensory hierarchy filters through poet’s bias (imagery > tech specs), keeping exposition lean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to let the past overwrite the present during the storm. Tightening occurs when she uncovers the final mirror, risking temporal dissonance to glimpse founders’ desperation—option narrows to “look and go mad” or “cover and preserve multiplicity.” Agency drives escalation: she invents, implements, and personally tests the mirror method. Cost is legible—she chooses custodial loneliness over revolutionary certainty—but price could be sharper if the storm scarred her sensory perception on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: civilizations survive by carrying contradictory origin stories without shattering. Subtext lives in gesture—covering mirrors is an act of compassionate curation rather than denial. Final image of “reflective dark behind the cloth” conceptually reweights the premise, refusing monolithic history. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what kids will be taught.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poet-curator diction owns the paragraph: “visible time pooled like amber honey,” “burnished sorrow,” syntax laced with cadenced semicolons. Perceptual signature filters every detail through aesthetic urgency; even storm mechanics feel painterly. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Under storm stress, diction compresses—“time tore open”—without losing coherence; rhythmic control heightens pressure while clarity holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“amber honey,” “polished stone”), paying off in closure reprise. One mixed-metaphor risk—“footsteps leaving temporary impressions in…honey”—barely perceptible. High information density; each sentence layers image + world rule + emotional state. Clean copy; pronoun and tense immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: temporal storms + mirror conservation as historiography, reframed through failed revolutionary archivist. Vase shard as bloodletting mnemonic feels new. Conceptual risk—visible time as viscous substrate—committed to fully without infodump retreat. Specificity anchors universals: asteroid corridors, brass pipes, “hollow-eyed founders” fleeing into vacuum. Ending multiplicity avoids safe middle; no trope echo of已知 SF set-pieces.</comment>
