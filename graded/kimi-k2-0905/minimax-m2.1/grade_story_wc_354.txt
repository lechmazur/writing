<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—“he had learned that waiting itself was a kind of teaching”—but no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the worry-stone ritual recurs without altering tactics. The exiled tutor’s only on-page “choice” is to rise and wait again, so the renunciation never costs him a visible alternative. Precise thinker is shown in cadence, yet the story summarizes seven years of teaching instead of dramatizing one risky lesson that could have fractured the covenant on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ambient-lyric lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held: magnetic images accrete until the final “exhalation” reweights exile as vocation. Orientation is clear by line 3; no temporal or spatial drift. Closure is a Charged Poise—tutor forecloses speech forever, cost felt in “teach without speaking”—but the beat is summary, not dramatized action, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus and worry-stone function as micro-setting: stone’s dent is mapped, magnetic currents “hum beneath his feet,” constraining his stance. Twilight and eclipse are handled as filtered perception, not weather report. Sensory economy is excellent—copper light, cool basalt—though spatial footprint beyond “among the stones” stays vague; still, the objects charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is survival of purpose under silence; pressure is atmospheric, tightening only through image repetition, not plot turns. No reversal narrows options—eclipse retreats, but tutor’s situation is unchanged. Cost is abstract (perpetual silence); no visible forfeiture on the page. Meets Accumulative/Textural escalation but stays static under causal reading.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges—beauty discovered in difficulty—via concrete motifs: stone worn smooth, eclipse revealing edges. No moral stated; final line offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtextual irony: his precision exiles him, yet precision lets him endure. Ambiguity is purposeful; counter-readings (complicity, futility) remain open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance is stable; syntax mirrors tutor’s measured patience—balanced clauses, controlled caesurae. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a chess thinker: “correlate,” “magnetic nexus,” “covenant.” No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior cadence is character-specific. Minor filter verbs (“he wondered”) are rhythm-motivated, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with eclipse breath-metaphor; sentences lengthen then contract. No synonym loops or scaffold. Two adjacent “he had” anaphoras are purposeful pattern, not template. Abstract nouns (“motivation,” “circumstances”) appear in reflective paragraph but are offset by tactile stone imagery. Closure line is clean, no mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fusion of magnetic physics with chess pedagogy feels fresh; exile-by-precision twist reframes familiar court-intrigue trope. Worry-stone as geologic record of waiting is specific, not quirky. Risk is quiet—lyric stasis instead of plot—but coherence justifies choice. Could transplant to another setting, yet stone/eclipse synergy would collapse, so transformation partial.</comment>
