<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s perpetual surprise is more label than embodied contradiction, but her micro-choice to pull the lever is credibly motivated by the “frequency of belonging” ache. The interior arc—realizing she is the missing piece—lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost (“already home” forecloses further search). No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; solo interiority remains sharp and specific through the climactic mechanism beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the stellar press reweights belonging from puzzle to presence, cost visible in the “brilliant dimness” that embraces her. Causal linkage holds—chip→mechanism→map→recognition—without convenient leaps. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“obsidian floor”), transitions clean, one deepening beat suffices for 700-word scope. Persistent constraint: the sealed station and the need for the chip keep pressure taut.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tarnished brass instruments, copper dome pried open, and micro-type surface of the chip are tactile, selective, and filter through Mira’s surveyor eye. Observatory constrains the final action—star alignment must coincide with lever pull—charging the closing image. No weather clichés; desert wind functions as timekeeper. Spatial choreography clean; she climbs, crosses, pulls—bodies and tools track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tightened when the sealed relay station denies conventional access. Single meaningful escalation: star positions + chip + lever pull foreclose the option to keep searching; cost is the irrevocable recognition that no external answer exists. Agency resides in the pull; coincidence merely enables, does not resolve. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational-architectural.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from stellar inscription to final map: belonging is not found but remembered. Subtext operates in the pilgrim’s vanished trace and the “stars remember” line, reweighted when Mira sees her own life in the branching paths. No moralizing; the final line offers Charged Poise. Recurrent motif (star trails) constrains tactics rather than decorating scenery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual bias—sharp-eyed, one beat behind expectation. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“brilliant and dim at once”) yet stays credible for a tech-savvy pilgrim. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullets skipped. Free indirect discourse clean; no filter-verb clutter in peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable—“sleeping sentinels,” “knif-edge ridge” compress atmosphere without purple drift. Sentence rhythm modulates: short beats for climb, longer coils for revelation. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language peaks at closure but remains coherent (“brilliant dimness” paradox is earned).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines antique observatory, nano-etched type matrix, and cosmic cartography into a fresh synthesis; not a checklist. The “belonging as star-frequency” conceit transforms familiar quest-for-home trope through mechanical specificity. pilgrim’s absence and Mira’s surprise trait are non-obvious angles. Risk in lyric closure pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
