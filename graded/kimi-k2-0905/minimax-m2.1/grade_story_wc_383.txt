<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s skepticism and secret receptivity coexist convincingly in the first half; the embodied moment of holding the shell against her ear shows micro-choice. Yet the interior turn “Her skepticism shattered not with dramatic suddenness but with the quiet acceptance…” is told, not dramatized, so the emotional cost feels pre-cooked. Because the decisive shift is summarized, motivation jumps rather than intensifies, keeping the arc solid but not fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (jasmine, violet dusk, shell resonance) deepens density until the final image reweights loss as continuity. Causality is internal and coherent—grandmother’s archived voice arrives through prior-set acoustic logic, not coincidence. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “her grandmother’s voice would live on, not as ghost but as gift” makes the new rule legible and costly. One scaffold phrase (“as if speaking across the boundary…”) slightly blurs the final beat, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The velvet garden at twilight is filtered through Mira’s need for sensory escape; jasmine scent and color gradients mirror her thinning skepticism without overt symbolism. Spatial anchors are clear early (edge of station, crate of effects) and the shell’s micro-chambers later function as mobile setting that constrains how memory can be received. Details are selective, POV-colored, and support the final reconfiguration. No environment-driven tactic alters the climax, so the 9-gate remains unmet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mira accept the shell’s impossible message—tightens once, at the exact moment the voice resolves into Elena; that deepening shifts knowledge and forecloses pure skepticism. Pressure stays internal and textural, appropriate to the accumulative lens, with no external antagonist required. The cost is conceptual (paradigm loss) rather than tangible, but it is legible on the page. A second tightening beat is absent, keeping the escalation single-arc rather than compound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transforming isolation into continuity emerges through the shell’s acoustic archive rather than authorial statement. The jasmine-to-dawn color progression quietly echoes the shift from solitary dusk to shared legacy, giving the reader an imaginal answer instead of a moral. No final-paragraph thesis is declared; resonance is left charged but not tidily resolved. A hairline slip toward abstraction in “translate isolation into independence” slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close prose carries a scientist’s precision (“resonant structures, acoustic chambers”) yet allows lyric dilation under wonder, matching Mira’s dual nature. Sensory diction is controlled and rhythmic; no filter-verb clusters or register drift. The absence of dialogue keeps the voice internally coherent, with no risk of convergence. A single cadence template in “as if…” clauses repeats twice; otherwise rhythm modulates with attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense and propulsive; most sentences perform two jobs (atmosphere + interiority or world-rule + emotional tilt). Figurative layering is selective, never more than one image per high-pressure sentence, so metaphor coherence holds. One adjacent paraphrase loop—“her grandmother had achieved what she set out to do. The archive was real…”—restates without new pressure, triggering a minor artifact flag. Closure image itself is clean, allowing the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The “memory-encoded seashell” trope is refreshed by hard-acoustic specifics (inner curves as micro-chambers) and by making the playback a two-part device whose missing half motivates future quest. Science-as-mysticism risks cliché, but the piece keeps mechanics concrete and stakes personal. Risk is moderate—no structural experimentation—yet the synthesis feels particular to this voice and setting. Transformation test passes: story collapses without Elena’s harmonic-archive rule set.</comment>
