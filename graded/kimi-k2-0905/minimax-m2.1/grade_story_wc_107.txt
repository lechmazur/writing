<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glassblower’s interior contradiction—yearning for open inquiry while armoring himself in isolation—is rendered through embodied, glass-specific beats (the kettle burn scar, the reverent pipe carry). Yet no second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the arc is a solo thaw whose cost is felt but not forced into an external choice. Reflection stays anchored to the cracked bookmark and melting ice cues, avoiding therapy-speak. The final stance crystallizes credibly: he will “begin again,” having traded frozen detachment for pliable risk. Still, the absence of a live opposition keeps the stakes interior-only, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the finished vessel and scarred bookmark together reweight his rule-set—protection without imprisonment—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose but coherent; each thaw image (dripping eaves, softening glass) deepens the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the final image (“prepared to begin again” now costs him his glacier armor). A tighter micro-turn mid-scene would lift this into 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned control room’s rusted consoles and cracked panes filter every beat through the POV’s glassmaker eye—hum of dying circuits mirrors glass memory, melting icicles time the furnace plunge. Micro-setting qualifies: the glory-hole flame and bookmark both constrain timing and handling. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment does not yet charge the final image enough to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protective inquiry versus exposed vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens once: the bookmark scar and cascading ice force the decision to keep the vessel open-mouthed, renouncing total enclosure. Accumulative pressure suffices; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible in the renunciation of absolute safety. A second, sharper trade-off would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative image of survived breakage—glass, leather, heart—without moralizing. The vessel becomes a non-literal answer: a boundary that remains permeable. Subtext resides in the bookmark’s scar and the icicles’ surrender, charged in the final tableau. Complexity is honored; no tidy maxim intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect stays snug to the glassblower’s craftsman lexicon—“gather of amber glass,” “hungry flames”—with rhythmic modulation that accelerates during furnace work and eases during thaw contemplation. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. The mock-liturgical address to the empty room (“Now then…”) is voice-specific and purposeful. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence drags. Figurative layer is dense but patterned (glass/ice/thaw) and pays off. One mixed metaphor—“weighty lightness”—is earned as thematic coinage rather than slippage. Minor scaffold: “slow and careful unFreezing” hyphenation tic. Otherwise momentum holds through 756 words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Melting control-room-as-studio is fresh; the glassblower’s monologue to absent machines transforms mundane reheating into liturgy. Bookmark-scar motif recurs with reweighted meaning, avoiding gimmick. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation over plot, cohering under closure. Slight deduction for echo of familiar thaw-as-healing arc, redeemed by glass-craft specificity.</comment>
