<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—clinging to her grandmother’s camera while learning the necessity of leaving images unrecorded—are dramatized in the final harbor dance; the cost is felt as she accepts the camera will stay empty. Interiority is concrete, body-based, never label-heavy. Elena’s silent arrival tightens the crucible; their shared grief alters mutual status without exposition. Only the “quietly charismatic” tag is asserted, not earned on-page, keeping the score shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the camera remains unfilled yet now holds memory’s weight, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds: pattern of unsigned stories → moonlit signing → shared silence set to music. One soft spot: the whispering advisor vanishes without beat-marking, a minor teleport, but it does not rupture causality. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; tightening deepens once when Marina chooses to sign spontaneously, foreclosing her prior silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor moonlight is not postcard beauty; it thickens into presence that sanctions the women’s wordless exchange. The empty camera functions as micro-setting pressed against Marina’s sternum, constraining her final decision to keep it unloaded. Spatial choreography across dock and rowboat is crystal. Weather is used sparingly yet tactically—“thickening” moonlight mirrors internal loosening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—translate grief into shareable silence—tightens when Marina improvises signs to Elena, narrowing options from rehearsed tales to vulnerable self-exposure. Cost is legible: the camera stays empty, her private language now externalized. Escalation is textural: pattern break from withheld stories to embodied signing. No reversal, but deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: remembrance lives in unrecorded transmission. Subtext resides in empty camera vs. living gesture; no ethical binaries forced. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing. “Joyful sorrow” is rendered as embodied loosening in Elena’s shoulders—specific, unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marina; perceptual signature favors silvered water, leather smoothness, sign-language kinesthetics. Syntax grows longer under rapture then contracts at close, mirroring breath. No dialogue to corrupt voice. Filter verbs are rare and motivated. Psychic distance cleanly shifts inward during the dance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. No synonym loops or template cadences. Occasional elevated phrases—“unreasonable beauty,” “particular rhythm of loss”—border purple but stay within POV’s awe. Mixed metaphors absent. High information density: worn camera, moon sheen, sign motion all serve dual roles. Final paragraph could trim one adjective (“luminous harbor by moonlight” repeated) but does not blunt closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Folktales told only in signs, then transmuted into grief-song, offers fresh angle on loss. Camera-as-absence rather than recorder subverts nostalgia trope. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens coherence, not gimmickry. Specificity of Deaf culture detail feels lived-in, not borrowed.</comment>
