<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—climb toward memory yet shoulder others’ grief—are embodied in the scar-tracing, box-handling micro-choices; the final vow to “translate pain” is earned by seven years of fireground drills and the mirror-drop. Interiority stays concrete (“landscape of her survival,” “hard softness”) without therapy-speak. The only minor slack: Elena remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is implied, not pressure-tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the ridge thickens the pattern of scars, saplings, moonlight, and porcelain until the closing breath reweights the bargain. Orientation is anchored by 70 words; the single shard-scene obeys scope. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mira’s seated vigil crystallizes the cost of traded innocence and forecloses self-pardon. Cost is legible in the cracked mirror pressed to lips, a persistent constraint she will carry back to the station.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Moonlit ridge, blackened stumps, and saplings are filtered through Mira’s firefighter gaze; the porcelain box functions as micro-setting that constrains every handling choice. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and reflected light, mirroring internal scar tissue. Spatial choreography is clean: path, stone, box against chest. Environment does not merely backdrop but supplies the literal fire line where innocence was bartered, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—honor the bargain with loss—surfaces in paragraph two and tightens when the box opens to reveal the crazed mirror. One meaningful deepening: the mirror’s fracture forces Mira to see “the person they had made her,” narrowing options from avoidance to vocation. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-memory. Cost is repeatedly paid—Elena’s death, Mira’s tremorless hands, the annual climb—culminating in the vow to carry others’ grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of fire’s indifference versus human caring; no character states the thesis aloud. The porcelain box and crazed mirror reprice the premise: survival is not healing but translational labor. Final image of moonlight on closed box offers non-literal answer—grief is not solved but containerized and mobilized. Ambiguity lingers whether this bargain is mercy or new scar tissue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature—puckered skin as map, moonlight fracturing like memory. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during ascent, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext through tactile diction (“cracked porcelain,” “brown and fragile”). Register remains within a firefighter’s lived lexicon without drifting into poetic self-consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, selective, and paid off—“slow dance of celestial bodies” returns as witness to vigil. Information density is high: each sentence advances memory, object handling, or thematic reweighting. Opening and closing lines bookend with mirror and box, creating sonic echo without repetition. Zero grammar or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The firefighter’s annual penitential hike with a cracked memento box is fresh, avoiding rescue clichés by focusing on aftermath translation rather than heroics. Specific detail—pressed flower, crazed mirror, fire line held—grounds the premise in irreplaceable particulars. Risk is taken in the quiet Earned Stasis ending, justified by accumulative pattern. No derivative echoes; the bargain with loss feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
