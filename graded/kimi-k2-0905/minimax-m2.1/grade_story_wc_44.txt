<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s scholar identity is signaled early and her quiet deliberation shows in micro-choices (soft footsteps, cross-legged sit), but interiority drifts into stock phrasing (“never wished more desperately”) and the final beat is delivered as declarative summary rather than embodied cost; the key’s warmth is the only tactile consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: find key → trace loops → close seven circles → shadow re-appears; the Bend backstory is anchored to present stimuli and the final image delivers a Conceptual Repricing (light folded back upon itself) with visible cost (key hot, shadow restored). Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating-isle observatory is more than postcard: the brass lens, humming stones, and perpetual twilight constrain Elara’s movements and supply the very shadow she unseals. Selective sensory detail (cold brass, soft click, captured starlight) is filtered through rune-scholar priorities; the setting’s geometry directly enables the loop-closing ritual that reweights the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled inside 100 words and tightened once: each closed loop makes the hidden shadow less elusive. Agency remains with Elara throughout; the seventh circle forecloses failure and the price (key burns, world-rule re-curved) is legible. No reversal beyond the single deepening, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-didactically: knowledge is not observed but enacted—sealed awakenings open only when the scholar risks bodily engagement (loops, heat). Final image reweights “shadow” from absence to folded light, avoiding moral summary. One near-prompt echo (“she realized with sudden clarity”) is softened by immediate physical corollary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s rune-scholar perceptual filter; diction (“residual magic,” “phosphorescent fish”) feels native to her training. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, clipped clauses during circling. No head-hop; free indirect slips are clean. Compression (“three seasons cataloging”) is strategic and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean and propulsive; occasional poetic duplication (“slowly, deliberately” used twice) and stacked metaphors (“symphony of enchantments,” “breath returning to a sleeping body”) flirt with overwriting but never stall causality. No loops or filter-verb stacks; grammar and tense stable. Closure image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Spoons bent reality” is a fresh, absurdist pivot that justifies the new shadow physics without exposition dump; the clockwork key as loop-closer feels inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk—treating noon shadows as origami light—pays off in a final reconfiguration that could not swap into another tale unchanged.</comment>
