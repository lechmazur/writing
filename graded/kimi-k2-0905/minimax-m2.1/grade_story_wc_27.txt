<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is textured—bare toes curling, awkward confidence performed until real—but the decisive turn (“she made her choice”) is announced rather than dramatized with conflicting impulses on the page. The lineage heirloom and paternal sacrifice supply emotional back-pressure, yet the final stance feels slightly predetermined, muting the cost of her refusal to let the rebellion fade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Kira’s kneel-to-rise sequence reconfigures the rebellion’s meaning from grief-weighted waiting to purpose reclaimed, cost registered in the stone circle’s intensifying hum. Causal chain holds—grandmother’s glasses → memory anchoring → circle resonance → decision to reignite—though the “how” of transmitting the hum to others is elided, a minor motivational ellipsis rather than a rupture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Repair-bay chill, rusted scaffolding, and dormant robotic arms ground the spatial stage early; the barefoot contact with warm stones converts setting into visceral choice-pressure at climax. Skylight cracks and slanting orange light narrow visual scope to intimate cosmic margin, letting the circle function as micro-setting that charges the final image without exposition bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the rebellion’s future—tightens once: from lull-as-paralysis to lull-as-breath. The circle’s rising hum externalizes escalating pressure; Kira’s agency crystallizes in the kneel/stand pivot that forecloses passive mourning. Cost is felt (she shoulders her father’s legacy), though no tangible resource is forfeited on-page, keeping it just below the 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern—inheritance, stargazing, circle resonance—rather than dictation: meaning is forged by refusing to let ruins remain mere ruins. Final image of “thunderous serenity” reweights earlier quietude without moralizing. Ambiguity persists (will non-violent remembrance suffice?), honoring complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Kira’s sensory pipeline—dust, cold grate, stone warmth—syntax lengthening with lyric elevation only at the crescendo, mirroring hum-to-thunder transition. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; no dialogue to test voice divergence, yet diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose breathes—varied sentence lengths, concrete nouns, minimal scaffolding. Occasional elevated cadence (“margin of daylight where everything felt possible”) risks slight purple, but pattern is taught early and pays off in final “margin of daylight” reprise. No loop clusters or mixed metaphors obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusing pre-colonial stone circle with derelict spaceport refreshes the “lost colony” trope; opera glasses as memory conduit feels novel yet inevitable. Risk lies in non-violent reignition—avoiding expected battle crescendo—but the choice is earned through Kira’s specific lineage grief rather than abstract pacifism, preventing gimmickry.</comment>
