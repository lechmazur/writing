<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s shift from clinging to permanence to allowing impermanence is embodied in tactile chalk-work and the pocketed tile; her contradictory impulses (fear of letting art die vs. need to hear herself) play out in-scene. Micro-choice—pressing the tile into the mandala—pays the cost of her old identity on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“comfortable wound,” “listening with her hands”) and avoids label-speak. The whimsical artist label is shown through off-beat perception rather than declared, earning the closing permission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile insertion crystallizes an emergent hush that reweights her art from permanence to impermanence, with felt cost (“the tile had become strangely warm”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chalk dust, mist, and tile resonance layer until pattern break at center mandala. Orientation anchored within 120 words and causality intact. One meaningful tightening—no reversal required under this lens—lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics, mist curtains, and lavender tile are filtered through Elara’s artist-eye and constrain her choices (where chalk falls, where tile is placed). The tile’s hum and the mandala’s spirals track spatially without drift. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound > sight) mirrors her need to “hear” herself. Environment charges the final image—tile warmth against thigh—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn to speak when art feels like lying”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies as chalk patterns must die to create hush. Inserting the tile is the single decisive agency that forecloses her old permanence stance; cost is the tile’s warmth and the irrevocable scattering of the mandala. Under Accumulative lens, density increase suffices for escalation; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible on page, satisfying 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: impermanence as creative permission rather than loss. Subtext resides in tactile silence—chalk dust settling, tile humming—never sermonized. Final image of pocketed warm tile reweights earlier “comfortable wound” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: she may still fail tomorrow, keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Free-indirect lyric stays within Elara’s perceptual signature: “something trying to remember what it once was,” “listening with her hands.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then compresses at insertion beat. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Psychic distance tightens credibly under grotto hush without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with pressure; figurative language is selective, never clotted. Sentences carry double duty (“mist curled upward like something trying to remember”). No synonym loops or template cadences. Closing sentence earns its lift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk artist + whispering-gallery acoustics + mandala impermanence feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of quiet hush-over-explosion is taken and paid off. Not derivative; could not swap tile for any random object without breaking resonance. Specificity of “lilac unease” and tile hum creates memorable texture.</comment>
