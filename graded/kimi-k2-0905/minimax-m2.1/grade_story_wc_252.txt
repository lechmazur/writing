<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s guarded-to-open arc is credibly embodied: the trembling unclasping of the scrimshaw, the deliberate laying-down, the cold-water step all manifest contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority stays concrete (“armor she had built around her heart” vs. “flower in the deep”) without diagnostic speak. The final renunciation is foreshadowed by her father’s earlier words and micro-choices under rising whale-call pressure; cost is felt as she swims away from the dock-lights that defined her. One hairline slip: “graceful Maren, careful Maren, guarded Maren” risks label-stack, but rhythm justifies it as incantatory release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scrimshaw left on the dock reweights the premise—freedom costs the very key that promised it. Causal chain holds: whale-call → invitation perceived → talisman set down → body enters water, each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“harbor’s sublittoral fringe”) and spatial track stays clean across swim. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits heirloom, past identity, and dry world in one continuous motion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe evolves from postcard label to active threshold: the wooden pilings, violet light, and bioluminescent spray literally structure her step-off. The scrimshaw functions as micro-setting—warmth against skin, then abandoned platform—charging the final image. Dock geography stays consistent; tide-turn acoustics motivate the whale’s arrival. Sensory selection skews auditory/tactile, matching a dock worker’s trained attention to rope and beam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock her own heart—tightens once: the whale’s second call forces the choice between talisman-as-shield and self-immersion. Escalation is situational but coherent: external invitation, internal refusal, then surrender; no coincidence resolves. Felt price is the forfeiture of the scrimshaw and the literal risk of hypothermia/drowning, crystallized as she swims toward “black water.” One beat could sharpen stakes further—an explicit memory of punishment for water-contact—but the current pressure suffices for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: inherited grief vs. self-forged freedom, dramatized through the talisman’s release and whale’s embrace. Repricing occurs in the final line— “some locks only open when you set down the key”—a conceptual shift that revalues every prior scrimshaw touch. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers: is this transcendence or suicide? The emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels salt-cold and heartbeat in throat. Subtext in whale song as non-violent liberation invitation avoids allegory trap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is maritime—ropes, tide, whalebone—without generic poetic diction. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences while coiling rope, fragments as she unclasps (“She did not throw…”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests in lyrical yet tactile narration; succeeds. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated (“she heard something that felt like permission”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes in one sinuous sweep; final line recharges motif without exposition. Strong verbs (“carved,” “breathed,” “swelled”) replace modifiers. One micro-slip: “surrender” used twice in close proximity, but second instance is thematic payoff, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm undulates like tide, accelerating into the swim.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-conflict dock worker meets mystical whale invitation to jettison inherited talisman—avoids both pirate cliché and therapy arc. The disappearing island motif reconfigured as vanishing self-island, not landmass, feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of “violet hour” sublittoral fringe and whale-bone scrimshaw grounds lyric risk. Transformation test: swap dock for spaceport and whale for signal—story collapses; maritime specifics are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Her grace is not ornament: rope-coiling fluidity contrasts with rigid inner armor, making the final ungraceful cold plunge the decisive reversal. Early embodied grace sets up stakes for losing it.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Scrimshaw drives every beat: gift → talisman → excuse → relinquished key. Final abandonment reweights all prior touches; without it, no tangible cost exists.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Island refigured as Maren’s own disappearing identity rather than geography; metaphoric but signaled early and charged in final swim-away. Could be clearer if one dock piling literally crumbles, yet conceptually sufficient.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Unlocking trait powers the plot: she must drop the “key” to open her heart, enacting the carved promise. Literalized in the beat of laying it down.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Detachment is the single irreversible act that triggers closure; no substitute verb carries the same ritual weight. Timing synchronized with whale rise.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whale call mechanics established acoustically through dock pilings and tide-turn, then dramatized as bioluminescent rise. Invitation structure prevents violence, enabling surrender arc.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe literally the stepping-stone off the dock; cold, neither shore nor sea, forces the liminal identity shift. Micro-setting qualifies.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“After violence impossible” is premise, not live clock, yet it motivates why whale-call replaces combat as liberation method. Static but foundational.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Freedom-through-embracing-true-nature is dramatized as abandoning inherited defense and accepting oceanic self. Conflict between safety and authenticity charges every beat.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Combative tenderness encoded in whale song—“fierce gentleness”—and mirrored in Maren’s trembling but resolute unclasping. Tone modulates from elegiac to luminous surrender without softening stakes.</comment>
