<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—coffee tin pressed to ribs, moon-cycle condition, trade of poems—yet her dramatic choice (offering one poem to Delphine) is slightly under-motivated; we see no micro-struggle or risk. The monthly personality trait is invoked but not exploited inside this scene, so the on-page contradiction is minimal. Delphine’s pianist past is elegantly embodied in her "quiet precision" and voice, so relationship crucible works. Cost is gestured (privacy surrendered) but not sharpened, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library, poems, and women are "waiting for the next reader," a crystallized stance with felt social cost—beauty forced inside a cage of iron and stars, work unfinished. Causal chain holds: poem-offer causes shared moment causes the unfinished cathedral image; no off-stage resolution. Orientation clean by paragraph 2; single transition to moon-rise is legible. Accumulation lens chosen—density of imagery and cadence tighten once as poems migrate into books—so the Required CR still satisfies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted beams, moonlit skyline, and paper dust are filtered through Mira’s vagrant-poet bias; the library itself is used as tool when it shelters their subversive cataloguing. Coffee tin serves dual micro-setting role: tactile warmth, then revelation platform. Final image of "fractured light" re-uses opening rust motif, charging closure. Environment does not push a tactical limit, so score stops just short of 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—create meaning inside a meaning-stripping place—is announced late but dramatized continuously through cataloguing, poem-planting, and whispered admissions. Tightening beat occurs when Mira decides to expose the hidden poems: risk of exposure vs. need to be witnessed; this narrows safety options. Cost is present (loss of anonymity, emotional vulnerability) though not materially compounded. Agency stays internal/artistic, fitting accumulative lens, hence high band but not apex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of "beauty as sabotage against erasure" emerges through acts—hand-written shelf signs, poems inside covers—not explanation. Subtext lives in fingers on spines and voice carrying "quiet precision." Final "luminous and incomplete" re-weights premise without moral. One hairline echo: Delphine states theme aloud ("act of creating meaning"), but occurs mid-scene and is brief; minimal deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—yard-sale tin warmth, moon as "clearing the jagged skyline." Syntax lengthens under calm, contracts ("they worked") for institutional rhythm, showing control. Pattern-taught elision ("the silence of two strangers...") paid off when dialogue finally breaks. No head-hopping; distance stable; register consistent with poet-vagrant ear; qualifies for 9 band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds later symbolism, e.g., "rusted iron beams forming a skeletal cage" forecasts closure image. Metaphors stay coherent (library as cathedral, moon as silver) and sparse enough not to clot urgency. No paraphrase loops; strong verbs ("clutched," "poured," "greet") limit modifiers. One minor scaffold: "they worked... still working, still talking" repetition could trim, but it occurs early and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prison-library micro-cathedral built by two marginal women feels fresh; poetry-as-graffiti and shifting-identity disorder deepen angle. Resistance conceived as quiet cataloguing sidesteps standard escape tropes. Moon-cycle trait, though under-played, seeds future uniqueness. Voice-level specificity ("penny poet," "coffee tin") prevents universal swap-out, giving inevitable hindsight glow. Risk in lyric stillness pays off; no gimmicks.</comment>
