<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-driven compulsion is vivid, but the “involuntarily truthful” trait is declared not dramatized—no on-page moment where it costs her. The hollow choice is credible renunciation, yet interiority leans on abstractions (“some memories too precious to let die”) rather than embodied contradiction. Emotional stakes feel high; micro-choices (climb, hide, study) align, but the climax lacks a visible price tied to her flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glass eye beside hidden texts crystallizes her outlawed mission with felt social cost. Causal chain holds—storm wreckage → climb → cache → resolve to study—but the “because” linking the glass eye to next action is implicit, not enacted. Orientation is quick; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices for 700-word window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hanging orchard roots in granite and functions as micro-setting: the hollow trunk supplies concealment and mirrors Mira’s fractured persistence, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—cool glass eye against thigh, saplings in wounds—filtered through forager’s gaze. Storm-scarred ravine anchors who-where-why within 120 words. Environment constrains climbing path and hiding spot, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore emotional connection via forbidden science—is signaled early and tightens when she secretes the eye with outlawed texts, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is situational: landscape violence mirrors social danger, forcing stance crystallization. No causal antagonist, but patrol dismissal shows stakes. Cost is conceptual (outlaw status) yet legible; could be sharper if patrol threat re-entered at end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory as subversive mercy—emerges through orchard imagery and smuggled gaze, never sermonized. Final tableau (glass eye beside discredited cures) reweights earlier “emotional memory” theory without naming it. Subtext in “mouth an open wound” hints at contagious vulnerability. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on replication risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice carries distinct perceptual signature: forager’s taxonomy (“read these ruins… symbiotic secrets”) and lyrical compression (“orchard trembled in the ravine’s throat”). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for ascent, clipped final line for poise. No dialogue, so no register clash. Glass eye motif recurs with shifting charge; prose stays within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense and propulsive; figurative language is controlled, not stacked. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“patient architecture of persistence”) fits reflective beat without register drift. Opening and closing images bookend cleanly; punctuation clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-viral emotional anesthesia fused with 19th-century ocular memory theory feels novel and specific. Orchards suspended in erosion gorge supply fresh visual metaphor that mirrors theme. Risk in lyric ellipsis pays off in resonant final image. Could push further if glass eye’s rumored mechanism were tested, not only archived.</comment>
