<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elena’s curiosity-to-necessity shift is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (hand over the tutor’s, decision not to ask). The tutor’s “dead” presence is shown via cool touch and reverent handling of seal; interior contradiction pulses in Elena’s simultaneous longing and restraint. Final renunciation (“I don’t need to know”) costs her full knowledge yet feels earned. Cap at 8.7 because the tutor’s pre-story timeline remains partly opaque, slightly blunting cost scale.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elena’s hand-clasp reconfigures their contract, cost is the foregone confession. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rooftop session layers architectural syntax until meteor night crystallizes the unstated pact. Causality intact: borrowed sugar → tea → roof → meteor → refusal. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 80 words. Persistent constraint: the seal’s buried past now shared but still unspoken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Desk seal, antique wood-ring, and rooftop meteor shower are handled, not catalogued; seal’s embossed paper sound recurs under pressure. Third-floor east window and midnight pipes filter through Elena’s growing lexicon, constraining her willingness to breach the lie. Spatial choreography clean: door-knock, desk, ladder to roof, hand-over-hand gesture track without drift. Environment directly shapes the final silence; buildings “lean inward” to witness the choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s need to understand why she was drawn—tightens when she realizes the price is perpetual mystery. One meaningful reversal: she moves from interrogation to protective renunciation, narrowing her future knowledge. Accumulative pressure via architectural grammar lessons and meteor shower; no coincidence resolves. Cost visible in her voiced relinquishment; option to “know” foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: knowledge can be housed in silence; some truths survive only in the negative space of lies. Subtext carried by seal’s buried history and the unasked questions. Final image of stars “corrections in margins” reweights prior lessons—universe itself edits, accepts deletions. Avoids explicit moral; resonance lingers in Elena’s paid forfeiture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, hushed free-indirect style stays inside Elena’s selective attention—mortar-colored eyes, pipe memories. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, fragments under meteor shower, matching cadence to awe. No dialogue; interior idiom distinct from tutor’s gnomic aphorisms delivered in reported speech. Psychic distance tightens for hand-clasp, then widens to cosmic scale—controlled modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “circular impression of a desk seal pressed into its wood decades ago” fuses object, history, sensory echo. No synonym loops; each metaphor (stars as corrections) extends single conceit. One passive—“had been buried”—justified as Elena’s inference. Rhythm breathes: long accumulative clauses build to short declarative “I don’t need to know.” Zero scaffolding, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost mentor teaches literacy of architecture instead of Latin, making “dead language” literal yet spatial. Premise feels inevitable—seal’s buried past, borrowed sugar ritual, meteor shower as grammar of sky. Not a retread; reverses usual ghost-story confession beat into chosen silence. Risk in quiet ending paid off by Charged Poise.</comment>
