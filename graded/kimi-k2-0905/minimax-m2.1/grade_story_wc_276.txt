<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Morwen’s “cool-headed” trait is shown through patient observation and the final refusal to seize; the rail-spike’s emotional transliteration lets embodied emotion surface without label-speak. Internal contradiction is present—fisherman pragmatism versus mystic receptivity—and the closing renunciation of noise costs him his old life of ordinary fishing. One micro-choice at each spire turn accumulates to the stance crystallization; no safety-hedging. Minor slip: “earned his reputation” is told, not embodied, but it is brief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silence he voices reconfigures sky patterns and charges the spike with goddess-echo; cost is the unspoken forfeiture of his former perceptual world. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each garden resonance thickens pattern until cadence shifts at the final non-sound. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by word 80; no ambiguity. No causal contradiction; sleepwalking constellations complicate but do not resolve, satisfying lens guardrail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden is rendered through proprioceptive footing and hum-under-sole rather than catalog; crystalline spires cast concentric light rings that constrain zigzag pathing. Micro-setting rule met: the spike becomes the final charged environment. Sensory selection skews auditory-synesthetic, matching POV’s fisherman ear. Spatial choreography across spiral is tracked cleanly; no impossible positions. Slight overture of “salt-heavy air” is familiar, but it is quickly braided into emergent imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“catch the echo before it scatters”—signaled early; each spiral turn tightens pattern density, narrowing options from sight to silence. Protagonist agency drives every escalation; no coincidence resolves. Visible price: the spike’s increasing weight with grief and the final trade of lifelong perceptual habit for god-echo. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; tightening legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of listening beyond hearing—silence reclaimed as craft. No explicit thesis; final image of fishing for “echoes only he could hear” reweights prior silver-fishing life without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is he blessed or exiled? Complexity embraced; no tidy binary. Subtext carried in gesture (loose grip, bare feet) and synesthetic color-weight transfers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains perceptual signature: salt, iron, vibration, star-drag. Syntax lengthens during garden approach, fragments at the non-sound climax, mirroring tightening pattern. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within plausible fisher lexicon—“cold-forged steel,” “silver from restless waters.” Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence never fractures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm naturally varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. High information density: single sentences deliver spike lineage, storm aftermath, and mystical premise. Metaphors are coherent—“boundary torn like wet paper” keeps tactile logic. Zero filter-verb stacks; no scaffolding. Opening and final lines act as resonance plates, anchoring and recharging motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses synesthetic cosmology with working-class maritime stoicism—fresh synthesis. Sleepwalking constellations and sound-wave garden avoid generic fantasy templates through specific sensory transliteration. Risky structural choice—lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals—paid off via Accumulative closure. Transformation test fails if relocated: requires exact coastal fisher silence-craft. Specificity throughout: rail spike as lineage, grief weight, god receiver—irreplaceable.</comment>
