<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—clinging to grief while weaponizing it as methodology—are dramatized in the handshake beat; the micro-choice to read the dead aloud instead of proposing terms crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete (“geometry of a loss”) and avoids label-speak. The earned renunciation—peace as saving the living, not honoring the dead—carries visible cost in the confession beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the slight external safety-hedge (no refusal or failure tested on-page) keeps her just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the handshake lingers, reweighting the forever-war stalemate under the Accumulative lens; the cost is felt in Maren’s realization that “the work would continue—messy, incomplete.” Causality holds: ritual reading → shared grief → handshake, each beat accumulating density rather than forcing reversal. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the clipboard’s tactile role in the final image could be sharper to nail the persistent-constraint test outright.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The terrace’s stone constrains the ritual pacing—“ancient before either dynasty”—and the midsummer celestial clock visibly pressures the timing of the handshake. The ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting, its black surface catching starlight to cue the name-reading beat. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (amber light, grinding sandals) and integrated into action rather than catalogued. Meets the 9+ gate: environment charges the final image by providing the literal platform on which the cost is enacted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can grief be converted into usable truce?—tightens when the name-reading ritual forecloses traditional treaty talk; the handshake is the first live option narrowed. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens: each spoken name adds weight rather than forcing causal reversals. Visible price: Maren abandons the belief that peace honors the dead, accepting endless labor instead. Slight reservation: the external political cost (will the camps actually delay fighting?) is implied rather than shown, keeping the score just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: peace as endless maintenance rather than noble culmination. The flawed-beauty tone—”beautiful in its imperfection”—is earned through the specific image of two bereaved leaders shaking hands on blood-stained stone. Final reconfiguration reweights the clipboard from bureaucratic prop to reliquary of names, offering a non-literal answer: redemption is the continuing act of reading the dead, not their resurrection. No moralizing sentence intrudes; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual signature—”particular geometry of a loss”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (long sentences for reflection, clipped fragments at the handshake). No head-hopping; Duchess Sera’s softening is observed externally. Diction remains within Maren’s plausible lexicon (“operatively gentle” is her own professional idiom). One microscopic slip: “celestial dance” risks poetic cliché, but the immediate re-anchoring to Jupiter and Venus saves specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose shows high density—”sun bled into night” does triple duty: time-pass, mood, foreshadow. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stake or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent (”geometry of grief” sustains the spatial/architectural motif). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor hairline: “slow dance of celestial bodies” is the only phrase approaching stock, but its immediate particularization keeps the line-level fault beneath measurable penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Freshens the well-worn “peace summit” trope by replacing treaty clauses with a funeral liturgy on an ancient terrace. The clipboard-as-reliquary is a specific, non-obvious synthesis of bureaucratic and sacred. Risk is taken with the anti-climax—no treaty signed—yet the choice is fully earned. Slight deduction for recognizable celestial-observer opening; still, the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
