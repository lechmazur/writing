<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is painter-specific and embodied (“paint-stained fingers”), and her arc from fracture to multitudes is legible. The decisive shift—accepting faces as multitudes—carries cost via the broken box restored, earned by prior causality. Yet the external world offers no secondary pressure; she faces only architecture and cards, so relationship/status crucible is absent and the “crestfallen” wound is asserted more than dramatized. Micro-choices (untangling threads) are present but solitary, keeping the score short of high-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored box and her re-threaded perception reweight the premise with conceptual cost (she can no longer pin faces to single truths). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each luminous knot is a pattern break that deepens density until meaning flips. Orientation is waived; initial disorientation (“the sea seemed to have forgotten”) pays off in the final inversion. One minor loop: “the question was rhetorical; she already knew the answer” appears twice without fresh charge, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is viscerally anchored—salt-breathing walls, inward-curving shelves that track Mira’s attention—and the tarot cards act as micro-setting that constrains her choices. Sensory hierarchy follows her painter’s eye: color, line, reflection dominate; touch returns via “paint-stained fingers.” Spatial choreography is coherent as she descends spiral stairs that “she had not noticed before,” a causal reveal, not teleportation. Environment mirrors internal collapse/contraction without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate via the cards charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether she can ever see/ paint a true face—surfaces early and tightens through pattern intensification: each card refracts faces until the perception itself threatens to collapse. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she flips fragmentation from curse to gift, foreclosing the old portrait method with visible conceptual cost. No antagonist or external opposition, so pressure is purely cognitive; still, the escalating luminosity of thread-loosening acts as accumulative agency. Cost is legible on-page (“the broken tarot box rested complete”), meeting the 8.8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—perception as multitudes versus singular truth—emerges through tarot imagery and painterly failure rather than declaration. Subtext operates in the silent shift from “fracturing” to “redesign,” a conceptual repricing enacted, not stated. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: the once-broken box now “complete” yet holding unstable multiplicity. No moralizing, and ambiguity lingers (she can paint again, but what will the portraits now look like?), fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s painterly perceptual filter: geometries, watercolors, rays, reflections. Syntax grows slightly more fragmented under stress (“Fragmented reality pressed…”) then steadies as she rethreads, mirroring arc. No dialogue, so voice distinction requirement is waived. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits an artist who thinks in form, and patterned elision (“she wondered why she had come”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer sense and image without paraphrase loops. Metaphors are painter-appropriate and internally consistent (watercolors bleeding, threads of light). One mixed metaphor cluster: “the velvet interior exposed like an wound”—article clash and mixed vehicle—but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences contract to shorter percussive ones as walls “contract,” then expand again on emergence, supporting momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Takes the trope of mystical tarot revelation and grounds it in a failed portraitist’s specific vocation; the lighthouse-library setting feels fresh, not standard occult backdrop. Fragmented reality is literalized through card imagery that reweights her artistic practice, a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking appears in near-solitary cognitive conflict, yet coherence holds. Could edge higher if external stakes or a second character complicated her fracture, but within 800 words the internal reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
