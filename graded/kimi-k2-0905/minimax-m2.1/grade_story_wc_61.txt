<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vael’s interiority is textured—sonar-ping perception, bodily translucence, gear-weight as legacy—but the emergent “consciousness” of the gear is accepted without visible contradiction or micro-choice that forecloses a path; the final stance is more passive witnessing than earned renunciation, so the cost feels conceptual rather than personally paid. The sentimentalist label is shown, not told, yet the gear’s agency blurs Vael’s decision moment enough to cap the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—cyclical garden, generational gear—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gear’s autonomous tick reweights the “share light without fire” mission into a colder, self-propagating illumination. Cost is legible in the final sonar ping that no longer returns to Vael alone, implying custodial displacement. One micro-turn (gear wakes) tightens the pattern; nocausality breaks, though the orientation of time (“seven cycles of breath”) remains poetic rather than chronometric, waived because it serves the lyric closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nebula garden is not backdrop but pressure source—petals fall against zero-g, roots drink diffuse matter—constraining Vael’s transit and charging the final image when the gear’s cold flame spreads through that same medium. Sensory triage is POV-true: luminous fog, brass teeth catching starlight, metallic heartbeat against translucent flesh. Spatial choreography holds across the 300-league drift. Environment fulfills the 9+ gate by shaping the stakes and final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and deepens when the gear’s self-ticking introduces a colder illumination that may obviate the custodian. One meaningful tightening: the gear’s autonomy narrows Vael’s options from active carrier to passive witness. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the closing whispered secret: the next bearer will inherit a tool that no longer needs a hand. Agency is renunciation-by-acceptance, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of light-as-presence versus light-as-calculation; the gear’s awakening reprices the ancestral mission without moralizing. Final image reweights “without fire” from benevolent restraint to potential exponential detachment—an unsettling conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers whether the cold flame is evolution or loss, satisfying the 9+ test for resonance without stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, with perceptual signature anchored in sonar pulses, translucence, and metallic heartbeats. Syntax modulates from long floating clauses to the staccato “This was not supposed to happen,” mirroring pressure shift. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Vael’s quasi-organic lexicon. Distinct rhythmic control lifts the voice to high-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. One mixed-metaphor risk (“cold flame of pure intention”) is earned by the conceptual reprice at closure. No loops, no register drift; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the zero-g drift, accelerating at the gear’s tick.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of obsolete brass gear with bioluminescent nebula garden feels inevitable and fresh; the “thinking stone” revived by pattern-attention flips the familiar generational heirloom into a latent AI awakening without technobabble. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes rather than obscuring them. Transformation is high: swap gear for any other heirloom and the entire conceptual reprice collapses.</comment>
