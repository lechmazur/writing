<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction—clinging to empirical training while surrendering to unmeasurable silence—plays out in embodied micro-choices (tuning stance, weeping) that visibly cost her composure. The final renunciation of measurable certainty is earned by the prior causality of the fragment's resonance and the silence's invitation. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible pressure; still, her solitary stance crystallizes with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe's recursive rhythm reweights her premise with undeniable cost—she abandons quantifiable science for intuitive listening. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (tower, gorge, lunar perigee). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break of geometric silence intensifies density, cadence shift in final paragraph reconfigures meaning. Persistent constraint—she can never again filter first—shapes implied future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rusted radio-tower city, swaying platform, and gorge wind constrain her posture and tool handling; the hollywood star fragment operates as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection (copper tang, tower sway, lunar glare) filters through her professional priorities. Spatial choreography is clean across ladder descent. Weather and moon distance causally affect signal reception. The fragment's heat-scarred edge is returned to in the closure beat, reweighting its meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she cling to measurable data or surrender to unknowable silence—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the geometric silence widens, forcing her to abandon filters; price is loss of professional certitude. Agency is interior renunciation, not external action, but forecloses future methodology with felt cost. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via silence density; coincidence (lunar perigee) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cyclical nature of endings and beginnings is enacted by the silence that births new perception, not stated. Subtext resides in the fragment's scarred glamour and the gorge's echoing absence. Final image of descent at dawn reweights prior material—she now carries an unsharable cosmos. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers over whether this gift is blessing or burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: astronomical lexicon filtered through tactile humility ("rusted ladder," "copper wiring she'd rewired herself"). Rhythm modulates—long clauses during cosmic receptivity, short fragments under silence shock. No dialogue; interior monologue stays in her professional register without filter-verb clutter. Compression ("serenely electric") is taught early and paid off in closing weeping beat. No head-hopping; single POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, character tool-use, and world rule ("fragment...hummed at frequencies no natural stone should produce"). Metaphors are spare and coherent ("silence...like a knife through water"). Occasional adjectival pairing ("serenely electric") risks register drift but is voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Final paragraph breathes without sluggishness, letting closure image linger.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: discarded movie-star glamour as scientific amplifier listening to cosmic hush. Premise avoids stock first-contact; instead, universe reveals its own recursion. Risk-taking in passive, observant climax is justified by prior causality. Specificity of Gorge of Echoes and perigee-tuned atmospherics resists generic anywhere. Could swap lunar perigee for another astronomical event, so not fully irreplaceable, but angle feels non-obvious.</comment>
