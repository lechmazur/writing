<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and profession-specific; the archivist’s “quartz hush” addiction and micro-footstep care feel lived-in. Yet the epiphany—“preserve meaning, not magic”—is declared rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse or external resistance tests her, so the change reads as serene acceptance, not costly renunciation. Still, the embodied ritual of slide-handling keeps her motive legible throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the archive’s mission flips from binding spells to curating stories, and the cost is her life’s premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each observed fade deepens pattern until the final reweighting. Orientation is swift; the dome, frost shelves, and twilight clock anchor by line 3. No causal break; the fade→story shift is seeded in the first slide reading.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen library above clouds is more than postcard: the zero-sound marble literally shapes her gait and the resonator’s quartz hush becomes the story’s final metaphor. The glass slide recurs as handled object, its ember-glow shift charging the closing image. Sensory triage—visual glow, tactile frost, auditory silence—mirrors her narrowing attention. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep vows from vanishing. Escalation is textural: each sampled slide shows further spectral drift, tightening the emotional noose. The midpoint reversal—compassion vow has already left the visible spectrum—forces her pivot to story-preservation. Cost is conceptual (loss of magical binding) rather than visceral, but legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: magic decays into memory, then into meaning—no character moralizes. The final gift (“in the act of seeking itself”) lands as earned paradox because the preceding cataloguing beats have shown the accrual of attention. Subtext in the hush—she fears noise/life—adds irony once she embraces story’s messy afterlife. No tidy thesis; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains lexicon of conservation science (“frequency resonator,” “sampling rods”) yet lets lyric compression (“crystalline silence”) coexist. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under discovery; no template cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Perceptual signature—soundless frost, slow clouds—remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with observation beats. Figurative language is sparse except where needed (“embers refusing to surrender”) and never muddles causality. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening and closing lines bookend with “luminous” / “luminous persistence,” a purposeful echo that recharges motif. Minor elevation in diction stays within archivist’s professional reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—magical vows archived as light slides—feels fresh, yet the core move (magic → story) is ancient; the novelty is the spectral cataloguing rigor. Risk is quiet: no villain, no chase, only attenuating glows; the piece bets everything on texture and wins. Specificity of the frequency-resonator device and emotional taxonomy (“vow of vengeance” vs “dying gods”) prevents generic fantasy drift.</comment>
