<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locksmith’s guarded interiority is rendered in concrete, character-specific images (“deliberately forgettable,” “rehearsed into ordinariness”), and the final smile shows a credible, earned release. Yet the long reflective block (≈30 %) is mostly summary; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in real time, so the emotional cost feels reported rather than lived under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the clay sentence re-prices the entire quest, the lock of hair acts as both key and conceptual cost, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Orientation is swift and the single transition (wall → fountain) is legible; causality is thin—star-guidance is poetic fiat—but the final image satisfies the cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Garden decay is filtered through the locksmith’s tool-biased gaze; temperature shift and crumbling wall serve as membrane and doorway, guiding her choice to kneel. The dry fountain basin with bones is a micro-setting that charges the final uncovering; environment constrains pace and posture throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the sealed idea—is signaled early and tightens when the chamber opens to a single sentence; the cost is the spent years and the relinquishing of the hair-key. Escalation is present but gentle, delivered via textural deepening rather than a reversible turn; pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the danger of locking away wonder is embodied first by the philosopher, finally by the locksmith’s release. The clay sentence reweights all prior material without moralizing; ambiguity remains—was the journey necessary?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinct (“tools…like sleeping birds,” “bruised-plum ribbon”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression in the star-guidance line is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences carry double duty (image + motion). One mixed metaphor cluster (“extinctions…candle” beside “cosmic possibility”) slightly blurs the peak beat, but clarity survives. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks; diction stays within locksmith’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “idea as literal lock” premise refreshes the familiar quest trope; the hair-key twist feels inevitable yet not obvious. Specific sensory detail (plum ribbon, dry fountain bones) grounds the concept. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but coherence remains intact.</comment>
