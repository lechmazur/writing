<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The poet’s shift from coin-for-verses hustler to intergenerational translator is believable because the music-box trigger is tactile and the granddaughter’s arrival forces a public surrender; interiority is vivid (“unraveled something in his chest”) but stops short of contradictory-in-scene tension, and the final vocation feels slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: handing over the box reweights his hoarded sounds into relational currency, cost felt in “gentle reluctance.” Accumulative lens holds—pattern of jarred sounds → pattern of remembered stories—though causality between Elara’s backstory and his insight is off-page inference, not dramatized beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dune-loft anchors by line 4; broken windows “framing the sea like abandoned paintings” filters through his artist-eye and constrains his later choice to leave the box. Salt-rot details return in the swollen wood that still yields music, charging the final image. Micro-setting (music box) meets 9+ test by altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give voice to silences—emerges late; escalation is textural (density of remembered clients) rather than causal narrowing. No on-page trade-off or price paid for the new vocation; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Coincidence (granddaughter arrives same day) supplies complication but also resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of translation-as-redemption emerges organically from jar-contents → inherited silences; final image of “sweetening silence” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the reluctant hand-off, but epiphanies lean toward abstract (“he understood what he had been gathering”) rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice stays consistent: clinking jars, “dawn’s earliest whistle,” salt-rot synesthesia. Syntax lengthens during revelation, then tightens into client-list coda, mirroring cognitive swell and release. No dialogue to test distancing; perceptual signature is stable throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical yet disciplined; only one paraphrase loop (“sounds…not sounds, but stories…not recordings, but relationships”). Metaphors stay coherent (wind-chime pockets, impatient-artist windows). High density without purple drift; final clause “most permanent currency of all” flirts with maxim but earns its place via prior economies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sound-jar currency and war-translator lineage intersect in a fresh way; risk is moderate—quiet lyric arc rather than twist. Music box as memory-fulcrum feels inevitable in hindsight, not derivative. Concept could travel, but coastal dune loft and sonic alchemy root it memorably.</comment>
