<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The warden’s solitary vigil is rendered with textured interiority—her nineteen autumns, the sextant’s weight, the desire to “discover what trees witness” all braid into a credible, occupation-specific psyche. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, however; the micro-choice to lift the sextant is the only visible decision, so the arc leans on contemplative endurance rather than tested flaw. Still, the voice-bound attention to sorrow’s mass gives her a memorable, particular loneliness that earns the quiet closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth literally unfolds under her moonlit gaze, reframing maintenance as compassionate unmaking; cost is felt in the phrase “heal by first understanding the full weight of what has been broken.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dream-mapped layer adds density until the pattern inverts. Orientation is immediate (tower, storm, night), transitions are clean, and the single shard satisfies Track A scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The stormlit tower, silver-lit labyrinth, and scent of “trees remembering confusion” are filtered through the warden’s professional gaze, anchoring every sense to her task. The sextant’s cracked lens and the mortar “where weather had carved rivers” act as micro-settings that constrain her method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or duplicates. Weather and moonlight causally enable the sextant’s repair and the unfolding vision, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping sorrow to keep the labyrinth livable—tightens once: the storm forces the parapet ascent that triggers the deconstruction. Agency is observational (she “witnesses” rather than fights), yet the unfolding itself is irreversible and narrows her future labor to “unmaking.” Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the safety of opaque walls. A second tightening beat is absent, capping escalation below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: broken instruments made whole, paths made transparent, sorrow made countable. The final image—labyrinth laid flat like fabric—reweights the opening metaphor of “half-remembered prayer” into a secular act of measured grief. No moral is stated; the reader is left to weigh the cost of clarity over mystery. The concept of quantified sorrow remains intellectually provocative rather than viscerally tested, keeping the score just under 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical, archaic cadence—“weather had carved rivers into the mortar,” “storm pressing its forehead against the tower’s windows”—that feels native to a lifelong warden. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then compresses for the pin-drop moment, mirroring her shift from custodian to seer. No head-hopping or register drift; every metaphor is POV-bound. The voice achieves rare singularity without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress, propelling the ascent and the subsequent unmaking. Figurative language is dense yet patterned—moonlight as solvent, sorrow as sand—teaching its own logic early and paying off in the final image. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. A single near-cliché (“half-remembered prayer”) is forgiven for its immediate contextual twist.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The conceit—labyrinth that rearranges by dreamed sorrow, mapped with a cracked sextant that heals in moonlight—feels fresh yet inevitable, growing from mythic roots into a private cosmology. Risk lies in the quiet, observant arc, but the payoff reconfigures the caretaker’s vocation into something paradoxically restorative. No derivative templates or familiar twist beats. Specificity of “seven hundred years” and “nineteen autumns” grounds the fantastical in lived time.</comment>
