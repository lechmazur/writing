<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s synesthetic engineering motive is vivid, but the David-memory block is recounted more than dramatized; no micro-choice in-scene shows trust fracturing, so the interior contradiction is told, not embodied under pressure. The final quiet smile is credible renunciation yet reads lightly costed because the forge’s supernatural logic externalizes the labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the device reframes trust-loss as audible silence, reweighting her world-rule with undeniable cost—"what exactly are we hearing when we hear the end of something?" The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds; aurora/greenhouse density tightens to a charged poise without causal reversals, satisfying short-form escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Micro-settings—resonator on temple, forge flames licking prototypes—constrain every beat; the greenhouse’s apple-roots-through-hulls image reappears in the final line, recharging the marvel tone. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5; only the silted ship names remain abstract, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of vanished trust—is signaled early; pressure deepens as each prototype distills absence into metal, foreclosing simpler amplification goals. The cost is conceptual but legible: she can now hear love’s dissolution, an irreversible perceptual narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of acoustics—silence as artifact, not void—without abstract thesis. The aurora’s final color-sound of "someone beginning to speak a word they had forgotten" offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: colors become sounds, humidity becomes audible “green creak,” forge burns “color of things unsaid.” Syntax stays controlled, lyric, and character-bound; no head-hopping; patterned elision (“pages tearing slowly”) is taught early and repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long vowel-laden clauses to clipped fragments under aurora shift; information density high—one sentence often marries sensory cue, backstory shard, and tool action. Two mixed metaphors (“fossilized crown,” “echoing orchard”) verge on ornament but occur outside peak beat; no loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Synesthetic underwater greenhouse with emotion-forging smithy is fresh synthesis; the “collecting absences” method turns standard grief-tech premise into ontological inversion. Risk-taking (surreal marine orchard) pays off by charging final image without obscuring clarity.</comment>
