<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Interiority is rich and specific—“absence that felt like a word stuck on the tip of her tongue,” “stone that had learned to breathe”—yet the only micro-choice is the final leaving of the eyes; earlier beats are contemplative, not causal. No contradiction is dramatized in scene; the stance tilts only through acceptance-summary rather than enacted renunciation with visible cost. Because the closure is conceptual, the earned cost is mildly attenuated—still credible, but not scalding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of looking, counting, fitting fragments intensifies toward the final “dovetailed with it.” Orientation is complete by line 3; transitions not required in single-scene design. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—eyes left as offering reweight ambiguous loss into lived pattern; cost is legible in “she rose, her knees aching.” Persistent constraint (loss unnamed) shapes every beat; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cavern orchard, mosaic stepping stone, and glass eyes each constrain movement and metaphorical reading; the chipped tiles literally guide her path and become the final altar. Sensory detail is selective—phosphorescent glow, cold stone against knees—filtered through her taxidermist-trained gaze. Final image of stalactites “indifferent and constant” mirrors her internal acceptance, charging the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the unnamed connection—tightens once: from attempted measurement to acceptance of ambiguity. Escalation is textural: each sentence accretes pattern until the final leaving forecloses solution-seeking. Cost is present (glass eyes relinquished, knees ache), but pressure plateaus rather than spikes; no live option is visibly closed off beyond the intellectual stance shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “mathematics of emotion” reframed from equation to mosaic pattern—grief as geometry of broken tiles that fit. Subtext lives in the eyes that once sought animal death-visions now repurposed to see human absence. Final image refuses moral, offering instead “strange hope” charged by prior particulars; no tidy thesis stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person tightly anchored in conjurer’s perceptual lens: “she thought again,” “she had been told.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath of cavern; diction stays within her esoteric lexicon—“stalactites,” “dovetailed,” “phosphorescent”—without register drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; rhythm modulates across paragraph breaks to mimic drip and step.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative density is high but patterned—water-through-stone, mosaic, moonlight—each image returns to reinforce closure. “Stone that had learned to breathe” risks mixed metaphor yet reads as character-specific compression; does not obscure causality. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge motifs with efficient image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fusion of taxidermist glass eyes with cavern orchard is fresh; “ambiguous loss” as un-nameable absence rather than death avoids cliché. Conceptual re-pricing of grief as mosaic pattern feels inevitable after textual set-up. Risk in lyrical accumulation pays off in final image without gimmickry; speculative elements stay subordinate to emotional logic.</comment>
