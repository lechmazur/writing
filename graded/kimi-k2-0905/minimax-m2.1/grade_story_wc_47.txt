<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The interior life is textured and body-attuned (“amber warm against my heart”), yet the arc is overwhelmingly reflective—no on-page choices test her stance after arrival. Confusion/betrayal are named rather than dramatized; we watch her feel, not act. The final “simply stay” lands as an earned renunciation, but because the story withholds any second character or live dilemma in-scene, motivation stays abstract and mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moss/water patterns gradually reweight the母女 stakes until the closing Charged Poise (“learning that sometimes the most quietly proactive thing… is simply stay”). Orientation is clean by line 3; causality is not the engine, yet the final crystallization is legible and carries felt cost. The single soft spot: the midpoint hospital flashback is a 100-word reflective block with no present-tense pivot—just enough to keep this out of high-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Data-center-turned-ruin is viscerally tactile: rusting racks, dripping ceiling, puddle mirrors. Every descriptor is filtered through the narrator’s bias toward reclamation/forgiveness; no tech jargon for its own sake. The setting supplies the central metaphor (nature rewrites hard surfaces) and directly feeds the final image—meets the 9+ gate for environment constraining meaning. Minor hedge: no single tool/object forces a tactical choice, so capped just below top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to position herself vis-à-vis her mother’s viral confession—crystallizes early, but pressure stays internal and static. No second on-page character or deadline narrows her real-time options; the risk remains emotional/abstract. The “tightening” is a shift in metaphor density, not a choice with forfeiture; hence mid-band. Needed: one live micro-choice here (answer the phone? leave the pendant?) to make cost visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of reclamation imagery—moss over metal, pendant passed down, confession surfacing—rather than any thesis line. The final CR reweights “quietly proactive” to mean presence itself, offering resonant ambiguity. No moralising, no tidy forgiveness; complexity sustained. Just short of 9.0 because the middle third leans on repeated abstract nouns (“grief,” “shame”) rather than new concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a hushed, lyrical cadence that mirrors the “honeyed hush”; perceptual signature is consistent (“I walk the overgrown corridors in my quiet way”). Syntax glides between short Anglo-Saxon monosyllables and the occasional Latinate bloom without register clash. Compression is purposeful—no head-hopping, no scaffold. Micro-hedge: several “I told / I watch / I sit” template stems cluster; keeps this just below the 9.0 floor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with the melt-drip cadence; clauses vary, no algorithmic repetition. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“each droplet tracing a slow, deliberate path”). High density: one line often performs scene-setting + interiority + symbolic charge. A few near-paraphrase loops (“quietly proactive… quietly proffers… simply stay”) prevent a clean 9; still, no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Abandoned data-centre as moss sanctuary is fresh; the viral-confession angle keeps the social stakes current. The synthesis of cyber-ruin and generational trauma healing feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist—but coherence is high. Doesn’t reach 8.5 because the emotional arc (watch/witness/stay) is an established quiet-epiphany template rather than a radical reconfiguration.</comment>
