<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s embodied patience and phototropic trait feel lived-in; the lantern-glass test of “gentle hands” is a clean micro-choice. Interior contradiction is light—no moment where gentleness risks self-injury or failure—so the arc rides texture more than wrench. Still, her final resolve to carry the oasis frequency home is credibly foreshadowed and costs her the certainty that her own world will listen. A hair deeper flaw-exposure would push 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each imagistic layer (kiln, glaze, beekeeper gentleness, lantern thrum) adds density until the final Charged Poise reweights “sharp gentleness” as cutting. Orientation clean by 120 w. Closure lands with conceptual cost—she now shoulders the oasis frequency, a living constraint. One minor causality gap: how she “knew” the right moment remains intuitive, but the pattern teaches mystic pacing early enough to excuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Desert, well, lantern glass, and potter’s hands all double as micro-settings that guide grip, breath, and final decision. Sensory triangulation (smoke like porcelain, honeyed vibration) stays POV-bound and purposeful. Object-state tracking perfect: glass clouded → thrumming → charged talisman. Environment never stalls momentum; each descriptor tightens the frequency metaphor. Could edge 9 if the smoke-clock had altered her footing or kiln timing outright.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—“understand why some places resist change”—is signaled early; tension deepens through pattern accrual rather than reversal. No external antagonist; pressure is the risk that the world will keep burning and her gentleness will prove insufficient. Middle tightening comes when glass vibration syncs heartbeat—she realizes the frequency can be carried, not merely witnessed. Cost is conceptual (lifelong burden of transmission) rather than visceral, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of “gentleness as blade” emerges via kiln, hive, and glass—never sermonized. Final image reframes sharpness as green glaze inside her, a non-literal answer that reweights every prior texture. Ambiguity remains: will the kiln world accept the frequency? Counter-readings (pacifism vs. complicity) are plausible and invited. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in haptic memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual skin: sun-pattern metering, clay memory, vibration tasting of honey. Sentence rhythm lengthens and contracts like breath, mirroring potter patience without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction control—“smoke…like a sigh that had lost its fire”—which remains fresh under pressure. Filter verbs used sparingly and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative strings dense yet purposeful—kiln, glaze, honey, porcelain—because they teach the accrual pattern. One mixed metaphor blink: “sharp enough to cut through any timeline” momentarily conflates blade and frequency, but recovers in the same breath. Line clarity never occludes causality; final image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Fusion of apiculture, pottery, and quantum echo is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. “Phototropic to kindness” reframes botanical trope into human neuro-tropism. Risk taken with quiet, accumulative structure pays off in Charged Poise. Slight softness because oasis survival mechanism stays metaphoric rather than mechanized, keeping concept shy of 8.8+.</comment>
