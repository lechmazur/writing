<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The oracle’s interior contradiction—urgency to map darkness vs. acceptance of silence—drives every micro-choice; her trembling hands, charcoal lift, and final smile embody a lifetime of obsession with cost paid in death. No second character on stage, so status crucible N/A; the lone POV sustains pressure through embodied stillness. The renunciation of speech for silence is earned across the text and forecloses any future testimony, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (flaking gold, last star, storm pause) tightens the stake of “map the night” until the charcoal stroke becomes the decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the booklet closed, darkness arriving, oracle dead—with undeniable conceptual cost: the world must now inhabit her silence. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“highest parapet of the ridge fort”); no ambiguity or teleportation; pattern of silence taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fort’s stone parapet, flaking booklet, and last star function as micro-setting that literally constrains the oracle’s final act: she can draw only while the storm pauses and starlight lingers. Sensory triage—wind taste, gold grit, marble hush—narrows to the charcoal’s drag across the page, charging the final image. Environment and tool are inseparable from the closure beat; removal would collapse the map’s creation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“draw the map before total darkness”—is signaled in para 1 and tightens once: storm pause gives the single window to charcoal the final page. No external antagonist; pressure is situational/time-bound; the deepening is the star’s flicker that forces the last stroke. Cost is her life, paid off-stage in the marbled hush, legible under Accumulative lens. Could reach 9+ if the price had bitten during the act rather than after.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via recurring silence: from pebble-shore lessons to charcoal marks, the story argues that knowledge survives by withholding, not telling. The final reweighting—darkness as habitable shore—lands without moralizing, encoded in the image of closed booklet and fading star. No thematic echo or platitudes; ambiguity (will anyone understand the map?) is purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-up sustains a consistent archaic, tidal cadence; diction (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) is oracle-colored, not author-intrusive. Compression (“she had walked… carrying only…”) is taught early and paid off in the final hush. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact; psychic distance narrows from panoramic ridge to the grit of gold leaf under fingernail, mirroring her focus.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable; figurative language is selective and pattern-unified (stone, storm, star, silence) without crowding any single beat. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, fragments in the storm pause, supporting pressure. Opening and final lines act as echo-shells (“pebble-shore” / “pebble shores”), creating circular resonance without gimmick.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired “last star” trope and re-codes it as tactile cartography of absence; the oracle’s method—summarizing silence via stone lore—feels culturally specific, not generic fantasy. The booklet-as-map-of-darkness twist is foreshadowed by constellation diagrams that no longer exist, making the final stroke inevitable yet fresh. Risk in lyrical stasis pays off: the story dares to climax in stillness and succeeds.</comment>
