<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied (“held against her chest like something precious and fragile,” “bowl … carried … through the refugee camps”). Motivation—find beauty in the unfinished—drives every beat and crystallizes in the charged final image with bowl pressed to ribs; cost (raw grief endured) is palpable on the page. No contradictory impulses are dramatized at once, so 9-strap is not quite met, but the arc is credible and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chronic hush is not defeated yet the reader feels a re-tuned breath between final note and silence; bowl’s warmth from sun+music is visible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—bowl vibrates therefore she knows something answered; she walks out carrying its weight. No set-up breaks, orientation clear by 60 words; lens held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shipwreck acoustics, ash-clouded greenhouse glass, and moss-covered concrete are filtered through Marina’s musician ear; each detail is selective and purposeful, guiding her choice to play. The bowl’s metallic memory constrains the moment of vibration, directly charging the closure image. One sentence drifts to overview (“the climate swallowed the coastline”) but does not obscure spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking the chronic hush—tightens once when first note returns altered from hull; the final cadence forecloses silence without repairing ruin, price paid in raw sound scraped from grief. Agency is continuous bow-pressure; no coincidence resolves. Could wish for one earlier material loss to sharpen trade-offs, yet cost is legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme—beauty inseparable from damage—emerges through orchard ash, cracked glass, and bowl’s inherited stories; final image refuses to moralize, letting warmth in brass reweight devastation. No echo-line states the thesis; silence itself functions as resonant subtext. Particulars accumulate into unavoidable emotional after-effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Marina’s sensory field; idiom (“echo-harbor violinist,” “stubborn beauty”) feels musician-specific, not borrowed. Syntax lengthens with bow strokes and contracts at peak silence; no POV leakage. Clean conventional mechanics except one purposeful fragment (“Nothing answered her.”) that teaches the chronic hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing: controlled caesuras, clause length variance, no scaffold loops; figurative language is sparse and coherent (“each drop a small bell struck”). High density per sentence, e.g., “skeleton of iron and stubbornness” carries setting+character+metaphor. Punctuation and sequence immaculate; no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Violinist reviving sound ecology in a post-fire shipwreck-orchard is fresh; bowl-as-archive-of-stories evolves into resonance engine, avoiding sentimental MacGuffin. Integration of climate-collapse, refugee heirloom and acoustic haunting feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric stillness paid off by earned hush-interruption.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Every story beat relies on Marina’s echo-harbor perception—she chooses bow pressure to probe hush, reads altered echo as answer, and endures raw timbre as cost. Without that trait the climax fails; trait + choice charge the final image.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bowl seeded early, vibrates mid-piece, and warms in sun at closure; its lineage of refugee stories weights her decision and physically transmits resonance. Remove it and the symbolic-mechanical payoff collapses.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chronic hush is not scenery; it blocks acoustics, forces her to alter bowing, and the moment it falters supplies the story’s decisive sensory change. Tight causal loop throughout.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Acute hearing enables her to detect faint drip and the hush’s first crack; trait costs her effort to “reach from a well,” making final breath audible. Story depends on this sensitivity.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The verb “unbind” is literalized—she releases trapped resonance, letting bowl vibrate and hush fracture; final walk carries the unbound warmth. Action reframes stakes on page.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grandmother’s bonfire method taught early, shapes Marina’s wordless storytelling logic, and surfaces again when ash-warm bowl vibrates like coals. Tradition guides musical attempt; remove it and thematic spine snaps.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shipwreck walls create echo-chamber that returns altered note; greenhouse ruin supplies concrete platform; both force acoustic tactics and stage the final resonance. Setting actively participates.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>After-fire timing supplies urgency—no rain, no birdsong—but clock itself does not tighten beats; it contextualizes rather than pressures choices, landing mid-band.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation declared in paragraph 7 and tested against ruin; she persists despite raw grief, proving beauty can coexist with loss. Ending carries bowl as visible cost of that belief; remove motive and the act of playing is unmotivated.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spare diction carries lyric weight; tone moves from devastated hush to tentative breath without sentimental uplift, achieving “magnificent simplicity.” Final image crystallizes it; tonal control is indispensable.</comment>
