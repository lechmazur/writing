<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward performed melancholy (“wonder crept back into her bones”) rather than embodied contradiction. The climb itself supplies micro-choices, yet her decisive shift—accepting guardianship of the wounded sky—feels abrupt because no prior beat shows her resisting that responsibility; the cost is named but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the queen’s purpose is reborn under a sky that still bleeds, so the cost is the eternal stewardship she now carries. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the lyric repetitions of “bleeding starlight” tighten the pattern until the final image reweights her sovereignty. However, the story exceeds the 800-word ceiling (~890), a technical disqualification at this venue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto, ridge path, and firefly constellation are rendered through the queen’s fatigued gaze, each sensory layer filtering her waning majesty. The “lacy menace” metaphor threads environment to emotional stakes, and the bleeding starlight physically pools, constraining her final stance—she kneels inside the wound she must tend.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim purpose or remain hollow—gains pressure as the mountain’s wound mirrors her own. The tightening occurs when she realizes the summons is not threat but obligation; however, escalation is textural rather than causal, relying on image density rather than a visible option being foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of sovereignty redefined as custodianship of irreparable beauty emerges through the bleeding starlight motif; no character editorializes it. The final smile carries the cost of endless service, letting resonance accrue without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the queen’s exhaustion; diction (“old lace,” “copper and wonder”) is idiosyncratic to her courtly sensibility. Rhythm lengthens then compresses with altitude, and no filter verbs dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety is supple, with strategic fragments (“The climb grew steeper…”) that mimic breath thinning. Occasional metaphor crowding (“cape made of spiderwebs and threat”) slightly overdresses the moment but never obscures causality or dulls the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The wounded-sky cave reverses the traditional ascent-to-power trope: sovereignty is not claimed but surrendered to an injured cosmos. Fireflies as constellations reframes mundane summer sign into cosmic responsibility, a fresh inflection that feels inevitable once stated.</comment>
