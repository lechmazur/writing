<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured (“the creak… sounded like a greeting from a dying world”) and anchors Elara’s estrangement. The final readiness to turn the crank is credibly prepared by childhood memory and lawyerly necessity. Yet the decisive cost—accepting dynastic identity—remains more asserted than embodied; no bodily or external price is shown once the voice speaks, so the beat lands slightly soft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is lean and coherent: arrival → discovery → turn → ancestral voice. Closure is a conceptual re-pricing: bloodline “accident” becomes unavoidable inheritance. The cut-off ending prevents a full Decisive Change on the page, so the cost is heard but not yet paid in action, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sepia room, wisteria-choked terrace, and brass crank are filtered through Elara’s scholar-eye and supply tactile props for the final act. The gramophone constrains the only meaningful choice; its brass gleam guides her hand. Spatial tracking is clean; one sensory anchor per move keeps the scene taut.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single stake—reject or accept the Morrow legacy—tightens the instant the crank is grasped. Agency is present but solitary; no live opposition escalates risk after the lawyer trigger. The tightening is conceptual rather than physical, sufficient for the length but lacking a palpable price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of heredity as inescapable resonance emerges through sound imagery rather than exposition. Final image of “the veil between past and present grown thin as paper” invites re-reading without moralizing. Could sharpen ironic gap: Elara the rationalist undone by acoustic memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric third-person adheres tightly to Elara’s perceptual filter; clause rhythms lengthen under nostalgia, contract at the crank turn. No head-hop; metaphorical language stays within her literary lexicon. A few adjective stacks (“golden shadows… tapestry of gold and amber”) flirt with purple but serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from elegiac cadence to staccato click of the crank. Figurative density is high but patterned early, so it reads as conscious texture rather than spillover. No paraphrase loops; pronouns track cleanly. One mixed metaphor—“shadows like arms of ghosts reaching”—barely blurs clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Haunted-objects trope is refreshed by acoustic rather than visual haunting; standing-wave voice is a novel delivery device. Risk is moderate—quiet gothic in flash length—but execution is confident. The cut-off rather than twist ending keeps it from full inventiveness.</comment>
