<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—precision versus wonder—remains embodied and concrete; the memory cascade is felt, not declared. The renunciation of pure skepticism is earned through tactile contact with the tile and carries visible cost in the final palm-press. No stock phrasing or diagnostic labels mar the peak beat. The shift from observer to co-creator is credible and scaled to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tile reweights her scientific rule-set, undeniable cost in “taking and giving in equal measure.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each copied symbol layers density until the final dawn image crystallizes the new stance. Orientation is anchored by line 9; no ambiguity at closure. One transition (night→dawn) is legible and coherent under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tower-body-tool continuum constrains every move: open roof admits whale-song that bleeds into memory, stone tile literally channels ancestral data, her palm must press it to finish transcription. Salt wind and grid-cool stone are returned in the final image, now reweighted. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors her scientist’s gaze narrowing to tactile temperature. Environment is not backdrop; it is the memory machine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve intellectual integrity vs. risk absorption into alien memory choir—tightens with each copied symbol. One meaningful deepening: the chain of grandmothers’ faces forces her to decide whether to add her voice. Cost is visible: she permanently trades unemotional documentation for participatory inscription. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without assertion: knowledge as communal, iterative offering rather than solitary conquest. The unheard symphony image reconfigures prior whale-songs as polyphonic human memory, a non-literal answer to her initial doubt. No overt moralizing; resonance arises from the tile’s final glow. Complexity remains—she keeps skepticism, now coupled with wonder—resisting tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains precise, scientist’s diction: “instruments calibrated for precision,” “symbols arranged in patterns that seemed both chaotic and deliberate.” Rhythm accelerates during transcription, sentences shorten, then widen into lyrical final paragraph. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays rooted in her tool-mediated gaze. Filter verbs serve voice when framing data, never dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers tool, body, memory—“grid of smaller squares, each containing a symbol she did not recognize, arranged in patterns that seemed both chaotic and deliberate.” No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line breathes after propulsive build, satisfying ear test. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hard-science skeptic meets pre-digital memory technology etched in stone by whale-watchers. Memory-as-inscription through tactile grid is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken—quiet lyric closure rather than spectacle—pays off by reweighting entire premise. Specificity of “salt winds swept up from the bay where the whales passed each autumn” prevents template drift.</comment>
