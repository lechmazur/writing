<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gardener’s gentle competence is sketched through tactile handling of the case and tapestry, but no contradictory impulse presses him; the discovery feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from internal conflict. His “understanding then why he had found this place” is asserted, not dramatized, so the final stance costs him nothing we can see. At this length we don’t need a full arc, yet the beat demands at least one micro-choice that forecloses an option—here the path stays singular and frictionless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry reweights the gardener’s caretaking vocation with the sovereign’s plea for posthumous witness, and the cost is the burden of now carrying that secret. Causality is thin—no prior beat makes the gardener uniquely able or obliged to answer the question—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the descent, cobalt light, and unraveling border deepen mood until the revelation crystallizes. Orientation is clear by word 60; the single transition (climb down / climb up) is legible and framed as continuous scene shards.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Velveteen gloom, starlight aperture, and ivy-scented air give immediate sensory grip; the cobalt silo’s acoustics absorb sound and time, nicely guiding the hush needed for close attention to the tapestry. The cemetery ladders and weathered stones root us, while the silo acts as micro-setting that isolates the moral focus. Detail is selective—no catalog of epitaphs—yet the ladder left “long ago” is a loose prop (who left it? why still solid?) that slightly undercuts physical credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake is whether anyone will answer the sovereign’s dying question; pressure is atmospheric, not antagonistic, and tightens only through contemplative decoding. One meaningful deepening occurs when the border’s fraying is read as “memories slipping away,” turning passive observation into urgent transcription. Yet the protagonist faces no trade-off—no risk of being trapped, no opposition, no visible price—so escalation is modest and the closure, while resonant, is cost-free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—anonymous mercy outliving the merciful—emerges cleanly from the sovereign’s encoded plea and the gardener’s habitual tending of the forgotten. Subtext lives in the act of repairing frayed threads rather than proclaiming virtue. The final image avoids moralizing, letting the tucked case beneath the arm imply custodial succession. Ambiguity is present but narrow: we sense the weight without probing its future consequences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays snug to the gardener’s calm, horticultural perception: “tender care he applied to all things connected to the dead.” Syntax is unhurried, mirroring pruning hands; diction favors soft consonants and vegetal touch. No dialogue means voice must carry all distinction, and it does—until the elevated phrase “uncharted echoes of a long-dead ruler’s compassion” drifts toward abstract grandeur alien to the prior earthiness. Still, rhythm remains controlled and head-hopping is absent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean, with purposeful compression—six sentences cover descent, discovery, and first contact. Occasional ornamental clustering (“cobalt silo, a cylindrical chamber of blue-tinged stone”) repeats hue without fresh information. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory anchors are concrete. One paraphrase loop appears: “darkness of endings… darkness… instead like a threshold,” shaving precision. No artifact touches the final image, so momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The burial-ground-as-archive is familiar, yet the tapestry-as-time-capsule and starlit silo beneath graves feel freshly combined. The gardener’s vocation-specific literacy—reading decay like botany—offers a non-obvious hermeneutic that justifies his selection. Risk is quiet: no violent twist, just the inversion that rulers fear oblivion more than subjects do. Specificity of the chess-in-progress motif points to a lived culture rather than generic medievalism.</comment>
