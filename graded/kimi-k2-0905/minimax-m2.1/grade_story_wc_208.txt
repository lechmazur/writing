<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aria’s tactile relationship to wood and salt is vivid and specific; the lantern-slide reveal forces a credible re-prioritization of her life’s work. Interiority stays concrete (“each curve an invitation”) and the final renunciation—carving the single reaching arm—carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only a smooth ascent to insight, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural pattern is taught by word 50 and lands a charged poise: the slide layers historical images until Aria’s stance reconfigures. Each shard (GPS death → arch shelter → slide vision → studio renunciation) tightens the same stake—how to make meaning from wreckage. Closure beat—“each motion a prayer”—makes the conceptual cost undeniable; no orientation or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Storm, arch, and lantern slide operate as micro-settings that physically constrain choices: the arch blocks wind so she can study the slide; the slide’s light needs twilight gray to reveal. Sensory selection mirrors urgency—horizontal rain, turbine-hum—yet never crowds the lyric cadence. The driftwood arm in the final image directly charges the stone threshold, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“how to shape debris into lineage”—is signaled early and deepens through one intensification: the slide reveals she already belongs to a chain of makers. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but the narrowing feels irreversible: she must now carve as reply, not self-expression. Cost is legible in the single, monumental arm she begins, trading manageable sculptures for an unfinishable gesture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from sedimented images rather than assertion: lineage, salvage, conversation across time. The final image reweights earlier motifs—arch, hands, storm—into a non-literal answer: making is inheritance. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the unfinished arm. One near-platitude (“she was perpetually learning”) is embedded early enough to feel like character habit, not authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Aria’s perceptual filter—grain like braille, turbine-hum reverie—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax lengthens and contracts with storm pressure; diction stays within her artisan lexicon. No head-hop or register drift; the elision of GPS coordinates feels taught and paid off in her final compass-free walk home. Voice is unmistakable at line level.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “salt and current shaped every twisted branch” performs characterization, setting, and theme in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language clusters only in calmer beats. Final third remains clean—“each motion a prayer, each curve an invitation”—so 9-band stays intact. Occasional alliteration (“turbine-hum reverie”) is pattern-taught and modulated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lantern-slide-as-time-loom converts a familiar “artist finds ancestors” arc into something materially fresh: glass disc that needs storm-light to awaken. Driftwood lineage and GPS failure synthesize into a coastal myth that feels inevitable yet unwritten. Risk in lyric compression heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Could not swap arch, slide, or storm without collapsing the entire armature.</comment>
