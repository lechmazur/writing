<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-tuned compass is vivid: moon-phase mood, bronze anchor in pocket, reflexive “I’m coming to meet you.” Interiority stays concrete, but the lone on-page decision—walking out to co-navigate—feels slightly under-pressured; the woman’s tear-stained face does the emotional lifting. Still, the cost of re-entering others’ grief is palpable and inherited object/hand-touch continuity satisfies earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptor layer (dead beacon, moonlit marsh, bronze weight) tightens the emotional map until the final partnered stance reweights “navigation” as mutual bearing. Closure is Charged Poise—the two women poised at the tree-line, grief geography now shared—with felt cost implicit in Mara’s continuing vigil. Orientation anchors clear by 80 words; no因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Signal station, rusted ladder, gutted hydraulics, black-water marsh—each tactile detail couples to emotional stakes; the bronze censer foot serves as micro-setting that literally weighs Mara’s choices. Weather and moonlight affect visibility and mood without overwriting. Spatial track clean; no white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s compass vs. accumulating grief calls—tightens once: answering the midnight plea means perpetually re-inhabiting loss. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internalised obligation + lunar cycle. Cost visible as she “walked toward the woman’s coordinates,” reaffirming endless duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration as theme emerges through action, not lecture: choosing to go north into winter toward pain. Bronze heirloom, moon tides and dead beacon accrue into meditation on bearing another’s bereavement. Final image of two silhouettes avoids moralising; resonance lingers in shared darkness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Mara’s perceptual filter: diction of currents, cypress knees, patina. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical clauses under starlight, shorter beats at phone intrusion. No head-hop; dialogue fragment carries authentic static break. Voice distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, sensory verbs (“gutted and dark,” “twisted cypress”), minimal filter. One paraphrase loop—“geography of loss” repeated near end—slightly dulls finish; otherwise crisp, lucid, no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Grief-as-cartography trope refreshed by moon-phase navigator + midnight short-wave souls; reverse migration angle feels novel. Risk taken with stationary, almost plotless arc, but accrual design justifies it. Could swap names but tactile marsh and bronze anchor glue it to this piece.</comment>
