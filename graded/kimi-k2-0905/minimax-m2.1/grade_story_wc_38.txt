<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—weaponizing the silence forced on her—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to dance the cipher in the drained chamber crystallizes her arc. Motivation tightens elegantly: every thrown dot of the dice is a day survived and a promise kept, so the final step toward daylight feels earned, not gifted. The only minor slack: “lyrical code breaker” is asserted more than dramatized in middle beats. Still, the cost of her transformed voice—movement instead of speech—lands with felt weight at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repetition of water, dice, coded pages, and dance accrues until the drainage reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift—who, where, when clear by line 3; no penalty applied. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the dry floor and collected dice visibly re-price her years of captivity into agency. Cost is legible in the single line “collected her dice” — the tool of endurance now weaponized for the next fight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The submerged lab is not mere backdrop; buoyancy literally enables her dance-language and the slow drain provides the decisive environmental shift. Selective sensory filtering—rusted stalactites, spider-thread catching light—mirrors her narrowed yet luminous attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent as water level and body position change. The hangman’s dice act as micro-setting that constrains choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom through decoded self—signals early and tightens once: the moment water begins to drain, all prior accumulations (dice counts, cipher dances) foreclose surrender. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the drainage beat delivers a single decisive intensification that re-weights every prior sacrifice. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the exit is unlocked by her own embedded frequencies. Cost is visible in the drained chamber—eleven years gone, voice irretrievably relocated into muscle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: encryption as survival, silence as generative, body as text. The spider web’s return in the final sentence re-weights the early cell image into quiet triumph—she too has spun escape out of secret silk. No moral is declared; the resonance lies in the unsaid equivalence between code and choreography. Complexity holds: her victory is real yet partial—she leaves mutilated but linguistically re-armed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature—mathematical arcs, musical metaphors, tactile dice edges. Rhythm swells and contracts with underwater slowness, then shortens as water exits. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Occasional compressed phrases (“神经系统 humming”) remain legible because the pattern is taught early and paid off in the dance sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lines carry double duty—description advances decryption plot while crafting lyrical cadence. Metaphors stay coherent within liquid physics: dangling screens as “rusted stalactites” is precise. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she began to dance”) are justified by the need to mark the shift into wordless language. No mixed vehicles or scaffold repetition obscures the final image.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of voice-theft, underwater lab, and choreographed cipher feels inevitable yet fresh; no extant template combines these elements in this way. Risky lyric compression is taught early and never compromises clarity. The dice-as-calendar and dance-as-ALU are specific inventions that would collapse if swapped out. Final spider callback transforms a casual observation into thematic keystone without sentimental garnish.</comment>
