<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s “combative tenderness” is shown through concrete micro-moves—stepping backward to give space, pouring tea in silence—so motive stays embodied. The children’s terror-to-curiosity shift is dramatized in the boy’s un-stopped reach for the cup, a credible hinge of resilience. The only flaw is a slight over-articulation of the mentor philosophy (“exile is not a punishment”) that edges toward diagnostic label-speak, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the swing outside waits, the children remain in over-large chairs, and Maren’s nod acknowledges a battle won at visible emotional cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—tea-leaf geometry and backward steps pattern toward the final crystallization. Orientation is anchored by word ~80; no teleporting props. A hairline slip: the phrase “reversible exile” is named rather than dramatized as a live option, keeping it just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library is sketched through haptic cues—dust planets, worn oak, a captured shadow on glass—each object enlisted to teach the reversal motif. Spatial choreography is clean: Maren steps backward, children climb too-big chairs, tea pot remains centered. The swing outside doubles as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Light and leaf work as tactile tools, never backdrop-only.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mentor resilience in broken children—is signaled early and tightens through the girl’s chin-lift/boy’s shrink dynamic. One meaningful deepening: the boy reaches for tea without protection, foreclosing the rejection option. Cost is felt—Maren’s backward step and chest-clench—but not yet externalized as persistent constraint, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges through the glassed shadow and backward-walk motif rather than thesis statement. The final image of an empty swing waiting for passengers reweights earlier exile as potential return, achieving conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and poured tea; no abstract manifesto. Minor echo of “exile is relocation” edges toward overt statement, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Maren’s perceptual filter—dust motes as slow planets, silver ring casting dancing shadows. Syntax modulates from long suspended clauses to fragment-like tea commands, mirroring her retreat-and-engage stance. No head-hop; children’s interiority inferred only through gesture. Voice sustains lyric compression without purple drift, the swing’s creak a rhythmic refrain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sparing metaphor density—every image (glass-pressed leaf as 标本) is re-used to teach reversal. Sentence rhythms lengthen during reflection, tighten during pour/reach beat, propelling momentum. Zero paraphrase loops; “afternoon” recurs only as temporal anchor, not filler. One near-mixed metaphor: “dark leaf of stillness” reads fine under light logic, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mentor-trauma trope is refreshed by the shard-mirror archivist occupation and tea-leaf geometry as spatial combat training. Reversible exile concept literalized in backward walking and shadow-trapping offers a fresh structural hinge. Risk-taking stays coherent; no gimmickry. Could dock for familiar “broken children saved by sage” arc, but specificity of method rescues freshness.</comment>
