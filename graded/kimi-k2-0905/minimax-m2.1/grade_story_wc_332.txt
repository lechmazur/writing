<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s solitude and quiet perseverance are rendered through tactile caretaking of books and pigment; her interior contradiction—yearning for absence yet restoring presence—surfaces only in the final photograph, so the arc feels more observed than dramatized until the last beat. The micro-choice to hang the self-portrait beside her desk crystallizes her acceptance, but earlier beats lack visible trade-offs that would raise the cost sooner. Still, her embodied attention to weather-warped pages keeps her from abstraction and earns the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each donated box and sunrise layer thickens the library’s haunted archive until the 1832 photograph reframes Mira’s own longing, delivering a Charged Poise that reweights every prior act of salvage. Causality is loose—palette rules are intuited rather than tested under opposition—yet the final image of the stilled dream hanging in morning light carries undeniable conceptual cost: she now tends her own captured absence. One transition (ferry schedule to dawn) is legible; orientation anchors within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The whispering stone corridors and salt-stained pages function as micro-setting: wind-borne voices dictate when Mira can safely paint, and the sunrise angle through salt-bleached panes literally enables the vitalizing act. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and touch over visual cataloguing, keeping description purposeful. The palette’s light-absorbing wells act as portable setting-as-constraint, charging the final image when hung beside the desk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—granting lost dreams a momentary body—surfaces early and tightens when the child’s photograph reveals joy “leaked away,” forcing Mira to confront her own unspoken absence. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each restored image adds weight until the 1832 portrait turns the tool inward. No external antagonist or reversal, yet the cost is felt when her lifelong ache is pinned to the wall, foreclosing endless searching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of preservation: to still a dream is to end its motion, to archive longing is to inhabit it. The watercolor palette literalizes this tension—color that drinks light—and the final hanging photograph offers a wordless conceptual repricing: Mira now works beneath her own captured incompleteness. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the quiet click of sunrise on glass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: wind is “carried voices,” pigment “bleeds,” memories “shift” like cargo in swell. Syntax lengthens during discovery, then compresses into single luminous clause at climax, mirroring the act of stilling. No dialogue, so voice carries full load; diction remains within a self-taught restorer’s lexicon without drifting into catalogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence; only one paraphrase loop (“longing… longing”) appears and serves as intentional echo. Metaphors stay coherent—light as paint, dreams as cargo—and never stall forward motion. Proofing is clean; pronouns track without drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The light-eating watercolor palette revivifying photographs via sunrise is a fresh synthesis of archival magic and coastal gothic, anchored in a believable shipping-archive milieu. Risk lies in the quiet accumulative structure rather than pyrotechnics; the payoff justifies the gamble by turning the tool on the archivist herself. No close echoes of familiar scenes; specificity of salt-stuck pages and ferry-less nights feels idiosyncratic rather than borrowed.</comment>
