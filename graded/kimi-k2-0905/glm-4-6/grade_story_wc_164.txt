<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aelia’s interiority is concrete—she sighs, murmurs, presses hands to glass—but the emotional contradiction promised by “cheerful gloom” is stated, not dramatized. The crater-glass work shows micro-choices, yet the missing-path obsession is told repeatedly rather than tested in scene. The final “bittersweet sensation” is generic payoff for three cycles of alleged obsession; no new flaw or cost is exposed. Still, her perceptual filter (rainbow light, seed-stars) stays consistent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each seed-layer adds density until the empty circles reweight the premise. Orientation is clean—geode cave, morning light, bird migration—by word 50. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the emptied emotions reveal deliberate erasure, not natural decay, shifting the story’s rule-set. The cost is conceptual rather than personal; Aelia’s stance crystallizes but she pays no new, visible price on this day.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Geode cave, crater glass, and seed-stars are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Aelia’s shifting perceptual palette. Light, color, and sound are filtered through her professional priorities; no tourist catalog. The micro-setting (crater glass as warm palm-sized tool) constrains every analytical move and charges the final empty-circle image. Spatial choreography remains stable; bodies and objects track cleanly across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightened when empty seeds appear. Escalation is accumulative: each colored bloom adds evidence, but the empty circles deliver the decisive reframe. Agency is observational rather than active; Aelia’s conjecture is sparked by external seed-drop, not a choice that risks loss. Conceptual cost is felt, but no live option is foreclosed for her today.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as harvestable resource, erasure as intentional theft. The empty-circle image reweights earlier colors without moralizing. Subtext is carried by silence—no colors, no whispers—rather than exposition. Final line’s “preserve what others couldn’t remember they had lost” offers resonant reconfiguration, though the insight is lightly earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is saturated with color and light fracture; diction stays within Aelia’s professional lexicon. Rhythm modulates from languid (“light splintering into rainbows”) to staccato as seeds drop. Filter verbs (“she could hear”) are minimal and voice-motivated. No dialogue to test naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned (color-emotion equations) and pays off in the empty circles. No synonym churn or template cadence. Sentence variety supports the breath-and-burst rhythm of seed-fall. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-illuminate the motif. Minor scaffold: “cheerful gloom” is repeated without new inflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sea-foam recollectionist who harvests bird-borne emotional seeds is a fresh synthesis; crater glass as transliterator feels inevitable, not gimmick. Conceptual risk—memory as agriculture, erasure as harvest—commits fully and pays off in the empty-circle reframe. Specificity of iridescent geode workspace anchors the fantastical premise. Could edge higher if Aelia’s personal stake had bled into the conceptual twist.</comment>
