<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tutor’s contradictory impulses—protective secrecy vs. the ache to be heard—are alive in every micro-gesture around the seal; Elias’s shift from interrogator to co-listener is credible because his skepticism is physically staged (leaning forward, stepping back). The final shared listening moment earns its cost: the lie forecloses her solitary claim to the buildings, yet the renunciation is felt in the cooling seal and the dawn-lit skyline. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the “patiently nimble” trait is told once, never tested under pressure, keeping this just shy of 8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the seal’s fading warmth crystallizes the new shared pact, cost paid in the loss of her monopoly on the buildings’ voices. Causal chain holds: the lie → weekly teas → Elias’s confrontation → co-listening, each because/therefore legible. The mid-text teleport from rooftop to study is flagged by the characters themselves, satisfies the mosaic exception, and the meteor shower’s final fade is reweighted, not abandoned. One minor loop—“the seal seemed warmer than usual” / “the seal glowed”—keeps this under 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is more than postcard: the jasmine’s night-bloom scent narrows attention to the seal, the meteor streaks mirror the wax-silver griffin, and the bricks’ whisper is physically accessed via the seal’s pressure. Micro-setting wins: the seal itself functions as the story’s “room,” its grooves and warmth guiding the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean—spectacles, pastry plate, meteor angles tracked. Only the indoor walls’ sudden softness drifts toward overt symbolism, preventing 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exclusive access to the buildings’ language—is signaled early and tightened when Elias demands the truth, forcing her to forfeit monopoly for companionship. Cost is visible: the seal cools, the whispering ebbs into shared custody. Agency is hers: she lifts the seal toward him, knowingly splitting power. Situational lens holds; coincidence (meteor timing) complicates rather than resolves. The deepening is single but decisive; a second reversal would overstuff 750 words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: agreed-upon lies as doorway, not sin; truth as shared listening rather than exposure. The pastries, sugar excuse, and griffin seal recur with reweighted meaning at the end. Subtext operates in silence—Elias’s outstretched palm, the tutor’s exhale—never explained. The final “never about the sugar” crystallizes the conceptual reprice: lies were the real invitation. Avoids tidy moral; the building’s sigh endorses being heard, not judged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><answer>Voice is lush yet controlled: long breathy sentences for meteor awe, staccato admissions under interrogation. Diction stays within an antiquarian tutor’s ken—”keystones,” “deeds,” “aged parchment”—without varnish overload. Dialogue carries distinct idiom: Elias’s architect precision (“Tell me about the lies”) vs. her evasive pedagogic courtesy. Perceptual signature is sharp: she notices mortar cracks before star trails, hears brick breath before human speech. One register slip—“something felt different” leans conversational—caps the score just below 8.8.</answer>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances image or pressure; no scaffold or synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and coherent—meteor streaks as sealing wax, bricks softening like old men—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm mirrors pulse of disclosure: longer clauses for star-drifts, clipped fragments when seal flares. Opening line anchors voice and object; final line recharges sugar motif with crisp release. One near-simultaneity—“she smiled, though her heart raced”—drops this from 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses dead-language scholarship with psychometric architecture, a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The griffin seal as linguistic stethoscope is a specific, irreplaceable instrument, not generic magic key. Risky mid-text teleport succeeds because pattern is taught early (“the room—they were in her study now”) and closure still lands under situational lens. Transformation test passes: swap sugar for coffee or tutor for cartographer and the emotional arc collapses. The rooftop-to-study leap and meteor-to-seal light echo show bold structural mirroring without gimmickry.</comment>
