<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid—dye-stained hands, heart-beat sync with the wing—yet the “donation” question is answered too smoothly; no lingering contradiction or cost is embodied in the final quiet beat, so renunciation feels pre-sorted rather than wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the morpho flash re-weights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens, turning sun-trail pattern into a life-purpose prism; cost is felt in the shift from investigative hunger to devotional stillness, no causal gaps, and orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating tea-house, crystal prism, dye vats, and valley-mist are filtered through Elian’s artisan eye; each object constrains gesture (sunbeam tracking on floorboards) and charges the final image—no postcard filler, every detail bends light or attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why stories stick—tightens once via the noon-to-dusk cadence that forces the decisive alignment; escalation is accumulative (density of sun-trail marks) rather than causal reversal, but the final refraction reweights options with visible price: curiosity yields to stewardship, satisfying lens demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: attention itself is the magnet; the wing’s spectral detonation re-prices “iridescent caution” from warning to invitation, leaving resonant ambiguity—no moral spoon-feeding, only the after-image of sky-blue responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance; syntax carries dye-master precision—verbs like “plunged,” “detonated,” “refracted”—without purple drift; no head-hop, psychic distance tightens in the flash-moment, then widens into earned calm, rhythm echoing heartbeat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; only one scaffold loop (“sun trails… sun trails” across adjacent clauses) and a single mixed metaphor (“quietly explosive” used twice) but neither touches the closure beat; high information ratio, strong verbs, no filter-verb clot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar donor-heart premise is transmuted through artisanal optics and accumulative light-tracking; the prism-teapot / morpho payoff feels inevitable yet un-stolen, giving a fresh inflection to “ordinary as beacon” without gimmickry.</comment>
