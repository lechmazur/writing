<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“bravely conflicted mind,” “heart raced,” “fingers trembled”—but stays at the level of performed emotion; we never see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, only alternating labels. Her motive is clear (provoke the buried conversation) yet the cost is asserted rather than embodied: the only tangible price is off-stage “sirens” and “hunt,” not a choice she renounces on the page. Micro-choices are missing between slipping the letter into the terminal and fleeing; the moment of irreversible agency is summarized, not dramatized, so the change feels declared, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—because she uploads the letter, the network awakens and the council will fall—but the decisive beat is compressed into a single sentence of summary (“the letter’s contents began to echo…”), blunting the visible cost. Orientation is immediate and clean: who/where/when locked by line 20. Closure lands as a CR (contraband truths reprice the world’s rule-set), yet the price is future-tense (“the council would hunt her”) rather than a constraint already shaping her tactics or body in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The library-as-tomb is evocatively anchored—“frost-coated shelves looming like tombstones,” “dim blue emergency lighting”—and the snowstorm outside keeps tangible pressure on escape routes. Micro-setting works: the crinkling letter melts a circle of sweat, concretely linking object, body, and stakes. Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly from shelves to terminal to alley. The snow never evolves past picturesque backdrop, but it successfully charges the final shrine image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. frozen peace—signals early and tightens once: uploading the letter forecloses retreat. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens, but escalation is front-loaded; after the terminal flickers, stakes are reiterated in summary rather than intensified through new obstacles or forfeits. Cost is announced (“world crumbling like paper”) rather than felt on-page, so the tightening lacks a visible price that alters her next move.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of suppressed truth vs. curated silence emerges organically through the letter’s viral pulse and Elara’s smile; no authorial thesis is stated. Subtext operates in the letter’s absence—we never read its words, only its contagious effect—creating dramatic irony between reader awe and council horror. Final image of the library as “shrine to her courage” reweights the tomb motif without moralizing. Minor abstraction in “fires burned” keeps it from deeper resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited voice is stable; perceptual signature strong—“snow like a ghost,” “shelves looming like tombstones”—with rhythmic, lightly lyric cadence that escalates toward the escape. No dialogue to test, but internal diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory hierarchy reflects archivist priorities (silence, networks, texts). Occasional template cadence (“The… The…”) softens propulsion but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied, but repetitive anaphora (“The snow… The council… The echoing library…”) in the final third creates a detectable template cadence that dulls momentum. Mixed metaphors are absent; density is high. Minor scaffold: “contraband truths” is repeated four times in 70 words, a synonym churn that pads rather than deepens. Closure image itself is clean and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen-archive rebellion is familiar, but the fusion of cryogenic librarian + viral letter + snowed-under necropolis feels fresh and specific. The “dormant networks” mechanic repurposes server-coolant imagery into a literal ice tomb, transforming trope into lived world logic. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation over plot beats; the pattern is taught early and pays off in the shrine reprise. Not transformative, yet memorably idiosyncratic.</comment>
