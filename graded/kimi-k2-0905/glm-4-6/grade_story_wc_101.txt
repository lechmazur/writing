<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet authority and Lena’s guarded curiosity are sketched through economical gesture and choice, but interior contradiction is reported rather than enacted in scene; the final hand-off to Lena reads as summary, muting the cost of leadership passed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s silence becomes Charged Poise—belonging re-priced without fanfare. Causal chain is intact yet compressed; the “spring in elders’ steps” is told, not shown, blunting the decisive change’s visibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Ridge, cabin, arbor, and bell form a tight micro-setting whose clay-red pillars and dull-silver chime guide stealth and acoustics; terra-cotta arbor is re-imaged as sentinel hub, charging the final quiet. Sensory range is narrow—mostly sight and sound—but selective detail keeps spatial choreography clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore communal dignity via anonymous care—tightens when youths volunteer after witnessing elders’ renewed gait; escalation is accumulative, not causal, and the cost (risk of caught night runs) stays abstract, limiting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet reciprocity emerges through image pattern (bell, baskets, shadow-steps) rather than statement; final silence reweights the opening “amplified quiet” without moralizing. Subtext in Lena’s lingering outside doors invites reader to feel the unspoken gratitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Elias then Lena; perceptual signature favors hush and texture—“sound that settled into bones.” Rhythm modulates from longer reflective cadences to clipped night-run verbs; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and propulsive; occasional soft fillers—“practiced economy born of scarcity”—slow the beat. No loops or mixed metaphors; one paraphrase loop on “quiet threads of trust”/“amplified quiet” costs nuance but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “sanctions-blighted village” frame is refreshed by anonymous gift economy and sonic signaling; bell-as-belonging device feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is modest—no structural experiment—but specificity of terra-cotta arbor and generational suspicion lifts it above template.</comment>
