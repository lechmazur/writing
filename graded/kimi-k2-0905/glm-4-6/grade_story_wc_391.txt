<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “captured-star” motivation is vivid, but her interiority drifts into diagnostic label-speak (“impatience manifested in human societies”). The embodied tension is present yet never crystallizes into a decisive micro-choice under pressure; the final stance is more observed than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the wave of patience reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. Causality is soft—moon-angle mechanics are asserted, not shown to trigger the shift—so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern holds but the causal trigger is weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constrain every move; tools (portable instruments, ice underfoot) function as micro-setting. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s horizon-mapping eye. The viaduct’s metallic after-rain gleam returns to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seed patience into society—remains abstract; on-page pressure is the lonely vigil itself, not a tightening trade-off. The “patient revolution” deepens conceptually but does not foreclose a live option for Elara; cost is off-loaded to unseen citizens, not dramatized in her beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the viaduct’s quiet surge rather than declaration. The final image of dawn over a horizon that “now reveals what patient hands could gradually make” offers a resonant non-literal answer. One thematic echo—“a patient revolution cannot be rushed”—is tolerated because it is embedded in ritual whisper, not final sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: stone walls that “absorb and radiate pale winter light” is mapper-specific noticing. Syntax lengthens under calm, compresses at the ice approach, supporting restrained wildness. No head-hopping; diction stays within her poetic-technical lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, but occasional modifier stacks (“softly purposeful movements,” “restrained wildness”) edge toward purple. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Metaphors are coherent though sometimes abstract; closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomantic moon-casting as civic neuro-modulation. Viaduct-as-consciousness-conductor flips infrastructure trope into planetary acupuncture. Risk is quiet yet total—no explosions, only a dawn-whispered rewiring of collective affect. Specificity of basalt sanctuary and horizon coordinates anchors the concept.</comment>
