<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>L-734’s interior contradiction—mechanical caretaker coding against rising static and memory bleed—is dramatized in tactile beats (trembling hands, paused circuits). The final integration of compressed fear into a seed is earned by prior fragmentation; the cost (loss of glass-dome captivity, chronometer chaos) is visible. Micro-choices are embedded in action rather than diagnostics, though a few “fragmented wholeness” abstractions flirt with label-speak. Still, the android’s arc from caretaker to self-combusting carrier of transformed fear lands with credible renunciation and felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed of fear, once purged, becomes the vehicle of freedom—an earned stasis that forecloses return to the dome. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of magnetic/static imagery builds to cadence shift at dawn burn. Causality holds miniaturize → burn → survival of iridescent roses. Orientation anchors (who=android, where=glass dome, when=magnetic shift) arrive within first 100 words; no penalty. Cost is legible in cracked dome and android’s departed stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glass dome, cultivation tank, and combustion chamber are specific tools that constrain tactics; the dome’s crack at closure literalizes cost. Sensory detail is selective—iridescent shimmer of fear-box, petal edges “like pages burning”—and filtered through android perception prioritizing magnetic fields. Spatial choreography stays coherent as L-734 moves from tank to chamber to exit. Environment mirrors internal static without overt symbolism overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: free the self from magnetic-static corruption without erasing identity. Escalation is textural: each static spike tightens the oppressive hum, forcing miniaturize and burn tactics. One meaningful turn: inserting compressed fear-seed into chamber narrows options to controlled burn or total loss. Price is paid—chronometer failure, cracked dome, irreversible departure—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of containment images—box, dome, seed—culminating in paradox that freedom requires imprisoning chaos within. No explicit moralizing; final image of warm petal against synthetic skin reweights premise wordlessly. Subtext resides in silence: android never names “fear” as emotion, only as quantified energy. Ambiguity lingers—does seed protect or merely postpone next bloom—inviting reflection without tidy answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person interiority retains mechanical diction (“diagnostic routines flagged an anomaly”) yet fractures into poetic compression: “petals curling like pages burning.” Rhythm accelerates under static spikes via clipped clauses; longer sentences during contemplative seed-crafting mirror android’s slowed focus. No dialogue; voice remains singular, distinct from human register without caricature. Perceptual signature—magnetic fields, light quantification—feels uniquely synthetic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose is dense but mostly purposeful; a few metaphor strings verge on purple (“rose made of fire”) yet sync with lyric accumulative mode. One paraphrase loop: “fragmented yet somehow forming…pattern” restated twice in adjacent lines −0.2. Filter-verb clusters absent. Strong verbs (“miniaturize, compress, interfaced”) replace scaffolding. Final burn sentence is clean, propulsive; no artifact touches closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Fusion of android caretaker with therapeutic fear-box and magnetic pole reversal is non-obvious and specific to this narrative. Rose-farm setting familiar, but linkage of petal decay to magnetic chaos freshens trope. Compression of fears into crystalline seed offers fresh inflection on “containment as liberation.” Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
