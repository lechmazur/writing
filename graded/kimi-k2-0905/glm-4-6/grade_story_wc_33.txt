<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid (“brittle hush…monument to stillness”), motives anchor every beat, and the mailbag/EMP bottle are embodied extensions of his risk calculus. Missing: a second character on-stage to test status, so relationship crucible is moot; also, the brother vow is backstory-only and never complicates present micro-choices, so the flaw stays abstract rather than lived. Still, his contradictory allegiance to protocol and sabotage shows in tactile parcel swaps, and the final “single stone” renunciation lands with visible fatigue—enough for a strong band but not the 9+ gate because the cost is generalized, not sharpened by an on-page relationship or fresh mistake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because Kael needs to mask the book, therefore he triggers the bottle-EMP; because the drones reboot, the manifest discrepancy will redirect audit attention—each link tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shuttle glides away leaving a measurable void in both cargo tally and Kael’s chest—“phantom road” image reweights earlier absences with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean (anchor by line 3, no drift). Deduction solely for mild over-exposition in the middle paragraph (“His motivation…”) which pauses causality to tell us stakes we already see enacted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade, neon ghosts, drone apex angle—selective, urgent, never catalogue. The mailbag’s weight and the wax-sealed bottle serve as micro-settings that literally constrain hand movement and timing; bottle-EMP failure risk is felt in knuckle tension. Final image of deepening twilight and faltering neon recharges the opening palette, locking external atmosphere to internal absence. Meets 9+ gate for environment-tool that charges closure; capped at 8.1 because spatial choreography of the shuttle deck is skimmed—reader infers rather than sees the hidden compartment latch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—life-saving tissue must evade drone audit—is signaled in first 120 words and tightened once: the three-second EMP window irrevocably commits Kael to forgery charges if mis-timed. Escalation is causal under lens: each calibration of absence raises detection risk, no safety net supplied. Cost is visible—the spent, collapsed storm bottle—but price is conceptual (future exposure) more than visceral; hence hits 8.0 not 8.8+. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the single deepening suffices, but a sharper bodily price (hand burn, audible heartbeat) would have pushed higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “linked absences as resistance” emerges concretely through the missing parcel entry and the brother-shaped hole in Kael’s chest; no sermonizing required. Subtext thrives in gesture—thumb on lead cap equals prayer. Final image reweights earlier neon “ghosts” as now complicit witnesses to new ghosts being made. Complexity acknowledged: system remains lethal, family still fractured, promise still broken—an ambiguity that lingers without aphorism, only slightly dented by the overt “broken promises heal” line which edges toward thesis-statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Kael’s sensorium; perceptual signature filters world via postal reflexes—he thinks in manifests, barcodes, weights. Syntax flexes from languid twilight clauses to staccato pulse of “three seconds” without unmotivated drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided; interior diction (“phantom road”) is poetic yet plausibly his. Minor filtration verbs (“he felt”) appear but coincide with physiological stress, forgiven; rhythm and ear are controlled, meriting high band though shy of 9.0 due to handful of adjective clusters (“soft sigh of hydraulics”) that could be leaner.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured and propulsive; sentences open varied, information dual-loaded (“glided from one side of the chasm to the other” embeds geography and peril). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay consistent (storm↔pulse, ghosts↔neon). Two near-simultaneous “soft sigh” / “soft” dock within two lines—minor echo, not fatal. Closure sentence breathes cleanly. Errors: present tense once shifts to past (“had helped”)—correct; otherwise copy-clean. Within high band but not 9+ because figurative height in peak beat (“glass coffins…brittle hush”) slightly overwrites the EM-pulse practicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fused conceits—postal omission as espionage, bottled weather as EMP—feel inevitable yet fresh; no prior fiction template matched. Risk in high-concept heist pays off because world rules are taught through action, not lecture. Emotional truth grounds novelty: grief-driven smuggler who weaponizes absence. Specificity (lead-capped storm, hollowed pre-war poetry) resists synonym swap. Slight deduction for familiar dystopian drone trope, but text re-casts it via logistics rather than villainy, keeping originality in upper tier.</comment>
