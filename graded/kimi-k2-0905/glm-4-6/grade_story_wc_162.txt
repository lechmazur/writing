<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elea’s “gift” and her drive to decode thresholds remain abstract; no embodied contradiction or on-page micro-choice tests her resolve. The father’s absence is felt, yet her decisions (tracing wood, staying on the terrace) aren’t forced into costly trade-offs, so the arc feels observational. Interiority leans on poetic labels (“featherly determined heart”) rather than specific, pressured thought. Endurance is declared, not dramatized with visible cost, so the renunciation lands softly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical CR—Elea accepts lifelong guardianship of “necessary distances”—but the cost is poetic assertion rather than dramatized forfeiture. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wood-grain readings, weather codes, and prism light iteratively reweight the sacredness of thresholds. Orientation is taught late (first 120 words drift in dreamy generality) yet ultimately pays off in the resonant final image, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. The meaningful tightening arrives with the realization that being lost is wandering unrevealed thresholds, but the beat is delivered in summary, not scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Drifting prism terrace” and “fractured light” are vivid, selective, and mirror the theme of splintered reality; the setting is the story’s micro-environment and charges the final image. Anchors (who/where/when) emerge gradually, but the delay is purposeful disorientation that resolves into Charged Poise. Sensory economy favors visual refraction and haptic wood grain, both filtered through Elea’s maze-trained perception. Weather and altitude metaphors remain consistent with the pilot-logbook frame, sustaining internal logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—stays coherent but abstract; pressure intensifies only conceptually via repeated epiphanies. No concrete external test (lost supplies, hostile intrusion) raises the price of her vigil, so escalation is purely cognitive. The final stance crystallizes gracefully, yet the absence of a visible or felt forfeiture keeps the score below the 8.0 band where cost must be undeniable. Coincidence is avoided; the butterfly effect is backdrop, not solver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme (“necessary distances bind reality”) emerges through iterated images—maze paths, wood grains, prism fractures—rather than explicit thesis, satisfying emergence requirement. Subtext lingers in the silence after butterfly-effect upheaval, letting reader feel the unsaid enormity. Final image of drifting guardian reconfigures loss into vocation without moralizing, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration. Minor abstraction prevents higher band; theme is felt but not scalding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: long breathy sentences mimic drifting light; diction stays within Elea’s plausible lexicon of maze-maker’s daughter. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Patterned repetition (“featherly determined,” “necessary distances”) teaches its cadence early and pays off in final line, earning elision tolerance. Perceptual signature is strong—she “reads” space like a maze—keeping POV tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm alternates between propulsive anaphora and shorter crystalline clauses, supporting the ambient hush. Figurative density is high but patterned, so Overwriting Cap is waived. A few paraphrase loops (“thresholds felt sacred… necessary distances… sacred thresholds”) dock −0.2. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks; closure image remains luminous and unpolluted by scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: corn-maze epistemology meets post-apocalyptic topology; butterfly effect literalized as continental drift and prism terrace is bold yet internally coherent. Specificity of “altocumulus lenticularis” as threshold code and wood-grain cartography defies generic post-disaster templates. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off—reader feels inevitability without having seen this exact guardian-of-gaps myth before.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</question><note>Present early; one beat—choice to stay on terrace as guardian; closure participation reweights loss into vocation. Could swap “corn maze” for “labyrinth” without breaking logic, so below 7.0.</note>
<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</question><note>Logbook appears early, mid, and final line; weather code links wood grain to threshold science, enabling conceptual turn. Object is handled, not just cited, giving it causal life.</note>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</question><note>Concept drives every beat—maze paths, prism fractures, unbridged distances—culminating in guardian ethos. Removing it collapses both theme and closure image.</note>
<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</question><note>“Featherly determined” recurs but never exacts a visible cost; determination is declared, not tested. Trait decorates rather than constrains action.</note>
<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</question><note>Intuition triggers key epiphanies (wood = map, distance = sacred) but dramatized once in middle; final guardianship is decision, not intuitive leap. Essential yet single-point usage.</note>
<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</question><note>Grain analysis is signaled early, executed mid-story, and links logbook codes to threshold theory; mechanics matter but do not shape final guardian stance—conceptual, not tactical.</note>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</question><note>Drifting terrace is the only location, supplies the refracted light that teaches fracturing, and hosts the final Charged Poise. Setting actively reconfigures meaning.</note>
<question>9 H</question><question>6.6</question><note>“After butterfly effect” is frame, not clock; time feels suspended, which suits hush but never tightens decisions. Functions as premise, not ticking pressure.</note>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</question><note>Motive is explicit early and re-invoked at each wood-reading beat; friction appears in fear of crossing irreversible thresholds. Desire directly shapes final endurance.</note>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</question><note>“Fractured hush” modulates from dreamy to solemn; final guardian image deepens the hush into reverent vigil. Tone is coherent, adaptive, and charges closure.</note>
