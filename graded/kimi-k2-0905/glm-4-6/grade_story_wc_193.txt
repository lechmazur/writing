<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo’s survivor guilt is conveyed through concrete bodily memory and the diamond-making beat; still, “therapy-speak” labels (“the weight of false promises,” “close the wound”) soften the peak moment and keep contradictory impulses off the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bolt vanishes, diamonds appear, and the phone’s final text re-weights his future; causal chain is intact, cost is visible, but a mild Orientation lag (who/where only implied until ~140 words) holds it below the 8.8 gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mushroom-farm body-as-setting guides every action: humidity dims vision, caps dictate where to kneel, glow supplies the energy; yet the bolt’s prior naval life never constrains choice, so micro-setting does not fully charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute regret into value—tightens once when the bolt humps soil and crystallizes; agency is present, cost is legible, but escalation is a single beat rather than a narrowing sequence, keeping it shy of 8.5.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-didactically: pain-as-carbon becomes light; no moral is sermonized, but the conceptual re-pricing is telegraphed one clause early (“a testament to his survival”), slightly shaving resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Voice keeps a restrained wonder in short, head-lamp-filtered sentences; rhythm modulates with pressure; occasional template cadence (“the weight…, the years…, the diamonds…”) is minor enough to preserve 8-band clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory nouns and verbs, high information density; one paraphrase loop (“the weight of it, not just physically, but existently”) and a mixed metaphor (“forest of glowing caps that pulsed”) dull the knife-edge needed for 8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Alchemy-of-trauma via quantum mycology feels fresh; synthesis is specific enough that swapping bolt or farm would break the image; risk is moderated, not reckless, but the fusion lands memorably.</comment>
