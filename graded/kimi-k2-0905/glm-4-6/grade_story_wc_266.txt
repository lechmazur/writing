<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The traveler remains a silhouette; no interior contradiction or embodied emotion is dramatized. Marek and Elara function as oracles, not crucibles—their advice is lyrical but never tests or alters the traveler’s stance. The only micro-choice—reaching into the pool—arrives without prior tension or cost, so the change feels bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pool reweights identity from circumstance to choice. Yet causality is lyric-accumulative, not situational; the star punches create paths without narrowing options or risking loss. Orientation is lyrically delayed but ultimately waived—the disorientation serves the dream logic at closure—so no penalty applies. Still, the traveler’s final gesture lacks a persistent constraint or price, keeping the beat just sub-resonant.</comment>

<comment>The veiled ridgeway is evoked through shifting horizons, star pulses, and shoreline laps; these images constrain movement by forcing indirect footing. The ticket punch’s star stamp acts as micro-setting, its glow guiding perception. Sensory selection favors twilight liminality—mist, lantern glow, reflected light—mirroring the traveler's indistinct identity. While no physical prop alters the final choice, the pool-as-mirror recharges the ridgeway’s overlay of possibility, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—locating “unused courage”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete failure cost is risked. Pressure escalates only descriptively: “overlapping horizons” promise revelation yet never foreclose a wrong path. The traveler’s agency is limited to walking and watching; the final retrieval of light is granted, not wrested. Thus escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, and the tightening never costs a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the reweighting of identity from leash-bound circumstance to self-chosen potential. The shoreline lullaby and star stamps weave a quiet motif of navigation-by-indirection, culminating in the pool’s reflective repricing. Yet the traveler’s arc is observational, so the insight feels lightly bestowed rather than struggle-earned. Final resonance is gentle but genuine: courage is remembered, not discovered—an answer that lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains twilight cadence—long breathy sentences, tidal rhythm, muted diction—without head-hopping. Compression (“after the leash breaks”) is taught early and paid off in the pool image. Perceptual signature is collective-mythic rather than individual, fitting the allegorical ferry guides. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is judged by narrative texture alone; the lullaby refrain remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but patterned: repeated “indirect routes,” “star-stamped,” and “shoreline lullaby” risk template cadence, though the recurrence serves accumulative design. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay maritime and astral. Occasional scaffolding (“the path is never straight,” “courage isn’t the absence of fear”) states what images already show, trimming density. No artifact obscures causality or dulls the final pool image, keeping the line-level above mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The after-death ferry ritual is familiar, yet the “ticket punch with star stamp” and “veiled ridgeway” supply fresh tactile specificity. Indirection as mandatory navigation method reweights the trope from judgment to self-recognition. Risk is taken in near-total abstraction, but the lyric pattern holds. While not radically original, the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—an angle that foregrounds unremembered potential rather than moral reckoning.</comment>
