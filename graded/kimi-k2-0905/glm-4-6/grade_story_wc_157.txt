<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s glint-and-spectacles trick risks charming-rogue cliché, yet his “plant them” micro-choice under raid pressure embodies the taxed-thought paranoia and earns the guarded-spark stance. Interiority stays concrete: soil under nails, weight of seed in palm. Contradictory impulse—thriving on chaos yet calculating each horticultural syllable—shows in scene, not summary. Cost is felt: the single etched wildflower is both triumph and future exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: Thought Tax → secret club → garden-code → raid → double-down → resilient wildflower. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the untaxed bloom revalues language itself. Orientation anchored by word 70; no lens drift. Persistent constraint—the seed’s ever-present weight—shapes tactics throughout. Cost legible in the scarred earth and Silas’s sharper glint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse operates as micro-setting: moth-wing shadows equal syllables, formaldehyde tang undercuts floral hope, monstera leaves become war-shields. Spatial choreography clear—tables, ferns, buried jars—tracking intact. Sensory triage narrows to touch (soil, seed) under raid stress. Final wildflower image is specific, irreplaceable, recharging earlier pinned-beetle stillness with living code.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve untaxed thought—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation: raid rumor → uprooted beds → lone encoded bloom; each step narrows options. Agency resides in Silas’s refusal to erase; the zigzag marigolds are his visible wager. Price paid: physical destruction of beds, future exposure etched into the surviving petal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image, not thesis: language = living flora, tax = uprooting, defiance = self-seeding. Final wildflower reweights premise—meaning can photosynthesize outside authorized syntax. Ambiguity preserved: victory is tiny, readable only to initiates. No moralizing; resonance comes from the bloom’s fragile candid-cryptic glyphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close adheres to Silas’s perceptual filter—spectacle glints, seed weight, soil coolness. Diction stays within rogue-scholar lexicon without academic inflation. Rhythm accelerates during raid warning (“blood went cold”) then settles into quiet final smile. No head-hopping; librarian and poet voices surface only through reported speech filtered by Silas.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, read-aloud clean; sentences open varied. Occasional flourish (“leaves like cracked green shields”) but never muddles causality. One scaffold spot: “chaos of nature obscuring the rebellion beneath” could trim. Final image crystallizes without overwriting. No loops, register drift, or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: horticulture as steganography, community gardens as samizdat. Wildflower-as-word feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken—quiet botanical victory instead of blaze—heightens plausibility. Concept fully committed; no retreat to safe metaphors.</comment>
