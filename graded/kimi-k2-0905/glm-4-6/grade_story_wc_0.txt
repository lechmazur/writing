<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her scientific lens on decay versus cosmic violence gives contradictory texture. Micro-choice (tracing the spiral for Mr. Gable) embodies values hierarchy with cost to her knees and dust supply. Motivation is anchored in trauma-avoidance yet never feels diagnostic; embodiment of “quiet kindness” shows rather than abstracts. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; flaw is implicit in solitary over-control, paid in lonely ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: final fingertip smudge reweights entire premise—her patient art is both gift and perpetual self-erasure. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral patterns layer until the last dust grain reframes stakes. Cost is felt—the priceless medium is literally wiped away—foreclosing limitless repair. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks; escalation is density-rise, not turnover.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting functions as tool: cracked glass, mossy stone, cedar box constrain gesture and limit dust application. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s astronomer bias—light refraction, particle spirals—tying cosmos to pot shard. Spatial choreography clean; weather (condensation) affects breath and visibility. Object-as-setting (dust box) recurs to charge final image. Professional astronomy detail stays relevant to metaphor; no excess exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent emotional chaos via micro-decay—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: dust is finite, each pattern consumes irreplaceable beauty. Agency is attention/renunciation; she chooses to spend dust on neighbor, narrowing future options. Cost visible—knee ache, fingertip smudge—under Accumulative lens; no coincidence. Escalation is cadence intensification toward final wipe, not external reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through parallels: cosmic flare vs. gentle flake, neutron star death vs. orchid root fade. No explicit thesis; final image silently reweights “gradual change” as mercy and self-sacrifice. Butterfly dust motif accrues meaning—memory of flight transmuted into grounded healing. Complexity preserved: her kindness may also be control; story refuses to judge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains astronomer-perceptual signature—light spectra, spiral arms—without drifting. Syntax varies: longer clauses for cosmic sweep, fragments when kneeling. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register stays within lexicon of scientist-poet; “iridescent powder” not “iridesce.” No filter-verb stacks; psychic distance tightens to fingertip in final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: “fractured glass of the storm-damaged greenhouse” fuses setting, backstory, theme in seven words. Rhythm breathes—no template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors coherent (galaxy spiral → dust spiral) and grounded. Zero paraphrase loops. Word choice precise: “curdled into bitter anger” not “became.” Proofreading clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron astrophysicist turned micro-decay gardener—occupation flipped into domestic magic. Butterfly-wing dust as tech is non-obvious yet logically seeded. Risk of quiet ending paid off by recharged opening image. Could swap names/places but metaphor lattice is specific; premise not template. Emotional specificity elevates familiar healing trope.</comment>
