<comment>Jonah’s reticence and observant warmth are shown through embodied micro-choices (slipping sea-glass into pocket, stacking stones) rather than labels. The anonymous-letter engine externalizes his loneliness and drives every beat, so his final silent triangle carries earned cost. Interior contradiction is legible—he both clings to solitude and craves the unseen correspondent—yet the climax is a quiet gesture rather than a new tactical risk, keeping the arc just shy of a decisive change. Still, the character reads as an individual, not a trope, and the flaw (silence-as-shield) complicates the choice.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lighthouse outage → sea-glass find → letter memory → stone pattern, each beat thickens the pattern of wordless communion. Closure unit is a Charged Poise: the aquamarine scatter on the walls reweights every prior letter and stone, making the cost of continued reticence legible without forcing speech. Orientation is anchored within 40 words; no prop teleporting. One soft scaffold—“the letters had taught him…”—is paid off by the final image, so permitted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sea-spray scent of ink, spiral stair torque, cold lamp glass: sensory detail is filtered through Jonah’s seafarer gaze, never touristic. The lantern room functions as micro-setting—its cold ghost-pressure hastens his need to relight and thus to “bottle safety.” Spatial choreography is clean; stones, crate, envelope, and tiller all track. Environment does not merely echo mood; it constrains the only possible response (silent signal), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving the fragile wordless bond—tightens when the lamp dies: if he fails, the letter-chain may break. Agency is present in relighting and in stacking the triangle, each act forfeiting the option to speak aloud. Cost is visible: the sea-glass warms, the ghosts “lean in,” acknowledging the silence he chooses to keep. Escalation is single-wave but sufficient for 700-word form; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: safety is co-constructed through symbols, not declarations. The sea-glass’s final prism-refract offers a non-literal answer—“connection survives in the quiet we consent to share.” No character moralizes; the ache stays luminescent, not explained. The motif (stacked stones) accretes meaning rather than decorating scene, re-pricing silence as communal currency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains salt-sting lexicon—“mist-kissed,” “oil rags,” “tiller”—syntax shortens under lamp-room pressure. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens from panoramic sea to the warmth of pocketed glass. Dialogue is absent by design; voice still modulates through cadence shift from wave-beat clauses to the single spare sentence of stacked stones. Perceptual signature is consistent: Jonah notices wear-patterns, scent of salt-ink, never tourist-catalogues the view.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job—description, interior, and motion: “his boat slicing / the lamp cold / ghosts leaning.” Metaphors are spare, sea-worn, never purple: “lighthouse stood like a sentinel” is allowed cliché because it is Jonah’s own internal shorthand. Opening and closing lines carry symmetrical salt-rhythm that booksends the voyage. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Epistolary ghost-story without a ghost is fresh; anonymous letters that train a silent man to speak in stones transforms familiar isolation trope. Sea-glass as message-coin feels inevitable in hindsight yet not borrowed from canon. Risk—no spoken dialogue, no overt specter—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Specificity of maritime supply run and stone-cipher keeps the premise from drifting into generic loneliness fable.</comment>
