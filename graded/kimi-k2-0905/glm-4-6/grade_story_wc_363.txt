<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-rooted resolve is viscerally embodied; the amber bead’s warmth against her bleeding palm makes the brother-motive physical. Interior contradiction is strong: she both masters and is consumed by the raveling silence. Micro-choice hierarchy—picking up puzzle edges, knotting memory-threads—shows sacrifice scaling with pressure. The final “wait” is an earned renunciation whose cost (collapsed body, flaring bead) locks the path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the loom’s shudder and bead’s flare crystallize the boundary between realms while Elara’s collapsed lungs make the cost bodily. Causal lens holds—each thread is a because that tightens until the puzzle circle therefore pulls her into the void. Orientation is swift: orchard, loom, silence planted by line 3. Only slack is the late rule for puzzle mechanics; taught in the same paragraph as payoff, so waiver holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting dominates: the loom, bead, and puzzle edges literally gate the cosmic crossing. Bamboo forest is sketched with swinging density—rustling absorbed, mist dissolving—then re-anchored at return. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s urgent narrow focus: sound drops out, touch (warm bead, sliced finger) escalates. Spatial choreography stays clean throughout the weave/collapse cycle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach stolen brother—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens through escalating bodily price after each thread. The silence progresses from oppressive to penetrated to re-threaded, a lived antagonist. One clear reversal: the jigsaw border completes, foreclosing retreat—she is pulled into the void she sought to bridge. Cost is visible—bloody fingers, ragged breath—altering later tactics (she must weave again).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of threading absence into connection emerges from concrete action, never slogans. The bead’s stoic sparkle and loom’s hush reweight meaning: emptiness becomes medium. Ambiguity is purposeful—brother’s echo is “faint but real,” refusing false certainty. Final image of orchard breathing with her offers resonant non-literal answer: isolation transformed into threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“raveling silence,” “woven void”) is patterned early and paid off. Rhythm swells with pressure—parallel anaphora of “every thread” mirrors mantra under stress. No head-hopping; bamboo remains external chorus. Compression in peak beats (“loom shuddered, pulling her”) keeps immediacy without scaffold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric cadences collapse into staccato “wait.” Information density high—single sentences splice memory, plea, and physical toll. Metaphors stay internally coherent (silence as textile) and physically tracked. Minor scaffold in “the silence wasn’t empty, she realized” could compress, but artifact does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of loom-as-portal is retooled through tactile micro-procedure: puzzle border as warp, amber bead as shuttle. Bamboo-orchard setting particularizes rather than generic fairy glade. Synthesis—childhood bead + jigsaw detritus—gains inevitability in hindsight. The risk of lyric repetition pays off by making silence a textile antagonist rather than backdrop.</comment>
