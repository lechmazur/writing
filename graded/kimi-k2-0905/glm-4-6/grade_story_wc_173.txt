<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but drifts toward poetic abstraction; the courtesan’s contradictory impulses are declared (“refused to be a hollow melody”) rather than enacted in a beat we can see. The single on-page choice—snapping the red thread—earns some cost, yet the prior threads are untangled in summary, blurring the hierarchy of values we need to feel the stakes escalate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: her unashamed laugh reweights every prior echo and the prism flare makes the cost visible. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each untangled thread intensifies the chorus of her own desires—though the middle compresses several choices into one paragraph, muting the because/therefore rhythm that would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Silver courtyard snow and crystalline sanctuary return as tactile constraints: the cold threads literally burn her fingers, and the refracted starlight charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single-location scene; selective sensory detail (bare feet on crystals, pulse of light through prisms) keeps the micro-setting vivid without tourist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—own her voice versus the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early and tightens when the red thread threatens to undo her. The single deepening (snapping that thread) forecloses the option of remaining “desired and untouched,” but the price, while felt, is not given a concrete after-image that would narrow later options; escalation is legible yet once-only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: freedom is curation, not erasure, of the fragments others imposed. The final laugh reconfigures the paradox of “chaste courtesan” without moralizing, letting the prism’s flare carry the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers—she is still desired, still untouched by others’ definitions—creating resonance beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays stable and filters every image through her body’s attention; perceptual signature is consistent (“snow whispered her name”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the snap of the red thread, longer cadences during the harvest—without losing clarity. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but stacked metaphors (“threads of light,” “trapped fireflies,” “web of possibilities”) crowd several sentences and slightly dull the tactile immediacy the moment demands. No loops or paraphrase stacks; information density is high. A single mixed vehicle—threads that both pulse and burn—mutes precision in the climax clause.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “harvest of echoes” as memory-refracting prisms gives a fresh tilt to the familiar liberation arc; the courtesan re-authors herself by curating, not destroying, the fragments. Risk is present—lyric compression could have collapsed into abstraction—but the closure image justifies the gamble. Could edge higher with a sharper external consequence tied to her new voice.</comment>
