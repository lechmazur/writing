<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal gazer’s interiority is textured—his “spatially imaginative” gift is shown, not labeled, when he folds time like cloth. Yet his want (“where is unused love stored?”) stays abstract; we never learn why this answer matters today, not yesterday, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. The final peace is earned by the revelation, not by any micro-choice that risks tangible loss, so the arc is more insight than change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Conceptual Repricing: love is archived in the exact moment it was snipped away. The causal chain is internal—psychometry → perceptual descent → temporal map—but each step is legible and the final image (“heavy and resonant as the final, fading bass note”) makes the abstract cost audible. No orientation debt; the booth anchors by word 30 and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Projection booth becomes a mind: ozone, humming walls, film-strip serpent coiled on the bench. The film itself functions as micro-setting—its sprocket holes are doorways, its emulsion a skin the gazer pierces—so the object literally constrains the final discovery. Spatial choreography stays clean; the reel is handled, heated, then released in a single continuous motion that synchronizes with the internal crescendo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will he locate the storage site of lost love—tightens when the search narrows from “where” to “when,” a conceptual narrowing that still forecloses his lifelong dread of evaporation. Cost is present but abstract: he accepts that his own unused love is already archived in a cut he cannot undelete. The escalation is purely epistemic, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet the price would be sharper if his body or memory paid something more concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as an inversion: the trash-bin of editing becomes the only afterlife love gets. The refrain of “hushed thunder” and “fading bass note” turns the unfinished musical into a metaphysical principle—tragic potential as preserved energy. No moralizing; the final sentence’s “contribution” reweights personal waste into cosmic archive, a resonance that invites rereading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, slightly archaic without purple drift: “celluloid serpent,” “temporal residue.” Syntax lengthens and contracts to mimic filmstrip unspooling—long sentences during descent, staccato fragments at the click-back to reality. No dialogue, so evaluation rests on narrative texture, which sustains a consistent perceptual signature of folded-space synesthesia.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor extends the film-reel conceit rather than decorating it. Rhythm modulates with discovery, climaxing in the single-sentence paragraph that lands the “when” revelation, a drum hit that justifies the prior crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—archived love lives in the cut frame—transforms a familiar metaphysical question into a cinematic vernacular that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is formal: the entire climax is an abstract realization, yet it pays off because the pattern (editing-room floor as afterlife) is taught early and re-anchored in sensory sound. Freshness score earns the +0.2 risk bonus.</comment>
