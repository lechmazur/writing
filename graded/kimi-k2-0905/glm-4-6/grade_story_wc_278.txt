<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core grief is embodied through tactile micro-choices—tracing Cassiopeia, trembling hands after amber translation—and the final stoic prepping of the needle shows earned endurance that forecloses denial; the emotional hierarchy never slips into therapy-speak. Interior contradiction is light (only one voiced regret line), and the external/internal split could be sharper under peak pressure, yet the visible cost on the midnight ritual keeps motivation coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lacerta tattoo crystallizes a new rule—Orion will externalize rather than silence memory—made legible by the cost of sleepless preparation and the whispered apology. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern intensifies through sonic artifacts until the amber shift reweights meaning. Orientation is clean by ¶3; no cap triggers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The antique desk and its secret drawer function as micro-setting that materially constrains discovery and supplies the letters driving tactics; amber and resonance rig recur as handled objects whose changing state alters choices. Sensory economy favors sound and hush, mirroring theme without checklist drift; spatial choreography inside the lab remains coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—silence personal guilt via firmware—is signaled by the second sentence. The midnight amber resonance provides one meaningful tightening that forces an irrevocable trade-off: externalize memory or lose equipment integrity; price is visible in shaking hands and the whispered apology. Escalation is textured, not causal-chain, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of sound, memory, and cosmic mapping; no explicit moralizing. The lacerta image reweights prior “folded time” and “meteor hush” motifs, offering resonant aftereffect: consoling others becomes self-consolation. Subtext of insect-as-witness and trapped vibration is cleanly integrated without symbol-for-symbol’s-ske checklisting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within artisanal lexicon (“northern star,” “分毫”) without academic drift. Rhythmic control peaks in the final paragraph where cadence mirrors calm after storm; no filter-verb stacks or head-hop glitches. Perceptual signature—cosmic/map idiom—remains character-specific and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>High information density: each paragraph advances premise or stakes; sentences avoid scaffold repetition. Figurative language is selective (“whiskey burning through wires”) and does not clutter peak beats; no mixed metaphors. A couple near-paraphrase moments (“ghosts of vibrations…refuse to fully depart”) are minor and do not touch closure; grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>The constellation-tattoo / sound-translation mash-up is fresh; amber-as-memory-capsule twist feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Emotional specificity—grief over an infant daughter—grounds speculative frame in human cost. Risk in lyric ellipses (“when time folds in on itself”) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry; no derivative premise penalty applies.</comment>
