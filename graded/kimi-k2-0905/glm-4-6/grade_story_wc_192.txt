<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s isolation and self-surgery metaphor hold steady, but interiority drifts into explanatory shorthand (“learned that intimacy was sometimes a form of consumption”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The phantom-pain notion is evocative yet never embodied on the page; we see no micro-choice that dramatizes her reliving a severed connection. The climactic decision to re-bridge is declared, not earned by a visible earlier beat that shows the cost of loneliness outweighing contamination risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the knock externalizes her reversal from isolation to communion, reweighting the emptiness motif with undeniable social cost. Causality is thin, though: the press of “something vast and hungry” is asserted rather than demonstrated through a beat that forces her hand; the hinge beat is summarized (“she knew she had one choice left”). Orientation is clear early, but the threshold-fading rule is introduced late and never shown altering her tactics until the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The serpent-ring, ash-stone, and starlight are tactile and selective, grounding each beat. The sanctuary’s skeletal frame against constellations mirrors her stripped interiority without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; the ring’s cold weight is tracked hand-to-hand. The micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate: the ring’s final contact against the door charges the closing image and constrains her irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep contamination out vs. risk re-connection—signals early and tightens once: the threshold’s audible thinning escalates from ambience to survival threat. Agency is present but abstract; the encroachment is described, not demonstrated narrowing her options beat-by-beat. Cost is conceptual rather than felt: the price of knocking is asserted (“risk being unable to breathe”) rather than dramatized through breath, pulse, or failing barrier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging suffocation through shared wound emerges implicitly from the ring’s ouroboros and the loaded emptiness motif, never sermonized. The final knock re-prices the premise: communion is no longer healing others but surviving the contagion of hope. Subtext lingers in the ring’s cold iron swallowing its own tail—an image of self-consuming isolation now offered outward. No tidy moral, only a crystallized cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: metal “as intimately as flesh,” ash-thickened stone, starlight that “burned cold and distant.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at the threshold breach, mirroring breath control. No head-hop; unreliability is hinted (is the presence real or guilt-projected?) yet remains coherent. Distinctive diction—“loaded emptiness,” “necrotic tissue”—anchors voice without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High information density; most sentences layer job, image, and metaphor. Figurative runs cluster in reflective paragraphs but pattern is taught early and paid off in the final metallic taste of the knock. One scaffold loop: “she had learned that … she had learned that” repeats concept without new pressure. Otherwise crisp verbs, zero synonym churn, no filter stacks; metaphor logic stays consistent (iron as flesh, emptiness as orchid).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: psychic wound-worker as lighthouse for despair-eating entities, using scar-to-scar Wi-Fi. Ouroboros ring re-cast from self-devour to bridge signal. Risk of lyric abstraction is taken and mostly landed; concept stays specific to this voice rather than generic occult. The reversal—teaching suffocation to breathe by risking suffocation—feels inevitable once the ouroboros is offered outward.</comment>
