<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—rational map-maker vs. credulous conduit—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, touching, laughing) that visibly cost her composure. The fossil’s warmth spreading “through her” fuses motive and sensation, making her final stance crystallization (“she was ready to tell its story”) feel earned. One hairline slip: “her motivation burned brighter than ever” drifts toward label-speak, but it is immediately anchored to tactile action.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each new fossil discovery thickens the pattern—tactile warmth → floating → melody—until the final image reweights her vocation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the caves’ melody “wrapped around her” visibly forecloses her old identity as mere map-maker. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive before 120 words and the cave geography stays coherent. Cost is legible in her pounding heart and the unspoken price of becoming “voice” for absent humanity.</comment>

<comment>Coastal cave network is not backdrop but instrument: narrowing walls, receding tides, and fossil “lanterns” actively pressure her path and tactics. Micro-setting rule satisfied—fossils function as portable terrain that constrain each next step. Sensory selection (brackish water, damp limestone, bone-deep hum) is filtered through her professional sensorium, never touristy. Spatial choreography is flawless: objects float, distances narrow, and she moves deeper with physical logic intact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate the silence into meaning”—tightens when the opalescent glow rewrites her sensory map, foreclosing the option of mere observation. Escalation is accumulative: each fossil encounter raises the emotional ante until the melody forces stance crystallization. Visible price: she forfeits detached map-maker identity and accepts irreversible conduit role. No coincidence resolves; all pressure emerges from her decision to keep touching relics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: absence can be vocalized through attentive touch. Subtext lives in gesture—floating fossils are not magic tricks but negotiations with loss. Final image reweights “voice of the unknown” from metaphor to occupation, avoiding moral. Minor deduction for near-echo phrase “world was waking up,” slightly generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, compressed diction mirrors map-maker precision: “hummed with the ghosts of tides” teaches the pattern early. Perceptual signature—temperature, mineral scent, vibration—remains character-consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens imperceptibly as awe mounts. Rhythm accelerates into breathless final sentence, matching melodic crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (cave as instrument, fossils as lanterns) stay coherent and physically grounded. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. Only microscopic hedge: “almost alive” slightly softens an otherwise crisp image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Post-human sensorium voiced through relic interface feels fresh; synthesis of paleontology and synesthesia is non-obvious. Risky floating fossils could read as arbitrary magic, but early “factually mystical” cue and consistent thermal/vibrational logic make the rule legible. Specificity: elm-vein fossil, spiral shell iridescence—details resist swap test. Minor proximity echo to canonical “last human” scenes, but voice transcends cliché.</comment>
