<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is consistently concrete—his trembling hands, the vial warming in his palm—but the “spiritually curious” trait is announced rather than dramatized until late. The final renunciation (lowering the camera, accepting perpetual pilgrim status) carries visible cost and is seeded by earlier micro-choices, satisfying the 9+ quick test. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene, however; the monk memory is reflective exposition, not pressure-tested action. Overall a strong, character-particular arc, but the lack of live internal conflict keeps it below 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the camera is lowered, the upside-down world rights itself, and strangers feel unaccountable mercy—an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The drive lens is accumulative/textural; pattern (breath → image → spark) is taught early and deepens once, then pays off in the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 4. Causality is internal and lyrical, not because/therefore, but the piece never promises otherwise. One soft spot: the Kwan-yin tear is introduced mid-scene as already-owned, a minor teleport, but it doesn’t break the closure logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The viaduct, wisteria, and camera obscura are tactile, lived-in, and filter every choice; the wooden box “feels heavier” under Elias’s grip, a micro-setting that charges the final image. Bloom petals fall in the last sentence, mirroring the internal release without overt symbolism. No spatial contradictions; pedestrian choreography tracked cleanly through the lens projection. Meets 9+ gate: the camera-as-setting constrains the only possible action and is inseparable from the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“release unused love back into the world”—is signaled early and reweighted once when Elias realizes the bridges of light are literal, not metaphor. Escalation is textural: breath-by-breath sharpening of projected images until the luminous webs appear; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forecloses any return to ordinary observation, accepting endless pilgrimage. Would enter 8.8+ band if a tangible loss (stamina, social credit, damaged tool) had been dramatized on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the return-of-love premise without sermonizing; final image (strangers smiling at nothing) offers a non-literal answer to “where does unused love go?” No overt thesis statement; only one soft echo—“pilgrim of sparks”—is self-diagnosed, but it occurs mid-scene, not in the final paragraph, so the thematic-echo penalty is waived. Complexity is honored: the process is irreversible, the cost is open-ended. Resonance is built from the camera’s re-inversion rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres strictly to Elias’s perceptual filter: “metallic tang,” “ghostly faces,” syntax lengthens under meditative breath. No head-hopping; pedestrian voices are heard only as projected ghosts. Diction stays within an artist’s lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm mirrors breath cycles—long sentences during exhale, fragments at image-flash—teaching the pattern early and paying off in the final paragraph. Minor hedge: one line of therapist-speak (“heal others”) leaks in, but it is brief and does not contaminate voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image, emotion, or concept; no scaffold, no paraphrase loops. Metaphors (wisteria as “silent prayers”) are sparse, mixed only once (“weight of unexplored dimensions”) but do not tangle the closure beat. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Proofing clean; pronouns unambiguous. One filter-verb cluster (“he noticed,” “he felt”) appears in a calm beat, not under peak pressure, so no 9+ disqualifier. Ear-test passes—read aloud, the cadence breaths with the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses camera obscura + Buddhist relic + urban viaduct into a fresh synthesis; the mechanism of “breathing to reveal love-sparks” is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (past-life monk, divine tear) are transformed through concrete optical science and public-space intervention, not mystic hand-waving. Specificity anchors risk: the upside-down projection physics is accurate, the tear’s milkiness is tactile. Could tip into 8.8+ if the monk memory had complicated the present tactic (doubt, mis-use), adding ethical friction.</comment>
