<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—her crown “too heavy for her brow,” the dream-bleed of starlight—but the decisive turn (she is the grotto’s exiled guardian) arrives as retrospective download rather than dramatized contradiction; cost is felt, yet the flaw is ironed out in a single beat of memory rather than pressed under continuing tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: renunciation of the mortal kingdom crystallized in the final “lacy menace” smile—visible cost, conceptual repricing. Causal lattice holds: dream → warning → climb → recognition → abandonment, each step a because/therefore linkage; no teleporting props or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is selective and POV-filtered: the ridge’s season-smear, the grotto’s breathing light, the firefly “miniature stars” that cue recognition. Setting actively steers choice—only storm-season grants access, and the ember wall’s heat literalizes her returning nature—passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—identity versus crown—signaled early; pressure tightens once when memory floods back, foreclosing mortal future. Agency is her decision to ascend and later to abandon; price (kingdom fracture) is legible in the final thunder-crack, though escalation is more conceptual than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: starlight that rusts, crown as shackle, grotto as womb-home. Final smile reweights prior motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers—guardian or destroyer?—earned through sensory particulars rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains controlled elevation: “celestial judgment,” “tissue-thin veil.” Perceptual signature—metallic crown weight, star-bleed rivulets—remains queen-bound; no head-hop. Compression (“seven leagues north”) is strategic, rhythm breathes with ascent pace; occasional elevated diction (“ethereal visions”) stays within fairy-tale register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract on the climb, lengthen in grotto reveal. Mixed metaphors avoided; “starlight bled…to rust” is precise. Minor scaffold: “shared exhale spotting” could lose “of summer” without loss; no loops or register drift in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “amnesic monarch” scaffold is retooled by inversion—she is not lost royalty but exiled celestial, kingdom the temporary costume. Firefly cue and rusting starlight give fresh inflection; risk lies in lyric density yet coherence holds. Freshness = specificity of sensory alloys, not premise revolution.</comment>
