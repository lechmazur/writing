<question>1</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Kael’s quiet competitiveness and map-obsession are concrete from the first paragraph; the coin-in-hand micro-choice to hand Jenna his prize embodies a credible renunciation that costs him the very token he fought for, earning the closure moment. Interiority stays tactile (“fingers closed around the zodiac coin,” “steps deliberate yet fluid”) rather than diagnostic. Only the “labyrinth feels alive” note drifts toward abstraction, but the body-in-motion keeps it embodied. The relationship under pressure sharpens when Jenna’s scoff melts into awe—an earned status shift on the page.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: coin-sense → locates Jenna → whisper test → key reveals seam → chamber opens; each beat narrows options. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael forfeits the coin, proving theory and crystallizing a new collaborative stance; the cost is the token itself. Orientation locked by line 3; no prop or map teleports. The labyrinth-as-sound-map rule is taught early and pays off in the final line “whispers become legends,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Storm-washed steel, corrugated hum, and static crackle are selective, urgent, and character-filtered. Micro-setting objects—coin, key, folded maps—constrain every choice and charge the final chamber image. Spatial choreography is flawless: three-container junction, disguised seam, humming heart. Only the storm’s “unnatural energy” leans generic, but the acoustic payoff redeems the label.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by the bet. Agency sits in Kael’s decision to whisper and to surrender the coin; both acts foreclose paths with visible cost. Escalation is single but meaningful: Jenna’s shout fails, Kael’s whisper succeeds, storm peaks as door opens—causality intact. No off-stage cheats; coincidence merely ornaments.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: knowledge hoarded versus shared; maps folded versus unfolded; whispers listened to versus shouted. No character sermonizes; the final line “whispers become legends” is image, not thesis. Surrender of the coin reweights value from possession to collaboration—conceptual repricing without moralizing. Counter-readings linger: is Kael generous or simply seduced by the next secret?</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s tool-hand, map-crease, coin-temperature perceptions. Syntax mirrors obsession: stacked participles for corridors, abrupt clauses for lock-click. Dialogue sparse but distinct—Jenna’s terse “Ready to lose your coin?” versus Kael’s softer offer. No head-hop; perceptual signature (“humming with the storm’s unnatural energy”) remains his. Register holds steady; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe with corridor length, then shorten at key-click; no template cadence. Concrete nouns predominate—“corrugated sides,” “disguised seam.” One mixed metaphor—“city of steel giants” beside “labyrinth listens”—but it’s taught early and functional. No loops, scaffold, or filter stacks; information density high. Final line propels without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Acoustic labyrinth built from shipping containers is fresh; maps as sound-fold instruction manuals is a non-obvious synthesis. The zodiac coin as gait-reader repurposes junk tech into mythic tool. Risk of quiet whisper climax is embraced and pays off. If relocated to cave or palace, the beats collapse—specificity anchors invention.</comment>
