<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-powered quest is vivid, but the interior contradiction—rage vs. seductive levity—is summarized more than dramatized in-scene; the sister-as-punchline reveal is embodied only by a single clutch of the arrowhead, so the cost arrives but isn’t felt in his body or choice. The final renunciation (dropping the flint) is motivated, yet the micro-choice that shows him relinquishing investigative identity happens off-stage in a half-line; we see the object fall, not the psyche split. Still, his bitter drive is specific and propulsive enough to earn the 7-floor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—arrowhead → phone call → Lyra confrontation → drop—but the phone’s emergence as the Jester’s conduit is introduced late and explained in static monologue, so the because/therefore linkage thins at the pivotal beat. Closure lands as conceptual re-pricing (“wound to be tended”), yet the cost is assigned rather than dramatized; the flint clatter is audible but emotionally weightless because we never saw Elias’s investigative self at risk on-page. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but a −0.4 deduction for soft causality at the critical turn keeps the score sub-7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground garden is tactile and selective: damp earth, crushed mint, floating bioluminal mushrooms—each detail either pressures Elias (he kneels, fingers cut) or mirrors the Jester’s anti-gravity motif. The arrowhead’s ancient/new duality and the cordless phone’s eye-metamorphosis anchor the surreal rules without exposition dump. Spatial choreography stays clean; distances and props track across beats. The setting directly charges the final image (Lyra reaching toward mushrooms), satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elias weaponize or release his bitterness?—is signaled early and tightens when the Jester offers sister-as-punchline, but the escalation is largely auditory (static voice) rather than an action that forecloses options until the final arrowhead drop. Visible price is conceptual rather than visceral; no live resource (time, tool, social credit) is spent mid-scene, so the cost legibility required for 8.0+ isn’t achieved. Agency is reactive—listening, clutching—until the last beat; a single irreversible move is barely enough for high-6.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief transmuted into absurdity emerges organically from images (floating mushrooms, joke-veined static) rather than exposition; no character moralizes the thesis. The final reconfiguration—“wound to be tended”—reweights the arrowhead from evidence to scab, achieving resonance without platitude. Subtext in Lyra’s frostbitten hope line carries older complicity, but her backstory stays too elliptical to deepen the thematic counterpoint into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited anchors firmly to Elias’s sensorium; perceptual signature is loaded with olfactory and gravitational bias. Syntax grows clipped under phone-static pressure, then softens at release, showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping; Lyra’s interior is implied through gesture and frostbitten diction. Voice avoids filter-verb clutter; occasional lyrical lifts (“wind chimes breaking in reverse”) are earned by pattern consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong density—earth/mint juxtapose regret/absurdity in single phrases; most sentences do two jobs. Metaphors stay internally consistent (gravity = levity). Minor scaffold: “static-laden confessions” is repeated almost verbatim within 30 words; a −0.2 loop. No mixed metaphors or register drift; final image breathes without overwriting. Rhythm modulates from long clauses underground to staccato phone bursts, supporting momentum rather than showing off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of cryptid hunt with grief-counseling via cosmic joke is non-obvious and fully committed; the Jester as regret-eating therapist reweights urban-fantasy tropes. Anti-gravity mushrooms and flint-tooth arrowhead feel particular, not checklist quirks. Transformation test: swap botanic garden/aerial fungi and the emotional logic collapses, confirming freshness. Risk in blending absurdist humor with bereavement lands cleanly because bitterness stays tasted, not canceled, to the end.</comment>
