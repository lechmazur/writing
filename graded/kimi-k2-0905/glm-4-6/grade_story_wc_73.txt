<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grim optimism is embodied in every step: he keeps climbing while knowing the stairs are endless, and the chipped die is fingered until it splits—an earned, tactile cost. Interiority is specific (“the low flame” of purpose) and contradictory (hope vs. logic) rather than diagnostic. The final laugh is credible because the proofs’ labor has been shown; the healed die externalizes a change already paid for. Minor defect: the “missed-opportunity” texture is named more than dramatized, so the flaw remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the staircase dissolves into a lit room, the perpetual-motion rule nullified by an equation whose chalky traces we saw. Cost is visible—stairs crumble underfoot, the die literally splits—so the rupture is material as well as conceptual. Causal lattice holds: each proof is a micro-choice that progressively weakens the staircase under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One hairline slip: “time had no meaning here” is stated late, not taught early, but the line is brief and does not derail the final re-weighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The staircase is simultaneously macro-setting and micro-tool: its angles are measured, its steps chalked, and its final crumbling is the decisive terrain. Sensory economy is tight—echoing groan, slipping sand—yet always filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias (mathematical exactitude). Spatial choreography is flawless; we never lose track of where Elias stands vis-à-vis the dissolving flight. The healed die on solid ground recharges every prior step, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“can infinity be cracked?”—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens through each chalked equation; options narrow as each step literally disintegrates beneath the proof. Escalation is textural: the air thickens, the staircase groans, the die wobble intensifies until the split. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; luck complicates (the askew die) but never resolves. The price is paid on-page—loss of footing, of the flawed die, of the staircase itself—earning the 8.7.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of flaw-as-freedom: the chipped die’s imperfection mirrors the staircase’s own hidden flaw, making the final healing a reweighting rather than moral. No lecture intrudes; the idea stays implicit in the chalk dust and the split die. The reader is left to feel that accepting one’s error is the only exit from self-made infinity—a resonant ambiguity. A half-point off because the word “texture” is used twice to name the theme, slightly over-signaling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s mathematically precise yet doom-haunted perception: “each step identical to the last” reflects his enumerating mind. Syntax lengthens and shortens with ascent tension; fragments (“Not violently. Like sand...”) mimic breath control during collapse. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. The absence of filter verbs and the rhythmic variation under stress justify the high band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Every sentence carries double duty: “He stopped mid-step, the groan of the stone echoing like a sigh” advances action, embodies setting, and layers metaphor without mixed vehicles. No scaffolding, loops, or synonym churn; even abstract nouns (“perpetual motion”) are tethered to physical stakes. Figurative language peaks only twice and is pattern-earned. The final clause—“the world stretched before him, not as a trap, but as a choice”—delivers a clean, propulsive cadence that recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The infinite-staircase trope is inverted by making the escape an act of abstract mathematics rather than physical heroism, a fresh synthesis. The chipped die’s healing externalizes internal change without sentimental magic because the logic of “flawed infinity” has been mathematically seeded. Specific detail (borrowed chalk, crumbling sandstone steps) grounds the concept. The risk is high—pure idea-driven climax—yet it pays off with crystalline clarity, earning the upper band.</comment>
