<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s mask-restorer lens (“I saw them daily in my shop”) gives his interiority a sharp, vocational POV that charges the final image. Micro-choices—needle angle, finger steadiness under rising silence—track credible artisan tension. One slip: the late, told-not-shown moral (“never truly been about mending facades”) lands as tidy epiphany rather than embodied contradiction, blunting cost. Still, the hierarchy of values (repair vs. release) is dramatized across six knot-beats with visible tactile stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each unraveled knot because/therefore liberates a spirit and narrows Elias’s options until the final memory-knot forces conceptual reprice. Closure is a clean CR—grief reinterpreted from confinement to connection—priced by the audible silence that disperses against the walls. Cost is legible in the exact line “his touch transforming,” where artisan identity is forfeited to medium. No telegraphing; pattern taught early by prismatic refraction that reweights at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary operates as micro-setting: every refracted beam constrains visibility and stages the spirits’ anchoring. Fisherman’s net, tapestry needle, and crystal facets are handled, not catalogued; their tactile states alter choices (darkening needle warns of intentional concealment). Starlight spectrum evolves from scattered rainbow to grounding anchor—environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies orbit, distances tracked, no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—free the drowned yet avoid inheriting their silence—signaled in first beat. Escalation is accumulative: each knot raises audible pressure until silence becomes palpable force pressing walls. Sixth-knot darkening acts as the one meaningful tightening that forecloses artisan detachment. Cost is felt (ears pop, needle warms), but price is conceptual rather than tangible loss—keeps it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete artisan imagery: masks, knots, facets—grief as repairable artifact versus lived resonance. Subtext carried in silence-texture and rainbow-refraction rather than exposition. Final image reweights premise: honoring grief converts prison-light into grounding-light—no moralizing sentence, only sensory flip. Invites counter-reading that villagers’ fear was itself a mask Elias must un-knot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s artisan eye; perceptual signature filters every beam through mending logic. Syntax tightens under pressure: “needle glinting… fractured… darkening” compresses clauses to mimic knot tension. No head-hop; Anna’s dialogue stays external, preserving POV modesty. Diction remains within coastal craftsman lexicon; elevated phrases (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) read as vocational metaphor, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable: “knots thick as a sailor’s thumb and dark with years of accumulated silence” layers tactile + temporal + metaphoric in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Rhythm accelerates at knot-six resistance, then exhales across final release—sentence length mirrors pressure curve. One micro-slip: “tapestry needle hummed” anthropomorphizes without prior pattern—minor artifact, does not dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Premise fuses maritime ghost-net with optic-sanctuary—fresh synthesis. Mask-restorer vocation flipped from surface mend to soul-unwind, transforming familiar trope. Risk taken in making silence audible and light tactile; payoff lands. Could edge 9.0 if coastal storm memory had been seeded earlier to heighten inevitability.</comment>
