<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arthur’s interior contradiction—seeking finality yet flinching from silence—remains vivid; the parasol-tip micro-choice anchors him without tidy epiphany. The “fold in patience” is felt, not labeled, in his shift from eavesdropping on endings to hearing continuance. Cost is legible: the sterile Zurich memory is renounced, the new rhythm accepted with the warmed ivory pressed to palm. No diagnostic speak; voice stays idiosyncratic and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sound he hunted becomes the beat that refuses to stop—cost is the redefinition of his life’s quest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of disaster sites → parasol intrusion → shanty continuation reweights stakes without causal reversals. Orientation anchored by word 90; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening at the fireside song crystallizes the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is filtered through Arthur’s alienated senses—salt, diesel, slush under boots—guiding his attention toward micro-surrenders. The heirloom parasol operates as micro-setting, its ivory tip constraining his thumb and reframing scale from collective wreck to singular endurance. Weather and buckled harbor affect salvage choices; spatial choreography clean. Final image reuses the warmed object to reweight meaning, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discern the frequency of endings—tightens when the shanty reframes the goal into hearing what continues. Pressure escalates texturally: stacked images of weariness culminate in the unwavering note. Protagonist’s attentional shift constitutes agency; no external coincidence resolves the quest. Cost is conceptual redefinition, felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: endurance, not finality, carries the authentic cadence of existence. Subtext resides in the parasol’s polite fragility against splintered boats—private gentleness surviving public collapse. No moralizing; the ending image of warmed ivory reweights prior material without statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers as sober uplift rather than sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Arthur’s perceptual quirks—“gripped reality loosely,” “world thinner”—with rhythmic, slightly off-kilter syntax mirroring his loosened grip. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under the fireside song. Filter verbs serve voice: “the air tasted of salt, sorrow…” Diction remains within his esoteric but plausible lexicon; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“reality slipping like sand” appears once and pays off in the water-cupped hands final image. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, interior shift, and object cue. No scaffold; even reflective lines advance stance. Minor alliteration in “salt, sorrow, strange, clean scent” reads intentional, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise of “euthanasia tourist seeking the sound of ending” is fresh; execution grounds the abstract in tactile salvage and an ivory trinket. Risky inversion—disaster volunteerism as aesthetic pilgrimage—pays off by revealing continuance rather than nihilism. Transformation test fails if parasol tip removed; its refined fragility is irreplaceable counterpoint. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
