<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—guilt vs. the need for precision—but the embodied emotion drifts into label-speak (“guilt-ridden heart,” “fierce repose”) that flattens peak beats. Micro-choice is visible when he presses the crimson thread, yet the stakes of that act feel abstract because the ruined lives remain off-stage. The final pawn move reads as earned, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; we’re told guilt lifts rather than feeling the chafe of its absence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each platform step is a because/therefore consequence of chess logic. Closure is a Decisive Change—pawn push dissolves labyrinth—paid for by the prior pattern of invisible games he plays against himself. Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props. The only slack is the late appearance of the “old texts” rule for tapestry entry; it doesn’t break causality but keeps the score under 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Platinum corridor and shifting grid are tactile and constrain every step; the tapestry border functions as micro-setting that gates entry. Rain-memory cobblestones and metallic air are filtered through the tutor’s haptic fixation. Environment directly shapes tactics—color-coded knots equal move vectors—so the 9+ gate is met. Minor over-patterning in “woven hush” repetition keeps it just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled early and tightened by each lethal mis-step on the grid. One meaningful reversal: realizing the stalemate he once botched is now solvable. Cost is conceptual (admission of arrogance) rather than external; visible price would push it above 8.2. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence rescues him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the equivalence of labyrinth and chessboard: redemption is not absolution but the courage to play the lost position correctly. Subtext lives in the pawn sacrifice—an echo of the student he failed—yet the final paragraph moralizes the lesson (“not as a burden, but as a lesson learned”), trimming the resonance. Still, the reconfiguration of guilt into responsibility lands with legible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to tutor’s perceptual filter—chess notation as cognition. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for calculation, fragments under platform pressure. No dialogue, so voice carries all; “fidgets productively” becomes a leitmotif that crystallizes in the final stillness. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent,” “refracting”) momentarily lifts out of his lexicon, holding the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, tactic, and memory. Figurative layering is controlled—no mixed metaphors—but “woven hush” is repeated enough to flirt with template cadence. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. One scaffold phrase—“his fingers, trembling slightly”—could compress, but it doesn’t stall propulsion. Closure image is clean and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess logic as spatial penance engine. The platinum labyrinth literalizes the “combinatorial hell” of regret without feeling gimmicky. Risk is taken—entire plot is a solitary puzzle—yet emotional stakes keep it from abstraction. Not quite 8.5 because the village’s time-frozen mechanic remains ornamental rather than reweighted at the end.</comment>
