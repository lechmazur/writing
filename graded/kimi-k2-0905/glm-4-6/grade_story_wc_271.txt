<comment>Maya’s quiet talent is shown through tactile gardening beats that externalize grief; the framed photo choice at the end crystallizes her earned shift from hiding to integrating memory. Interiority avoids label-speak, instead using soil-touch and salt-spray as somatic triggers. The only minor slack: the lighthouse-keeper philosophy is recounted rather than dramatized, slightly blunting the relational crucible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the framed photograph beside succulents reweights trauma into cultivated life, cost felt in the lingering salt wind. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each gardening beat layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn: hide photo → display photo, tightly causally linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cliffside arboretum is not backdrop but active constraint: salt spray shapes plant choice, wind dictates Maya’s low crouch, precipice mirrors life-on-edge stakes. Micro-setting succeeds: the greenhouse workbench becomes a shrine, its slatted light charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is botanist-specific—root systems, salt burn, junipers sculpted by wind—anchoring POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—integrate memory without succumbing to freeze—tightens once: hiding the photo → displaying it. The sea-thrift transplant beat deepens knowledge, reweighting survival metaphor. Agency is quiet yet visible; cost is opportunity of continued secrecy foregone. No external antagonist needed; wind and salt function as environmental pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: salt-tolerant persistence as model for trauma integration. “Pearl of stillness” motif is understated, reprised only at the end where it reconfigures meaning without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—smoothing, not creasing, the photo—implying acceptance more than epiphany. Final image resists tidy moral, offers charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maya’s perceptual filter—botanical nomenclature, henna-pattern memory, salt-taste air. No dialogue present; prose rhythm breathes with gardening cadence, sentences lengthening in reflective beats, tightening during freeze moments. Free indirect style clean: “quietly talented hands” repeated becomes signature, not tic. Register stable, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay vegetal and coherent—root systems, salt, succulents—without mixed-vehicle clutter. High information density: one sentence often layers gardening action, memory cue, and thematic echo. Minor scaffold: “quietly talented hands” appears twice; accepted as deliberate motif. Closure line is crisp image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-garden arc is refreshed by drone-strike wedding premise and botanist’s somatic markers; sea-thrift as trauma metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist; succeeds under Accumulative lens. Could edge higher with one sharper inflection earlier, but specificity of coastal plant lore keeps it from template territory.</comment>
