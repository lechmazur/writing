<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The violinist’s grief-forgetting, shell-talisman choice, and final renunciation of flight (letting the shell fall) trace a credible interior arc. Emotion stays embodied in bow-weight and collarbone-ember rather than labels. Yet the statues’ nod-through-rhythm and instantaneous stone-to-dust collapse feel externally granted, not earned by flaw or mistake; the cost lands on the city, not visibly on her body/choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “resonantly soft” music and shell images tighten until the final chord reweights the world. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (sky-bridge, violin, rust/glass). Closure = Resonant Reconfiguration: the dropped seed reconfigures city + orchard with undeniable conceptual cost—mechanism halts, vines rise. The crumbling statues, however, arrive as sudden external payoff rather than causal narrowing of her options.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory triangulation—bow-screw click swallowed by void, locust shell warming ribs, sunrise petals cracking glass—grounds the fantastical in tactile POV. The sky-bridge itself (a recurring object of light and tension) constrains her last stance and is re-imaged as “strings of light” in the coda, satisfying 9+ micro-setting test. Statue geography stays coherent; stone eyes enforce silence that she pierces with sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each musical phrase increases density until machinery stalls and flowers breach pavement. Visible price is the city’s mechanical death and her own exposure on the bridge, but because the statues crumble by enchantment rather than by her strategic trade-off, the tightening feels half-external; agency is expressive, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of silence vs. music, mechanism vs. seed. Subtext lives in gesture: pressing palm to stone chest, letting shell fall—renunciation of personal flight for collective bloom. Final image of vine twining broken statues offers Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. The refrain of “resonantly soft” risks thematic echo, but its last use is an earned sonic texture, not thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric compresses into violinist’s perceptual signature: wind hoarding notes, strings worn thin by grief. Rhythm swells and contracts with musical tempo; diction stays within poetic but plausible lexicon. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Patterned elision (“the gap between knowing and understanding”) is taught early and paid off in final silence-between-notes image, satisfying experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: “locust’s memory of winged escape warming her ribs” does three jobs (object, emotion, foreshadow) in one breath. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (sound as tide, glass cracked by laughter). Two near-simultaneous participle openers in climax but cadence mirrors musical acceleration, reading as purposeful texture rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar “artist vs. mechanized city” trope is refreshed through locust shell as seed of rebellion and living-statue orchard police. Specificity of heart-rhythm signal and “resonantly soft” sonic weapon makes the payload feel particular to this text. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens resonance without obscuring closure. Transformation sufficient: swap shell or music and the entire reconfiguration collapses.</comment>
