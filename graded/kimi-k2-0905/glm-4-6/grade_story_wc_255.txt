<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s colorblind painter identity, plant-code language, and “innocently cunning” trait are vividly embodied in every beat; the bargain micro-choice (white lily) crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final renunciation of gray life is earned by the prior causal chain. Minor slip: Lyra’s interiority is only gestured at, but she functions as pressure, not focalizer, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because Leo cannot see color, therefore he barters, therefore the reed vibrates, therefore the world fractures. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the gray certainty is foreclosed in the final image of “glorious, messy, vibrant flaws.” Orientation anchor (courtyard, glassblower, post-phoenix) arrives by line 3; no ambiguity. One meaningful tightening: the reed-hand-over moment collapses all options into a single irrevocable sensual awakening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard’s shifting light, molten glass heat, and plant-code lexicon are filtered through Leo’s value-based perception, constraining every negotiation. The reed itself becomes a micro-setting that literally intersects the body/eye at closure. Spatial choreography is clean: bench → workbench → studio → return, no impossible positions. One hairline slip: “ceramic mug” appears un-anchored in the studio, but it is instantly re-seen in color, serving the reveal, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trading season-long labor for sight—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Lyra points heart → sky, forcing Leo’s lily bid that seals the contract. Escalation is causal: each new plant added raises the social price of failure; the reed’s hum is the irreversible turn that forecloses gray neutrality. Cost is visible: lifelong servitude inscribed in the courtyard soil. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is want vs. irreversible knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: beauty is located not in ideal form but in the imperfect, now literally visible spectrum. The lily’s “unblemished” symbolism is re-priced by the ending’s “messy, vibrant flaws,” a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. Subtext operates in gesture—Lyra’s silence, Leo’s snapdragon—for defiance and regret. No moralizing sentence mars the final image; resonance is sensual, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres strictly to Leo’s monochrome-filtered perceptions; diction (“values,” “symbolically”) reflects his painterly training. Syntax grows shorter, almost syncopated, as the reed vibrates—“He gasped”—mirroring sensory overload. No head-hopping; Lyra’s interior is only implied through glass-colored eyes and gesture, preserving distance. The plant-code idiom is consistent, legible, and distinct from the narrative voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “kaleidoscope of hues he could only perceive as shades of gray” performs double duty—world-building + character limitation. No register drift; “ceramic,” “cerulean,” “sienna” belong to painter lexicon. Final line’s anaphoric triple—“glorious, messy, vibrant”—is earned cadence, not template, releasing the built pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The colorblind painter who barters for sight via plant-sentences is a fresh synthesis; the phoenix aftermath is background foil, not gimmick. The reed-as-sensory-key could feel contrived, but its metallurgic backstory is anchored in glassblower fire-myth, making the magic feel craft-based rather than arbitrary. Risk—lyric stillness over action—pays off in the final chromatic explosion. Specificity of botanical code prevents generic “artist seeks beauty” template.</comment>
