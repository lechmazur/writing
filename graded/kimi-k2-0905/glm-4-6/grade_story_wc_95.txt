<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Internal contradiction is present—Elias's mechanical arm whirs with philosophical tension—but the emotional embodiment leans on stock cues (“smiled, a flicker of chaos”) rather than raw, idiosyncratic sensation. Lyra’s entrance and the mutual fingertip brush do crystallize a hierarchy of values (intellectual parity over victory), so the Earned Stasis carries cost, yet the micro-choices leading there are mostly verbal parries, not visibly priced gestures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens: accumulative lyric texture tilts to situational crystallization at the end. Closure is a Charged Poise—both duelists simultaneously concede that the “overture wasn’t hidden,” reweighting the whole fencing-of-angles premise with undeniable conceptual cost: the game is abandoned in favor of listening. Causality is interior and symbolic; no external plot reversals are required. Orientation is clear within 30 words, no prop teleporting, and every sundial slant pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glass atrium and half-painted sundial function as micro-setting that actively constrain stance: transparency forces public visibility, painted angles force codified speech. The Danish needle card is tactile and tracked, but the brook remains acoustically atmospheric rather than tactical. Spatial choreography is perfect; only the brook’s descriptive presence feels ornamental rather than choice-forcing, preventing 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“turn questions into destinations”—tightens when the sundial angles foreclose any further riposte once the sunrise/windmill image is mutually decoded. Escalation is conceptual: each angle parries narrows intellectual options until the only remaining move is renunciation of the duel itself. Visible cost: Elias relaxes the mechanical arm, Lyra concedes the hidden overture, both accept that fencing is now listening. Agency meets situational lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—cognition as combat versus communion—emerges through the needle card’s evolution from weapon to listening device. Subtext lives in gesture: the fingertip brush supplants expected blade penetration. No moral summary is offered; the brook’s murmur stands as non-literal ratification. The concept is coherent, but the sunrise/windmill cipher is so abstract the reader feels the thematic click rather than emotionally re-experiences it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect lyricism stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—“brass joints whirring like a philosophical argument unresolved”—a cadence that mirrors his clockwork mind. No head-hopping; Lyra’s interior is Legible only through Elias’s biased reading. Diction is elevated but consistent (“Resonant Reconfiguration,” “conceptual repricing”) and justifies itself as academy jargon. Filter verbs are rare; rhythm modulates with sun-angled tension, earning high-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught in the opening line and pays off in closure, so density penalty is waived. No mixed metaphors; “fractured compass” and “velvet-covered blade” stay within visual/tactile logic. Paraphrase loops are absent; each sentence advances image or angle. Final line “The brook murmured its agreement” is a hairline cliché, preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—duel via sundial code—takes the familiar academic-rival trope and fuses it with steampunk limb plus Danish needle card, creating a non-obvious ritual. The sunrise/windmill cipher feels bespoke; removal would collapse the entire fencing logic. Conceptual risk (renunciation rather than victor) is fully committed to, not hedged. Only the brook’s ornamental function keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>
