<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—preserve secrecy vs. reclaim earthly wisdom—are dramatized in frantic paint-peeling and the final renunciation of the throne; the cost (exile risk, ancestral burden) is felt. Interiority stays concrete: “fingers trembling,” “heart raced.” One beat of diagnostic self-label (“wisely adventurous”) is brief and embedded in grandmother’s voice, so allowed. The refusal to claim power is earned by the generational memory cascade, giving credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ruby flake’s pulse → disables guards → reveals waterfall → mural → stairway → renunciation. Each step narrows options until the final refusal forecloses exile yet accepts lifelong guardianship. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty throne reweights “ascension” from power to wisdom, cost visible in Elias’s quiet return to secrecy. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall and living orchard are not backdrop: they gate entry, supply genetic-fruit clues, and charge the final rainbow-streaked image of the fading temple. Micro-settings—visor, synth-skin paint flakes—constrain tactile choices. Spatial choreography is clean across the cascade crossing. Environment directly shapes tactics: sunrise clock, liquid veil, mural surface.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—decode before purge—tightens at each ruby-flake cue; sunrise acts as live countdown shown in “precious minutes fading.” Escalation is causal: each peeled layer reveals deeper stakes (exile → ancestral guilt → species wisdom). Final refusal costs personal glory, paying visible price. No coincidence; pressure grows through protagonist’s micro-choices.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—wisdom over supremacy—emerges from mural glyphs and Elias’s renunciation, never stated. The empty throne reconfigures “ascension” as moral evolution, not domination. Motif of layered paint mirrors layered memory, reweighted at closure when temple fades. Final image (rainbow on orchard) offers non-literal answer: stewardship, not rule, is humanity’s next stair.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s sensory filter; perceptual signature vivid (“antiquated lore keeper uniform,” “chrome horizon”). Syntax compresses under time pressure—“As dawn threatened… he plunged”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Register stable: no academic drift; diction stays within lore-keeper idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “ruby flake older than floating cities” does world, history, and stakes in one clause. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for mural reveal, then staccato “precious minutes fading.” Zero filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s looping phrase “sally not into space, but back…” is purposeful cadence, not artifact, echoing opening.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-sky dystopia with Arthurian throne quest feels fresh; “genetic fruit memory” and paint-layer archaeology are specific inventions. Risk—quiet renunciation instead of coronation—heightens theme without gimmick. Transformation test fails if renamed: throne-as-wisdom hinge is non-generic. No recognizable source echoes; speculative trope flipped to anti-imperial.</comment>
