<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior contradiction—yearning to transcend yet bound by garden exile—anchors the arc; the final “cosmic verse” burned into skin is earned by prior micro-choices and lunar-dust study. Emotion is embodied in vein-light and obsidian reflections, not labels. Flaw: no second character on-page, so relationship/status crucible unused; also, competence (tide mastery) slightly over-balances visible struggle. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait whose renunciation lands with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the verse transforms her body into living scripture, reweighting the Nostalgia Ban’s premise. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—star-gaps and dust-structure density build until the final cadence shift. Causality intact: each observant micro-study of gaps enables the final cellular inscription. Orientation clear by line 6; one minor scaffold (“tonight would be the night”) but no artifact obscures the payoff image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Twilight garden, obsidian circle, and moonstone dust are specific, tactile tools that constrain choreography and charge the final inscription. Sensory hierarchy follows Lyra’s dancer priorities—starlight texture over sight, tidal rhythm over sound. Spatial choreography cleanly tracks her spiral within the stone ring. Weather/star-field evolve as she dances, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform self into uncontainable scripture or remain exiled. Pressure tightens through density of star-gap observations and dust dissolution; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful deepening: moonstone speck liquefies, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible—skin burns, anchor loosens—yet escalation is accumulative rather than sharply reversive, fitting lens.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: censorship vs. unbannable knowledge encoded in cellular gaps. Subtext in gesture—vein-light, obsidian reflections—avens nostalgia without naming it. Final image reweights “ban” itself as obsolete. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about how scripture will rewrite world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-up sustains dancer’s perceptual signature—tidal syntax, star-gap diction. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for spiral flows, fragments at ignition (“liquid light, flowing”). No dialogue, so voice purity uncontaminated. Filter verbs minimal; “she could see” once but justified by ephemeral vision. Consistent poetic register without thesaurus drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“moonstone dust speck...pulsing with residual magic that defied suppression”). No synonym loops; metaphors coherent (veins of light ≠ contradictory vehicles). One template cadence run (“from...from...from”) but purposeful parallelism teaching tidal sources. Final line propels outward, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of tide-dance, particle-gnostics, and censorship transcends stock dystopia; star-gap cosmology feels inevitable in hindsight. Moonstone dust as multiverse-holder is fresh yet grounded in earlier magnification studies. Risk in lyric density pays off by charging final body-script. Minor proximity to “living tattoo” tropes offset by cellular-scale transformation.</comment>
