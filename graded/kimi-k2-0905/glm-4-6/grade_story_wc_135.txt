<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “obsession” with fragments is shown via the deliberate empty shelves—but the decisive moment of handing the valve to the community is filtered through summary, not a visible micro-choice. The poet Mara remains a symbolic listener rather than a pressure source, so the relationship crucible is mild. The renunciation of completeness in favor of “acknowledged absence” is credible and thematically earned, yet the cost is stated rather than embodied in a final gesture. Voice stays consistent and vocationally colored; still, the climax would sharpen if Elara’s own body betrayed the strain of letting the gap stand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the exhibit’s incomplete wholeness reconfigures community memory without erasing loss. Causality holds—because Elara withholds full restoration, the exiles can bear their staggered truths—cost is felt in the final image of “ivory luster” regained yet still fractured. The brass valve is seeded early and reprices the meaning of absence at the end, satisfying the pattern. The only slack is the off-stage assembly of the exhibit; a single on-page beat of Elara placing the last fragment would have nailed the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mist-shrouded ivory harbor is more than postcard; its reflective surface literalizes the community’s need to see their own absences. The archive’s empty shelves function as micro-setting that literally constrain Elara’s method—she can only stage what isn’t there. Weather returns in the final image of rain-washed lights, charging the closure with rinsed but persistent opacity. Spatial choreography is clean: dock → archive table → exhibit space, each locale hosting a distinct beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the community face its own holes—tightens as each fragment risks reopening wounds. Escalation is textural: each object adds density to the shared absence rather than solving it. The staggered-interval tactic is the visible tactic that forecloses a single cathartic reveal, trading completeness for survivability. No reversal is needed; the deepening of fragility is the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through juxtaposition of archival completeness vs. lived incompleteness; no character moralizes the message. The trumpet valve’s reappearance as the final “mute witness” reweights absence from wound to identity without pronouncement. Subtext operates in silence: parents too traumatized to speak, children discovering drawings. The ending invites reflection on whether partial truth is truer than restoration—complex, unresolved, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative voice sustains a lyrical maritime-archive register—“navigated absences,” “conversational gaps”—that never drifts into self-conscious poetry. Perceptual signature is consistent: everything noticed is either salt-stained, brass-corroded, or paper-torn, matching Elara’s fragment-fixation. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. Psychic distance stays tight; even abstract nouns like “opacity of memory” are tethered to Mara’s clouded eyes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long tidal rolls to short brittle clauses (“this was the valve that broke”), mirroring the move from longing to fracture. Occasional modifier stacks—“mist-shrouded ivory harbor after rain”—risk purple but stay within POV’s sensuous archive eye. No paraphrase loops; however, “acknowledged and understood” is mild tautology that could compress. Otherwise crisp propulsion, high density, zero artifact interference with closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Freshest inflection: exile memorialized via broken musical part rather than intact relic—absence literally engineered into the archive. Staggered-interval revelation method is non-obvious yet inevitable given the community’s trauma saturation. Risk is taken in rejecting restorative climax; the payoff is a conceptual repricing rather than emotional purge. Could edge higher if the harbor’s ivory had cracked under the weight of withheld stories, literalizing cost.</comment>
