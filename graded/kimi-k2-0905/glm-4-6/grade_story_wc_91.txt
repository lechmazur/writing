<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motives—the bottled bugs as cosmos, the itch to “feel how one moment bleeds into the next”—stay concrete and embodied; every micro-move (stumble, kneel, re-cork) is tethered to that want. The accidental prophecy mechanic is shown, not merely labeled, when the escaped bug literally drags him to the buried relics, forcing a visible, costed choice to pocket transformation instead of cash. Interior contradiction is light—no real wrestle with “why not sell the relic?”—so the arc flirts with tidy rather than truly costly renunciation, keeping it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern by layering bug pulses, beach hush, and volcanic rumble until density crystallizes in the relic find. Orientation is clean inside 120 w; the single shard tightens once (escape→discovery) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias re-seals the bug, now freighted with tangible transformation, cost felt in the grin swallowed by the hush. No causal cheats; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Hinges on image more than wrenching choice, so it tops out at mid-8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Black-sand beach, fissure glow, bug-light micro-cosmos—each detail is filtered through Elias’s destitute philanthropist eye and used: sand grips his boots, heat frames risk, the box’s glint triggers the final beat. Spatial choreography is flawless; no exposition dump. Environment does not just decorate but supplies the relic constraint that reweights his collection, meeting the 9+ gate, yet the description never quite loops back to punish or scar him, so it stalls just under the top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grasping transformation—is signaled early and narrows to the single bug escape that forces immediacy: pursue the rogue light or lose his private cosmos. Escalation is one-wave (density rise → relic find) rather than a tightening fork of options; cost is present (he could have sold relics for food) but not dramatized as forfeiture. Sufficient for the length, yet the absence of a second, riskier fork keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—transformation as fragile yet eternal—arises from the shells-turned-stone relics and the re-captured bug, never sermonized. Final image of crunching sand re-weights the hush into quiet applause, a non-literal answer to Elias’s whispered plea. Complexity is modest; no counter-argument about transformation as commerce is entertained, capping lift below 8.5.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias with vivid perceptual signature: “slow dance of celestial bodies,” “tiny cosmos in his grasp.” No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under pressure (curse → laugh swallowed). Syntax grows lyric without register drift; only a few soft-filter verbs (“he noticed,” “he saw”) dilute immediacy. Overall a controlled, textured voice that serves the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—short beats for stumble, elongated for beach hush; no template cadence. Metaphors are consistent (bug = rogue star) and physically coherent. One paraphrase loop (“whispering hush” repeated for island and beach) and occasional “he felt” filter-stack nudge it shy of 8.5; no artifact touches the closure beat. High density, clear propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing destitute philanthropist with accidental prophet via a bottled lightning-bug compass feels fresh; the relics-as-transformation-trophies twist is earned, not grafted. Specificity of volcanic black sand and once-a-decade sky dance anchors the concept in lived geography. Risk is moderate; structure stays linear, but the lyrical hush pattern pays off. Avoids cliché yet doesn’t fully risk a formal rupture, holding it under 8.5.</comment>
