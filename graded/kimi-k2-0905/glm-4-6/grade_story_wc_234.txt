<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s need to quantify vs. romantic’s rapture—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (clutching columella, guiding light-threads). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forecloses the past as immutable, trading it for a pocket-star whose warmth she must now bear. Kael functions only as whisper-trigger; no relational crucible, so relationship bullets skipped. One nagging slip: “scientifically romantic mind racing” is diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, blunting immediacy −0.4.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pocket-star reweights memory from fleeting to tangible, cost felt in Kael’s awed silence and Elara’s new burden. Causal lens holds: secret → revaluation → iterative return → star-creation, each step logically forced. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“ember nexus”), well inside 120-word window. No prop or knowledge teleport; columella and pocket-sun states track cleanly across beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember nexus is not backdrop but active constraint: its flicker softens to “steady glow” in reverence, mirroring Elara’s narrowing options. Pocket-sun and columella serve as micro-setting tools that literally guide her hands and refract light into memory-threads. Twilight’s color shift is filtered through POV bias—“sky’s surrender”—not tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography clean: two bodies, one sphere, one shell, distances unambiguous across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture density of presence—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the secret demands revaluation, foreclosing her former interpretive frame. Escalation under causal lens: whisper → refract → weave → star, each step raises stakes by making memory irreversible. Cost legible: she must now carry the star’s weight, a literalized burden. No abstract stakes; every intensification is tethered to tactile light-threads.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory’s value is not recorded but forged, repriced by willingness to bear its weight. Final image of pocket-star answers the thematic question without moralizing. Nautilus spiral and iterative return motif recur only as operative tools, not decorative symbols. Subtext lives in gesture—the hush of the nexus, Kael’s awed silence—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is alchemical-romantic—“luminescent sphere,” “molten veins,” “scientifically romantic”—a consistent idiom. Syntax lengthens under awe, contracts during precision work, mirroring pressure. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“clutched,” “wove,” “splintering”) advance action. Dialogue minimal (two whispered words), so dialogue bullets waived. Voice never explains what the image already shows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses build incantation, then snap to short final sentence “Their light did not fade.” Information density high—single sentences perform setting, metaphor, and emotional turn. One mixed-metaphor twitch: “palette of resolve” (paint) vs. “spectrum of immutable decisions” (light) within three lines, but does not obscure causality. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; every recurrence reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Premise—“alchemist distills memory into star at volcanic twilight”—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: lyric accumulation replaces plot reversals, paid off by charged final image. Nautilus spiral and pocket-sun are familiar motifs but here retooled as laboratory apparatus. Derivative tilt avoided because emotional specificity (friendship, secrecy, burden) is non-generic.</comment>
