<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—yearning vs. exhaustion—are etched in every stair climbed; the need to “conduct” past sound collides with the bodily price of doing so. Micro-choices (shell placed, crack-hummed, glass flaw sung) reveal a hierarchy of values where artistic rescue outweighs survival. The final slide to the floor is earned: every prior step has foreclosed rest, so collapse is inevitable, costly, visible. Voice remains idiosyncratic; no therapy-speak, only bone-level ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is pristine: because he is chronologically homesick, therefore he maps memories onto glass; because each pane is sung, the spire answers; because dawn arrives, the chord crests and depletes him. Orientation anchored by clause 3 (“frozen lake outside”). Closure = Charged Poise: the C-major dawn reweights every prior note, cost is the instant fade of shell-light and his collapse. Persistent constraint—imminent exhaustion—shapes tempo and tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass spire, nautilus alcove, mirrored lake, and body-in-motion form one continuous instrument; each shard of ice or pane constrains where foot or voice can land. Cold is not backdrop but brake—slippers, seepage, shivers limit ascent speed. Final image reuses the mirrored horizon, now stripped of aurora, to show cost paid. Micro-setting (shell on alcove) literally tunes the entire score; remove it and the causal engine breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract lost childhood melodies before body fails—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens with each floor climbed. One meaningful turn: at apex he must surrender remaining stamina to release the chord, foreclosing any further search. Cost is dramatized—legs give, glow dims, horizon reverts to plain lake. No coincidence; pressure is internal clock plus cold architecture, both coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art can momentarily defeat time, but the body keeps the final score. Nautilus, spiral stair, and dawn chord form a returning motif that reweights from promise to price. Final image—ordinary lake, ordinary sky—renders the symphony invisible to all but him, a quiet conceptual repricing. Resists moralizing; leaves reader with the ache of private triumph that changes nothing outside.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Ai’s sensorium: every descriptor is filtered through auditory obsession—“low, resonant frequency he alone seemed to hear.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath needed for humming; diction stays within a poet-philosopher’s lexicon without slipping into academic register. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Minor cadence repetition in “he began… he moved…” but patterned to mimic climbing rhythm, hence tolerated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, Stakes, and bodily cost (“The cold seeping through his thin slippers as he traced the nautilus curve”). Metaphors are few, precise, anchored—“crooked smile” crack, “pearly light” in shell. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either ascent or memory map. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward dawn then fractures in the final short clause “He slid to the floor.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Freshens the “artist sacrifices self for art” trope by making the medium a frozen architectural instrument and the score a private cartography of grief. Specificity—nautilus-as-tuning-fork, glass flaw as kite-shaped note—prevents abstraction. Risk: lyric escalation without external antagonist, yet payoff lands because internal clock supplies lethal opposition. Conceptual repricing at end feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
