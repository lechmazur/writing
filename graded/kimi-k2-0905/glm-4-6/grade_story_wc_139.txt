<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maya's interior contradiction—honesty forged from a liar's toolkit—shows in her tactile care with the ink she refuses to touch. The brush-stroke on the keypad crystallizes her hierarchy: redemptive use of inherited skill over self-protection. Elena is functional, not full-fleshed, but her grip on Maya's arm supplies enough secondary pressure. The “karmic account” ledger is stated more than dramatized, yet the final refusal to keep the pot turns inheritance into cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: because she tested the ink → knows its power; because she owes a balance →helps Elena; because the guard sees painted symbols → momentary compliance. Orientation is clean within 120 words: who (Maya), where (prep room), when (night of escape). The UV-trigger pay-off is seeded by “glinting under fluorescent lights.” Closure lands with conceptual cost: the pot—her father's cheat—stays with Elena, so Maya replaces deceit with deficit, the new imbalance she'll have to live with.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prep room's “deathly vitality” is vivid, selective, and threaded through action: cold steel, formaldehyde scent, fluorescent glare—each detail either enables concealment or signals risk. Spatial track is clean: table → refrigerator → corridor → alley; no impossible moves. The ink pot functions as micro-setting, its porcelain weight anchoring every beat it appears. Environment never stalls plot; instead the refrigerated units literally hide the living, exploiting the setting's logic.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake—Elena's freedom—tightens once: the guard's 90-second window narrows options to now or never. Maya's internal collateral (dad's ledger) braids but doesn't compete; external pressure drives. No reversals needed at this length; one meaningful tightening suffices and is met. Felt price is present: relinquishing the pot and accepting a new imbalance scaled to flash length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete paradoxes: ink that dissolves rigidity becomes the tool of ethical rigidity; deathly space incubates life. No overt thesis statements—reflection stays anchored to objects. Final image of the car pulling away reweights the pot from family curse to transferable shield, evoking ambiguous after-effect: will Elena use it nobly? Complexity is honored, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Maya's perceptual filter: “porcelain glinting,” “smelling faintly of formaldehyde.” Syntax stays controlled, rhythmic, with purposeful compression: “waited actively—being present but patient.” No head-hopping; Elena’s interior is accessed only through gesture. Register remains in character—no academic drift. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual: Elena's “good people” line carries acknowledgment and warning simultaneously.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong density—sentences perform double duty: “deathly vitality of the prep room” marries atmosphere and theme. Minimal scaffolding; no synonym loops. One mixed-image risk: “mathematics of a fair trade” is abstract but saved by immediate tactile context of the ink application. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with punchy clauses under pressure. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the pot hand-off carry weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Ink that liquefies thought is fresh, and repurposing funeral-home routines for asylum is an unexpected angle. Premise avoids generic heist beats; waiting-as-action subverts infiltration tropes. Some inherited-crook-seeks-redemption DNA is familiar, but specific stakes (geneticist, crematorium loophole) particularize it. Risk: “math of fairness” flirts with abstraction but stays marginal. Overall, synthesis feels specific enough to transcend template.</comment>
