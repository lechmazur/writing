<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael’s proprioceptive memory and mask-ghost pressure are dramatized as living instruments: the “phantom weight” steers both his collapse and the calculus insight. Interior contradiction is constant—he clings to pain’s geometry while hunting its antidote—embodied in tremoring hands and neck-angle replication. The final step forward crystallizes a credible, costly stance: to keep using the very circuitry of trauma as his laboratory. No diagnostic self-labeling; every beat is muscle and vertigo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the equation M = ∫(k/R) lands on-stage, re-weighting the forest from penitentiary to proving ground. Causal chain holds—mask-memory braces → equation insight → step forward—each pivot driven by on-page somatic memory. Cost is visible: the mask ghost must stay or the math evaporates. Drive lens is causal throughout; the UV forest obeys wavelength rules that Kael weaponizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is not backdrop but apparatus: violet edges soften in direct response to the equation, a live variable that alters Kael’s tactical options. Bark, ozone, and pulsing canopy are filtered through proprioceptive hypersensitivity—every surface becomes a calibration tool. Spatial choreography is clean; body-to-tree orientation stays consistent from slumped awakening to first forward step. Setting charges the final image: the path literally brightens as the math takes hold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the formula for mercy”—is signaled early and tightened when the forest’s light reacts to the equation, proving the hypothesis testable. One meaningful deepening: mercy flips from absence of pain to deliberate counter-action, narrowing Kael’s moral toolkit to active intervention. Cost is legible: he must perpetually inhabit the mask-ghost to keep the integral live. Escalation is intellectual yet visceral, fitting causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: mercy as integrable kindness refracted through radius of influence. Subtext operates in light physics—violet wavelengths literally graph his moral function. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: a glowing path quantified by trauma, not despite it. No final-paragraph thesis statement; equation is enacted, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person deep stays locked to Kael’s proprioceptive stream: sentences contract around joint angles and air-current vectors. Diction is math-tinged yet embodied (“tilt of the ground”, “unnatural precision”)—no academic register drift. Rhythm accelerates with tremored breaths, then steadies as the integral precipitates. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; perception remains strictly character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences couple sensory data to philosophical weight (“the canopy above pulsed with a sickly violet glow that made the shadows writhe”). Metaphors are coherent—mask as ghost, forest as integral limit—no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective pairs (“rough and unforgiving”) are earned by pressure. No loops or scaffold; final line is clean, propulsive, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of torture-survivor somatics with abstract calculus of mercy is non-obvious and unforgettable. UV forest as live function plot rather than allegory escapes stock dystopia. Risk—staking climax on an equation—pays off because the math is somatically earned. Specificity of “pewter mask strap” and proprioceptive memory prevents generic transfer; story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
