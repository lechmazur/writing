<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman’s contradictory impulses—ferrying oblivion yet planting memory—are alive in scene: he scatters seeds while hearing bird-mandated “Now,” a micro-choice that costs him the last of his cargo. His grief is embodied in the hollow that “mirrored the hollow in…his ancient heart,” not abstracted. The renunciation at dawn (silent departure after luminous roots appear) is earned by the ritual beats and carries visible cost: he forfeits remaining pods and any future return. Only the “ancient heart” cliché and slight over-reliance on epithet (“gloom-hill coachman”) keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jetty’s planks, once battlefield, glow with “luminescent roots,” making the submerged concord’s rebirth undeniable; the coachman’s exile is the felt price. Accumulative lens holds—each seed, bird call, and tide layer tightens texture until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (twilight shoreline) and pattern-taught disorientation (spectral horses) pays off in the ghostly garden. No causality breaks; persistent constraint (dead reef) shapes every action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blooming jetty itself functions as micro-setting: its salt-worn crevices determine where seeds lodge and root, directly enabling the closure image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—lavender-gold twilight narrows to luminescent roots at the final beat. Weather and tide are causal, not backdrop: the turning tide “washes over the jetty,” literalizing renewal. Only a trace of tour-listing (“shimmering horizon…hollow expanse”) prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the drowned concord—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each seed-scatter beat; the tern’s cry “Now” forces immediate action, narrowing options to scatter-or-keep. Cost is legible: the coachman gives away the last pods, foreclosing his own sacramental hoard. Escalation is accumulative: pattern of seed, tide, bird call intensifies texture until the luminescent roots reweight the stake. No reversal, but single meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: forgiveness is enacted, not preached—each seed is “a seed of forgiveness offered to a wounded earth.” Subtext hums in the pods’ whisper-rattle and the tern’s monosyllable, both carrying future/past simultaneity. Final image recharges motif: luminescent roots literalize submerged concord, repricing human–nature betrayal into covenant. No moralizing, only luminous spectacle that invites reflection on restitution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is archaic yet precise: “Tempus est” and “submerged concord” belong to a narrator who traffics in dead tongues; diction never drifts into modern explanation. Rhythm swells with long anaphoric clauses that mimic tide-roll, then contracts to “Now” at climax. Perceptual signature is consistent—world is seen through ferryman-eyes that hear ghosts in birdcalls. No head-hop, no filter-verb fatigue; compression (“narrow vastness”) is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new information (seed→crevice→tide→root). Metaphors stay coherent: “hollow expanse that mirrored the hollow…heart” sustains mirror-logic without mixed vehicle. High density: “ferrying not just passengers but promises between realms” collapses job, cosmology, and emotional cargo into one line. Only two near-adjacent “hollow” repetitions, but they serve echo, not churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-parable with psychopomp myth; seed-cargo as contract-urn is fresh. Risky second-person address to earth (“garden reclaim a battlefield”) is earned by sustained ritual tone. Transformation test fails if relocated: only this dead-reef jetty plus ghost-coachman yields the same closure glow. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. No stock eco-apocalypse tropes; the mournful ferryman trope is re-enlivened by botanical sacrament.</comment>
