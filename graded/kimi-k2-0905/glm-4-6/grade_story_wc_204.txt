<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—order vs. the lure of rupture—is shown in embodied micro-choices (leaving the press, pocketing the bottle). The final leap is credibly foreshadowed by his growing abandonment of ritual. Cost is felt: inkless hands = identity erased. Just shy of 9 because the whispers’ seduction is more asserted than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the press-slam ruptures eternity, leaving Elias free yet unmoored. Causal chain holds: frost warning → bottle seizure → lever pull → fractal shatter. Cost is on-page—“inkless hands,” library frost erased. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options toward the single irreversible act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass orchard, cloud-sea, and letterpress are not postcard backdrop: the glass fruit glow guides Elias to the bottle; the cloud-sea receives his final body. Frost patterns function as both oracle and countdown, constraining choice. Micro-setting—the press lever’s cold bite—charges the rupture image. One tenth off for “swirling sea of clouds” cliché phrase, quickly recovered by functional specificity elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will he break eternity’s cage?”—is signaled in frost line one. Escalation is single-track but effective: each frost message narrows his tactical options until the lever-pull costs his lifelong identity. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Meets 9-band test: agency drives the turn and the price (library’s blank frost, his empty hands) is legible on the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—order as self-imposed incarceration—emerges through the press ritual and its fracturing, never sermonized. Frost aphorisms act as compressed subtext rather than thesis statements. Final leap reweights “eternity is a cage” into liberation through annihilation, leaving plausible counter-readings (freedom vs. nihilism). No moralizing tagline; image alone carries resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, filtering cosmic images through Elias’s tactile precision (“ink as night,” “cold biting skin”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fragments at rupture, mirroring stress. No head-hop; diction stays within his artisan lexicon. One cliché shard—“split the air like thunder”—drops it below 9; otherwise voice is distinct and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective, never obscuring causality (“bottled whisper…pressing against the glass”). Information density high: each sentence advances image, motive, or stakes. One paraphrase loop—“the whispers had begun…”—costs a tenth. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and closure-sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floating glass library + letterpress + compressed-time bottle synthesize into an image system not seen before. Conceptual risk—compressing eternity into a moment—pays off narratively and thematically. Frost as oracle avoids generic prophecy by mechanical linkage to the press. Transformation complete: remove any core image and the story collapses. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
