<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his palm against the fragment, breath steady, moonlight in his eyes—but the “discarding assumptions” beat is asserted, not dramatized; we never see a specific assumption surrendered or its immediate cost. The arc from obsessive listener to listener-who-accepts-silence is gentle, credible, but the emotional crescendo is more lyrical assertion than crucible. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the ending renunciation carries quiet weight.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the signal is inside the fragment, not the stars—an elegant inversion with felt cost (“the shard of hush now a part of him”). Causality is accumulative/textural: pattern of listening, thinning static, moonlit refraction; one meaningful tightening when the fragment’s light reweights the quest. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The ending beat is present, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just below the 9 gate.</comment>

<comment>Lattice-work tower, yawning gorge, copper receiver, lunar perigee—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s engineer-poet gaze. The Hollywood fragment’s “residual fame” warmth and the tower’s groaning steel mirror his internal shift. Spatial choreography holds as he moves from console to edge; the gorge and moon constrain mood, not tactical choice, so micro-setting qualifies. Final image of fragment in pocket recharges earlier motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the beginning inside endings—remains coherent; pressure intensifies via denser static, brighter moon, warmer fragment, but the protagonist’s agency is largely receptive: he “leans in,” “withdraws,” listens harder. No live option is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual re-pricing rather than a sacrificed alternative. Escalation is textural, not causal, and works under Accumulative lens. A visible price (fatigue, risk, surrender of old gear) would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as information, fragments as carriers of forgotten stories. Subtext resides in gesture—the fragment pulsing, the gorge holding breath—avoiding overt thesis. The final line (“Every ending is just another frequency”) risks echo-template but is saved by its placement as personal credo, not sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is the signal real or projected memory? Complexity earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent lyric-technical: “latticework,” “resonance chamber,” “serenely electric” belong to Elias’s idiom. Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses during signal approach, shorter declaratives at close. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within his plausible lexicon. Slight poetic elevation is motivated by moonlit awe; no head-hop or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature held under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; most sentences carry dual duty (e.g., “copper glinting serenely electric under the lunar perigee’s oversized glare”). Two adjacent near-paraphrases—“the shard of hush that promised answers” / “the shard of hush now a part of him”—create mild echo; not at closure. Mixed metaphors avoided. No template cadence, no scaffold loops in final third. Clean grammar, tactile specificity, strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—loner tuning dead celebrity shards for cosmic silence—is fresh synthesis of ruins-mining + hauntology. Hollywood fragment as vessel sidesteps stock alien artifact. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot twist; coherence holds. Conceptual re-pricing feels inevitable in hindsight. Could tip into 8+ with sharper tactical cost or irreplaceable prop function.</comment>
