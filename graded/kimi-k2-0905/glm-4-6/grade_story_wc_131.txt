<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior life is richly textured—his fingers “tracing familiar paths” and the metallic smell triggering a Proustian plunge into childhood archive work—yet the story withholds any contradiction that would force a wrenching micro-choice under pressure. His kindness and methodical nature are shown through tactile ritual, but the arc is observation-to-gift rather than sacrifice, so the cost feels diffuse; the closure smile is earned yet not paid for by a lost path. Still, the lonely custodian who yearns to be “seen without being seen” is individuated, flawed, and consistent, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: each stealth pass adds density until the tape fragment reweights the librarian’s perception of her workplace. Causality holds—Elias caches because outage grants cover; librarian discovers because he planted—yet the decisive change is her wonder, not his risk, so the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Closure lands cleanly under this lens, the final image of tape against morning light reconfiguring both guardians’ roles, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library’s “aged bones,” pipe chases, and hollowed-out book create a micro-setting that literally channels Elias’s movement and constrains his timing; the outage-darkened stacks supply both cover and poetic hush. Sensory selection is biased to Elias’s professional intimacy—dust, metallic tape scent, flashlight blade—never tourist-catalog. The sapphire dawn re-illuminates the found fragment at closure, environment charging the final image as required for 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmit hidden history before power returns—tightens once: cache planted → discovery imminent. Escalation is textural: each hidden compartment adds weight to the library’s secret archive; the tape fragment is the pattern-break that crystallizes the librarian’s stance. Cost is present but oblique: Elias risks exposure, yet we feel her gain more than his loss, keeping the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: stewardship of institutional memory via anonymous acts. The tape and hollowed book motifs recur with shifting meaning—first discarded technology, then gift—recharging the ending without overt statement. No moralizing paragraph; the final smile in darkness is the resonant answer, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Elias’s perceptual signature—“sapphire hush,” “ferromagnetic tape”—diction precise yet never academic. Rhythm breathes with stealth: long sentences for crawl, staccato flicker for outage. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; no head-hop. Distinctive, taught, paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; sentences advance stealth, scent, or emotional calculus. Occasional lyrical clustering (“sapphire hush,” “aged bones”) flirts with overwriting but serves pattern, not clutter. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; final line lands clean. High-band but not artifact-free enough for 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of urban-explorer stealth with archival tenderness feels fresh; the “invisible librarian’s assistant” trope is inverted—he gifts rather than steals. Specificity of tape reel, pipe chase, hollowed classic novel anchors novelty. Risky lyric compression is controlled, pays off in final reweighting. Not quite unforeseen in hindsight, but synthesis is memorable.</comment>
