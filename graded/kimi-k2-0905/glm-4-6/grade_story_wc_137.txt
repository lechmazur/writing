<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “sympathetic skeptic” contradiction is shown in the moment she lifts the tile despite doubt; her interiority stays anchored in bodily warmth and the village’s grief. The renunciation of skepticism is earned: the cascade of others’ memories visibly costs her—“her heart heavy yet light.” Minor slip: “courageously kind” is stated twice rather than revealed through a harder trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s transcription act crystallizes a new stance—skepticism surrendered to shared memory—costing her the protective distance she prized. Causal chain holds: tile warmth → cascade → transcription → village peace. Orientation anchored by 110 words. No lens ambiguity; accumulative design tightens once through the whale-song counterpoint that reweights the silence at dawn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tower’s circular room and open roof constrain the ritual; the obsidian tile’s warmth is a micro-setting that dictates when and how Elara acts. Whale-song below functions as atmospheric clock, tightening the dawn deadline. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific: astronomer’s stone, migrating sound, internal glow. No spatial drift; bodies and objects remain trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—village grief vs. her skepticism—is signaled early. One tightening: the memory cascade forces her to keep transcribing though it invades her identity; cost is the irreversible loss of protective doubt. Escalation is accumulative: each layered memory increases density until the tile dims at dawn. Agency is sustained—she could stop tracing, but doesn’t.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the whale-song / unheard-symphony pairing: shared mourning can be sculpted into communal peace only if someone pays the price of private belief. No explicit moral; final image of “world felt a little less heavy” reweights prior skepticism. Subtext resides in silence replacing symphony—peace is absence, not solution. Avoids tidy aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptions; perceptual signature is cool, tactile, astronomical. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during memory cascade mimic overload; short coda sentences echo dawn release. Filter verbs minimal; “felt more than heard” is justified as phenomenological report. Voice never drifts into editorial omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong density—most lines do setting + interior + metaphor simultaneously. One paraphrase loop: “unheard symphony” repeated three times with identical phrasing; clipped 0.2. Mixed but functional metaphor—“cascade of light and sound”—doesn’t violate physics. No scaffolding; opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Punctuation and tense remain stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of astronomer tower + whale migration + memory tile feels fresh; none of the three elements is new, but their intersection is. The “unheard symphony” motif rescues the fantasy object from generic relic status by linking it to natural migration song. Transformation test passes: plot collapses without whale-clock and tile-syntax. Quiet risk—lyric accumulation instead of battle—pays off in earned stasis.</comment>
