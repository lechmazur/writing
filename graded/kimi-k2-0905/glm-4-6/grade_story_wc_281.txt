<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “affectionate skeptic” trait is shown through her decision to translate, not suppress, the psychic noise into art, but interiority drifts into diagnostic labels (“somatic markers”) that dampen embodied immediacy. The final stance-crystallization feels earned because the muscovite-in-hand moment visibly costs her exhaustion, yet the contradiction between loving wonder and demanding evidence stays more declared than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Charged Poise: the last image of the geode refracting her color-map reweights the premise, making the psychic residue a “language” rather than curse, with cost legible in her aching body. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—each somatic flare adds pigment to the 3-D map—though a single tightening beat could have compressed the late-night montage into one decisive filtration moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The studio operates as micro-setting: LED rigs and prisms constrain her choreography and literally supply the color palette that externalizes the telepathy. Fractally precise rainbows off the muscovite return in the closing image, crystallizing the emotional map she has painted, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the psychic noise before erosion—escalates as each somatic flare forces her to cast another color, visibly tiring her. The cost accumulates in sweat and trembling arms, but the absence of a live external antagonist keeps the pressure internal; one sharper moment of near-overload could have pushed the band higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the architecture of human emotion is legible only when externalized and refracted, never owned. The muscovite’s final rainbow reprises the fractal motif, implying that disorder and order coexist—an answer felt, not stated, satisfying the non-literal resonance test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is textured, synesthetic, and POV-locked: “colors bled like watercolor on wet paper” is perceptually specific to an artist. Rhythm modulates with effort—short clauses during flares, longer coils during reflection—no head-hopping or register drift, meeting the 9- gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is strong, but occasional modifier stacks (“fractally precise layers shimmering”) verge on purple in a high-pressure beat, and two adjacent sentences open with “The light…/The static…” creating template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence advances color, body, or map—yet these micro-slips keep it shy of 8.8.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of telepathy-pill fallout with light-painting cartography is fresh; without the muscovite’s literal refraction the metaphor would collapse. Risk is present but safe-hedged—studio magic stays within art-world plausibility, not fully leaning into the speculative rule-set it conjures.</comment>
