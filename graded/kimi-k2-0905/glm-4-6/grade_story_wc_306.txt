<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Both characters’ interior contradictions are dramatized (Elian’s doubt as tool, Lyra’s rehearsed resolve cracking). Micro-choices—Elian’s lever pull, Lyra’s tear-tracked silence—carry visible cost. The shift from performance to fragile grace is legible, though the brother remains off-page; relationship crucible is therefore only implicit, capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard left behind and hung among chimes reweights the premise—doubt becomes instrument, not burden. Causal chain holds: campfire-death → Lyra’s arrival → chime sequence → renunciation. Cost is felt in the “lightness” of the shard and Elian’s mantle-shift. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and intact at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse, dawn surf, and wind trajectory are precisely tracked; the lantern room’s spatial choreography stays consistent. The shard functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV: Elian notices wind direction and tonal texture, not tourist vistas. Environment directly supplies the tools (chimes, levers) that enable the resolution, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Lyra’s need to loosen her brother’s certainty—tightens once via the chime sequence that forecloses her old manipulative stance. Agency is hers: she asks, listens, cries, leaves the shard. Price is her loss of the shard-as-weapon and the exposure of her “sincerely insincere” mask. No reversal for the absent brother keeps it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of doubt-as-tool emerges solely through image and action—no explicit thesis. The final image (shard hung among chimes) reconfigures meaning: void becomes instrument, certainty yields to nuance. Subtext in Lyra’s rehearsed apology-threat and her silent tears resists tidy moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: brother unseen, outcome uncertain, yet emotional after-effect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elian’s perceptual bias: wind-tones, collar weight, lever tension. Syntax is clipped under pressure—“He selected four chimes…”—then widens to lyrical cadence as resonance fills the room. No head-hopping; Lyra’s tears are observed, not interiorized. Distinct maritime diction (“sea-sculpted driftwood”) stays within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“cloak of doubt” introduced early), and paid off in final mantle image. High information density: “campfire…surrendered its last spark” compresses time, signals appointment. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for wind swell, then stark “Thank you” to close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Conscience for hire” who works via wind-chime cryptography is fresh; the mechanic is fully realized rather than gimmick. Familiar lighthouse setting is retooled into an auditory interrogation chamber. Risk lies in off-page brother—could feel like sleight-of-explanation—but the emotional logic holds because the client, not the absent sibling, is the true subject of change.</comment>
