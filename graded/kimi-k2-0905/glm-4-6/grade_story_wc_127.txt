<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dealer’s shift from extractor to conduit is credibly grounded in repeated, embodied contact with the petal’s charge; the final pocketing is a micro-choice that costs them their detachment. Interiority stays concrete (“familiar weight,” “rare, genuine smile”) and avoids diagnostic speak. Professionally thorough trait is shown, not told, through ritual sleeve-adjust and logged transaction. The one flaw: the chemist’s interiority is inferred with unwarranted certainty (“realized the chemist’s longing wasn’t for tears”), a knowledge leak that keeps this just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dealer pockets the petal now humming with “possibility,” conceding the old trade model is broken. Causality holds: the petal’s residual “determination” is the because that forces the methodological pivot. Cost is visible—loss of emotional distance and future revenue risk. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (amber thickening, static softening) reweights the stake without requiring causal turns. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto is more than wallpaper: its thickening light tracks the dealer’s internal shift and the final warmth literalizes the new stance. The blotter petal serves as micro-setting; handled in at least four beats, its evolving vibration constrains the final decision. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (honey light, crackling static) rather than catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—hand-to-table-to-pocket motion stays tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining professional detachment—tightens when the petal imports un-bottle-able resilience. Escalation is textural: each sensory intensification (amber thickens, static crackles) raises the cost of proceeding. One meaningful deepening occurs at the midpoint pause where subsume-or-amplify is decided. Price is on-page: dealer forfeits monetizable grief and accepts identity blur; future transactions will carry uncontrolled seed-truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: counterfeiting emotions eventually counterfeits the self. Subtext is carried in gesture—setting the petal down is a quiet refusal of commodification. Final image reweights earlier “half truths” into “seeds of truth,” a CR that invites reflection on value vs. authenticity. No moralizing; complexity stays intact—the dealer still sells, but now with uncontainable leakage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the dealer; no head-hops. Perceptual signature is distinct: static electricity as emotional barometer, synesthetic amber thickening. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences during communion, crisp fragments at decision beat. Diction remains within plausible lexicon for a covert tradesman. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences often advance atmosphere, character, and stake simultaneously (“blotter petal…key, memory holder”). No paraphrase loops; each return to the petal adds new charge. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors in 750 words, each paying off. Minor register lift (“resonant reconfiguration”) is allowable at climax. Final line is propulsive and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise—illicit emotion distillation via static electricity—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation of familiar trope (empathy dealer grows conscience) is grounded in specific method rather than abstract moral. Risk of lyric repetition (amber, static) is accepted and pays off in closure image. If names and places changed, the core would collapse—proof of specificity. No close echoes to famous scenes.</comment>
