<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The registrar’s quiet vigilance, micro-choice to step outside, and final offer of tea crystallize a believable shift from observer to host; interiority stays concrete, but the two strangers remain symbolic silhouettes rather than crucibles of status, limiting relationship pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: registrar sees doodles → deciphers intent → intervenes → shared silence → tea; the broken-then-unbroken key mirror supplies visible cost, earning a Charged Poise closure; slight late arrival of spiral/key mechanics (-0.3) but pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal-whispering stones and rain-pooled forecourt actively guide the registrar’s barefoot step and hum-backed applause moment; lens-turned-relic reweights final image, satisfying 9+ gate; projector detail could be earlier but still constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—will symbolic honesty thaw mistrust—tightens once when registrar risks exposure; cost is the audible shift from hush to applause under lamp; agency is mostly interpretive rather than tactical, keeping escalation modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transparency as mutual salvation; final teacup clink replaces moral, achieving CR; spiral/key recurrence reweights meaning; only minor abstract “freed by honesty” echo in murmur (-0.1).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to registrar’s selective attention—lens polish, stone hum; syntax breathes with hush-cadence; no head-hop; external figures speak only in gesture, keeping voice intact; slight template cadence in “the registrar… the registrar…” (-0.2).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long torrential sentences to final short sips; information dense; no scaffold loops; mixed metaphors (“shoulders knotting like tangled thread”) slightly strained (-0.2); legible throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Post-verbal world communicated solely via doodled tickets and humming stones is fresh; mistrust-thaw-through-transparency angle feels inevitable in hindsight; risk is quiet but coherent; slight echo of silent-film metaphor (-0.1).</comment>
