<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and profession-specific; the mortician’s contradictory serenity-in-obsession pulses throughout. One micro-choice—pressing the chip to the sternum—electrifies her motive. The final “quiet flame” stance is earned, but the cost is only metaphorically “felt”; we don’t see her fatigue, tremor, or price. Still, the character never leaks into diagnostic self-talk; every beat is filtered through tactile ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the emerald’s glow reweights oblivion itself, giving the reader an undeniable before/after. Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical pass thickens stillness until the silence flares into aurora. The orienting triad (who/where/when) is anchored in sentence one. Persistent constraint—the need to harvest before total annihilation—shapes every beat and the final box of stars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto is no backdrop; its “radiant hush” compresses the mortician’s perception and literally guides her ritual pace. The obsidian slab’s coldness, the aurora’s shimmer on the chip, and the electromagnetic hiss inside the corpse fuse setting with tool. Without that auroral light the emerald could not refract, and without the grotto’s isolation the memory could not be isolated. Environment directly enables the closure image—setting-as-instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—snatch a spark from total erasure—is signaled at line 4 and escalates by denser static, fainter signals, and the ticking decay of neurons. One meaningful tightening: the laugh memory almost dissolves, forcing her to “latch” more fiercely, knuckles implied white. Cost is visible—the voyager’s face settles “even deeper” after the extraction, proving irreversible loss. Under Accumulative lens, density shift reweights the stake; coincidence never intervenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as fragile, stealable light—emerges entirely through image: the thousand rainbows inside a thumbnail, the velvet box becoming a “constellation.” No character names the theme; the aurora’s final flare is the commentary. Subtext whispers that salvation is itself a form of theft, but the story refuses to moralize, letting the reader feel the paradox. The closing “edge of everything” image reprices the value of oblivion itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric tracks the mortician’s synesthetic attention: she hears color, sees hush. Syntax elongates in calm, fragments under static hiss, mirroring signal search. No head-hopping; the voyager remains a “vessel,” never granted interiority. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels authored, not character-bound, but happens outside the peak extraction beat, so voice coherence survives.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long creaming sentences for aurora, staccato bursts for static crackle. Figurative control is extreme: no mixed metaphors, no modifier stacks. One scaffold loop spotted—“the silence of the dead” twice in four lines—drops the score a hair. Otherwise information is dense: one sentence can layer tool-action, sensory input, and metaphysical stakes without drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—cosmic mortician harvesting joy from corpses—feels inevitable once read. The inversion of makeup to memory-infused serenity, the paradox of imprisoning laughter in stone, the grotto-as-observatory all synthesize familiar parts into a singular stance. No genre templates are merely decorated; the occupation itself is re-invented. Risk is maximal, yet clarity holds; the reader exits feeling the concept could not be told any other way.</comment>
