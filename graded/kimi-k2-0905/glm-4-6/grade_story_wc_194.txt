<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’ interiority is evocative—“dynasty ender, not by sword but by quiet erasure”—yet the emotional pivot relies on a single abstract realization rather than a visible, costly micro-choice. The final stance is legible, but the cost is felt conceptually, not bodily or socially, so the renunciation lands softly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each crank turn tightens knowledge and narrows legacy options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—dynasty = prison—whose cost is legible in the final silence. The missing external consequence keeps it from full 9-band punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sepia room, brass crank, and serpent sigil are tactile, selective, and return re-weighted at the end. The micro-setting (crank-as-key) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. One stray spatial reference—“far end of the room”—is never anchored, a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single stake—truth vs. dynasty—tightens through each crank escalation. Agency is interior but active: turning the handle is the on-page trade-off that reweights legacy. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, capping the upper band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: inherited silence as prison. The serpent-eating-tail and standing-wave lie converge to reconfigure meaning at the end. No moralizing, but the conceptual pivot leans more cerebral than gut-punch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lush, period-tinged diction stays within Elias’ lyric register; “golden shadows that danced like old memories” risks cliché but is earned by POV nostalgia. Rhythm modulates with crank-speed, no head-hop. One filter-verb cluster (“he began to muse”) is minor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong cross-modal density—brass cool, sepia sigh—without purple overload. No loops or scaffold. Opening participle “casting” creates simultaneity hiccup, but causality holds. Closure image is clean, uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dynasty-erasure via gramophone standing-wave lie is fresh synthesis. Risk lies in quiet, interior climax; payoff is conceptual reprice rather than external rupture, satisfying but safe. Specificity of “bridge of intuition” keeps it from feeling gimmick.</comment>
