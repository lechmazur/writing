<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elian’s desire to “capture” the dream is declared, not embodied; no contradictory impulse complicates it. The only micro-choice—breathing in rhythm—remains abstract; we never feel his body under threat or taste the cost of failure. The ending’s “home” for the dream grants him what he sought without foreclosing a path or exacting visible price, so the arc lands as observation, not earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror dome lets the dream stay, the orchard stays ruined, and the sextant is whole—cost is conceptual, not visceral, but legible. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: breathing cycles + glass shards + fog density build to pattern-shift rather than because/therefore chain; this lens is taught early and holds. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. The sextant’s calibration is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fog is not backdrop—it limits visibility, forces tactile work, and becomes the medium in which the dream-bird moves. The broken sextant’s brass gleam and frost-rimmed cobbles are filtered through a glass-grinder’s eye, giving micro-setting authority. Final image of “glass mountains rising where only ruins existed” reuses the shard motif to reconfigure space, passing the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the dream return?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density: each exhale thickens the fog-glass interface, narrowing possibility from scattered shards to sealed dome. No reversal or price is exacted from Elian; the dream simply alights. Escalation is textural, not tactical, so the beat feels like deepening atmosphere rather than risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries emerges through fused glass and sextant rather than statement. Final image reweights the premise: boundaries are not destroyed but made permeable at will—conceptual cost is that the orchard remains ruined under glass mountains, implying permanence of loss. No moral is stated; resonance is visual. The astronomer’s absence keeps theme oblique, perhaps too oblique for full punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s perceptual grid: “his hands, calloused from decades of grinding glass” is a maker’s tactile vocabulary. Syntax lengthens during the ritual, then shortens at release, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds a craftsman’s lexicon. Distinctive, consistent, and pressure-responsive—meets 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “shards of mirror glass he had collected from abandoned houses, each piece holding fragments of reflected fog” does three jobs—backstory, setting, metaphor—in one breath. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors (pale ghosts, prismatic wings) stay coherent within light-and-glass physics. Rhythm modulates from frost-bitten crispness to dome-sealing hush without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing celestial navigation with mirror-making to catch a runaway dream is a fresh synthesis; the sextant-as-dream-lodestone feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high—quantum alchemy in under 800 words—but pattern is taught early and pays off visually. Orchard-ruins-plus-fog is familiar, yet glass mountains refract it into new light. Not quite 9+ because the emotional stakes remain abstract; nevertheless, a memorable speculative miniature.</comment>
