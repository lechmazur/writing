<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and character-specific; the glass eyes act as embodied contradiction between grief and methodical hope. The final renunciation—“perhaps the ambiguity wasn’t a problem to be solved but a space to inhabit”—is earned by the iterative nightly trials and crystallizes a visible cost (tears sizzling on stone). Minor over-articulation of “mathematics of emotion” flirts with diagnostic label-speak but is immediately grounded in tactile ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic reconfigures meaning of loss without solving the disappearance, cost paid by the steam from tears and the altered weight of the eyes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of drip, pulse, and shifting tile deepens until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift: who, where, stakes planted by word 80. No causality breaks; every return to the orchard adds density rather than mere repetition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Cavern orchard is not backdrop but apparatus: bioluminescent fruit powers the glass eyes, drips supply the “mathematics,” chipped mosaic routes the ritual. Micro-setting (stepping stone) literally shapes the final reconfiguration—patterns migrate as the stance shifts. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elian’s conjurer priorities—sound of silence at moon-zenith triggers action. Environment constrains and enables every beat; without it the spell collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—convert ambiguous loss into soluble equation—tightens when each nightly iteration fails until the final reframe. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive: droplet, pulse, pattern shift. Single meaningful deepening at climax: realization that ambiguity is habitat, not puzzle, forecloses the path of endless experiment with visible cost (tears evaporating). Agency remains interior yet decisive under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of measurement—grief quantified becomes grief accepted when the metric itself mutates. Glass eyes migrate from forensic evidence to lenses for inhabiting uncertainty. No moralizing; final image (eyes linked by light threads) reweights prior material without exposition. Subtext of sibling bond lives in silence and object, never declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—attention to drip cadence, mineral scent, tile ridges. Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual tempo; diction favors alchemical precision (“dovetail,” “bioluminescence”) yet stays within conjurer lexicon. No dialogue, so voice remains pure sub-vocal chant; rhythm mirrors drip pattern. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated—each sentence performs dual labor (atmosphere + causality). Figurative layer is controlled: only one sustained metaphor cluster (mathematics = grief map) and it pays off. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Final third is clean—no artifact touches closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward silence-then-shift without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geomancy, grief-coding, and bioluminescent horticulture feels sui generis. “Mathematics of emotion” risks concept-gimmick yet is saved by tactile execution—droplets as data, tile chips as variables. Risk taken: no external plot, purely accumulative interior arc; coherence under pressure validates experiment. Fresh inflection at closure—loss as inhabitable space—reconfigures familiar bereavement narrative.</comment>
