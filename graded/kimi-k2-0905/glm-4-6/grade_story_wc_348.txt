<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—dreaming of biomedical polymers yet bound by corporate patents—grounds every beat; the “loosened grief” image is embodied in the tactile pocketing of the chrysalis. Her micro-choice to trace river foam until the polymer variant insight arrives is credible, specific, and alters tactics. The brother remains off-stage, so status/relationship crucible is muted, but the self-split is sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she kneels at the ravine, she sees the chrysalis → follows braids → reads foam → conceives variant; therefore the corporate barrier is bypassed. Closure lands on-page as she hands Marco the new polymer—visible cost is the legal risk she now shoulders. Persistent constraint (patent) shapes tactics throughout; no causality breaks. Orientation anchors by line 4; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Braided ravine, foam islands, and chrysalis shell are rendered through polymer-chemist perception—chromatography analogy is POV-specific. The micro-setting (pocketed chrysalis) is carried forward and literally charges the final image when she palms it in the lab. Weather/terrain affect pacing: moss-slick stones keep her kneeling long enough to watch foam long enough to spark insight. Spatial choreography clean; no credibility errors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver therapy to Marco without breaching patent—signaled by paragraph 4. Tightening beat: “sometimes the divergent path isn’t a choice … but a synthesis” crystallizes the ethical trade-off and forecloses resignation. Cost is concrete: she risks litigation and career ruin; the polymer she hands him is legally “unencumbered” yet personally endangers her. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis emerges organically from chrysalis → foam → polymer variant; no character articulates “people can change.” Subtext lies in the river foam’s separations-rejoinings mirroring her split loyalties. Final image of wildflowers in ravine crevices offers non-literal answer: synthesis, not sacrifice, lets life root in former fracture. Complexity intact—corporate contract still looms, so moral is not tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elena’s perceptual filter—synesthetic “symphonically minded” diction recurs but remains coherent. Syntax flexes with pressure: short declaratives at insight moment (“Sometimes … synthesis”) mimic mental click. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. No head-hopping; focalization stable. Metaphor chain (chromatography, symphony, foam) is internally consistent and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; most sentences advance both image and causality. Minor scaffold: “the polymer chemist…,” “the symphonically minded chemist…” repeated openers create template cadence (−0.2). Figurative density high but patterned early, so allowed. No mixed metaphors; river/foam logic stays physical. Final line avoids explain-everything; ends on image. Clean grammar and pronoun reference.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of polymer science with metamorphic imagery feels fresh; chrysalis-as-catalyst and foam-as-method avoid stock lab epiphany. Risk: lyric science-heavy opening, but payoff justifies. Synthesis-of-divergence reframes familiar ethical dilemma without retreat. Detail specificity (patent law nuance, chromatography analogy) individuates the concept. Not 9+ because premise core (scientist breaks rules to save sibling) is recognizable even if execution is elevated.</comment>
