<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet ritualism and embodied tremor give interior contradiction; the inkwell-as-grandfather-proxy and archival urge feel lived-in and motive-deep. Cost is visible when he pockets the final note knowing water will erase it again—Earned Stasis with felt price. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets NA; single-POV interiority stays specific, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy (archive vs. surrender to tide) drives every beat; flaw (obsessive retrospection) compounds and is accepted, not cured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lodged note layers density, cadence tightens toward “wound slowly closing.” Closure is Charged Poise—drawbridge descending reconfigures meaning, cost legible in widening water-gap. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleport props;因果 chain clean (note-placement ritual → future divers → present stoic endure). One shard only, inside 800 w; single meaningful tightening sufficient. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early via “notes like archaeological markers.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Body (trembling hands), tool (inkwell), and micro-setting (hollow under staircase) actively constrain where Elias can kneel and write, charging the final image. Sensory triage—glass shards reflecting sunset on his face—mirrors internal bruise without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography immaculate; drawbridge mechanics accurate, river level change causal, not decorative. Idiom era-appropriate; proper-noun economy tight; weather literally alters timetable—classic 9+ gate met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can he preserve memory before water reclaims it; signaled in line 5. Escalation is accretive: each note placed = one more future voice vs. obliteration; final note (acoustic specs) deepest layer, narrows option to stop—he chooses endurance. Cost visible: “gap widening… like a wound” as bridge drops—felt price paid. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; one tightening suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: submerged architecture = memory architecture; no explicit thesis. Final image reweights prior motifs—water closing over notes is living oblivion, not tragedy. Subtext in gesture: inkwell brass etched with faded maps = memory itself fading. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers—will anyone ever read these markers? Concrete aftereffect: reader feels archival futility yet necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly lashed to Elias’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction maritime, tactile, slightly antique (“wedging his fingers,” “water retreated”) consistent with generational tool. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for calm survey, clipped fragments when horn sounds. No filter-verb stacks; psych-distance stable. Free indirect clean: “he imagined the hundreds…” anchors thought in scene action. Voice distinct enough to be unmistakable in blind excerpt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (anchor, characterize, foreshadow). Figurative language selective—metaphors (crystalline puzzle, bruised canvas) paid off by mirrored glass flare at end. Zero paraphrase loops; no template cadence. Strong verbs (“wrest,” “wedged,” “swirling”) carry motion. Minor register lift “conceptual repricing” fits surveyor’s archive mindset. Opening line arresting; final line cadence resolves with echographic click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: flood-dam archaeology as elegiac ritual; not common trope. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off via charged final image. Specificity of 1937 wedding, acoustic architect journals keeps it from generic ruin-porn. Transformation test fails if swapped to any flooded site; inkwell lineage and grand-daughter photo root it uniquely. Slight familiarity of “notes for future” device caps below 8.5.</comment>
