<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shael’s interior contradiction—shadow-laced yet empathetically open—remains credible under pressure; the calm intuition trait enables the micro-choice to press the final shard, but the lack of any visible physical or emotional cost after reconstitution blunts the earned-change punch. Still, the anomaly identity and paradoxical nature are dramatized, not merely labeled, sustaining high-band character work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror glimpse thickens the empathic density until the crystal re-forms, delivering a Conceptual Repricing (“Equality”) that visibly reweights prior images; cost is legible in the orchard’s shudder and the Council’s unanswered wonder. No causality breaks; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard, spiral crystal trees, and groaning ice floes are rendered through Shael’s selective perception; the recurring crystal fragment and vintage mirrors constrain every tactical move and charge the final reconfiguration. Sensory economy favors haptic/reflective detail over visual catalog, sustaining momentum while rooting the fantastical in lived tactility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Single dominant stake—restore balance before the Convergence breath expires—tightens through each mirror beat; the final shard-press is agency-driven and forecloses the path of detached observation. Cost is felt via orchard shudder, but internal price (fatigue, memory bleed) stays abstract, keeping the escalation just shy of 8.8+ clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of empathy-as-equilibrium emerges from the crystal’s accumulated centuries and the two-children image; no moral is stated. The re-pricing lands through the reconstituted orb rather than an articulated thesis, achieving resonant ambiguity without drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person limited clings to Shael’s perceptual signature—shadow-stitched, calm-intuitive—without leakage; patterned diction (“shadow-laced,” “weighted breath”) teaches its cadence early and pays off in the final whisper. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on syntax and metaphor, both disciplined.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High information density: each sentence layers mirror, memory, and emotional charge; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective (“crystalline tears”) and never muddles causality; final line resolves by image, not exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Premise fuses dimensional peacekeeper with empathic scrying via Venice-chapel ice tears—specific synthesis rather than stock trope. Risky structural choice (lyric accumulative shards) heightens resonance without obscuring closure; transformation test passes—story collapses if “equality” image removed.</comment>
