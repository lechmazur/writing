<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but drifts into performed sorrow; the “shyly unstoppable” tag recycles three times without fresh contradiction. The centuries-long lifespan is asserted, never tested by physical limits or memory decay, so the final smile feels unearned. Micro-choices are few—mostly tracing and kneeling—so agency stays poetic, not crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: blossom absorbs pain and reweights the postcard’s promise, cost felt in the hush of insomnia ending. Causality is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore; lens stays Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early via refrains. Orientation anchor (“the insomniac poet traced…”) arrives inside 50 words, so no penalty. Time-span hand-wave (“across centuries”) is magical-realist premise, not breakage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Shell, cliff, reef-shadow sea, postcard ink—each re-appears to constrain or mirror emotion; the postcard’s galactic swirl physically redirects the poet onto the cliff. Sensory triad is selective (visual, haptic, auditory lullabies) rather than checklist. Micro-setting rule met: postcard charges final image by becoming the blossom’s twin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will pain ever bloom into beauty?—is declared early; pressure deepens via insomnia, drafts, postcard glow, blossom apparition. One tightening beat: fingertip touch dissolves hoarded pain, foreclosing perpetual sorrow. Cost is emotional (awe replaces ache), but no tangible loss alters later tactics; centuries of endurance function as mythic stasis, not escalating trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “blossom armistice” reframing pain as luminescence; no final-paragraph thesis states the moral. Subtext lives in silence—the missing lovers, kingdoms unnamed—letting solitude speak. Ambiguity remains: is the truce permanent or cyclical? Resonance is imagistic, not tidy, satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-ornate yet consistent: long breathless cadences mirror insomnia; diction (“reef-shadow joy,” “star-eyed traveler”) stays inside poet’s lexicon. No dialogue to distort. Repetition of “shyly unstoppable” is deliberate motif, not template churn. Psychic distance compresses at climax—short sentences as blossom flares—then relaxes at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“ink swirling like nebulae”) so penalty waived; no mixed vehicles. Paraphrase loops appear (“pain bloomed into constellations” vs “photosynthesize pain into beauty”)—same concept twice, −0.2. Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; opening and closing lines are sharp. Overwriting stays on lyric side of line, never opaque.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of centuries-scale elegy with reef-shell micro-cosm is fresh; postcard-as-compass and blossom-as-truce avoid stock fantasy objects. Conceptual risk: pain-into-light photosynthesis could read self-help, but specificity of insomnia, shell acoustics, and “off-key wind” grounds it. Transformation test passes—emotional arc depends on postcard’s galactic ink and shell’s resonance.</comment>
