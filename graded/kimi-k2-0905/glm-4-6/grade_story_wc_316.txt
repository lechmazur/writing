<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ego-death numbness vs. clone-emotion polarity is embodied in gesture and jar-contact; the “searing reality” at the end pays the cost. Interiority flirts with diagnostic labels (“emotional numbness”) but converts them into synapse-firing imagery. Micro-choice chain—slam jar, pour will, accept solitude—earns the stance. Clone dissolves too cleanly for full 8+; no lingering physical echo of their grip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Kael vivifies, therefore clone destabilizes; because clone vanishes, Kael inherits unshared truth. Closure is Earned Stasis—he cradles the glowing jar, foreclosing reunion, cost = “alone with the truth.” Orientation is taught via disorientation (void, fraying stars) and pays off in stabilized night. One logic bump: brain’s legal authority to decide existence is asserted, not seeded, but the emotional beat overrides the gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Floating rock and void function as micro-setting: edge-drop constrains foot placement, jar pedestal anchors fight geometry. Sensory triage under crisis—cold feet, slosh of “dead sea,” warm glass—filters through Kael’s survival priorities. History-rewind is shown via star realignment, not told. Environment does not charge final image as tightly as jar itself, capping at 7.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Single stake—right to exist without copy-ache—tightens when vivification narrows options to “only one synapse pattern can pulse.” Clone’s taunt escalates stakes from custody to erasure; Kael’s counter escalates from defense to usurpation. Cost is legible: clone’s blur-dissolve and Kael’s permanent solitude. Escalation plateaus after mid-scene; no second tightening turn, so stops at 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of authenticity after fragmentation emerges via jar’s relabeling from “duplicate” to de-facto original. Subtext in clone’s final fugue face conveys loss without moral sermon. Final image reweights premise: victory = solitary custodianship of self, not wholeness. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in jar’s quiet hum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature favors tactile void cold and synapse glow. Rhythm accelerates under short clauses during vivification beat, then exhales into longer reflective cadence. No head-hopping; clone’s interior accessed only through Kael’s reading of its flicker. Filter verbs minimal; “brain sloshing like a dead sea” is POV-apt simile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: “history rewriting itself, stars realigning” compresses cosmic stakes without exposition. Mixed metaphors minimal; “cold blanket of numbness” is stock but isolated. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. One adjectival stack (“perfect, steady beat”) in closure beat but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Brain-custody as proxy for self-custody twists clichéd clone fight into ontological duel. Premise is familiar, but execution marries void dojo, synapse vivification, and ego-death aftermath into fresh texture. Risk in abstract stakes lands because body-jar contact grounds the conflict. Not quite 9+ because clone’s dissolution leans on light-show rather than previously seeded rule.</comment>
