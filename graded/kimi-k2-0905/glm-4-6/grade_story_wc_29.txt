<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s isolation and scientific conviction are sketched efficiently, but her interiority stays largely expository (“cautiously hopeful” is told, not embodied). The stakes register intellectually yet never bite into her body or routine—no sleepless twitch, no hunger pang, no risk to a valued relationship—so the micro-choices feel lightweight. Closure is a functional Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is external (community manipulation ends) rather than personal, keeping the arc more premise than person.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Structure is causal and linear: signal anomaly → decoding → counter-measure → silence. The reveal that signals adapt to human interpretation is a sharp pivot (Q2 9+ cost test met: “the patterns subtly changed whenever different interpretations gained media traction”). Orientation is clean within 120 words; no seams or loops. The jamming payoff is set up early with the subsonic tech, so the climax feels earned, not contrived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting is efficiently anchored—“dim glow of the university radio station's control room”—and the astronomical charts function as a tactile tool handled in multiple beats. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual), but selectivity matches the POV’s professional filter. The station never constrains her physically (no locked doors, budget cuts, eavesdropping colleagues), so environment stays backdrop rather than pressure. Micro-setting qualifies; no 9+ gate charge because charts don’t reconfigure in the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect humanity from manipulative cosmic signals—is declared early and escalates through data loss, academic infighting, and communal unrest. The subsonic jamming is a decisive, irreversible act that forecloses her covert access and risks career exposure (visible cost: “any direct transmission would be traced”). Escalation is single-track but sufficient for 700-word scale. Coincidence is absent; tension tightens because her own success erases the evidence that justified it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: weaponized narrative vs. evidence-based truth. The story resists sermonizing—no character spells out “truth matters.” Instead, the theme accrues through the responsive signal patterns and Elara’s quiet sabotage. The final silence reweights earlier noise, offering a resonant non-verbal answer. Complexity is present (human gullibility is part of the equation), but the piece stops short of indicting any single faction, leaving ambiguity that feels intentional rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara with consistent scientific diction (“celestial signal interpreter,” “cross-referenced the transmissions”). Rhythm is steady, slightly clinical, mirroring the POV’s observational bent. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on interior texture; occasional elevated phrases (“ethereal grit”) flirt with register drift but remain within her academic lexicon. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat; perceptual signature is coherent if not dazzling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, information-dense, and largely free of loops or scaffold. A few template cadences (“the patterns subtly changed whenever…”) recur, but they serve as signal-leitmotif rather than artifact. Metaphors are sparse and unobtrusive; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-based economy. A stray adjective stack (“ethereal grit”) is the only micro-purple moment; it doesn’t blur causality or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise reframes SETI trope as psy-op by cosmic pranksters—fresh angle executed without camp. The responsive-signal mechanic is a clever inversion of the “message from benevolent aliens” cliché. Internal logic holds: tricksters exploit interpretive bias, Elara exploits their oversight of subsonics. Specificity is high (Cygnus X-1 coordinates, subsonic jamming physics). Risk is moderate—quiet ending, no body-horror or twist—but coherence and conceptual punch outweigh spectacle.</comment>
