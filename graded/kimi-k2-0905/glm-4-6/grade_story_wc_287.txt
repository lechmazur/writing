<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gardener’s protected vulnerability and wistful pragmatism are credibly embodied in his midnight mirror-work; his micro-adjustments with the bitting gauge tooth reveal a quiet hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. Interior contradiction is present—he both accepts winter’s bleakness and fights it—yet the arc stays modest: endurance rather than transformation. Because no other character shares the scene, the relationship crucible is absent, but the solitary stance feels earned. The final image of neighbors unknowingly continuing his craft shows cost (his invisibility) and is legible under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors’ glow reconfigures the building’s winter life; the cost is the gardener’s perpetual anonymity—felt when the superintendent mimics him without credit. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reflective node adds density until the final moon-to-morning cadence shift reweights the stake. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One micro-turn—2:17 AM alignment—suffices. Causality intact: because he installs mirrors, light reaches the alley; because neighbors notice, the ethic spreads.</comment>

<comment>Fire-escape micro-setting and the bitting gauge tool constrain every adjustment; harbor moonlight is filtered through gardener’s nautical attention, not postcard catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—rust, height, angle tracked across moves. Weather (winter’s approach) tightens the timeline and justifies the light-capture quest. The final image of multiplied mirrors recharges the luminous harbor motif without overt symbolism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—ward off spiritual winter darkness—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each mirror increases cumulative glow, tightening the felt need for secrecy. No external antagonist; pressure is seasonal and social (eccentricity risk). Cost is legible: sleepless labor, invisible authorship, and the gardener’s acceptance of being unthanked. The superintendent’s joining affirms stakes have scaled beyond the protagonist.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: communal care can be wordless, propagated by reflected light rather than sermon. Subtext resides in the bitting gauge—precision born of lock-picking repurposed for generosity. Final image reweights “after the final petal drops” from loss to generative continuity. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in who deserves credit.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to gardener’s perceptions—spectacle frames, calloused fingertips, moon-angle math. Diction (“wistfully pragmatic,” “protected vulnerability”) risks abstraction but is redeemed by concrete tool-use. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for harbor gaze, staccato for drill-mounting. No dialogue, avoiding register mismatch. Voice remains consistent across lyric and mechanical beats.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with only one paraphrase loop (“luminous harbor by moonlight” echoed twice). Metaphors stay coherent—boats like corks, moonbeams redirected. No filter-verb stacks. One template cadence in “working with the rhythm of oars in water” repeated, but it is motif-driven and taught early. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting image carry weight.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—clandestine fire-escape light-harvest—feels fresh against familiar winter-grief trope. Bitting gauge tooth as precision instrument for generosity is specific and non-obvious. Transformation test passes: story collapses without mirror-network logistics. Risk taken in quiet, non-confrontational arc; payoff is communal diffusion rather than personal triumph. Slight deduction for sentimental neighbor-mirror echo, but offset by harbor specificity.</comment>
