<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her trembling hands, the phantom ache of absent scent—and the screw’s discovery forces a credible shift from numb endurance to active remembrance. The moment she traces the inscription, her stance toward her own grief reconfigures with visible cost: she weeps, then steadies to repair the clock. Motivation stays character-bound; no knowledge leaks. The only minor slack is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she had fixed herself”) that slightly over-articulates the epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: each droplet, scratch, and glint of brass adds density until the inscription reframes the grandmother’s entire history. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—cedar’s ghost arrives as felt cost, not declaration. Orientation is secure inside the workshop within 50 words; no caps triggered. The screw’s payoff is seeded early and re-weights the stake at the end with undeniable poignancy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The workshop’s mist, grime-streaked light, and ticking water constrain Elara’s narrowed perception; the screw’s dimples and worn threads act as micro-landscape that literally redirects her attention. Sensory selection is POV-driven—visual fracture replaces the lost olfactory world. No exposition dumps; spatial choreography is clean. The final image of retreating fog is tethered to the emotional unclenching, earning the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she re-enter life without smell?—tightens when the screw’s inscription forces a choice: keep grieving or appropriate the grandmother’s “ordinary miracles.” The single deepening is sufficient; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is legible: she forfeits her refuge of numbness, signalled by steady hands returning to the wrench. Pressure accrues under the accumulative lens rather than causal reversals, meeting the lens-governed bar for escalation.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: water drops, thread-worn screw, cedar ghost. No moralizing—just the final inhalation that re-prices prior emptiness. The grandmother’s transmutation of loss into delivered life quietly asks whether Elara can do likewise, leaving plausible counter-readings. The trembling calm modulates into steady hope without sentimentality, landing a resonant after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly wound to Elara’s perceptual quirks—light fracturing like scent once did. Syntax breathes with her breath: short clauses under the loupe, longer cadences as memory floods. No head-hopping; diction stays within her artisan lexicon. The lyric repetition of “drip” and “fog” is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances image or emotional state. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (mist like sigh, screw as map). Opening and closing lines bracket the arc with sonic echo. A single passive clause (“the water clock…was here”) is strategically placed to slow the beat before revelation; otherwise verbs are strong. No artifact intrudes on the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: anosmic aromatherapist × water-clock restorer × midwife’s screw as emotional map. The concept of “reading between the lines” is literalized through etched initials and scratched metal ridges. Familiar grief-recovery arc is re-inflected by the olfactory loss and horological metaphor, making the ordinary miracle feel newly minted. Risk—lyric stillness instead of dramatic showdown—pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
