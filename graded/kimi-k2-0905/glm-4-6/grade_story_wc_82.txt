<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession is palpably embodied—every flex of finger on quartz vibrates with grief—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic shorthand (“a delusion, a beautiful madness”) that momentarily cools the forge of his contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crane’s polish thickens the pattern of loss until the final Charged Poise where seventeen quartz spectres refract the basilica light, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—he can keep making light, but her shadow will never return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating isle, glass basilica, tea garden, lapidary bench—each surface is sensuously exploited: the isle’s rock supplies raw quartz, the basilica’s rainbows calibrate polish angles, the dew-slick table steadies the fracture tool; environment actively limits and enables every micro-choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reassemble Liora’s dream—tightens through tangible attrition: every crane steals another sliver of memory, visible in the dwindling detail he can still recall; the escalation is felt as increasing blur in his interior lens rather than external reversal, sufficient under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The luminous torment of art-as-exhumation emerges wordlessly: grief is not named but crystallised into countable cranes; closure image of a constellation that cannot resurrect enacts a Conceptual Repricing—art’s transcendence bought with irreversible memory-depletion—without ever sermonising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lapidary in both senses: sentences facet and catch light (“the polish rose in a fine dust, glittering”) while psychic distance contracts under pressure; no head-hop, no filter-fat, and the diction never exceeds a craftsman’s lexicon—perfect alignment of perceptual signature and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm courses from long gleaming clauses to staccato chip-“click” of fracture; occasional metaphor density in the middle third (lantern/sun imagery) nudges the upper limit but never stalls propulsion; copy is clean, no loops, no mixed vehicles—only a single paraphrase echo (“luminous torment” repeated) costs a tenth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing lapidary craft with origami and dream-taxidermy is fresh; the quartz-crane-as-souvenir feels inevitable yet unexampled. Minor risk: the “detaching shadow” device flirts with Gothic trope, but the physics of memory-polish re-configure it into something story-specific and haunting.</comment>
