<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orion’s interiority is sharply particular—"jocular mask he wore as deftly as any field uniform"—and his loneliness is embodied (vacuum in chest) rather than labeled. The contradictory impulse to barter moon rock for connection while insisting on vanishing is dramatized in-scene. Final renunciation—staying still to listen—carries visible cost: the logistician who moves supplies must forfeit motion. Micro-choice hierarchy (moon fragment vs. auditory world) reweights values with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he feels owed reciprocity, therefore he offers moon rock; because woman refuses direct cure, therefore ladder ascent becomes inevitable; because he listens, loneliness is reconfigured. Closure is Earned Stasis—he forecloses the quest path with conceptual cost: "visitor, not a resident." Persistent constraint (moon fragment left behind) shapes future seekers, charging final image. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Disused station overgrown with ivy constrains movement—rusty ladder is only upward path—and charges final acoustic revelation. Micro-setting (cupola as resonant chamber) functions as tool that converts sterile moon shard into audible world. Sensory hierarchy filters through logistician’s disaster-trained ear, narrowing to heartbeat then expanding to city hum. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from platform to dome; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cure loneliness via reciprocal exchange—tightens when moon payment fails to yield person, forcing ascent. One meaningful deepening: external quest switches to internal attention; cost is forfeited mobility and relinquished moon fragment. Escalation causal: each failed transaction narrows option field until only listening remains. Price visible on page: "logistician...had to learn how to stay still."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: barter culture of disaster relief collapses when loneliness demands non-transactional attention. Subtext in woman’s smile—"impossible riddle"—implies cures can’t be swapped. Final image reframes prior moon rock as sterile currency against living soundscape. No moralizing; resonance carried by acoustic flip from vacuum to symphony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains crisp logistician filter: "straps fraying like his patience." Distinct perceptual signature—disaster jargon, geological recall, auditory cataloging—stays consistent. Free indirect cleanly handles "he decided, was the universe finally settling a debt." No head-hopping; woman’s dialogue idiom remains external, maintaining POV modesty. Rhythm accelerates with fragmented ascent, then breathes into cupola silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors climb: short declaratives during ladder ascent, longer flowing lines inside dome. No loops or scaffold; each line advances knowledge or atmosphere—"smelled of damp earth and rust" doubles as sensory and metaphor. Figurative language sparse, precise: "vacuum in his chest" sustains celestial motif. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs—"he scanned," "he forfeited"—propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—loneliness cured by listening in abandoned station—feels fresh against trope of found object. Moon rock as failed currency flipped to acoustic toll is specific inflection. Risk taken: minimal external plot, interior pivot; coherence maintained. Slight dock for recognizable "wise crone" archetype, though her function as waypoint-swapper subverts expectation.</comment>
