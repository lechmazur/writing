<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied deafness—feeling the phonograph’s scrape through boots, palms, ribs—makes every micro-choice a percussion of need. The broken-needle filing is a visible, tactile ritual that externalizes her interior contradiction: crave sensation yet fear damage. Her final palm-press on the spinning disc is a decisive, costly act that fractures numbness; the price—ruined grooves, bleeding shellac—is felt on the page. No diagnostic self-talk; the body speaks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the filament snaps, the cavern stays muted, yet Elara’s stance is re-weighted—“messy, painful throb of existence” is the conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tactile vibration layers density until the pattern break (needle rasp → internal crack) re-tunes stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no debt. The persistent constraint—deafness—shapes every tactic and is re-priced in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern is not backdrop but resonating chamber: slack drum skins act as acoustic dampers, the bench’s wood-shaving carpet supplies tactile grit, the stone floor conducts bass-line tremors into Elara’s feet. Micro-setting—the phonograph turntable—functions as fulcrum: its vibrations constrain her hand placement, timing, and final palm-press risk. Spatial choreography is immaculate: needle, disc, bench, boots track without drift. Weather’s “faint rustle of turning seasons” is acoustic curtain, absorbed into muted hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break emotional numbness—tightens through tactile escalation: each grittier vibration demands greater physical complicity until palm-on-disc risks ruin. Agency is sensory, not verbal: filing the needle, boot-soles as antennae, palm-press that forecloses sterility. Cost is viscous and audible—the grooved destruction Elara feels under her skin. One meaningful intensification suffices; the final ache is undeniable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inverted sound as metaphor for retrograde grief: to feel backward is still to feel. No thesis spoken; the ruined record becomes an unspoken answer to numbness. Subtext hinges on gesture—hand on spinning decay—implying art’s need includes willingness to damage the medium. Final image reweights premise: silence is not absence but raw, unfiltered vibration re-priced as survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, percussive: “filament of hush,” “jagged journey of the needle,” syntax jittering like scratched shellac. Perceptual signature is deaf-accurate: attention gravitates to vibration, friction, floor-conducted bass—never sound as air-pressure. No head-hopping; single POV stays inside her skin. Rhythm accelerates with filing-scrape sentences, then slows for the final spun-out ache—prose as ventriloquist of bone-conducted music.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level density: one sentence conducts three jobs—e.g., “She pressed her palm flat against the spinning record, feeling the jagged journey of the needle as a frantic, buzzing text” shows action, tactile metaphor, and stakes. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; each adjective earns place. Figurative logic stays physical: “buzzing text” marries sound-as-touch to literary trope without rupture. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“defiantly beating heart”) that recharges “filament” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—deaf musician curing numbness with backward records via bone conduction—is non-obvious synthesis. Risk: crude needle destroys medium to heal self, turning audiophile sacrament into self-wounding sacrament. Specificity of drum-cavern acoustics and shellac test-discs anchors freshness. Transformation test fails if Elara is swapped out; deafness is prerequisite for entire sensory logic. Bold yet coherent; no retreat from damage-as-cure ethic.</comment>
