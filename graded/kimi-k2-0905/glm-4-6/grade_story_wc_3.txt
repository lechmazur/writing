<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is textured—cuneiform mind-set, embodied awe at the seed—but the “kindly methodical” trait is announced, not pressure-tested; no micro-choice reveals a cost for being kind. The decisive gesture of planting the seed feels more conceptual than character-forced; we are told it honors Hamid, yet her contradictory impulse (risk the station? risk her life?) stays off-page. Still, the analogical thinking is lived in perception and lends her a perceptual signature that lifts the score to high-band edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s instantaneous bloom re-weights death as continuation, cost felt in the final image (“constellations of information”). Causal lens holds: because she translates seed-patterns with cuneiform logic, therefore she dares to plant—one tightening move. Orientation is clean (anchored by 60 words); single reflective block obeys BRR and tilts present stance. Slight deduction for soft transition into planting beat—choice summarized, not dramatized—but the reconfiguration is legible and charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor is more than postcard: metallic trees, zero-g soil, and humming fields actively enable the seed experiment and mirror the in-between state of transition. Sensory economy favors Maris’s translator eye—crystalline patterns, whispering light—details filtered through her epistemic hunger. The arbor’s force-field boundary recurs in the final image, now charged with new meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only minor slack: altitude effects (breathing, cold) invoked but never constrain her movement or decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the seed before grief erodes purpose—is signaled early; pressure tightens when germination happens in minutes, foreclosing the option to wait for safety protocols. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she trades certainty for a leap into unknown continuation. Under causal lens this is sufficient, but the absence of external risk (station failure, authority, etc.) keeps escalation intellectual, not visceral, capping high-band entry. Agency is present yet abstract—she kneels and communes, but no tangible price is dramatized on her body or future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: translation as survival—cuneiform, seed, grief—all re-cast transition not as loss but encoding. No explicit thesis; final image of “constellations of information” offers non-literal answer to mortality. Subtext resides in silence after Hamid’s departure, felt as “touching distance,” a mood that modulates into wonder. Score peaks because the speculative botany and Mesopotamian analogy interlock without meta-commentary, letting theme rise from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maris’s scholarly diction—“epistemic hunger,” “analogical thinking”—syntax calm, slightly formal, matching methodical temperament. Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees light as “whispering promises,” roots as “encoding information.” No dialogue, so no convergence risk; register stable. Minor lift for rhythmic control in the final paragraph where clauses telescope upward like the growing branches, echoing content.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “metallic leaves grew from suspended soil” packs world, image, and stakes in one stroke. Few filters, no synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (transition = translation). One scaffold trace—“the touching distance she felt from Hamid”—is repeated in closing line; intentional echo earns waiver, but still slightly dulls sonic freshness. Otherwise clean grammar, varied sentence lengths, and strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cuneiform philology with quantum-botanic afterlife is fresh; seed that encodes transition physics feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Tropes (isolation sky-lab, haunted mentor) are re-inflected through linguistic analogy and speculative agronomy. Risk is taken: quiet, concept-driven closure instead of spectacle, and it pays off. Slight deduction for thematic echo of “everything transforms” that skirts universality cliché, but specificity of knowledge fruit recharges the idea.</comment>
