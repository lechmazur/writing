<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior life is palpable—“tactfully hopeful” beats show in micro-choices—but no on-page contradiction forces a visible renunciation; Elias’s stance softens yet never stakes a path he must relinquish, so closure lacks a felt cost paid by character flaw, capping 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens openly taught by dust patterns; closure is a CR where the button-drawing pairing reweights hope and gives Elias a new mandate—cost is the unending archive task he now shoulders, seen in “quiet click” Charged Poise; causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Foster file room is the whole world: dust swipe orientates, ledger weight constrains Elias’s posture, fluorescent hum times solitude; micro-object (ledger spine) guides first curiosity and later archival sleeving, meeting 9+ environmental constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—rescue forgotten kindness—is steadily tightened through each found marginalium; agency tracks Elias’s archival sleuthing, but escalation is incremental pattern-build rather than a single high-cost turn, so pressure is coherent yet modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around invisible kindness as archival palimpsest; no explicit thesis—meaning arises from the lift of button-to-eagle image that reconfigures foster-care narrative into quiet heroism; final image offers conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close diction carries Elias’s gentle precision—“reverence usually reserved for sacred texts”—without slipping into archivist jargon; rhythm swells at discovery then settles with closure-earned hush; no head-hopping, voice texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Syntactic variety carries information double-duty; “accumulated dust patterns wrote their own stories” marries tactile detail to metaphor without overwriting; near-zero filter verbs, no scaffold loops, climax line unmarred by figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise rescues bureaucratic paperwork as spiritual quest; button-ledger discovery pattern feels inevitable in hindsight; could edge higher if foster-system critique bit deeper, yet angle of kindness-through-dust is fresh and risk-takes pay off under lens.</comment>
