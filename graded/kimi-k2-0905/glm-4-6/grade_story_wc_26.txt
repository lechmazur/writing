<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “luminous regret” felt in her chest is specific. Motivation is legible—preserve hope by re-binding shadows—and intensifies across beats. Micro-choice at the river stone (activating resonance chamber) is concrete, though the final “constant vigilance” stance is declared not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts perpetual vigilance with visible cost (“luminous regret” carried forward). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dissolving hope/chip shadows tightens until library reconfiguration crystallizes new equilibrium. One soft spot: causal leap from “play stone at proper shadow frequencies” to full metamorphosis is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (river stone) constrains the climax: its resonance enables the re-binding. Sensory selection is POV-driven—“scent of blooming knowledge” noticed only by a dusk noticer. Spatial choreography is clean as Elara moves from window to velvet box to viewing chamber. Library-as-organism evolves with plot—branches turning inward is an environmental choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep shadows attached by preserving hope. Tightening occurs when Elara realizes hope literally fragments; cost is felt as “luminous regret.” Agency is methodical—she integrates new protocols and accepts lifelong burden. Pressure plate is single but sufficient for this length; option space narrows to “vigilance or loss.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern—shadows once bound, now drifting—rather than thesis. Final image of stone etched with recovered dreams reweights prior motif without moralizing. Some abstraction around “hope’s shape” flirts with pseudo-profundity but stays anchored to concrete library changes. Ambiguity lingers: can vigilance truly hold darkness? Unanswered, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—“sharp-eyed dusk noticer” filters every notice. Sentence rhythm breathes with her deliberate gait; cadence slows during contemplation, accelerates slightly at metamorphosis. No head-hopping; lexicon remains within her plausible diction. Filter verbs (“she noticed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—“shadows stretched like fingers” stays physical. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (worldbuild + emotion). Minor scaffold: “luminous regret” is repeated twice; could vary diction but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Shareable dreams → detachable shadows” is a fresh causal hinge. River stone as hope-crystal recorder feels invented yet inevitable. Conceptual risk—library rewrites itself—pays off by making setting an actor. Avoids stock dystopia; instead, quiet cosmic maintenance becomes heroic.</comment>
