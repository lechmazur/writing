<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—ex-rebel hunger for truth vs curatorial need for control—are dramatized in every mirror-covering gesture; the final renunciation of academic validation is earned and costly. Interiority stays embodied (“hands that still remembered the shape of a protest sign”) and avoids diagnostic jargon. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: he forfeits institutional credit to protect the shard’s living memory. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics off the page, capping excellence at 8.9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s humble origin rewrites imperial history with undeniable social cost—curators’ narrative collapses off-stage. Causal chain holds: because he veils mirrors, the drifting light coalesces into the hand-with-flower vision; therefore he smuggles the shard, foreclosing academic approval. Orientation anchors (asteroid museum, Final Dynasty exhibit) arrive by line 6; pattern is taught. Persistent constraint—his exile status—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid corridors and the maintenance-suite micro-setting constrain every move: only there can mirrors be veiled, exterior shutter opened, light summoned. The shard itself functions as micro-setting—its pooled twilight literally reconfigures the room’s metal surfaces. Sensory economy is severe: three senses per beat, always filtered through Kaelen’s poetic bias. No 9.0 because the exterior void is named but not exploited as pressure during the meteor shower.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the civilization’s hidden tenderness—tightens when academic narrative threatens to erase it. One meaningful deepening: shard shifts from “ritual bowl?” to “wildflower vessel,” narrowing Kaelen’s options to subterfuge. Agency drives escalation: his decision to veil mirrors triggers the vision that forecloses institutional path. Cost is felt: he accepts permanent marginalization to keep the memory alive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: empires collapse, yet humble beauty persists in unrecorded hands. Subtext operates in the shard’s reflected face—love, not power, is the buried truth. Final image of poems shared in “quiet corners” reweights prior academic dispute into grassroots resistance. Burnished sorrow is earned through specific image (flower in worn hand), not abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is thick with poetic compression—“light...spooling like golden thread”—yet never obscures causality. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kaelen sees sorrow in every surface, narrates void with nautical metaphors. Syntax modulates: long lyrical sentences in exhibit, clipped fragments during veil ritual. No dialogue, so no convergence issues. Patterned elision (mirror ritual) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information. Metaphors stay coherent: “light...pooled, wept” extends water imagery without contradiction. Minor scaffold: “the light within the room began to congeal, to paint images” could be one verb. No loops or register drift; final image is crystal-clear. Rhythm accelerates into the vision, then breathes out with quiet smuggling exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of time-visible asteroid museum, mirror-covering rebel ritual, and shard-as-ordinary-vase is fresh synthesis; none can be swapped without collapsing premise. Conceptual risk—history rewritten by household object—pays off with emotional wallop. Familiar trope of fallen empire is inverted through micro-domestic lens. Risk heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
