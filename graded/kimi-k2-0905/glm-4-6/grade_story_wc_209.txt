<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lena’s quiet drive is credibly embodied in her night-foraging for postcards and the cross-legged ritual on the studio floor; the contradiction between public acclaim and private obsession stays alive. Interiority avoids label-speak—her “secret garden” is shown via paint-stained fingers, not therapy prose. The final softening into contentment is earned because the murals physically externalize her transformed stance, foreclosing older solitude with visible cost: she installs the cards in a public case and stays to guide twilight visitors. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV depth is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last mural reframes night-blooms from anomaly to ecological heart, reweighting her prior obsession with undeniable conceptual cost—she will paint only collaborative nocturnal ecosystems. Causality is intact: each postcard discovered → questions deepen → chapel glass gives mechanistic answer → murals shift. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of postcards, seasons, and glass diagrams accrues until meaning flips. Orientation clean by line 3; single transition (studio→pavilion) taught by seasonal bridge; cost visible—“she stood back from her final scene,” relinquishing solitary authorship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Winter melt, summer jasmine scent, autumn moonlight on amber glass—details are sensory, selective, and filtered through painter’s eye. The studio floor, chapel windowpanes, and pavilion walls function as micro-settings that constrain how she can investigate and display knowledge. Spatial choreography is coherent: postcards migrate from flea-markets → studio → glass case at pavilion entrance, tracking her stance shift. Weather affects action—snow timing forces the final viewing at twilight when painted flowers “breathe,” charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she crack why night-flowers bloom—tightens when chapel glass proves the adaptation strategy, foreclosing her prior romantic mystery. Agency is accumulative: each season of painting and card study adds pressure until she must choose between private myth and public ecosystem truth; the mural reinterpretation is that choice. Cost is conceptual rather than external—she forfeits the delicious secrecy of “anomaly” for communal scientific wonder. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: revelation belongs to those willing to inhabit darkness. Subtext lives in repeated postcard handwriting “the garden doesn’t sleep,” silently countering her early loneliness. No moralizing finale; instead the painted ecosystem reframes prior images without exposition. Emotional aftereffect is concrete—visitors sense murals breathing at twilight, inviting reader to stay after lights dim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lena’s perceptual filter: color vocabulary (“umbral tenderness,” “vibrant strokes against dark”) matches painter sensibility. Rhythm modulates—long sinuous sentences for nocturnal bloom prose, shorter fragments when she kneels in chapel. No head-hopping; focalization locked. Filter verbs (“she began to reckon”) are voice-motivated, not dilution. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer time, scent, and paint texture without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent: moonlight as cloak, snow as melt-water tick. Only minor scaffold—“she had learned” summary in final paragraph could be dramatized, but it is brief and lands after closure image. Clean grammar; pronoun reference clear despite long sentences. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of botanical science with mystical pilgrimage feels fresh; night-pollination via ultrasonic bat petals is specific, not Wikipedia dump. Postcards-as-oral-trail device transforms familiar antique-shopping trope into epistolary mystery. Risk-taking in accumulative seasonal mosaic pays off—pattern taught early, closure legible. Could not swap night-bloom premise for day-flowers without breaking concept and title metaphor. Synthesis of mural art, ecology, andQuiet Quest yields memorable, non-obvious angle.</comment>
