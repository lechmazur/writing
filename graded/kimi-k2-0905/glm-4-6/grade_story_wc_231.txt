<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Hemlock’s “borrowed memories” gift is vivid, but his interiority drifts into exposition; the Edelweiss memory-surge is told more than embodied. The final nightly gesture shows earned endurance with cost, yet his contradictory impulses (keep vs. share isolation) stay implicit—never enacted in scene. Character voice distinct, but micro-choices under pressure are scarce; the memory inheritance is backstory-heavy and only tilts present stance once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of collected objects → memory frisson → lighthouse log gaps → nightly ritual. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dock gap is reweighted into shared witness, cost is the keeper’s lifelong solitude now consciously assumed. Orientation clear by word 60; one soft transition (lighthouse interior) taught by object array. No causality break, though escalation is gentle density-rise rather than twist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Opal dock mist and Edelweiss petals are tactile, charged micro-settings that constrain Hemlock’s ritual; lighthouse glass case acts as second micro-arena. Sensory selection (lavender-pearl dusk, salt-tremble on aged hands) filters through keeper’s obsessive attention. Weather twilight anchors time and metaphoric threshold, mirrored in closure image. Spatial choreography clean across single location; environment steers nightly offering gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: witness isolation vs. shared connection; signaled early, deepens as Hemlock decodes stranger’s gesture. Pressure intensifies through accruing memory-fragments, not external opposition—an acceptable Accumulative tightening. No visible price paid beyond emotional confirmation; cost is conceptual (perpetual caretaking) rather than concrete forfeiture, keeping it below high band. One meaningful cadence shift: private grief → public tribute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: isolation witnessed becomes communal, love persists as ritual. Subtext loaded in silent nightly flower placement rather than stated. Final image resists moral, offers charged poise; ambiguity (does tribute ease loneliness?) lingers. Avoids overt thesis; insight grows from concrete particulars (Edelweiss, log gaps). Sentimentality skirted, though alpine nostalgia edges close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Hemlock’s diction: “opal,” “mist,” “borrowed memories,” lighthouse tech. Rhythm varies—long lyrical sentences for dusk, clipped fragments for memory flashes. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Free indirect style clean; perceptual signature consistent (keeper notices light, gaps, weathered textures). No head-hopping or register drift; elevated diction justified by reflective stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but stays readable; some metaphor density in opener (“nautical twilight painted the mist…”) could trim. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance image or knowledge. Occasional stacked modifiers (“perfectly preserved dried Edelweiss boutonnière”) but meaning intact. Final paragraph risks paraphrase-loop on “shared isolation” theme, yet cadence serves closure uplift. Generally controlled, with ear-pleasing variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memory-collecting lighthouse keeper feels fresh; alpine Edelweiss as portal-token is specific, not stock. Turning souvenir into nightly ritual avoids sentimental twist via quiet endurance. Concept of “witnessed isolation” offers understated emotional pivot. Risk lies in lyrical stillness over event, but coherence holds. Could push further into keeper’s flaw or consequence for higher band.</comment>
