<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and body-attuned (“her breath fogging the panes as if to mimic the frost-kissed world”); motivation stays anchored to the single stake of re-creating sound. Micro-choices—striking the fork, reading the thermal screen—track a believable experimental arc. No contradictory impulses under pressure cost her a path, so the “earned cost” bar is barely missed. Still, the embodied silence-first POV feels particular, not generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the scanner’s color-cascade reweights silence into “music” with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal, but the lens is taught early and holds. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within the first 60 words; no penalty. The final beat—“the scanner flickered one last time”—makes the before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: glass walls both trap and transmit vibration, directly enabling her sonic experiment. Sensory selection stays biased to touch and temperature, matching her deafened POV. The orchids’ thermal glow is returned in the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography remains stable throughout the single continuous scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each fork strike and heat-map tightens the emotional density until the color-symphony lands. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the void itself. A visible price is paid: Hours of silent labor and the tear-tracked cheek mark the cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse metaphor: music need not be heard, only felt. The orchids’ unheard “song” reconfigures the meaning of sound for both survivor and reader. No moral is stated; the final image of petals “dancing to a rhythm unseen” provides resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity is preserved—will the world beyond the glass ever share this music?—yet the thematic question is answered.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, cadenced, and perceptually specific to a deafened ear (“the storm’s roar still echoed… a phantom symphony”). Syntax favors participial openness that mimics breath-fog and vibration. No dialogue appears; thus no voice convergence risk. Register stays consistent; no academic drift. The lyric pattern is taught in sentence one and paid off in the final “silent symphony.”

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is image-dense yet scaffold-free; no synonym loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors stay coherent (frost / glass / warmth) and do not stack during the climax. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; each advances either heat-map data or emotional charge. Opening and closing lines bookend the sonic arc with tactile imagery.

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—hearing loss converted to thermal music—is non-obvious and inherently specific to this character. The tuning-fork-as-baton is fresh without being quirky; it grows organically from her past as a musician. Risk is taken with the lyric-accumulative structure, but coherence is maintained. Could edge higher if the orchids’ final “dance” carried a sharper surprise, yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
