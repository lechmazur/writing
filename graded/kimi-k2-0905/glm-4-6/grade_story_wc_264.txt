<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dreamless freight guard’s motivation—to nurture a seedling of possibility—is clear and anchored in his blank-slate mind, but his interiority stays largely declarative (“his heart carried the steady beat”) rather than embodied under pressure; the single micro-choice (planting the seedling) is quietly earned yet lacks visible cost or contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the chess-clock-backward tick and crystalline leaf re-weight the premise—dreamless minds can still birth futures—with undeniable conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern (glowing dune, archive shimmer, clock) tightens into the final image; causality is lyric-not-linear but coherent under that lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The glowing dune, chess clock, and crystalline flora are rendered with selective, sensory specificity; the environment is less backdrop than instrument—its luminescence permits the archive to shimmer and the seedling to root—so setting constrains and enables the final image, satisfying the micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Stakes—restoring botanical possibility—are signaled early; pressure deepens through pattern accumulation (archive corners, clock materializations, seedling timelines) rather than causal reversals; the final backward tick crystallizes cost under the Accumulative lens, though only one meaningful tightening occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: extinction versus divergence, the fertility of emptiness; the fractured lullaby cadence and recurring “occasionally everywhere” re-weight into the final image, offering resonant ambiguity—life sprouting from dreamlessness—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-driven; diction (“ravenous sky,” “ghost flowers”) stays within freight-guard perception; purposeful repetition (“occasionally everywhere,” “fractured lullaby”) teaches its music early and modulates into the closure beat; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Few loops; high density—each sentence layers image, rule, or stake; metaphors stay coherent (clock/leaf veins mirror frozen time); occasional template cadence (“the freight guard…”) is intentional refrain, not scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs, peak beats uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dreamless guardian of quantum archive sowing potential timelines is fresh synthesis; lyric accumulative structure mirrors the archive’s branching logic; risk—abstract physics in under 800 words—pays off via charged final image; avoids cliché of post-apocalyptic hope sermon.</comment>
