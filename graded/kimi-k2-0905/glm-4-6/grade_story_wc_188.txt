<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlo’s interiority is textured—“serious playfulness,” the lavender/kerosene scent cross-wiring—but the moment of change is delivered as paraphrased insight rather than embodied contradiction; the final realization is told, not dramatized under pressure, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic’s last line reweights the premise and Marlo’s stance, with the burned knot as visible price; causality holds under the Accumulative lens—each sensory filter adds density until the pattern crystallizes; orientation is clean by line 5, no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blooming fortress walls, torch-flare angles, and shifting tesserae are selectively detailed and directly enable the discovery; the kerosene-soaked rag and mosaic tiles function as micro-setting that constrains the final action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—are signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory filtration and mosaic revelation, narrowing options toward the single decisive spin of fire; the tightening is meaningful, though the external cost (one rag, one flame) is modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from fire-as-creation-against-absence; the closing aphorism is earned because the mosaic fragments and flame patterns have literalized it first; ambiguity remains—hope is not guaranteed, only the imperative to create—avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marlo’s perceptual filter; diction—“serious playfulness,” “gravity of hopelessness”—carries a distinct rhythmic signature; no head-hopping or register drift; compression in the chant lines is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional poetic uplift (“twilight painted…lavender and gold”) is purposeful and patterned; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; final paragraph avoids explanatory bloat, letting the image resonate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The starless-night fortress as a pilgrimage site for fire-artists feels fresh; the mosaic-message mechanic is a novel diegetic puzzle; risk is moderate—lyric filtration instead of overt plot twists—but specificity of craft detail lifts the piece above generic “find wisdom” arcs.</comment>
