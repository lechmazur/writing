<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The engineer’s interiority is vivid—his gloved hand feeling the key bite, the tremor as he attunes—yet the “logically emotional” trait is declared more than dramatized. We see no contradictory impulse in scene; the ritual proceeds with serene competence, so the promised internal tension is only narrated. Motivation (protect the artifact) is clear and constant, but no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values or a visible cost to him personally. The arc is steady admiration rather than earned renunciation or change, so the characterization stops just short of publish-now excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A single, continuous scene whose causal chain is legible: key warms → hum spreads → ice glows → artifact secured. The Orientation Test is passed—who/where/when anchored by line 30. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the marina’s cracks become “pathways of light,” a conceptual repricing that makes the forgiven legible. Cost is present but abstract (his lifelong vigilance continues); because the price is not felt in-scene, the story misses the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is never a postcard: shards hum, boots crunch, key bites palm, and the lighthouse artifact answers back. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—engineer notices vibration first, color second. The setting directly enables the climax: the ice acts as resonant medium for the sonic absolution, so environment constrains tactics and charges the final image. Micro-setting (gloved hand, crypt key, coat shimmer) repeatedly intersects with macro-setting to keep the world tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect artifact from human greed—is declared early and rehearsed but never tested on-page; no antagonist or counter-presence appears, so pressure is tonal, not tactical. Escalation is textural: density of light, hum, and color intensifies until the ice transfigures; this Accumulative pattern is coherent but lacks a narrowing of live options. The engineer’s agency is ritual fidelity rather than risk-laden choice; no credible loss (time, tool, social credit) alters his tactics. Cost is cosmically shifted onto the landscape, so the reader feels wonder more than jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image: vibration as forgiveness, ice-fractures as absolved scars. No character articulates a moral; the final “cathedral of ice” reweights prior material without sermon. The concept of sonic absolution is dramatized rather than explained, and the after-effect is contemplative awe rather than tidy lesson. Ambiguity lingers—will greed return?—but the piece avoids pseudo-profundity by keeping insight anchored to concrete sensory payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays locked to the engineer; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is distinct—twilight-color coat, vibration-first attention, engineer’s lexicon of frequency and resonance. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer ecstatic clauses at climax, crisp sentences during setup. No dialogue to test, but interior diction remains within plausible technical-mystic register. Patterned repetition (“the sigh of…”) is taught early and pays off in closure image, earning its cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; most sentences do two jobs (image + causality). A few metaphor stacks (“jagged, silvery landscape that seemed to hum…”) flirt with overwriting but serve the lyric mode. No synonym loops or template cadence; openings vary. Minor scaffold: “the key began to warm… began to…” could compress. Closure image is sharp and uncluttered, sustaining high-band readability with only hairline slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of lighthouse engineer + sonic absolution + vibrational ecology feels fresh; not a trope checklist. The notion that regret can be unwoven through resonance rather than combat is a non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity—crypt keeper’s key repurposed for living ice, coat color twilight-shift—prevents generic transfer. Risky lyric density is sustained without clarity loss, meriting the upper band.</comment>
