<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lorne’s vocation and solitude are vivid, but interiority is mostly declarative (“his purpose was to map…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the bloom succeeds on first attempt so no flaw or cost is tested, keeping the arc flat. Emotional stakes are asserted, not dramatized through error or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of crack-reading and stone-pulse thickens texture until the bloom crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is swift, transition is single-scene, and closure lands with undeniable stillness, but the lack of any prior failure or price keeps the cost more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ice-web topography, cave resonance, and the stone’s glow are tactile and selective; the cracks literally guide the conjuring, so setting constrains the final action. Sensory hierarchy stays tied to Lorne’s professional gaze, anchoring the bloom’s expansion in lived space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“quiet in the storm”—is clear early; pressure intensifies via sensory density rather than option loss. No reversal or trade-off is risked; success is immediate, so escalation is textural deepening only. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-resistance emerges through the bloom’s palpable hush rather than statement. Final image of Lorne smiling inside the bubble reweights prior noise, offering resonant ambiguity about endurance versus victory. No moral is declared; meaning stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady perceptual signature—ripple-mark tracing, harmonic vibrations, “hammered repose.” Syntax is rhythmic, slightly ceremonial, modulating into shorter beats at the bloom flare. No head-hopping or register drift; voice is coherent and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphor chains (“storm of light,” “screaming light”) occasionally layer without fresh payoff, creating minor purple density. No loops or scaffold; clauses stay crisp, and the bloom sentence achieves breath-stopping clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Silence-as-geomancy mapped on fracture patterns feels fresh; energy beings remain off-stage noise, avoiding over-explanation. Concept doesn’t fully risk failure or subversion, so ingenuity is strong but not breathtaking.</comment>
