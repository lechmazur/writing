<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Lyra’s “perpetually learning” trait is asserted but never embodied in a contradictory choice; she simply decodes the slide and follows it. The interiority is lyrically voiced yet generic (“her heart thrumming”) and never complicates her stance. Closure is serene acceptance rather than a costly renunciation, so the arc feels observational, not crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: slide inserted, storm calms, alliances acknowledged—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: slide images echo prior sculptures and re-weight meaning rather than force physical change. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One soft patch: the hidden compartment at the lighthouse appears only at payoff, not seeded, so the beat feels conjured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Archway, shale, turbine-hum, and salt-chewed hands are vivid, selective, and filtered through sculptor perception. The lantern’s glow physically guides her deeper, so environment constrains movement. Micro-setting (warped glass, kelp rope) doubles as tool and stakes. Final image is charged by the cave wall slot—setting participates in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: discover whether her wanderings mean anything. Pressure escalates texturally—each glowing image re-weights her past sculptures rather than narrows external options. No concrete loss or trade-off is risked; the storm never truly endangers her. Cost is purely conceptual recognition, so tension plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: art unknowingly braids human and coastal histories. Subtext lives in the slide’s metamorphosing images—past work reframed as covenant. Final insertion avoids moralizing; the hush after storm feels earned. No late thesis statements; resonance is imagistic, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Lyra; perceptual signature is tactile-grain (“calloused from salt and wood”) and auditory turbine-hum. Rhythm swells and ebbs with surf and pulse, never monotonous. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compressed lyric syntax is consistent and taught early; closure line sustains cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density. Occasional modifier stacks (“turbine-hum reverie overtaking the storm’s fury”) flirt with overwriting but stay within lyric contract. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb clusters. One mixed metaphor—“timewoven alliances made manifest”—slips in mid-climax, dulling edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Driftwood sculptor decoding her own accidental geocache is fresh; magic-lantern-as-self-map feels novel. Coastal archaeology trope is elevated by maker lens. Risk is moderate—lyric accretion instead of plot reversals—but coherence holds. Not radically avant-garde, yet specificity rescues it from template.</comment>
