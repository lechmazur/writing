<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“solitary playfulness,” brass sphere “slow, deliberate regret”—her contradictory impulses (grief vs investigative zeal) stay embodied and scene-locked. Every micro-choice (hovering nib, under-drawer search) is traceable to her inherited “curse of the curious” and the fresh lethal threat. The final renunciation of passive grief for active exposure lands with visible cost: accepting that printing the truth may repeat the murder loop. Missing 9-band only because the moment of explicit fear (flaw acknowledgement under new threat) is compressed into one clause rather than lived contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: phone clue → bent nib contradiction → chart taped underside → new murder thesis. Each because/therefore linkage raises cost and narrows options, culminating in the Charged Poise of the nib-as-promise. Closure reweights the premise with conceptual cost: the same printing empire that buried truth must now expose it. Retro-pays early disorientation (observatory geography withheld) by revealing the dome’s hidden maintenance passage as murder vector.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Brass celestial sphere, echoing observatory, and rosewood desk form a micro-setting triad that literally steers discovery (sphere → regret metaphor; desk → nib weapon; chart underside → route). Cloud-height acoustics narrow perception during solitude, then shift to claustrophobic trap once killer motive is inferred. Sensory hierarchy obeys astrophysicist-heiress priorities: visual axis of dome, tactile nib weight, archival paper scent. The environment constrains the final choice—only the press empire’s reach can broadcast what the stars “watch.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove double murder—signaled in paragraph two and escalates via each contradiction unearthed. One meaningful tightening: realization that bent nib equals struggle, not grief, collapses safe mourning stance and forces intervention. Protagonist agency drives every inflection; no off-stage rescue. Price paid: acceptance that exposing killer may doom her, charged in the cold weight of the nib-promise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited observation-as-curse emerges imagistically—brass sphere, star-chart—never sermonized. Subtext in “orbits of regret” converts from cosmic metaphor to circular violence protecting power, reweighted at closure. Ambiguity remains: printing truth may perpetuate or break orbit, letting theme linger without moral tag. Final image offers CR: same nib that signed headlines will puncture them, repricing the family empire’s social contract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara with perceptual signature—“brass celestial sphere spun like a slow, deliberate regret”—syntax mirroring an astro-child’s diction. No filter-verb bloat; metaphors are POV-loyal. Psychic distance compresses under pressure to staccato clause rhythm, matching pulse of discovery. Voice coherence survives experimental compression; solemn playfulness held in “she would prove it was murder, through proof by contradiction, just as he’d taught her.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “grief didn’t bend a pen nib; force did” compresses causality + emotional pivot in nine words. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent. Occasional elevated diction—“conceptual repricing,” “teleological vector”—justified by observatory-heiress intellect. Final cadence slows into solemn promise without sagging momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Inversion of classic heiress trope into investigative agent is fresh; star-chart floor-plan twist converts astronomical setting into literal murder map. Risk of overlaying metaphor (“orbits of regret”) pays off because metaphor later becomes motive blueprint. Familiar “criminal patriarchal institution” frame is personalized through print-ink imagery and specific family legacy. Not quite 8.5 because the conspiracy architecture (killer guards old secret) edges toward trope.</comment>
