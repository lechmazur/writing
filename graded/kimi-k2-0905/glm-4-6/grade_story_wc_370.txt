<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—compassion vs. self-protection—are dramatized in every micro-gesture (smoothing the invitation, locking books away). The hide ritual crystallizes her hierarchy of values: safety > community, yet she still steps outside. The final choice is earned: her earlier disaster with patients foreshadows why emergence costs. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. Only ding: emotional arithmetic is a touch tidy at the mirror beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: she closes the disguised door, crystallizing the paradox of retreat-as-offering. Cost is legible—she trades her hard-won solitude for potential empathic overload. Causal chain intact: invitation → hide ritual → stepping out. Lens (Situational) holds throughout; pressure is her anticipation of emotional chaos. Orientation anchored by word 60. No meaningful escalation after the 50% mark keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<comment>Library, invitation, and moonlight are not backdrop—they constrain action (locked compartments, midnight deadline). The crumpled invitation’s creases mirror her internal folds, recharged when she pockets it at exit. Dust motes vs. her stillness is a tight environmental metaphor that charges the final image. Spatial choreography flawless; no white-room. Micro-setting (cardigan pocket) hosts the charged object. Meets 9- gate: environment shapes exit ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect empathic limits vs. serve community—signaled on first page. Tightening occurs when the clock strikes 11:45, forcing the leave/stay decision. Price is felt: she forfeits sanctuary by opening the door. Escalation is present but singular; no second reversal. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than active confrontation. Situational pressure coherent, yet static after midpoint keeps it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: solitude as prerequisite for genuine compassion. Subtext carried in gesture (smoothing invitation = caressing fear). Final image reweights premise—exit is not abandonment but offering. No declarative moralizing; avoids sentimentality. Paradox motif recurs with increasing specificity, charging closure. Minor slack: “beautifully nested paradoxes” edges toward echo, yet context justifies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature sharp—Elara notices dust motes, creases, smells of bakery. Syntax mirrors her hesitation: long, comma-rich sentences that fray at emotional peaks. No head-hopping. Filter verbs serve voice (“she knew with certainty”). Dialogue absent, so voice carries every beat without monotony. Diction stays within lexicon of a librarian-healer. Nearly flawless; one template cadence in hide ritual (−0.1).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—clipped as midnight nears, expansive during reflection. Figurative language sparse and precise (“streetlights cast gentle patterns”). No mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “nested paradoxes” appears twice without new angle (−0.2). Information density high; sentences multitask. Opening line anchors stakes and voice. Final line resolves by image. Proofing clean. Closure beat untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Library of Unwritten Thoughts” is fresh; secret-society tucked beside bakery feels newly specific. Therapist-turned-librarian twist on empathic-recluse trope gains extra layer via past malpractice. Risk taken with quiet, renunciation ending rather than dramatic convergence scene. Synthesis—wisdom through error—arises from particulars, not allegory. Could swap a few phrases without structural change, so not indispensable. No close echoes of canon.</comment>
