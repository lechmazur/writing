<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—duty to silence vs. hunger for sound—stays vivid in embodied micro-choices (bare foot flex, single hummed note). The climactic renunciation of regret is foreshadowed by early tactile memory, so the shift feels earned. Flaw: “excruciatingly gentle” is repeated until it becomes mannerism, blunting the idiosyncrasy of his gait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the droplet-percussion re-weights his identity from burden to companion. Causal lens holds: because he listens, therefore he hums, therefore he reclaims agency. Cost is legible—he will keep measuring time for others while privately savoring music. Minor drag: orientation (who/where) edges past 120-word mark, but the crystal forecourt is concrete enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that literally channels sound; its post-rain vibration becomes the tool that forces his sonic transgression. Sensory economy is tight—only drip, hush, and glassy resonance are needed. Spatial choreography is clean: he “moves excruciatingly gently” to center pillar, hand to surface, vibration up arm. Weather evolution (rain→sunrise) mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling silenced musicianship—is signaled early. Single tightening occurs when droplet-notes force him to hum; that audible act permanently narrows his identity options. Cost is present (public silence must be maintained), but escalation is muted; no external antagonist or tangible loss sharpens the turn. Sufficient for length, yet not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time kept for others vs. time reclaimed for self. No overt thesis—meaning resides in the auditory image of droplets syncing with his heartbeat. Final image crystallizes the concept: he smiles while copying clock faces, privately orchestrating an internal symphony. Subtle counter-reading possible—reconciliation may still be fragile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: auditory focus, lexical restraint, rhythmic mirroring of “excruciatingly gentle” cadence. No register drift; diction stays within cloistered scribe lexicon. Compression taught early (“glacial hush”) and paid off in final hush-to-music inversion. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breath-syncs with content—long humid clauses yield to clipped droplet fragments. Figurative language sparse and coherent; no metaphor muddle. One paraphrase loop (“excruciatingly gentle” x4) deducts −0.3, but pattern is purposeful, not scaffold. High density achieved: each sentence advances either sensory data or interior shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise—silent monk reclaiming music via rain-triggered crystal acoustics—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk lies in lyric repetition; it mostly heightens rather than obscures. Transformation succeeds: plot would collapse if droplets were generic rain. Slight deduction for over-familiar trope of “repressed artist healed by nature,” but specificity of setting reinvigorates it.</comment>
