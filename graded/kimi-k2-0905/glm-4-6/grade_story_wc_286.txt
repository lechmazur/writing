<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet, observant nature is consistently embodied through tactile micro-choices (thumb on glass, smoke-watch, hand on fracture). Interiority stays concrete; the final “offering” is a credible renunciation that costs him the anomaly’s thrumming intimacy. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the arc is more steady revelation than pressured change—still earned, but short of the 9-band threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the thrum resolves, bee vanishes, oasis relaxes into ordinary abandonment—visible cost is the loss of the timeless moment Kael briefly shared. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of observing, marking, lensing, then gentle surrender reweights meaning without forced causality. One micro-turn (fractures re-seen as shield, not wound) tightens stakes at exact midpoint; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cracked earth, crystallized honey, smoke-river, and lantern glass scratches are selective, sensory, and filtered through Kael’s potter gaze. The micro-setting (glass + smoke) literally enables the final revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; only the bee’s vanishing lacks a tracked after-image, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why does this place resist decay?”—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes the resistance is love-frozen. One meaningful tightening at the nexus: fractures flip from threat to shield, narrowing his options to witness, not repair. Cost is the quiet forfeiture of the numinous thrum; pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping it just below the 8.8+ demand for a sharper price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: kiln-fire scars, crystallized honey, and the final image of an ordinary oasis assert that preservation and impermanence coexist. No moralizing; the closing sentence reweights the whole quest without abstract statement. Ambiguity lingers—was the moment released or merely hidden?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature—sun-pattern thinking, clay-calloused touch, phototropic craving for kindness. Syntax breathes with long observational sentences that contract at the fracture touch. No head-hopping; diction remains within a quiet craftsman’s lexicon. The faint poetic uplift in the final clause is earned by prior restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “a frozen amber tear in the fabric of the now” does triple image-work without purple drift. Rhythm modulates—long smoke sentence vs. staccato “He waited.” Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor (“sharp gentleness”) is intentionally oxymoronic and thematic, not accidental clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Temporal bee-in-amber oasis guarded by love rather than tech is fresh, and the potter’s non-interventionist method subverts standard “fix the anomaly” plots. Specificity of lantern-glass + smoke flattening as lens feels idiosyncratic. Risk is quiet; stakes internal, but coherence never wavers. Not quite paradigm-shifting enough for 9+ band.</comment>
