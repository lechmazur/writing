<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sentinel’s motivation is clear, but Lila and Marc remain archetypes: no interior contradiction, no micro-choice that costs them anything. Their reconciliation is triggered by an external prop, not by an irreversible decision that reveals hierarchy of values. Because the couple’s arc is the emotional stakes, their thinness caps Q1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the synchronized walk-out reconfigures their stance with felt, if quiet, cost. Causality is soft—letter → glance → hand-touch—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final image reweights earlier mismatches. No orientation debt; transitions are legible within one scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amber glass, russet vines, and the drifting letter provide tactile anchors that mirror emotional temperature. Pavilion and vineyard constrain proximity, forcing the couple into shared physical space. Sensory selection stays tight to POV-filtered attention; no static postcarding. Environment does not yet constrain a final tactical choice, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will they reconnect—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: letter fragment read aloud → mutual recognition. Escalation is gentle, appropriate to lyric mode, but only one visible narrowing occurs; no additional tactical cost or lost option. Sufficient for short-form, but not multiple beats of pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “destined mismatches” emerges through recurrence of missed connections rather than exposition. Subtext lives in the sentinel’s silent leaf-arrangement and the letter’s half-burned confession. Final image of synchronized steps offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Could deepen if couple’s private mythology echoed the theme more specifically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays stable, focalized through the sentinel’s quiet perception. Prose has controlled rhythm, autumnal cadence, and purposeful repetition (“destined mismatches”). No head-hopping; diction remains within vineyard dusk register. Distinctive without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length; information density is high—each line advances image or emotional tilt. Minor loop: “the sentinel… the sentinel…” openings in paragraph 1, but pattern breaks quickly. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Clean copy; one typo (“edge” repeated) does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise—sentinel puppeteering reconciliation via found ephemera—feels fresh, not trope-laden. Risk is quiet rather than bold, but specificity of vineyard dusk and charred letter edge prevents generic swap-out. Transformation would collapse if setting or object changed. Stays below 8.5 because emotional arc remains familiar underneath ornamental frame.</comment>
