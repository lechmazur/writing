<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“her heart hammering against the familiar prison of her own ribs”), but the claustrophobia is announced more than embodied in micro-choices; the single decisive action—pressing the compass—lands, yet the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping emotional legibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: compass → organ resonance → key pattern broadcast → space stabilizes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“key now restored to the world’s consciousness”) with felt cost in her breathless ascent; the spatial mutiny rule-set is rewired, satisfying the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Star-dusted darkness,” “angularities,” and “prismatic shards” are selective, pressure-filtered; the nexus geometry is re-etched by each organ chord, so setting actively constrains her placement of the compass—meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore balance to mutinous spatial rifts”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as walls “breathe” and starlight fractures. One meaningful escalation: the act of transfixing at the crescendo narrows options to succeed or die, price visible in her tremoring body.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: harmony tames entropy. The organ’s lonely note pattern reweights from ominous to redemptive without moralizing; the final smile is a quiet, earned resonance that invites reflection on boundary-rewriting versus self-acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains perceptual signature—claustrophobic diction, rhythmic clauses mimicking held breath. No head-hopping; filter verbs serve voice (“she felt the compass point connect”). Organ chords function as dialogue-like beats carrying subtextual urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sentence variety and information density, yet figurative drift clusters in peak beat (“shadows elongating into impossible angularities while starlight fractured into prismatic shards”) risk coherence; no loop or scaffold, but overwriting nudges clarity −0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny as dimensional rebellion against geometry rules is fresh; compass-as-conductor and organ-as-tuning-fork synthesize into an inevitable, non-obvious ritual. Risky lyric density pays off in closure image—specific, memorable, not extractable to another tale.</comment>
