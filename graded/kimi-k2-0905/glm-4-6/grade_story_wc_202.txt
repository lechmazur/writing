<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motive—recover matriarchal translator lineage—stays sharp; micro-choice (taking the first canvas) shows risk. Interiority (“she had always been here”) is concrete yet avoids diagnostic speak. The Earned Stasis—accepting endless work—carries cost, though emotional contradiction could be pushed further in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cumulative/Textural lens: canvas fragments and market stalls accrete into a heritage map; final image reweights earlier motifs with clear Charged Poise. Orientation anchors who/where by word 75; no causality break. Closure beat—portrait of herself writing—makes lineage cost legible (“work just beginning”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting of the fragment-as-lens actively guides perception and choice. Market is sketched with selective sensory ropes, bottled starlight, but keeps economy. Lighthouse-painting interior revealed through the fragment acts as environment that alters her path, satisfying 9+ object-use gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover erased women translators—announced early; each canvas discovery tightens density, foreclosing ignorance as an option. No explicit antagonist; pressure is archival erasure, escalated by found images. Cost visible: she embraces lifelong, possibly isolating, labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of historiographic justice emerges via accumulating canvases rather than thesis statement. Final “overlooked histories would have their day” lands as CR that reweights earlier motifs. Ambiguity lingers: no promise of recognition, only duty—complexity respected.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric registers perceptual distortion of glass fragments; diction stays within translator’s sensory lexicon. No dialogue, avoiding voice convergence. Rhythm swells in long sentences then clips at closure, mirroring breath of realization. Compression taught early (“elusively tangible”) and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High sentence-level density; metaphors (glass as bridge) recur without overstuffing. One paraphrase loop—“between worlds… between childhood and now” earns slack for thematic echo. No filter-verb stacks; clauses propel. Final line cadence perfectly resolves lyric pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival feminism + alchemical art-market + optic magic; not a standard trope template. Risky eternal-instant structure holds due to accruing canvas evidence. Could edge higher if market rules were slightly more concrete, but transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
