<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reaper’s interior contradiction—duty vs. grief—drives every beat; the micro-choice to leave the crystallized page behind is earned by the cascade of embodied tremors, hitched breaths, and whispered names. His flaws (denial, self-punishing duty) actively shape the naming ritual, turning each crystal into a visible cost. The final smile is fragile yet credible because the story has let him bleed on the page. No stock therapy-speak; even “heartbroken” is redefined through the specific sacrifice of Elara.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of naming converts private grief into a communal witness, foreclosing both oblivion and easy absolution. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each crystallized monster is a pattern break that reweights the stake from “bury pain” to “host it.” The final image of glittering monsters left behind carries undeniable conceptual cost: he will carry the scar, but the grief is now shared with the cosmos. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words (who, where, when), so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cracked bronze dome and fractured light are not backdrop; they supply the literal method (scattered prisms) that crystallizes the monsters and charges the final image. The atlas page operates as micro-setting—its sea monsters constrain every naming choice and then re-emerge as the closure object. Spatial choreography is immaculate: page → pedestal → light → crystal. Weather (dusk → night) tracks emotional cooling after the final star-pierced release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform nameless grief into named, bearable pain—tightens with each crystallization; the option to forget is foreclosed once the page glows amber. Escalation is textural: the hydra’s glass teeth, the kraken’s frozen flames, the air’s chill—each image reweights the cost without causal reversals. The protagonist’s agency is the act of naming itself; no external coincidence intervenes. The price is visible in the lingering scar and the abandoned, glowing monsters.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of the reaper’s trade: what he once took (souls) he now gives (names to fears). The atlas monsters shift from symbols of terror to vessels of love, a reconfiguration paid for by her sacrifice. No explicit moral is stated; the final lullaby is the stars’ soft light, not a thesis. The echo of sacrifice reframes death not as end but as mnemonic labor—an idea that lingers beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, its syntax mirroring the reaper’s tremulous breath and halting memory: fragments, em-dashes, prismatic light. Perceptual signature is consistent—he sees the world as a map of wounds and constellations. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Register stays within a sorrow-bound, mythic lexicon without drifting into purple; “inked agony,” “frozen flames” are earned by the magical logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long, dusk-heavy sentences to staccato naming beats, accelerating as crystals form. Information density is high: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic work without redundancy. No mixed metaphors; light → crystal → scar is a single coherent vehicle. Minor scaffold: “the reaper’s X” opener appears three times but serves as ritual cadence, not clutter, and is pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusing the reaper myth with bibliomancy and grief-crystallization feels fresh; the sea-monster atlas page is a specific, irreplaceable artifact. The inversion—“naming” as an act of surrender rather than ownership—flips the usual fantasy trope of power-through-naming. Risk is taken in the lyric, almost liturgical structure, yet coherence holds. The cosmic lullaby closing image is memorable and non-obvious.</comment>
