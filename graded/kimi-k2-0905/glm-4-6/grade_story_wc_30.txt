<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The migrating-identity librarian is notionally vivid but performs no reversible choice; interiority drifts into thematic summary (“wisdom thrived in the spaces between opposites”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Smelting fish/ink is the only micro-choice, yet it feels pre-ordained, not a fresh test of Elias/Elara’s split. Cost is asserted (“centuries,” “tomorrow disappears”) rather than felt; the ending renunciation is gentle page-turning, not a path foreclosed with pain. Voice stays consistent, but passivity caps emotional depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: tidal rhythm + lunar name cycle pattern taught early, reasserted at closure when inked words re-enter the water. Closure is a Charged Poise: the librarian’s calm inscription re-weights the ritual, acknowledging cyclical loss of self with conceptual cost legible in “after tomorrow disappears.” No因果 reversal, yet density increases toward final image; orientation anchored by ~100 words. Minor loop: “ponderous grace … inexorable rhythm” paraphrase inside one sentence (−0.2) but does not dull final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass-domed tidal atrium, rising water, and metallic gears are kinesthetic, constraining movement and timing of smelt ritual; wintersun light refracts through water onto ink, charging the final inscription image. Bamboo creel doubles as micro-setting, its contents (fish, relic metal) literally fed into crucible, tying librarian’s body to mechanism. Spatial choreography clean; no generic fantasy filler. The environment is not backdrop but engine—water level dictates when ritual must end, shaping pace and cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder via cyclical ritual—signaled early, but pressure stays ambient, not acute; no beat where failure feels possible. Escalation is tonal thickening rather than option-narrowing; the creel’s emptying and ink-making unfold smoothly without counter-force or risk. Cost is poetic (“tomorrow disappears”) yet not dramatized as loss on page. Under accumulative lens, cadence shift from observation to inscription suffices for minor tightening, but no tactical consequence alters next cycle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of cyclical identity/duality emerges through repeated images—gears, tides, moon, ink—rather than exposition; no explicit moral. Final line offers resonant Conceptual Repricing: today’s words become tomorrow’s dissolved mystery, reweighting earlier smelt act. Ambiguity stays purposeful: wonder is maintained by consuming the self. Minor drift toward thematic label “wisdom thrived in contradictions” (−0.3) keeps score sub-8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays tight to librarian’s perceptual filter—mechanical sounds, salt smell, metallic gleam—syntax lengthens and contracts with water level, producing tidal rhythm in prose. Diction marries tech (“quantum physics,” “titan-gear”) with mythic (“keeper of myths”) without register clash, showing identity blur. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on description, succeeds. Free indirect thought clean: “they would become Elara” carries forecast flavor insidePOV knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence variety avoids template; information dense—one line can layer sensory cue, world rule, and metaphor. Minor paraphrase loop “gleaming like distant memories… gleaming with the same winter light” (−0.2). Figurative language disciplined, never floods high-pressure beats. Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves via image that re-cues “after tomorrow disappears.” No scaffold clutter; pronouns & tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Fusion of librarian, tidal clockwork, and lunar identity migration feels fresh; not a trope checklist but singular synthesis. Transformational hinge—fish → luminous ink—turns biological waste into epistemic eternity, a reconfiguring metaphor not seen before. Risk-taking in quiet, cyclical plot without external antagonist succeeds because pressure internalizes via moon-phase inevitability. Could not swap setting or conceit without collapsing entire narrative architecture.</comment>
