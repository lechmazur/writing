<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The librarian’s “sanely eccentric” contradiction is lived: she traces calculus-of-poems maps in dust, lets the scarf tighten as compass, and chooses to step into the impossible door—each micro-choice driven by her stated mission. Interiority stays concrete (“felt a flicker of recognition,” “the scarf tightened…not as a warning, but as a compass”) without diagnostic labels. Flawed obsession complicates the final act—she leaves the patrons behind, accepting eternal caretaker exile—cost is visible in the closing image of the scarf now “woven with the threads of countless tales.” The reawakening is both triumph and life-sentence; the endurance is earned, not tidy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the librarian returns to the same midnight desk but the library has become a living, breathing organism whose heart she now is—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because she follows the scarf-hum → hyperbolic door → surrenders to the geometry, therefore the building’s nature flips. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and again after portal return; no teleporting props. Hyperbolic geometry is taught early as “language of impossible spaces” and pays off inside the spiral where stories exist as mutable curves—no late rule patch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library is more than postcard: shelves stretch “like taffy,” titles are audible equations, dust records theorems—environment actively warps and guides her path. The scarf operates as micro-setting/tool: its fray, hum, and eventual silk-bridge constrain every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy tracks her curator gaze—smell of old paper, taste of ionized dust—never tourist list. Final image of walls “breathing” recharges the opening dust motes, fulfilling the 9+ gate that setting must charge the last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the place where stories live—tightens when the geometry door appears: entrance costs permanent separation from normal reality. One meaningful reversal: the scarf shifts from gift to lifeline to irreversible fusion with narrative fabric, foreclosing her return to ordinary caretaking. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each step deeper into hyperbolic stacks narrows exit options until only eternal stewardship remains. Visible price: patrons’ ignorance persists, her solitude solidifies—felt in the closing cadence “resumed her watch” now inside a sentient building.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: analog memory (tactile, frayed, breathing) defeats digital ephemera by becoming literally alive. Subtext resides in silence—patrons never notice the cosmological renovation, underscoring that meaning is private, custodial, lonely. Final image reweights the stake: stories no longer need finding; they own her. No moralizing, only charged poise—reader left to feel the cost of reverence to ink and dust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline eccentric: “calculus of poems,” “syntax her map”—diction precise to a librarian-poet yet never showy. Rhythm modulates: long spiral sentences during hyperbolic walk tighten to staccato beats on return (“The library was different now”). Perceptual signature filters every noun through cataloguing instinct—“analog memories,” “tactile data streams.” No head-hop; third-person stays latched to her sensorium; scarf POV-metaphor never leaks into authorial explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances world or want. Mixed metaphors are deliberate and coherent (“hyperbolic space…each curve a line of poetry”) paid off by portal geometry. Information density high: one sentence can set, characterize, and foreshadow (“the scarf, like her, was a relic of a time when stories were tactile”). No artifact intrusion in closure beat: final line breathes cleanly. Opening and closing lines function as symmetrical narrative hinges without drum-beat cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Takes the tired “stories come alive” trope and makes it mathematically erotic: hyperbolic geometry as literal narrative bloodstream is fresh, non-obvious, fully committed. Scarf-as-wormhole and librarian-as-heart-organ fusion feel inevitable yet unforeseeable. Risk in lyric density pays off—reader exits convinced the library respires. Concept and emotional truth cohere: solitude of caretaking made cosmic.</comment>
