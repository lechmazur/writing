<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Aria’s obsession is vivid, but her interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“questions thrum behind her eyes”). The final choice—sealing the tapestry after decoding the ritual—reads as a foregone continuation rather than a costly renunciation or decisive pivot; the promised price of performing the ritual on herself remains off-stage, blunting earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The mosaic shard structure (library excavation → diary decoding → tapestry epiphany) is coherent and causal, each beat because/therefore linked. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the axis is metaphysical, the cost is species-wide imaginative extinction, and Aria’s renunciation of action crystallizes the stakes. A stronger on-page body-cost (fatigue, temporal urgency, or concrete risk) would lift this to 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The silo’s concrete curves, containment fields, and spectral imager are tactile tools that constrain movement and enable the diary probe. The tapestry dragons return as charged micro-setting, their “shifting” re-weighted at closure to embody the re-awakening axis. Environment passes the 9+ gate by shaping the final image, though spatial choreography inside chamber nine could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes escalate from recovery to cosmic reconnection; the diary probe is the single decisive tightening that reveals the metaphysical axis fracture. Cost is conceptual—humanity’s dream-death—rather than personal, keeping pressure legible but less visceral. Agency is pure intellection; the absence of an external antagonist or time-clock keeps escalation just shy of 8-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of imaginative extinction emerges concretely through the dragons’ disappearance and diary testimony, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final “faintest hint of stirring” offers a resonant, ambiguous re-pricing rather than a moral. Avoidance of sentimental uplift and willingness to rest in charged poise lifts the score; slightly fresher symbolic linkage between tapestry threads and neural/synaptic imagery could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: Aria hears plaster whisper and sees dragons pulse. Syntax is textured—“bronze quiet,” “muted spectrum”—without purple overload. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctiveness is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains singular and stable under pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“metaphysical displacement”) fits an archivist’s lexicon and is kept short.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the excavation beats; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is selective: “embers refusing to die” charges the dragon image without crowding. High information density—each sentence layers history, tool, or sensory cue. A single mixed metaphor (“sediment in stone” applied to emotional resonance) is minor enough to leave 9-band eligibility intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit that walls retain emotional sediment and dragons are literal axis guardians is fresh, synthesizing archive fantasy with speculative anthropology. Transformation test passes: the silo-library, tapestry fragment, and dream-extinction timeline are inseparable from this exact plot. Risk of conceptual overload is flirted but held in check; a hair more embodied consequence would edge into 8.5+ territory.</comment>
