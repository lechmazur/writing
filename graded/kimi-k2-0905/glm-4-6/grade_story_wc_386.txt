<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“calloused from diving and delicate handling of ethereal matters” embodies vocation and vulnerability in one stroke—and her contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs compulsion to dive again) are active in the final beat. Micro-choices (caressing the melted globe, deciding to “dive again”) reliably externalize motive. The sixty-year backstory is efficiently anchored and tilted into present action. Cost is felt: each revelation “exhausts” her, but the story stops just short of dramatizing a renunciation or irreversible loss on this page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing: the Window’s last glint reframes every prior ghost-contact as unpaid debt, not gift. Causal chain holds—dream infiltration → director’s certainty → investigation—each step legible under Hybrid lens (accumulative dreams tighten into causal push). Cost is undeniable: “Working with such clarity always exhausted Elara.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Minor slack: the director’s off-page phone call is a black-box turn, but it is motivated by on-page dream transmission.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glacial shrine, diesel-salt scent, and the warped glass globe constrain action (she can’t leave without re-entering cold, can’t read ghosts without the globe). The globe’s “fractures” literalize her perceptual filter—setting doubles as perceptual apparatus. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: professional wreck-diver notices hull fracture patterns before metaphors. Final image of “starlight borrowed and returned” crystallizes environment into thematic mirror without overt symbol-mongering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—delivering drowned truth before ghosts overpower dreamers—signalled early. Escalation occurs through denser, more frantic dreams; pressure jumps from “echoes” to Nikolaus stepping fully into frame, forcing her to act. Agency is visible: she chooses to weave truth into director’s dream, pays immediate fatigue cost. Stakes stay coherent; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images of preserved vs evaporated—ice holds, globe leaks, starlight is “borrowed.” Final reconfiguration: exposure does not purify the deep, it merely transfers haunting to the living (“always more stories”). Subtext beats are crisp: candle flame vs glacier blue juxtaposes fragile life and eternal cold. No moralizing line; resonance carried by final breath-fog on glass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—synesthetic slide from diesel scent to ghost chill. Diction (“windows of connection,” “starlight borrowed”) remains within her idiom of salvage mysticism. Rhythm modulates: long frost-slow sentences for shrine meditation, clipped clauses when Nikolaus appears. No head-hop; director’s dream infiltration is shown only through her lens and its aftermath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can layer globe handling, breath fog, and ghost fatigue. Metaphors are spare and coherent—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on micro-turns. Minor scaffold: “always more stories waiting beneath the surface” edges toward template, but it is isolated and does not dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ghost-whispering wreck-diver is fresh; pairing it with dream-cameo forensics is distinctly non-generic. Synthesis feels inevitable because the globe’s fractures literalize both broken hull and dream fissure. Risk: cramming six months’ investigation resolution into one off-page call. Transformation strong enough that swapping setting or artifact would collapse meaning.</comment>
