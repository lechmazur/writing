<comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her joints ache, the thorn digs, the ink smells—yet the “calibrated treason” is stated more than dramatized; we are told she has endured but see only one flash of past winters. The final micro-choice (prick, blood, seal) crystallizes her renunciation, but the cost is slightly under-felt because the document’s downstream risk is only asserted. Still, the contradiction between holy setting and fraudulent act is held in tense, character-specific silence. A hair more dramatized fear or physical toll would have pushed this to 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens dominates: because she found the ink formula, therefore she can forge; because she forges, she breaks the cycle. Closure lands in the final “unlink” step—her lighter body and the thorn tucked to heart—an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Orientation is clean by line 5 (aurora sanctuary). One transition (undercroft → sanctuary) is legible and brief. No plot amnesia, no convenience; the document’s success is left open, but her internal victory is decisive on the page.</comment>

<comment>The marble sanctuary under shifting aurora is not backdrop: the cold seeps into her knees, the acoustics swallow weeping, the pearl twilight times her final burnish. Stalactite drips serve as diegetic clock, tightening the beat. The heritage thorn functions as micro-setting—handled, bloodied, recharged at closure. Only the undercroft line drifts into generic “forgotten” shorthand; a single sensory cue there would have hit 9+.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—erase Valerius name—signals early and tightens once: the ink formula discovery raises stakes from survival to systemic revenge. The single reversal is the drop of her own blood—shifting perfection into personal covenant, visible price on page. Pressure remains coherent; no outside coincidence. Escalation is linear rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 700-word window, but the absence of an external obstacle test keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges: forged truth can be holy when justice is unreachable—never sermonized, only embodied in wax and blood. The aurora’s color shift from emerald to pearl mirrors her internal shift from vengeance to unlinked poise. Subtext resides in the thorn: patrimony turned stylus of contrition. Final image reweights “forgiveness” as self-release, not mercy for him—complex, earned, unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is monkish—script, ink, acoustics, cold stone—never drifting into editorial omniscience. Syntax lengthens during forgery, mimetic of quill glide, then fragments as she stands—“joints protesting.” No filter-verb stacks; metaphor disciplined (“aurora painted” is the single lyric reach). Voice is consistent, character-bound, and rhythmic under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Density high: vellum/quill/ink/wax all work double duty as tactile detail and plot gear. Single mixed metaphor—“memories surfaced like drowning bodies”—but it is brief and fits emotional register. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges thorn and unlink motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Forging-as-prayer is fresh angle; aurora-lit sanctuary as forge room is atmospheric risk that pays off. Thorn-as-quill twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual repricing at end lifts it from revenge tale to sacramental paradox. Slight deduction because the House Valerius poisoning backstory is familiar aristocratic trope; the inversion is fresh, the root less so.</comment>
