<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara’s orderly-intuitive trait is shown through pattern-seeing and graffiti logistics, grounding her motive to preserve the carnivalesque. Interiority stays concrete—her hope “wavers” at the barges—but the dual-allegiance conflict is summarized more than dramatized; the final stance shift feels earned yet understated. Micro-choices (painting, placing the chip) are visible, but no contradictory impulse is staged inside a scene; the emotional cost is implied rather than embodied in a single charged beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: graffiti network density increases until the developers’ curiosity reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara watches the altered finale, moonlit chip crystallizing that preservation/adaptation have fused. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; one causal gap—how graffiti coordinates 47 rafts without leak—remains an ellipsis, not a break. Cost is conceptual (carnival now “moves with purpose”) and felt, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is the raft maze’s perpetual neon; sensory selectivity favors shifting light on water, narrowing to the chip’s rough pores under moonlight at closure. Micro-setting—the chip on the sill—functions as charged object reweighting the theme. Spatial choreography stays coherent across 47 rafts; no impossible moves. One minor efficiency gap: clean-energy barges are sketched, not used to block or enable a beat, so environment narrowly misses constraining tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve carnival soul vs. survival math—tightens when graffiti converts decay into “armor.” One meaningful deepening: developers’ curiosity replaces contempt, foreclosing total loss. Agency is cumulative: Mara’s encoded paintings shift community stance; no single reversal, but escalation accrues under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible—original acts rewritten, historic artifacts hidden—yet the price to Mara personally (time, risk, identity exposure) is only implied, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: coded art as living memory resisting commodification. Subtext in graffiti “decorative” script vs. hidden coordinates is clever, but final paragraph nudges toward explicit thesis (“culture shock absorbers never truly finished”). Resonant image—moonlit chip as silver veins—reweights escape into renewal, yet the closing line’s abstraction slightly dilutes earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly pinned to Mara; perceptual signature favors patterns, currents, and paint glow. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic variation supports accumulative design. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. One register lift—“conceptualized,” “equilibrium”—slightly academic for a raft-born culture worker, but consistent; voice remains distinct and coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high density: “salt and sweat of generations” compresses history. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare, vehicles stay coherent. One mixed metaphor flickers—“armor” of aesthetics vs. “buoyant” soul—yet doesn’t cloud causality. Final line drumbeats “never truly finished,” a micro-repeat, but inside closure beat so allowed; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival + graffiti resistance is a fresh synthesis; trope of gentrification is inverted through covert art network. The foundation-stone chip re-appears as glyph and moonlit sigil—inevitable yet surprising. Conceptual integrity commits fully: no retreat to mainland safety. Risk in accumulative structure pays off; specifics feel particular to this watery maze, not transferable template.</comment>
