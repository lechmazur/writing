<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning for “lost joy” is vivid early, but her interiority drifts into lyric summary (“pensive mirth” repeated) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the single micro-choice—initiating the light ritual—launches the vision but carries no visible risk or trade-off, so the beat feels more observational than crucible. The absence of live opposition or cost keeps the arc just below the 7.3 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the last line reframes the fragment from relic to “treasure” and reweights Elara’s stance—she now carries the light she conjured, a conceptual cost that forecloses her remaining innocent nostalgia. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each pulse of light thickens the nostalgic texture until the final fadeout crystallizes her solitary custodianship. The orientation anchor (“within the fold of a daydream”) is taught early and pays off, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fog-shrouded orchard, crumbling plaster, and moss-covered wall are filtered through Elara’s painterly eye; sensory hierarchy privileges ochre light and damp chill, guiding her ritual posture. The fresco fragment’s tactile crumbling directly enables the resurrection beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Single stake—recover lost joy—tightens once when the vision begins to fade and Elara must accept transience; the felt price is the ache of watching blossoms dissolve back into mist, a visible forfeiture that alters her emotional ledger. No external antagonist, but internal pressure suffices under Accumulative lens; still, the escalation is brief and could use one more beat of narrowing options to breach 7.3.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of art as salvage emerges organically: the act of “painting with light” transmutes private nostalgia into sharable memory without moralizing. Final image—fragment warm in satchel—reweights the premise: joy is not found but continuously re-illumined, a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection beyond the plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric POV stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter; rhythmic control mirrors ebb/flow of visionary light (“light began to bleed…faint glow…motes danced”). No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “chemical emulsions” and “pensive mirth,” which individuates her artist intellect without rupturing register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentence variation carries the swell and retreat of the vision. One paraphrase loop (“pensive mirth” twice) and a single mixed metaphor (“breath hanging like tiny ghosts”) nick half a point, but artifacts avoid the closure beat, permitting 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “paint with light” mechanic freshens standard memory-recovery tropes; coupling fresco archaeology with photochemical logic feels idiosyncratic and specific to Elara. While orchard-as-lost-Eden is familiar, the synthesis of muralism and latent-image chemistry supplies a non-obvious angle that would collapse if swapped out.</comment>
