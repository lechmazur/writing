<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is rich (“expectant resignation” crystallizes her stance), but the internal contradiction is more asserted than dramatized in-scene; her micro-choice to place the rosette back on the desk is the only visible fork. The “skeptical administration” is off-page, so no status crucible tests her. Students remain a chorus; no single secondary character applies pressure that forces her to adapt tactics. Closure is Earned Stasis: she accepts the quiet cost of persistence, but the beat is a single gesture, not a pressured fork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: Eleanor lights the lamp, accepting the “slipping away” of the art with quiet cost felt in the amber chord. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of subtraction (noise, hatred, hesitation) tightens through repetition and reweights the stake (“ancient melodies became bridges”). Orientation is clean: velvet library / autumn / Eleanor anchored by word 24. One causal micro-turn—two students create perfect fifths—deepens rather than reverses; no decisive external change, so tension plateaus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its “traveled stillness” and autumn leaves pressing the windows mirror the encroaching loss and supply acoustic hush that enables the final chord to hang. The rosette is handled in three beats—desk, sunlight, final placement—charging the closure. Sensory selection is biased to Eleanor’s musician ear (dust motes in sunlight, chord hanging like amber). Spatial choreography stays clean: students file in, sit shoulder-to-shoulder, leave; no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save vanishing art by merging hostile voices—signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: administrative dismissal → she risks rehearsing anyway. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of slow loss) rather than tactical; no resource lost, no option foreclosed on-page. Agency is endurance, not decisive gamble; the tightening is lyrical, not causal, so escalation feels gentle rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: “diversity creates the most beautiful harmonies” is never spoken; it resonates through the fifth discovered by once-divided students. The rosette’s reprise at the end reweights earlier description into a quiet answer. Subtext lives in gesture—shoulder-to-shoulder seating, the single lamp—avoiding moral summation. Final image of “autumn amber” chord offers Charged Poise that lets reader feel the cost of persistence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains a controlled, musical cadence; syntax lengthens and shortens like breath (“their competing harmonies gradually resolving into unexpected unity”). Filter verbs are scarce; perceptions are musician-specific (“perfect fifths,” “mathematics of a culture”). No dialogue to test, so voice coherence rests in consistent metaphoric register. Diction stays within Eleanor’s plausible lexicon; velvet, rosette, amber feel lived-in, not decorative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; sentences layer image and idea without scaffold (“autumn leaves pressed themselves against the tall library windows”). One paraphrase loop: “subtracting noise from both their conversations and their ancestral melodies” repeats the concept inside one line—minor. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay acoustic. Opening and closing lines are image-based, satisfying the ear. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: uses a forgotten zither rosette as literal notation and social bridge—specific, non-obvious. Tropes of healing-through-art and small-town grudges are transformed by acoustic mathematics and library hush. Risk is quiet rather than bold, keeping stakes intimate; could swap in any endangered folk instrument, so irreplaceability is moderate. Emotional specificity lifts it above template.</comment>
