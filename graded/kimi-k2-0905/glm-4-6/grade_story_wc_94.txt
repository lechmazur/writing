<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The poet’s through-line—map the scars, dare to read aloud—stays legible; his trembling envelope-rip is a believable micro-choice under pressure. Interiority drifts into canned abstraction (“furiously tranquil,” “quiet rage”) rather than embodied contradiction, dulling specificity. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the stance crystallizes credibly, yet the cost feels pre-summarized rather than discovered in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the timer’s click triggers the poet’s shift from witness to cartographer, a Charged Poise re-weighting under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. Causality is thematic rather than plot-based—each beat deepens image density until the final lightning flash—acceptable for this lens and length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Observatory, storm, and envelope function as micro-setting objects that constrain the final act; the glass dome’s cold against palms is tactically used just before the stance shift. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound of timer, chill of glass) mirrors interior narrowing. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Meets 9+ gate but lacks fresh environmental twist, capping at 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break silence vs. keep safe—surfaces early. Escalation is imagistic: storm thickens, envelope nears opening; the timer’s click provides the single required tightening that crystallizes stance. Cost is conceptual (future exposure) rather than immediate, enough for this length but not viscerally felt on-page. Agency resides in the envelope decision; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of mapping collective scars emerges through concrete objects—timetable, poem, timer—without authorial thesis. Final image re-prices silence as unfinished cartography; ambiguity lingers legitimately. Avoids moralizing, though occasional phrases (“cartography of scars,” “constellation of his art”) flirt with thematic echo. Resonance holds but doesn’t deepen prior material stunningly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains perceptual signature: stormlight, ink-clouds, glass chill filtered through a poet’s eye. Syntax flexes from rolling anaphora to sharp fragment (“release”) under rising pressure; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within literate poet lexicon. Voice distinctiveness is steady, if not electrifying.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety; sentences breathe with storm tempo. A few soft loops (“poem… map… map” restate) and stacked metaphors (“storm-kissed wonder,” “tempestuous and serene”) slightly over-season high-pressure beats. No artifact reaches closure beat; clarity intact. Minor tightening would elevate to 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Censored poet + observatory storm + darkroom timer as silence-metaphor creates a fresh fusion; bus-timetable relic is a sharp specificity. Concept risks prompt self-consciousness yet feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes; risk is present but controlled, not gimmicky. Could push further into unexplored emotional territory for 9-band.</comment>
