<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction between serenity-seeking and obsessive nightly vigil is present but stays summary; no moment of simultaneous impulse in-scene. The final renunciation—sharing seeds and porch ritual—lands with visible communal cost, satisfying earned stasis. Olfactory gift is concrete (diagnosing ailments) but never complicates her choice under pressure; it’s a super-power without drawback. Micro-choices remain ritualized rather than risk-laden; the corpse flower never threatens failure or forces a wrenching trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the porch becomes communal scriptorium, seeds distributed, serenity redefined as shared motion. Causality is accumulative: nightly doodles → wrapping-paper archive → communal ritual; the pattern is taught early and reweights meaning at end. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; no causal reversals needed. Cost is felt: her private obsession dissolves into village chorus—"each carrying their own scrap"—foreclosing solitary path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Treetop village is sketched with swift, tactile anchors (rope ladder, branch foundations, misty canopy) that constrain movement and social fabric. Corpse-flower scent acts as micro-setting, invading lungs and dictating tempo of dawn gathering. Wrapping-paper interiors function as portable setting-object hybrid, charging final image when scattered across porch. Environmental detail never stalls beats; each mention seeds later communal use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal serenity via solitary cultivation—tightens when nightly vigil draws spectators, narrowing privacy. Escalation is incremental: sprout → bud → bloom → shared seeds; each stage adds social witness, foreclosing isolation. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive attention. Cost is legible only at end when she forfeits exclusivity; middle beats feel safe, lacking tactic-altering danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: decay-as-renewal migrates from plant to ritual to community without authorial nudge. Wrapping paper—literal detritus—becomes wisdom carrier, repricing “waste” as archive. Final image reframes serenity as motion-with-others, dodging platitude. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance carried by scattered paper scraps catching moonlight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s perceptual filter: scent metaphors, charcoal-smudged fingers, spiral vine doodles—texture stays consistent. Psychic distance tightens under bloom scent: “something ancient… remembering” reads as synesthetic thought, not exposition. Dialogue sparse but natural; Finn’s “When will it bloom?” sounds like actual child urgency. No register drift; scientific terms (“corpse flower”) filtered through her wonder, not textbook.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; sentence rhythm mirrors seasonal accumulation without monotony. Metaphors are spare and anchored (moonlit web, tide’s thought) rather than stacked. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances archive, scent, or social encroachment. Opening and closing lines bookend with rope ladder and seed dispersal, creating cadence symmetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower horticulture in treetop hamlet is fresh angle; wrapping-paper journal subverts expected bound diary. Risk taken in quiet, observational arc rather than disaster plot; payoff is communal poetics rather than spectacle. Olfactory sensitivity as diagnostic gift edges toward magic but stays character-bound. Could verge cliché yet avoids eco-mysticism sermon by grounding wisdom in scrap ritual.</comment>
