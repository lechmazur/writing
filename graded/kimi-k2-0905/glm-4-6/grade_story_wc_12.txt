<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The priest’s interiority is rendered through embodied ritual micro-choices—foot on pedal, brush in air—that externalize his contradictory drives to contain and confront the void. His flaw (intellectual hubris that silence can be mastered) compounds across loops, and the Earned Stasis victory leaves him vibrating with unspoken cost: “the weight…settling into his bones.” One slip: the moment of wavering is told in abstract “resolve wavered” rather than shown through perceptual crack.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the anchor stabilizes but the priest exits with silence as a persistent constraint—“the silence followed him.” Causal chain holds: every loop, stroke, and rhetorical question tightens the entity’s options until the final unlooped note fissures its hold. Cost is legible in the final image—“the violet color was gone, but its memory lingered”—a conceptual repricing that reweights his future tactics. Lens (Hybrid→Accumulative) is taught early and held without wobble.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor functions as micro-setting: its quivers dictate when the priest pedals harder or shifts from chant to pigment. Body-as-setting is equally precise—robes whisper, breath sucked into vacuum stone—guiding his stance and tool use. Violet pigment’s refusal to fade supplies the final image that recharges prior strokes. One minor over-clocking: “muffled clarity” is repeated four times without fresh sensory tilt after the second use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—prevent full possession—tightens through each loop-layer and pigment stroke; the entity’s recoil is the visible price that forecloses the option to give up. Escalation is accumulative: density of loops, light, and violet circles increases until the final unlooped note ruptures the stillness. Agency stays with the priest; coincidence is absent. The cost is felt in his exhausted exit, though the entity’s defeat is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the danger of trying to decorate absence into meaning. Silence as medium, violet as trace, loop as echo—all shift from control tactic to fragile ward. Final image reweights the premise: absence can only be contained, never erased. No moralizing; the reader carries the hum of the pedal as aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the priest’s perceptual filter: sound absorbed, color trembling, joints tracked against stone. Syntax mirrors ritual cadence—balanced phrases that tighten into staccato under pressure. No head-hop; pedal, palette, and robe function as extensions of his body. Voice is singular, chant-like, yet never drifts into monotony because each loop adds harmonic pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density lyric: every sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned—silence as paint, loop as prayer—and pays off in the final dissolving stroke. One paraphrase loop: “the silence returned, heavier now” echoes earlier “silence…thick” within 40 words; the second could compress. Otherwise, cadence breathes with the pedal presses, no algorithmic drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sound-art, liturgy, and cosmic horror feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. The loop pedal as sacramental tool re-invents both exorcism and performance art. Risk—entire conflict fought in abstract color-sound—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor deduction: “dimensional anchor” is genre-familiar; the piece does not transform the term’s interior logic beyond vibration and light.</comment>
