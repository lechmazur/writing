<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present (writer-block vs. calling to collect hopes), but the shift is narrated rather than dramatized in scene; the “I solemnize” beat is the only micro-choice we watch, and it arrives late. Embodied emotion is lyrical rather than visceral—no bodily specifics under pressure beyond “warm” shell and “dry clothes.” Because the arc is allegorical, flaws feel safely “literary” rather than urgent; cost is conceptual, not personal, so the needed sting is muted. Closure turns on renunciation of old writer-self, but that self was sketched in summary, so the forfeiture is understood, not felt.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each hope-collecting beat thickens texture and reweights the stake (creativity restored). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—manuscript now “living entity”—with undeniable cost (he is now conduit, not owner). Orientation is clear by line 30; causality across mosaic shards is loose but coherent under lyric rule-set. Final image recharges shell/morning-light motif, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.</comment>

<comment>The feral nexus remains a poetic constant, but its mist, dry-river logic, and cameo physics are taught early and rule-consistent. Shell functions as micro-setting: warmth, geometry, vibration constrain every collection beat. Sensory triage is biased to poet-sight (watercolor, pulsing orbs) yet stays purposeful. Spatial choreography is lightly tracked—no impossible placements—so environment serves symbolic pressure without logistical confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—creative resurrection—signals on page 1; escalation is textural: each harvested hope deepens the cost of failure until “hollow structure” becomes “living entity.” Agency is present in the solemnize micro-choices; refusal to look away anchors the ephemeral figures. Visible price: he forfeits sole authorship, becoming vessel—price stated on page. No reversal, but deepening suffices under lyric lens; luck never intervenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: art as extraction, not invention—born from witnessing unlived lives. Spiral shell and orb imagery recur with shifting valence (tool → vessel → desk lamp), recharging closure. No moralizing sentence spells the lesson; final image of “new stories waiting to be born” lets reader complete the reconfiguration. Ambiguity remains: is the conduit state gift or servitude? Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is stable, with poet-novelist diction (“impossible geometry of longing”) justified by protagonist’s vocation. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic sentences for mist, staccato “I see you” for collect-beats. No dialogue to distort register. Free indirect style is clean; perceptual signature skews visual-metaphoric, matching character type. Slight template cadence in “Against the current…” repetitions, but pattern is taught early and serves mantra effect, so allowed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lush figurative density risks purple in spots (“molten silver forming impossible geometry”), yet stays aligned with dream-logic rule-set. One paraphrase loop detected: “steps confident across shifting sands where reality bent” repeats bent-reality notion within three lines. No mixed metaphors; time-sequence is clean. Opening and closing lines are sharp; middle contains minor scaffold (“each moment stretching according to need”). Overall propulsion maintained; artifacts never touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Writer cures block by harvesting unwritten souls in liminal mist” is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. Spiral shell as telepathic codex and container for abstract hopes is inventive; likewise “solemnize” ritual professionalizes witness. Risk lies in high lyric register—could slide into workshop cliché—but specificity of orb shapes (star, wing, pyramid) grounds concept. Transformation test passes: swap shell or river and entire metaphoric engine collapses.</comment>
