<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s spiritual-custodian persona is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“flourishing stillness,” “transformative power”) that flattens contradiction. No embodied emotion under the meteor-empathy beats; she “feels resonance” rather than trembling, tearing, or breath-catching. The final renunciation is signaled, yet the cost feels intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each meteor pass layers density until the lantern glass reweights meaning at closure. Orientation clean by 120 words; causality intact—lantern teaches pattern, Elara repeats ritual, glass evolves. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “empty, ready to receive more” crystallizes cost of perpetual openness. Minor loop: “she began to… she continued to…” softens the final tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Station and lantern glass function as micro-setting: obsolete consoles and warm yellow light constrain every move. Sensory triage—cold monitors, soft chime, breathing glass—filters through Elara’s custodial bias. Spatial choreography stable; no white-room syndrome. The lantern’s evolving glow tracks interior shift and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: maintain empathic communion or retreat into isolation. Escalation is textural—each meteor shower intensifies the lantern’s glow and Elara’s spiritual risk. No external antagonist; pressure is existential, tightening until the glass empties itself, forcing her into perpetual receptivity. Cost legible: she accepts endless vulnerability in exchange for cosmic connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated meteor deaths: strength via vulnerability. Subtext resides in lantern’s shift from warm fullness to luminous emptiness—an unspoken koan on receptivity. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; no character spells out the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; cosmic diction (“celestial bodies,” “luminous life”) fits educated loner custodian. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences for ritual, crisp fragments at clarity peak. No head-hopping or register drift. Lantern glass as perceptual filter gives memorable perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, largely loop-free; occasional “she began to” scaffolding repeats but never obscures causality. Metaphors consistent—light, breath, warmth—no mixed vehicles. High information density: each sentence layers image or emotional increment. One paraphrase loop mid-final paragraph (−0.2) prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cosmic-janitor + empathic meteor-tracking is fresh synthesis; yellow lantern as vulnerability engine avoids stock mystic artifact tropes. Concept commits fully, follows implications to luminous emptiness. Risky stillness philosophy central, not ornamental. Slight familiarity of “loner attains cosmic wisdom” arc keeps it sub-9.</comment>
