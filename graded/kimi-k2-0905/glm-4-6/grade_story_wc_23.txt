<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is sensory and specific; the coat-patches and censer foot act as embodied memory. One contradiction—he “doesn’t pick up” yet the voice “would tell him only what he already knew”—flattens micro-choice tension at the climax beat, nudging the score down from 8+. Still, the renunciation of the phone method lands as earned stasis with visible cost: he walks away carrying the bronze weight, grief literalized.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the censer foot placed at the map-center crystallizes “a place he could never return but could always visit.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each patch, moon-phase pulse, and midnight call layers until the final silence feels re-weighted. The withheld pickup is the decisive micro-choice that forecloses the old compass, paying off the taught pattern. Cost is legible in the final image: he carries the bronze alone toward a horizon that offers no arrival.</comment>

<comment>The starlit signal station is rendered through broken hydraulics, dust-threaded glass, and a frayed rotary wire—details that constrain action (no antennas = no outgoing signal). The body-as-setting functions when coat-patches bristle “like old friends,” anchoring orientation inside the parka instead of the room. Micro-setting qualifies: the censer foot’s changing temperature and moon-lit sheen directly guide the charcoal lines on the floor. Environment and tool jointly charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping the geography of loss—tightens when the censer foot grows hot, forcing the final line that edges “where the sea had taken everything.” Escalation is textural: each sensory echo (patch, moon phase, phone silence) accretes until refusal is the only possible stance. No live antagonist, yet environmental decay and grief’s tide supply coherent pressure. Visible cost is the forfeiture of the midnight-call crutch; future navigation will ache without that phantom voice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the conceit that loss is a navigable coastline rather than a feeling; the map drawn in charcoal is the story’s concrete answer. No moral is stated—only the final image of a man walking toward a horizon that never arrives. The censer foot’s patina and the coat-patches re-weight their first appearance into a quiet promise of return, fulfilling the non-literal reprise test. Ambiguity lingers: is solace found or forever sought? The refusal to answer is the honest resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative: long braid sentences mirror the stitching of coat and memory, then fracture into single-line staccato at the climax (“The phone rang. He didn’t pick it up.”), teaching the pattern and paying it off. Perceptual signature is strong—moonlight is a “silver coin waiting to be spent,” grief is a shoreline you can walk but never reach. No dialogue to test, yet free-indirect compression stays clean. Register never drifts above the navigator’s lived vernacular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but controlled: “each patch a memory of places he’d once known” does triple duty—world, character, thematic spine. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“the station’s silence returned, deeper now”) costs −0.2. Figurative logic stays coherent—bronze that “shimmers like liquid moonlight” keeps within the maritime/celestial palette. No artifact touches the closure image, so 9+ remains technically possible, but the loop keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The reverse-migration concept flips the usual exile story into an inward cartography of grief, fresh without gimmickry. Coat-patches as memory-archive and censer foot as tide-calibrated compass are specific inventions that would collapse if swapped for generic tokens. Risk is taken in the lyric refusal of externalized plot, yet coherence holds. The synthesis feels inevitable: of course a patchwork man would map his scars with a moon-drunk bronze weight.</comment>
