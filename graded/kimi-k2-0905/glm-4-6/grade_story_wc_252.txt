<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s guarded-cage interiority is vivid and embodied (“violence she’d never known gave way to a tender ferocity”), but the causality between scrimshaw-glow and heart-unlock is asserted, not dramatized; the climactic choice rests on lyrical declaration rather than a visible micro-choice with cost. Still, her contradictory impulses (conformity vs. defiance) stay alive in scene and the final stance is credibly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: the whale-call motif and scrimshaw glow tighten the stake through patterned return; the disappearing island reappears as Charged Poise with felt loneliness-cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sublittoral fringe”), transition at mid-story is legible, closure lands as Earned Stasis—she forecloses the island path yet carries its song, cost legible in “salt on her lips.” One soft patch: the island’s rule (“demand she detach”) is told, not tested in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Coral-shadow lattices, whalebone texture, and warm vanishing-sand are filtered through Elara’s labor-honed perception; the scrimshaw constrains her final choice and charges the last image. Spatial choreography stays clean across water-to-island-to-dock loop; only micro-slip is “air grew thin” underwater—easily read as metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom vs. belonging—signals early; escalation is driven by scrimshaw glow and whale-call density, each return narrowing options. The final detachment costs her the island’s community, but because the island’s demand was narrated rather than dramatized, the price feels conceptual more than visceral; still, it forecloses a live option under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: gentleness as rebellion, grace as weapon. The whalebone charms tree re-images piratical defiance into self-acceptance without moralizing. Final laugh-salt image offers resonant non-literal answer; only minor drift is the late abstract equation “freedom wasn’t a place but a choice,” which lightly echoes prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains liquid, cetacean rhythm; diction stays within dock-worker Elara’s plausible lexis. Perceptual signature is sharp—“world unraveled into myth,” “sand soft beneath her feet.” No dialogue to judge; free-indirect slips are clean. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mimics wave-pulse; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor stack (“grace a stark contrast to brutish labor… violence become impossible”) is vivid enough to pass. High information density: each line layers sensory, emotional, or symbolic work. Proofing clean; only micro-glitch is repeated “the scrimshaw glow/glowed” within 60 words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing pacifist dystopia, pirate relic, and vanishing-isle portal into a lyric crucible of self-definition feels fresh; the disappearing island trope is retooled as interior mirror rather than escape hatch. Specificity of sublittoral labor and whale-song mechanics grounds the concept. Risk in quiet ending heightens rather than dilutes resonance.</comment>
