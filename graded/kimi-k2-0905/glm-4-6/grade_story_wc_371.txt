<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers on moss, shawl-adjusting as self-soothing—but “creeping normality noticer” is asserted not shown in micro-choices. The bread momentarily charges her stance, yet the trait never complicates tactics; the old man’s arrival and her instant steady voice flatten the flaw/pressure nexus. Still, the final smile is credibly small, earned, and costly under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the eaten loaf reweights absence into shared memory, bird chirp crystallizes new quiet. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of scent seeds, silence, bread—tightens once when man eats with her; cost is the gone loaf, the stayed bird, the winter ahead. Orientation anchored by word 50; no causal gap. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tea-house balustrade, moss, yew hedge, barren soil—each detail is handled, not catalogued, and constrains her planting action. The bread’s crust-as-map is a micro-setting object that charges the final image when shared. Sensory hierarchy obeys her priorities: damp earth, phantom yeast, faint chirp. Spatial choreography clean; no world-rule drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: wrest meaning from eroding world via small acts. Pressure tightens once when gardener-baker appears and bread is shared, reweighting the act from solitary ritual to communal memory. Cost is legible—she loses the last loaf but gains an ally and audible bird. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: memory as seed, bread as sacrament, absence as medium. No explicit thesis; final image of stayed bird and tasted crust reconfigures “sacred in ordinary” without sermon. Subtext in silent eating and man’s cloak shimmer. Ambiguity guarded—no moral, only tasted promise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice: syntax lengthens with scent-memory, shortens at bird-chirp. Diction stays within Elara’s perceptual lexicon—“phantom sweetness,” “guerrilla gardening.” No head-hop; single POV stable. Dialogue minimal, indirect—“I baked that”—carries subtext. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she smelled” as act of attention).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence rhythm mirrors breath, paragraph cuts tighten toward final chirp. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor. Density high—“bread…perfect map of forgotten streets” does two jobs. One near-filter verb cluster mid-seed-planting but does not stall closure. Opening & final line frame and recharge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshens post-apocalypse trope via sensory micro-acts rather than宏观 collapse. Bread-as-map and guerrilla gardening are specific, not quirky ornament. Risky quiet ending lands because prior pattern teaches reader to value small sounds. Slight proximity to “baked memory” trope keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
