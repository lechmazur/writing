<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—clutching the wheel while trying to exile his own ghost—play out in continuous, embodied beats. The micro-choice to crush the wheel into mist is both renunciation and self-indictment, paying the cost of “eroded ambitions” with physical pain. Interiority stays concrete: “the plastic cool against his palms,” not abstract regret. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: he forecloses nostalgia yet remains scarred, ghost quiet but not erased—an unmistakable price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fragment-collecting and mirror-images accrue until pattern-break—wheel crumbles, ghost thins—reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final step onto “something beyond” crystallizes both option and cost without exposition. Causality is interior yet legible—because he keeps trading borrowed memories, therefore the ghost thins; because the wheel dissolves, therefore he can leave. Cost is visible in the closing image—clouds closing behind him, lagoon humming farewell—an undeniable conceptual toll.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is not backdrop but physics: tilting planes force Elias to crouch, sink, recalibrate balance. The camera wheel functions as micro-setting—its brittle teeth gauge his own wear, its final crumble cues the exit. Sensory hierarchy obeys scavenger bias: mirrored water first read as salvageable surface, then as threat when reflection shows “older, tired.” Spatial choreography is clean—boots sink, mist thins, horizon parts—no floating anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single stake: negotiate exile of own ghost; pressure escalates via density—each collected fragment tightens internal polarity between regret and forward motion. One meaningful deepening: when he realizes stories are “for him,” not the ghost, the premise reweights—refuge becomes self-accusation. Cost is visible—wheel dissolves into skin-biting shards—altering later gait toward horizon. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as paradox: freedom is acceptance of irreducible self-haunting rather than ghost’s erasure. Subtext resides in gesture—crushing plastic = crushing former identity—never named aloud. Final image reconfigures rule: horizon is not escape but next sentence in same story. Avoids moralizing; resonance is imagistic, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction stays within scavenger lexicon—“brittle curve,” “salvaged,” “barter.” Rhythm mirrors lagoon pulse: long sentences during drift, fragments under pressure—“He tightened. He recited. He stood.” No filter-verb stacks; perception is body-first. Voice never explains metaphor; metaphor is experienced as tactile event.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “carousel horse, frozen mid-rear” does triple duty—setting, symbol, mirror—in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“kinetic lagoon hummed” remains audible motion, not mixed vehicle. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo—“hummed above” vs “hummed its farewell”—pattern taught and paid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: regret-as-haunting literalized into negotiable ghost scavenged by overheard stories in skyborne lagoon—conceptual risk that stays plausible via sensory grounding. Carousel-stillness inversion supplies non-obvious ticking clock. Crumbling disposable camera as soul-barometer feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
