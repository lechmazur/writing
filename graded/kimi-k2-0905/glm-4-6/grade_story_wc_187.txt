<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers “preemptively nostalgic,” his breath hitching under the weight of revelation. The contradiction between his need to archive and the fear of losing clarity is held in scene, not stated. The final smile is a credibly costly stance: he accepts that his own memories will one day be whispers, and that knowledge lands with quiet force. Only the “summer-quill” label is ornamental; it never acquires tactical weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the melting fog returns the world to vapor, but Kael’s notes and body now carry the archive—an irreversible internalization with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crystal whisper, shadow measurement, and ledger stroke thickens the density until the final image reweights the premise. The persistent constraint is the obligation to remember without certainty; it shapes every micro-choice. No causality breaks; orientation anchors (who/where/when) are vivid by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and solidified fog function as micro-settings that constrain movement and perception. The “crystal whispering” surface literally holds voices only Kael can hear, turning ground into archive—an environment that dictates method and stakes. Shadow lengths refuse sun geometry and obey fog-time, a world rule discovered through action that directly powers the climax. Final image reuses the setting: the melting forecourt is the exact place where the cost becomes visible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve collective memory before fog erases it—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Kael realizes the fog has its own timeline. One meaningful deepening: shadow geometry mismatch forces him to trust fog-time, foreclosing reliance on sun-based certainty. Cost is legible: the clarity he will lose when fog lifts is felt preemptively, and the dawn melt makes that loss real. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific inversion: memory is not retrieved but deposited—Kael becomes the medium rather than the seeker. The final image of silence where whispers were reconfigures the central question from “What did they remember?” to “Who will remember me?” No moralizing; the bittersweet smile is the non-literal answer. Preemptive nostalgia is dramatized, not labelled, giving the piece its ache without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught: “preemptively nostalgic” repeats with变异, teaching the reader to feel anticipatory loss. Syntax mirrors archivist precision—stacked participles echo ledger lines—yet stays readable. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices shadow angles the way a sailor notices wind. No head-hopping; psychic distance crystallizes in the final line where silence becomes tactile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“dome split by lightning that never struck” condenses setting, threat, and paradox in one image. Rhythm accelerates toward the dawn melt, then exhales into the final short clause. Zero loops, no synonym churn; “preemptively nostalgic” is purposeful pattern, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lonely archivist, stormbound observatory—are re-cast through the crystal forecourt that stores voices in rain-fog, a concrete mechanism not seen elsewhere. The inversion of memory-as-deposit rather than memory-as-retrieval gives the概念 fresh torque. Risk taken: lyric repetition of “preemptively nostalgic” could cloy yet accrues elegiac force. Specificity of method (shadow lengths vs fog-time) makes the invention feel inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
