<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s “softly adaptive” therapist mode is shown through her instrument choices and watchful silence, not jargon; the baby-curl talisman and eclipse timing externalize her motive without therapy-speak. Leo’s first gesture—hand extended in darkness—pays off three months of selective mutism believably because the story lets his body speak first. Interiority stays concrete: harp strings test the air “like a tentative greeting,” not abstract labels. The final mutual curl exchange crystallizes a shared cost—her professional boundary thins, his grief externalized—earning the micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Single continuous scene under the eclipse clock; causality is lyrical but legible: because Maya plays, therefore Leo taps; because totality arrives, therefore voice returns. The curl-objects teleport once (her locket appears in Leo’s hand without prior transfer), a nit that nicks but doesn’t break the linkage. Closure is a Charged Poise: arms raised toward the ring-of-light reconfigure both their private griefs into shared wonder; cost is the irreversible exposure of their talismans on the grass. Orientation anchor (highest point of Sage Ridge) arrives by line 6; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sage-covered ridge and ancient oak root system double as metaphor and physical stage, constraining where Maya can stand and where Leo plants himself; the eclipse shadow literally moves their interaction zone. Harp and silver locket function as micro-settings that dictate proximity—she must sit within arm’s reach for the curl exchange. Sensory hierarchy obeys therapist POV: sound of strings first, then visual eclipse, finally tactile hand-link. Final image—two lockets now magnetized by shared music—recharges the ridge with new emotional cartography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Maya elicit any voluntary sound from Leo before sunlight returns. Escalation is accumulative-textural: each musical texture (harp, hum, stone rhythm) thickens possibility until the eclipse darkening supplies irreversible pressure. Agency is Maya’s renunciation of forcing; her tactical retreat into stargazing lullaby is the decisive narrowing that invites Leo’s first move. Cost is visible—she risks professional failure in real time under a cosmic clock—yet the reversal feels gentle rather than sharp, capping the score just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Ordinary magic” emerges through concrete re-pricing of two baby curls: from memento mori to bridge object. Theme avoids moralizing; the final line—“how small—and how connected—we truly are”—is voiced by narrator, not character, but is earned by the eclipse image that literally miniaturizes them under cosmic fire. Subtext operates in silent hand-link and curl placement, not exposition. The concept that healing is recognition, not repair, is shown via mutual vulnerability rather than thesis statement, satisfying complexity without tidy equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Maya’s perceptual filter: harp notes “test the air,” eclipse light “collects in the hollow.” Diction is lyrical yet therapist-precise: “softly adaptive,” “closed posture,” “unconscious rhythm.” No head-hopping; Leo’s interiority is guessed only through body cues. Syntax modulates with pressure—short paratactic clauses during totality, then flowing cadence as music loosens. Dialogue is sparse and child-authentic: “Can you link the music to the stars?”—a line that could only be Leo’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences during harp flow, staccato fragments as moon bites sun. No synonym churn; “curl” always “curl,” never lock or tress. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 800 words, each paying off (roots as rivers, music as bridge, eclipse as halo). Filter verbs minimal; perception direct: “she touched the locket,” not “she felt herself touching.” Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Eclipse-as-therapy-device is fresh without gimmick; the celestial event is not a backdrop but an active pressure mechanism that times the boy’s first words. Baby-curl motif is specific enough to avoid generic keepsake cliché—its origin (pre-birth lock) is particular. Combination of music therapy + solar totality + memento hair feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at concept level. Risk taken: quiet climax without shouted epiphany; coherence survives, meriting high-band entry.</comment>
