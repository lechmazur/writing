<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “wise fool” mask is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“the universe…a tapestry of lies”) that reduces contradictory impulse to aphorism; no micro-choice after the mid-point visibly risks his cover, so the renunciation at the end feels assumed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final stitch collapses the unseen web, a legible before/after shift with felt cost (his mask must stay on). Causal chain is lyric, not tight—why this stitch now?—but the candle-pattern teaches an accumulative lens that holds to the last image; orientation clear by word 80, no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, silver thread, and candle-flame interact tactilely—thread gleams, flame syncs with heartbeat—anchoring abstract stakes to handled objects; the observatory’s silence is used as acoustic pressure, not postcard décor, and constrains the final stillness that lets the coup pause.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the loose thread before the coup”—is signaled early; pressure tightens via candle-flame brightening as each stitch narrows possibility. Cost is conceptual (permanent mask, stories still unheard) rather than visceral; one meaningful deepening, but no live option is foreclosed on the page, holding it shy of 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: listening as resistance, embroidery as counter-espionage. Final image—chart shimmering, silence lighter—reweights prior motifs without moralizing; ambiguity survives (coup merely postponed). Subtext in flame-whispers and “echoed silence” avoids explicit thesis, letting reader carry the aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains anchored to Elias’s biased perception—starlight “threaded,” flame “whispering truths only he could hear.” Rhythm breathes with stitching tempo; no head-hopping. Diction stays within artisan-astronomer lexicon; cadence control heightens at climax without obscuring causality. A near-invisible seam of filter verbs (“he could feel it”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and plot work. One paraphrase loop (“echoed silence” hit three times) and a mixed metaphor (“galaxy-chart alive, pulsing…edges fraying”) dilute clarity; neither touches the closure beat. Otherwise propulsive, rhythm varied, no scaffold clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Embroidery-as-intelligence and candle-as-oracle refresh familiar spy tropes; the “adjacent possibilities” mechanic stays conceptual, not transformative. Specificity of cobalt observatory and silver starlight keeps it from template drift. Risk is lyric accumulation rather than bold structural gamble, so bonus withheld.</comment>
