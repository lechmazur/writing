<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s contradictory impulses—profit from drought vs. reverence for lost birds—are declared rather than dramatized; the egg-release is the only micro-choice that visibly costs him, so the arc feels asserted. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“fractured grace,” “secretly sentimental”) without embodied contradiction in real time. Still, the final renunciation lands because the salt-flat silence and evaporating footprints externalize a believable self-punishment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the egg’s molecular song replaces physical possession, leaving Silas with an audible ghost he can never trade or display—cost is legible in the rain erasing his footprints. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat adds density (drought profit → cryo-chamber → salt map → resonance) until the final cadence shift reweights his entire archive. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop; its reflective crust doubles the sky and becomes the resonator that traps the bird’s song, directly enabling the closure technology. Micro-setting—the egg’s ghost image in the salt—constrains Silas to kneel and accept non-possession. Sensory economy favors glare, crunch, and sub-audible vibration over visual catalog, mirroring his narrowed guilt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he relinquish control of extinction he engineered—tightens once: from owning the last egg to releasing its molecules into the drought-scape he owns. The tightening is textural, not causal, but the audible echo that now haunts the flats is an undeniable, irreversible price. No antagonist needed; the conflict is between archive and erasure, resolved by the rain that will dissolve both salt and footprints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of preservation: the only way to “save” the bird is to disperse it into the very damaged medium that memorializes its absence. Subtext operates in the unspoken admission that his philanthropy is a penance fund. Final image of rain applauding the salt refuses a moral, offering instead a conceptual repricing—restoration now means haunted dissolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a calibrated middle distance: close enough for glove-leather and heartbeat, distant enough to let the salt mirror speak. Syntax lengthens under reverie, then fractures into particulate clauses during the release, mimicking molecular dispersion. No dialogue needed; the prose’s hush is the bird’s absent song.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful variation; only minor scaffold (“the very man who had caused it”) restates prior clause. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—salt as mirror, drought as silence—teaching the reader early. No mixed metaphors in the closure beat; the rain-applause image is precise and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The extinct-egg-as-resonance-archive is a fresh synthesis of cli-fi and elegy; the drought-magnate who weaponizes water to fund a private avian afterlife feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking—releasing the last specimen into its own absence—pays off thematically and emotionally without gimmickry. Only the “ancient parchment” disguised as satellite photo flirts with cleverness, but it is brief.</comment>
