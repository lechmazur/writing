<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and painter-specific; the arc from despair to remaking is credible. Yet the shift from passive grief to active weaving relies on a single abstract whisper (“by untangling threads”) rather than a dramatized trigger, softening the motivation at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: broken box → descent into library → card sorting → self-portrait reboot. Closure lands with earned stasis: he forgoes the old “perfect faces” and accepts luminous fragmentation; cost is the lifelong ache now repurposed as guide. Orientation clean by 70 words; lens stays accumulative/textural, held to final charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Forgotten library inside lighthouse is more than backdrop—its swaying shelves and salt-sticky wood physically constrain kneeling, sorting, breathing. Lantern beam and dancing shadows are reweighted in the last paragraph: the same light that exposed fracture now “illuminates the path forward,” anchoring the RR. Micro-setting (tarot box, single Fool card) functions as extension of body and choice. 9+ gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can he remake meaning from ruin?”—tightens once: the decision to sort cards rather than flee. Escalation is textural (density of ruined objects mounts) rather than causal; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost visible: he surrenders the illusion of wholeness and embraces permanent ache. Would benefit from one external obstacle to sharpen trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of luminous fracture emerges through recurring cards, light, and salt-stains rather than statement. Final image—brush poised to paint “fragmented yet luminous” selves—offers resonant non-moral answer. Rhetorical questions stay in interior voice; only final “What if the fractures are where the light gets in?” borders on echo but is saved by embodied context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to painter’s perceptual filter: color, texture, stroke metaphors dominate. Rhythm swells and narrows with emotional tide; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“crestfallen,” “luminescent ache”) fits artist’s self-concept; pattern taught early and consistent. Final cadence shifts from long breathless accumulations to short declarative strokes, mirroring renewed agency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Information density high; most sentences dual-task (e.g., “its broken edges sticky with salt and time”). Mixed-metaphor risk in “bones of a forgotten thing” but physical logic holds. Two scaffold spots: “he asked himself” twice in adjacent rhetorical clusters; minor loop. No artifacts in closure beat; read-aloud rhythm varied. One paraphrase loop costs −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Freshness lies in merging tarot, lighthouse library, and portrait artistry into one textured crucible. Fragmented-reality trope is common, but here it is literalized through water-warped cards and painter’s medium. Risky second-person rhetorical questions mostly pay off. Synthesis feels specific to this voice; could not swap elements without breaking pattern.</comment>
