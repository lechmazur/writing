<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya’s “closure-seeker who opens wounds” is dramatized through her surgical erasure of scars and the reversed mission to Samuel; the coffee-ring epiphany gives embodied cost. Yet interiority drifts into psych-label shorthand (“tunnel vision,” “displaced miracle”) and the plant-whisper gift is asserted, not tested under pressure. The final renunciation lands, but the contradiction between healer-as-wound-opener and telepathic listener stays declarative rather than acted-out.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: coffee rings, frozen hourglass, and plant whispers braid into a pattern that reweights the stakes toward reading vs erasing. Closure—Maya’s apology and vow to teach reading scars—carries legible conceptual cost (“some memories deserve to be preserved”). Orientation anchors by word 60; no causal reversals, but the deepening pattern lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Quiet tower at dawn” is sketched with selective sensory cues (frosted glass, meteor hush) that feed the hush-tone. Micro-setting objects—hourglass, coffee stains, potted plants—are handled and return to charge the final image. Spatial clarity holds; no environmental constraint actively shapes the final choice, keeping it under 9-line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—erase vs read scars—is signaled early; pressure tightens when plant telepathy reframes her work as theft of stories. No external antagonist; the escalation is conceptual, landing via Samuel’s restored scars and Maya’s apology. Cost is felt, but the turn is more revelation than irreversible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scar/constellation metaphor and the frozen-hourglass image: memory should be legible, not smoothed. Subtext sits in silence—Samuel’s thumb tracing the faint lines—rather than exposition. Final image of “sand shimmering like tiny scars” reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids tidy closure, though the plant-telepathy conceit flirts with allegorical convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature leans medical (“anesthesia,” “temple scars”) fused with lyric tags (“meteor hush”). Compression is purposeful; no dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-like phrasing) nudges above POV lexicon but stays patterned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythm-varied, image-dense, mostly propulsive; a few stacked metaphors (“concentric coffee rings…map to someone’s pain” followed by “moths to flame”) create transient purple tint. No template cadence or synonym loops; filter verbs minimal. Line-level clarity intact, but figurative layering in peak beats keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of cosmetic-surgery futurism with plant telepathy feels non-obvious; hourglass as frozen-memory emblem repurposes a stale symbol. Scar-as-constellation and coffee-ring cartography supply fresh visual logic. Conceptual risk—miracle displacement—pays off in the closing reframing. Specificity anchors the speculative edge, though core “learn to read scars” arc is familiar.</comment>
