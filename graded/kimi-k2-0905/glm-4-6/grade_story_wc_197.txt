<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya’s vigilante archivist persona is sketched vividly—her tactile key-tracing, puddle-map reading, and ninety-second broadcast gamble all embody “carefully resourceful.” Interiority, however, leans on diagnostic labels (“cognitive erosion,” “Tyranny of Indifference”) rather than embodied contradiction, muting the last-scene cost. No other character applies live pressure, so the single-POV crucible never tightens. The earned stasis lands, but the emotional price feels more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: key → puddle map → booth → Marcus ghost-broadcast → alarms. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no spatial drift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ninety-second hijack seeds doubt with visible civic cost (alarms, manhunt risk). The price is present but compressed into a single clause (“key still warm”), not foregrounded, so it stops short of 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Puddle-reflection cartography and auric lagoon mineral glow are sharply sensory and plot-functional; the environment literally channels her next move. Micro-setting (weathered logo key, dusty booth window) doubles as tool and atmosphere. Spatial choreography holds from ministry steps to shed floorboard. The lagoon’s starlit shimmer charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test, but the broader city remains a generic silhouette, capping uplift.</comment>

<comment>Stakes—“make erased history reappear”—are declared early and tested in the ninety-second intrusion that forecloses Maya’s anonymity. Escalation is linear but effective: Jenna missing → puddle signal → booth boot-up → broadcast → sirens. The tightening is technological, not personal, so the cost feels external; still, the lens holds and the visible price (state hunt) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as mineral deposit—what settles can still reflect. The puddle-map and lagoon imagery braid remembrance and resistance without moralizing. Final image (“memories of how things once were”) reweights the premise via Conceptual Repricing. A slight sermonizing echo (“world drowning in lies”) keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays fixed on Maya; perceptual signature is curator-level attention to obsolete tech and reflected light. Syntax is smooth, but several abstract nouns (“cognitive erosion,” “Tyranny of Indifference”) drift toward editorial rather than character diction. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Filter verbs are minimal; rhythm breathes well under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density, and mostly free of loops; only minor scaffold (“as evening fell… as dusk settled”) repetition. Mixed metaphors avoided; “slow poison of altered records” is vivid and coherent. One simultaneity slip (“watching as the old technology hummed to life” during insertion) is forgivable. No artifact obscures the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The puddle-cipher + obsolete-key insurgency is a fresh synthesis of memory-resistance tropes. Turning a defunct telecom booth into a samizdat transmitter gives concrete specificity; mineral-glow lagoon as dark-net medium feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—tech nostalgia could have read cute—but grounded in tactile detail. Not radically novel, yet the particulars are memorable.</comment>
