<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The immortal’s monomaniacal hunger to “see what happens after goodbye” is the engine of every beat; his dimensional awareness is shown, not told, through the way he reads magnetic lines as exit veins. Interiority stays crystalline and specific—his “dead heart” pulsing in sync with the fragment is a perfect embodied contradiction. The final renunciation—letting go into unmaking—pays off every prior micro-choice; the cost is the erasure of the observer himself, legible in the scar left in space.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the immortal’s disappearance rewrites the rule that an eternal cannot leave; the shimmer-scar is the on-page cost. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each magnetic pulse thickens pattern until the origami collapse. Orientation is taught by prismatic motion cues early; no teleporting props or logic breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is not backdrop but antagonist: its shifting facets force cautious footwork, its hollowed socket is the precise keyhole for the fragment. Light-bending at climax physically manifests the conceptual unmaking. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—magnetic fields felt as “static whisper” against skin—never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each magnetic pulse. The final fold annihilates the only witness, paying the price in erased existence. One meaningful deepening suffices: geometry frays, options narrow to unmake or retreat; he chooses unmaking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that only the eternal can gift himself the finality he craves. The goodbye motif reweights from abstract curiosity to literal self-negation. No moralizing—last image of “nothing, and everything, all at once” is earned by the physics of the fold. Subtext hums in the fragment’s dormancy: curiosity sated means story ends.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains locked to the immortal’s dimensional perception; diction—“beige repetition,” “hushed thunder”—is his exhausted lexicon. Rhythmic control mirrors magnetic rise: longer clauses build, then fragment into single-word beats at collapse. No head-hopping; elision (“he let go”) is purposeful payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each metaphor extends the prism/void motif without mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length to mimic field oscillation. Minor over-modification in “silent, beautiful violence” is the only hairline slip, but it occurs pre-peak and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny against eternity itself is fresh; the amulet as key to self-erasure flips standard escape tropes. Risk—lyric compression, single character—heightens rather than obscures stakes. The shimmer-scar final image feels inevitable yet unexampled elsewhere.</comment>
