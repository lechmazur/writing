<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lyrically charged but leans on atmospheric shorthand (“heart racing with cautious exuberance”) rather than embodied contradiction. The dreamer’s motivation—document before evaporation—remains consistent, yet no micro-choice visibly risks loss or alters tactics; the veil stays cosmetic, never constraining visibility or disclosure. The arc is observation across thresholds rather than a crucible that costs her anything on-page; closure insight is graceful but not earned through a prior fork where she could have failed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library dissolves into internal mist, reweighting the premise that unspoken words live inside her. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (reverse time, propagation delay) is taught early and cadence swells toward the final breath. Causality is internal-associative rather than because/therefore; orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately dream-logic and serve closure’s liminal charge. Cost is felt in the image of her adjusting the veil—an Earned Stasis that accepts perpetual partial concealment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The glowing library is rendered through selective synesthesia—books “breathing,” mist that “rolls inward like tides”—and functions as both macro-setting and micro-object (the watch/skin interface). Spatial choreography is dream-soft but coherent; distances collapse and re-expand rhythmically, mirroring the text’s pulse. Environment constrains movement: she can only step through temporal gaps the watch reveals, so setting directly shapes tactics. Final image of veil-adjustment is charged by the library’s dissolution, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Stake is the preservation of vanishing unspoken words; pressure accumulates via narrowing temporal windows (propagation delays lengthen). No reversal forks the path—escalation is a spiral of deepening pattern rather than a choice that forecloses an option—so cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Agency is observational/documentary; she races the mist but never confronts a live trade-off. Sufficient for lyric accumulative design, yet lacks a visible price that alters later capability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse archive: what humanity never says constitutes its truest library. Subtext resides in the watch’s backward tick—time reversing to expose what was skipped forward. Final image of veil-adjustment offers non-literal answer: she becomes custodian of her own withheld utterances. No late moralizing; insight arises from the dissolution image rather than abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent poetic register; diction stays within dream-logic lexicon. Syntax lengthens and compresses to mimic propagation delays, teaching the pattern by paragraph cadence. Perceptual signature is synesthetic and temporal—echoes arrive late, mist is tidal—without POV leakage. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter verbs, maintaining immersive immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate incantation; repetitions (“documented frantically,” “backward cycle”) serve accumulative pulse rather than accidental template. High metaphor density is justified by dream-mode, yet occasional stacks (“waves breaking on distant shores” inside a mist library) flirt with excess. No paraphrase loops; sentences carry double duty (image + motion). Copy is clean; opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line releases with resonant image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise reverses standard archive—absence as collection—freshly grounded in temporal mechanics. Watch-as-cipher and propagation-delay navigation feel inevitable in hindsight, growing from internal logic rather than gimmick. Risk is high: entire story is metaphoric, yet coherence holds. Specificity of “chairs positioned for conversations that never happened” keeps abstraction tethered to lived detail.</comment>
