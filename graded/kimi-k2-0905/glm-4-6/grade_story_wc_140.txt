<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—his “mosaic of forgotten moments” and the way overheard voices graft onto the poison label—but the ghosted man remains a device more than a contradictory psyche. No micro-choice after the find alters his tactics; he merely pockets the label and resumes walking, so the path from discovery to identity is told, not tested. The ending renunciation (he accepts being stories) is seeded, yet no prior beat risks an alternative, so the cost feels conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard of overheard life layers onto the label, tightening the metaphor of administrative death. Closure is a Charged Poise—he lifts the label to the light and sees the collage of strangers’ faces—an image that reweights identity as communal palimpsest. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 4, satisfying orientation. The single flaw: no visible price for carrying these borrowed stories; the cost is implied, not on-page, holding the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The container labyrinth is tactile—rusted walls as “distorted mirror,” salt-softened paper, crane tremor felt in shins—every sense filtered through the POV’s ghosted attention. The poison label itself becomes micro-setting, its brittleness and faded warning constraining how he can handle, read, and layer it. Tide rhythm is used as emotional metronome, not postcard weather. Only the crane’s physics stays off-page, but this never affects choice, so the cap remains 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reassemble a life from scraps—is clear early. Escalation is accretive: each overheard fragment tightens the label’s metaphorical cargo, deepening rather than reversing. The final image crystallizes stance rather than foreclosing a live option, so the tightening is poetic, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (he is forever composite), but no tangible loss is dramatized, capping entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges silently: bureaucratic erasure vs. oral resurrection. The poison label is transmuted from death-commodity to living archive—an organic re-pricing that avoids thematic statement. Final image lets the reader feel the paradox of owning every story except his own. No late moralizing; resonance is carried by the label’s glint in slanted light, earning its lift toward 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly glued to the ghost’s perceptual filter: “clang of a distant crane was not noise, but the tremor of a story about to be lost.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with tidal sentences, then compresses around the poison find. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within a dockside wanderer’s reach. Voice never hedges or explains; it teaches its pattern by beat 2 and pays off in the mirrored label-glimpse, satisfying 9- gate requirements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory ground, metaphoric lift, and forward motion—“the port was a graveyard of voices, and he was its sole undertaker.” No scaffold; every paragraph shifts knowledge or emotional charge. Figurative surplus is present but patterned (container-“canyons,” “steel monoliths”) and justified by the POV’s mosaic lens. A single mixed vehicle—“corrugated walls” beside “canyons”—keeps the score south of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The erased-by-paper conceit is fresh, but the orphan-rebuilding-self-from-fragments arc is familiar; originality lies in the port’s acoustic archaeology and the poison label as palimpsest. Risk is moderate: accumulative lyric structure taught early and sustained. Specificity of defunct shipping line symbols and salt-curled paper keeps it from sliding into template. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not radically unexpected, parking the score high-7s.</comment>
