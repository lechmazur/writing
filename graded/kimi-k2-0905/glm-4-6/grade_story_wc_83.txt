<comment>Elias’s grief-numbed fix on “harvesting” lost futures is palpably embodied in the thumb-scabbed geode and the console ritual; contradictions between survivor guilt and god-builder ambition stay active throughout. Micro-choice at the descent decision crystallises his hierarchy of values on-page. One hairline slip: the leap from mapping to harvesting potential is asserted rather than shown through a beat that puts him at bodily risk or reveals a visible price paid right now—cost is thematic, not dramatised. Still, interiority is concrete, distinctly voiced, and drives every beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the move from grief-observer to active predator of ‘never-lived’ lives is a decisive reconfiguration that carries undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain (humming failure → time to scan → realisation → descent plan) is uninterrupted, but a micro-gap: how the Mapper’s raw signal translates into physical travel is withheld, leaving a faint logistical ellipsis rather than motive flaw. Orientation is swift; mosaic pattern (sensorium flashes) is taught early and coheres at the final image. Meets the lens (Hybrid—conceptual escalation toward CR) without contradiction; price is felt as Elias embraces predation of the void.</comment>

<comment>Floating thermosphere lab is sketched via lived function—flicker of generators, relay hearts, blue rinse of rebooting light—rather than tourist catalogue. Geode doubles as micro-setting, its hexagonal lattice mirroring console maps to constrain metaphysics; environment literally channels choice. Bodies track cleanly around circular console; no impossible props. Specificity anchors premise and gives tactile launch point for final descent. One notch below elite only because exterior vacuum remains generic backdrop, not yet pressing on physiology or time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to lost possibilities vs surrender to moral abyss—sharpened in one clear intensification when Elias tips from observer to harvester. Agency is continuous: each console click, pocketed geode rub, coordinate entry narrows ethical exit; the Mapper’s signature of the doomed classroom forces final decision. Cost is conceptual, not physical, but made legible in last clause “anticipatory horror and ecstasy.” Meets short-form requirement of single meaningful tightening; no false reversals; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief-stricken commodification of lost futures emerges through repeated geode / Mapper / unused potential triangulation, never authorial lecture. Final image—readying descent to siphon children’s unlived Tuesdays—distills chilling moral inversion without moralising. Subtext ripples in juxtaposition of wedding laughter echoing inside a war-machine-turned-monastery. Ambiguity remains: reader must decide if this is transcendence or damnation. One abstract phrase “theology of the potential realm” flirts with echo-penalty but is brief and earned by concrete build-up.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, latinate, yet stays in damaged-soldier register who has absorbed technical manuals; “humming of the observatory failed” sets syntactic rhythm of stressed noun clauses echoing trauma fragments. Compression and patterned elision (“mathematics and metaphysics merged into something approaching truth”) are taught in first third and paid off in mirrored final cadence. No head-hopping; POV distance stable third-person close. Dialogue absent; no penalty. Under peak stress diction tightens: “He would become a cartographer…”—declaration becomes breathless, fitting exhilaration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-wire: long noun-heap sentences risk density but information multiplies (sensor hum, grief shard, metaphysical premise) without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors appear once (“circuit breakers cooled their relay-sensitive hearts”) yet fit personification pattern and pass. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs drive clauses. One scaffold tic—“the… the…” anaphora near end—creates faint sermon cadence but also mirrors obsessive mindset so allowed. Closure image is crystalline, uncluttered. Proofing clean; no typos or punctuation slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses drone-strike survivor guilt with hard-SF multiverse mining; synthesis feels both un-obvious and inevitable. Geode as simultaneity talisman recasts cheap New-Age trope into physics-of-sorrow device. Risk of over-abstractness is embraced yet controlled by concrete operational beats at the console. No close echoes; concept is singular. Transformation test fails if swapped with generic crystal, proving specificity has fused to emotional arc. Achieves freshness without gimmick, propelled by authentic emotional need.</comment>
