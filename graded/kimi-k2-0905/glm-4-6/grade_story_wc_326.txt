<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s survivor-guilt and Aris’s digitized regret interlock cleanly; his hand trembles on the porcelain while her voice flickers in his ear, both embodied. The micro-choice to tap the shard and disrupt the ink pattern crystallizes their co-dependence. Interiority stays concrete: “porcelain shard gleamed in moonlight” shows, not tells, his fragile hold on life. The closing heartbeat count—“Seventy-two. And infinite for you”—earns a quiet renunciation of solitude; cost is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the spiral galaxy in ink re-weights the accident from tragedy to shared continuum, cost paid in Elias’s spoken “infinite.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—ink patterns, snow silence, heartbeat cadence layer until meaning tilts. Causality holds: shattered watch → static clears → ink galaxy → final cadence. No orientation drift; anchors (“opal observatory, midnight snow”) land by line 4. One shard, one scene, one transitionless arc satisfies scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Opal façade shimmering like “captured dawn” and ink puddling in star-carved grooves are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered. Snow acts as acoustic blanket, forcing inward attention; the observatory dome’s fracture line is felt in the cold draft that ghosts his neck. Porcelain shard functions as micro-setting—handled twice, charges final image. Environment constrains: isolation, silence, and the ink’s refusal to fix a pattern force their joint surrender to ambiguity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Aris be reassembled before Elias’s guilt erodes him—tightens once: static clears → ink trial → galaxy image proves fragmentation is irreversible, narrowing options to acceptance. Escalation is textural: each swirl ups the psychic cost until Elias names the price aloud. No coincidence; pressure is internal and coherent. Felt price is the spoken “infinite,” a lifelong vigilance he embraces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: wisdom lives not in fixing failure but in surviving its reflection. The ink galaxy re-prices the accident from shame to shared cosmos. Subtext operates in silence—Elias never says “forgive me,” yet offers his heartbeat as metric. Final line answers the thematic question—how to live after error—with a quiet, non-moral image: counting infinite beats for a ghost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, compressed, heartbeat-timed; clauses shorten under pressure (“Seventy-two beats per minute”). Perceptual signature is astronomer-poetic: snow is “silent curtains,” ink forms “constellations that should not exist.” No dialogue contamination; Aris’s transmissions are radio-static fragments, distinct from Elias’s tactile diction. Free-indirect tension holds: “Your heartbeat is increasing” feels like internal surge, not external diagnosis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is velvet-dense yet propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are purposeful—“captured dawn in moonlight” twins luminescences to echo digital/organic doubling. Sentence rhythm accelerates with heartbeat spikes, breathes with snowfall pauses. Filter verbs serve voice: “he admitted” embeds monitor habit. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, monosyllabic drop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Digital-ghost astronomer bound to survivor via heartbeat telemetry feels fresh, not trope mash. Risk of sentimentality is averted by refusal to restore Aris; instead they co-author an imperfect cosmos. Specificity—opal observatory, porcelain shard, ink galaxy—grounds the conceit. Final reconfiguration (“infinite for you”) turns tech telemetry into spiritual vow, an inflection unlikely in any other story.</comment>
