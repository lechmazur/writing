<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elian’s curiosity about trees is stated early and re-appears in the final notebook entry, giving the arc a single, legible through-line. Interiority stays concrete—tools clink, hands tremble—avoiding label-speak. Yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the character never hesitates, fears, or risks anything tangible, so the “cost” is purely conceptual. The result is competent but not crucible-level characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard adds a new sextant function or dream fragment until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the trees’ absorption of sorrow reframes Elian’s maintenance duty with quiet cost. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3). The only drag is the mosaic’s fourth shard (morning coda) which slightly dilutes the resonance already achieved on the tower; still, the ending lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail—metal clink, bronze gleam, rain-lash—grounds every new shard without tourist-catalog excess. The sextant itself functions as micro-setting, constraining every action; the stormlit tower supplies the final charged image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across shards. For 9.0 the tower would need to push back physically (wind almost wrenching the sextant, etc.); as is, environment enriches but does not endanger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what do trees witness?”—is signaled in paragraph two and deepened with each dream fragment. Pressure tightens once: storm + moonlight force the moment of revelation. Because the lens is Accumulative, one meaningful intensification suffices, but the absence of any external obstacle or forfeiture keeps the score below 8.0; the cost is conceptual, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: human grief is metabolized into vegetative memory, reframing custodial labor as stewardship of living archives. No character sermonizes; the final notebook entry lets the image speak. The concept invites counter-readings—are trees compassionate or merely indifferent?—supplying lingering ambiguity. A hair’s breadth from 9.0 only because the coda’s “ordinary miracle” line flirts with self-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—selective tool awareness, quiet bodily reactions. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with purposeful repetition (“quantified sorrow”) that accretes meaning. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent. A 9.0 would require one sentence-level surprise or syntactic fracture under storm pressure; the voice is polished but never stretched.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, loop-free until the final clause (“ordinary miracle of this knowledge”) which slightly abstracts the preceding concrete image. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences. Information density is high—each sentence advances tool, dream, or tree data. The near-miss on 8.8 is the single conceptual summary in the last line; trimming it would leave pure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sorrow-sextant grafted onto dendritic memory is a fresh synthesis not seen in submission templates; risk is taken and paid off. Specificity—K-17 corridor, moonlit fracture-healing—prevents abstraction from sliding into gimmick. The concept commits fully without late rule changes. A 9.0 would require one more irreplaceable detail that only this labyrinth could contain.</comment>
