<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Emmie’s steadfastness is repeatedly told (“curiously steadfast”) rather than shown through contradictory impulse; the interiority slips into label-speak (“comforting unease that defined her existence”). The final decision to preserve the truce is declared, not dramatized with visible cost—she simply “retreats with her prize,” giving us no embodied fallout. Motive is clear but flattened by summary; the father’s murder reveal should twist her stance, yet her emotional calculus stays off-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: each failed attempt tightens Silas’s vigilance and narrows Emmie’s options until the recording is obtained. Closure lands as a Decisive Change—she possesses the tape—but the cost is only asserted (“irrefutable evidence”) rather than felt; no consequence on her safety or soul is dramatized. Orientation is solid: who/where/when anchored by line 3. The sunrise deadline provides clear external pressure; the lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>Rotting pier, lantern glint, canvas walls—selective sensory hits create lived-in smuggler warren without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: she slips “behind Silas’s tent,” canvas pressed, retreat route legible. Weather and geography stay consistent; no physics stumbles. The antique fob is the only object that constrains choice (activates recorder), satisfying 9+ gate; environment itself does not tighten tactics, so capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival vs Silas’s betrayal—signaled early; sunrise deadline tightens once, no further escalation. Each false start incrementally raises Silas’s suspicion, narrowing Emmie’s access; the final diversion successfully forces the recording moment. Cost is present but abstract: “the truce of hush would soon shatter” stays declarative; we don’t see her lose an ally or future. Agency is active—she engineers the diversion and the press of the fob.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of loyalty-to-outlaw-family vs justice emerges through action rather than sermon. The decision to save the truce reweights “hush” from cowardice to communal armor, but the insight is delivered in narrator paraphrase. Subtext in gesture is thin—no loaded silence or ironic image beyond the fob’s glint. Resonance is moderate: the moral ambiguity is asserted, not lingeringly felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays close to Emmie with no head-hop; perceptual signature relies on visual glint and tactile clutch of fob, but diction drifts into abstract register (“careful balance,” “conceptual repricing” feel like rubric nods). Rhythm is serviceable, not musical; sentence openings vary adequately. No dialogue to test subtext. Voice competent yet interchangeable—could swap maritime smuggler lexicon without structural change.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm steady; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and safe—“echoed like distant thunder” is shopworn but brief. Information density decent: one sentence often advances plot + atmosphere. Passive voice minimal. Copy clean; no typos. Micro-redundancy: “rotting timbers above” appears twice in 800 words; a small −0.2. Closure beat is clear and unpadded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Pirate-market-under-pier + moonshine filial vengeance is a fresh mash-up, but the beats follow a standard spy-caper template (failed infiltrations → diversion → MacGuffin secured). The “truce of hush” concept is the most original ingredient, yet it operates more as label than lived rule that surprises us. Silas-as-betrayer and fob-recorder are familiar tropes. Specific sensory grime helps, but core plot could swap genres with minor tweaks.</comment>
