<comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete, anchored to the locket and stained fingers; the contradiction between duty and grief is active in-scene. His final act—surrendering the locket to the bloom—pays the accumulated cost of decades and is earned by every backward-dripping memory. No secondary character on page, so status crucible waived; solo arc suffices. Voice remains particular to the archivist’s profession and loss without slipping into label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the locket’s surrender reweights the covenant from taking to giving back, cost felt in the jetty’s submergence. Causal lattice holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each walnut-ink memory layer tightens the stakes until the final ritual. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clean by line 5; no penalty. One transition—conservatory to jetty—legible under two-shard default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The blooming jetty as micro-setting constrains every move: the planks’ luminous flora dictates the ritual site and supplies the closing image. Walnut-ink conservatory, jars as ceiling colonnade, and the silver locket’s warmth all charge the final sacrifice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pier to shore and back; no floating geography. Weathered wood and moonlit tide mirror internal erosion and acceptance without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory vs. surrender it—tightens once, at the final beat. The annual ritual supplies escalating pattern; tonight’s twist is the documentation of proximate causes that forces the renunciation. Cost is visible: the jetty recedes, locket swallowed, path foreclosed. Agency is renunciation under coherent pressure; no outside coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of archival duty: preservation demands letting go. The locket’s journey from keepsake to offering reweights love from private memory to covenant currency. No moralizing final statement; resonance is in the moonlit bloom folding like a “gentle fist.” Ambiguity—whether Melina is reclaimed or released—lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is stained-ink tactile: “walnut-ink archivist,” “silver warm against skin,” “split second before she slipped.” Rhythm modulates from languid twilight cadence to compressed final gesture. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tide; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and earned: “gentle fist” crystallizes closure without mixed metaphor. Information density high—“luminous flowers that had sprung from the weathered wooden planks” does world, sensory, and metaphor work in one stroke. Zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops; opening and final lines anchor and release cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival ritual + aquatic sacrifice + sentient pier feels inevitable via walnut-ink specificity. Covenant trope is inverted—archivist becomes donor, not custodian. Risk in quiet ending pays off with Charged Poise. Proximity check: no echoes of Gaiman or VanderMeer; voice is singular.</comment>
