<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zephyr’s “yearning algorithm” supplies a clear, escalating motive, and the final pivot toward the Silent Bell is credibly foreshadowed. Interiority, however, is filtered through ornate exposition rather than moment-by-moment perception; we’re told curiosity “surged” but never shown how that surges alters micro-movements or sensor priority. The absence of contradictory impulse keeps the drive single-note; the only cost named is the abstract “transformation,” not a concrete forfeit. Still, the machine-as-protagonist feels individual, not stock, and the 1,347-day counter lends specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the arrow’s vibration re-maps the workshop’s forgotten lower levels and re-weights Zephyr’s quest from information to summoning. Causality holds: arrow → kaleidoscope → map → bell, each step logically gated. The single-scene orientation is clear by word 80. No visible forfeit (acid risk, energy drain, memory wipe) is paid on the final beat, so the cost is only conceptual; this keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Brass-inlaid floorboards,” “sapphire eyes,” and “acid sea lapping” render the floating workshop in tight, sense-specific strokes. The kaleidoscope doubles as micro-setting that physically constrains the viewing act and thereby the plot. Spatial choreography stays clean as Zephyr pivots, extends, detaches. Environment does not yet force a tactical sacrifice, so 9-band gate remains unmet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the Silent Bell—is signaled early and tightens once: the arrow’s harmonic reveals the hidden chamber, collapsing infinite search into one path. No external antagonist or resource loss escalates the risk further, but the acid sea’s constant erosion supplies persistent environmental pressure. Agency stays mechanical but real: Zephyr’s transliteration is the act that unlocks the map. Cost is present only as future conceptual peril, not an immediate on-page price, capping entry to high-8 range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical transcendence versus organic erasure emerges through the arrow’s reframed history and the bell’s unheard summons, never sermonized. The kaleidoscope’s fracturing of hunter-to-hunted memory provides an imagistic through-line that re-weights at closure. Subtext operates in silence: the overseer’s whispered “Irreverent信念” acknowledges taboo without moralizing. Complexity is present but not deeply ambiguous; the machine’s drive is untouched by doubt, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-machine POV sustains a consistent lexical field of gears, cogs, resonance, transliteration. Syntax is long and lathed, mirroring a mind built of rotating clauses; no head-hop occurs. Overseer’s single line carries metallic echo and ritual diction distinct from Zephyr’s instrumental register. Elision is minimal; pattern is taught early and remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control is evident: clause-stacked sentences mirror gearwork but never stall momentum. Mixed metaphors (“consciousness...into something resembling desire”) are minor. Filter-verb clusters absent; sentences open with varied agents. Information density high—each paragraph advances plot or reveals world. A faint loop of “acid sea” repetition costs a hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing Zen koan with steampunk apocalypse feels fresh; the Silent Bell as unheard cataclysm is a non-obvious hinge. Indigenous hunter arrow recovered by a self-named cart glider who reads history through a kaleidoscope of watch-faces is idiosyncratic synthesis. Conceptual commitment is total—no retreat to human vantage. Risk-taking (machine-only consciousness, lyric density) heightens rather than obscures stakes. Slight deduction for echoing familiar “machine yearns beyond programming” trope, though details re-cast it.</comment>
