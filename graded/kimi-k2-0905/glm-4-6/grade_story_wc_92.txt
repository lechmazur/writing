<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Elena’s calmly inventive trait is stated repeatedly but only demonstrated once (aligning quill to decode sundial); interiority drifts into summary (“mind raced through possibilities”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final loyalty pivot is declared, not dramatized: we are told she “made her decision” but see no micro-choice that costs her. Bronze heirloom and lineage secrets remain abstract; emotional stakes stay generalized (“protect the fort”) instead of sharpened by personal flaw or visible loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the blackout is revealed as intentional redistribution of light, re-weighting Elena’s mission (Conceptual Reprice). Causal chain holds—sundial angles → cradle access → engineer reveal—though compressed into a single contiguous descent. One transition (courtyard → lower chamber) is legible; orientation anchored by twilight & torch-light within first 120 words. Cost is implied rather than felt: Elena’s loyalty shift is stated, not paid with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Luminous fort, half-painted sundial, and pulsing cradle stones supply tactile specificity; environment directly shapes tactics—angles guide Elena to hidden panel. Light/darkness imagery is woven through action rather than backdrop. Spatial choreography stays coherent across courtyard, wall panel, and circular chamber. Micro-setting rule met: bronze quill + sundial angles together constrain the decisive discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—fort’s power vs. people’s access—signaled early; blackout tightens window for intrusion. One meaningful escalation: Elena decodes sundial, descends, confronts engineers; knowledge shift reframes blackout from threat to revolution. Protagonist agency present but diluted—engineers deliver the final explanation, muting cost. Tightening forecloses her old allegiance, yet price remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of equitable light emerges through action (engineers reclaiming energy) without sermon. Bronze heirloom and coded sundial quietly braid lineage authority vs communal access. Final image reweights “sparks” from elite monopoly to shared resource, achieving resonance without moralizing. Could rise higher if Elena’s personal stake in that shift were dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elena; perceptual signature vivid in metallic chill of quill, torch-smell, pulsing stone. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for twilight, clipped descent into chamber. No dialogue, so voice purity maintained. Occasional elevated phrase (“winking hush”) risks ornament but fits twilight atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and sensory density propel momentum; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language selective—twilight shadows, quill tracing metal—without cluttering beats. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“traced,” “loomed,” “trembled”). No artifacts in closure beat; prose remains transparent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Revolution-via-blackout and sundial-cipher feel fresh within fantasy-fort frame; trope of “sealed power source” is re-angled toward energy equity. Specific detail—half-painted angles, bronze quill lineage—prevents generic swap. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent but not startling. Could push higher if Elena’s inventive trait engineered a unique counter-move rather than receiving engineers’ plan.</comment>
