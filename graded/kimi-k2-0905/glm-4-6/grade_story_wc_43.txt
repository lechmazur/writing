<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elijah’s serene decisiveness is shown through calm micro-choices (gentle hymn, careful placing of shard); the kindness carries visible cost as he absorbs Hale’s grief. Interiority stays concrete—cool guitar wood, tight chest—never drifting into therapist-speak. The final renunciation of a perfect repair in favor of symbolic reunion is earned by the patient accumulation of quiet acts, giving the needed “visible cost” for >8.8 candidacy, though the emotional contradiction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: broken vinyl cue → request → hymn → symbolic repair → stillness charged with gratitude. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Hale’s tear and smile reconfigure the remaining life space without sutured sentimentality. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in Hale’s cracked whisper and Elijah’s packed violin, satisfying the 9+ proof test, yet the tightening beat is a single crest—just shy of exceptional structural daring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hospice hovering “above the clouds” functions as micro-setting whose altitude isolates, making the shard-handling feel sacred; panoramic windows and cotton peaks stay tactile without tourist excess. The vinyl’s grooves, the clean medicinal scent, and morning-pink clouds each filter through Elijah’s musician/perceiver bias, guiding attention toward sound and aroma. Spatial choreography is exact: guitar case against palm, nurse stepping out, Elijah kneeling—no impossible positions. The environment does not merely backdrop but focuses choices, meeting the 9+ gate of constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: craft a “flawless goodbye” that lets Hale finish his unfinished duet. Escalation is one smooth tightening: Hale reveals the shard → Elijah shifts from prepared melodies to raw improvisation → symbolic repair narrows future options to acceptance. Agency stays with Elijah; coincidence is absent. The visible cost is Hale’s tear and Elijah’s realization that some breaks aren’t mended but musically held—satisfying high-band cost legibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mending versus honoring fracture emerges organically through the vinyl ritual; no character sermonizes. Subtext lives in gesture: Hale’s steady grip on the shard signals forgiveness more than any word. The final image—imperfect shard inside sleeve—offers a non-literal answer: completion is fragile containment, not seamless repair. Ambiguity lingers yet feels coherent, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited hugs Elijah’s calm musician ear: “notes hung...as if weaving themselves into fabric.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences breathe during hymning, then shorten at the leave-taking. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual (“skip the usual melodies today”), distinguishing nurse brevity from Hale’s rasp. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sustained; non-standard phrase “hymning the mundane” is taught early and repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly propulsive, but relies on several stock stems (“the weight of the moment,” “pulsing stillness,” “scent of hope”) that blunt specificity. One paraphrase loop: “executing a flawless goodbye” echoed as “execute a flawless goodbye.” Mixed metaphor risk in “clouds blushed with pink” is minor. No closure obscurity; density sufficient; artifact presence keeps this from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar hospice-lit terrain is refreshed by the vinyl shard as sacrament and the therapist who improvises rather than preaches. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation, not structural twist—but specificity of sound (Clair de Lune crackle) and tactile detail feel individual. The broken-record-as-eucharist notion is memorable, preventing full template drift. Could push further into sonic tech lore for sharper freshness.</comment>
