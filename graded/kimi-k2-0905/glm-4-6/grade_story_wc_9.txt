<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s grief is embodied in tactile rituals (hand-print, saucer) and drives every beat; the final renunciation—“learn to breathe again in this atmosphere of memory”—carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but could be sharper under pressure. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the portal closes, leaving her to inhabit “what remains,” a reweighting legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, pattern taught early and held. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Midnight glade, cracked saucer, and onyx-ink patterns constrain her choices and charge the final image; micro-setting qualifies. Sensory selection narrows to taste/texture under duress. Spatial choreography clean; no world-rule breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost time—tightens when she learns it has transformed into “beauty that chokes the living,” a deepening that forecloses retrieval. Pressure accumulates via image density, not causal reversals, consistent with Accumulative lens. Cost legible in the white-glow crack and her forced renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the saucer’s crack and the glade’s suffocating beauty: grief is not solved but inhabited. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo penalties; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains coherent distance; diction (“spilled midnight,” “liquid mercury”) stays within cartomancer’s poetic lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses at portal split, longer cadences in reflection. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is pattern-taught early and paid off in closure image; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“impossible blossoms… choking beauty”) but it tightens rather than drags. Read-aloud rhythm varied; no scaffold artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartomancy, cloudwood cards, and temporal amber feels fresh; grief-as-atmosphere rather than puzzle-to-solve subverts expected “rescue the past” arc. Specific hand-print ritual and dolls’ saucer crack ground abstraction in irreplaceable detail.</comment>
