<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s lineage-linked motive (inherited grain, last-of-its-kind photograph) is specific and stakes his identity; the “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized in his chemical-timing invention. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and exhaustion is shown through bodily micro-choices (“pressed against the lunar surface”). The flaw: no contradictory impulse is staged in scene—risk, fear of failure, or temptation to abandon—so the arc is linear rather than crucible-tested. Still, the renunciation of future access feels earned because radiation closure is already on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat is a therefore-link from arrival → chemical set-up → temperature trigger → last-light capture → off-limits summit. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the photograph exists, the summit will be tourist-locked, Elias carries the grain-cost home—visible forfeiture on the final line. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no penalties. Micro-turn happens at “radiation warnings had come too late,” narrowing options without external rescue. Cost proof: grain returned “against his heart” is the kept wound that literalizes lost era.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lunar vacuum rules are learned through action—dust settlement, camera chemistry calibration, visor-view of colors “that shouldn’t exist”—never dumped. The grain functions as micro-setting that constrains the timing mechanism, qualifying for 9+ gate. Sensory economy favors urgent immediacies: glove dexterity, visor condensation, cold seeping through suit. One minor slip: summit spatial layout is sketched once then assumed, but choreography stays tractable in the single long beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“last lunar morning photograph before orbital shift & commercial lockout”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is steady: delay risk → chemical gamble → radiation closure. The tightening beat is the belated warning that makes retreat impossible; summit access is permanently foreclosed, price paid on-page. Agency is endurance & invention rather than reversal, fitting situational lens; cost is omission (future access) rather than bodily loss, slightly softening intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing scientific romance versus corporate tourism emerges through image chain: lone inspector / tourist platform future / dying spectrum. Subtext in gesture—placing Earth-grain beside camera—argues memory over monetization without sermon. Final image reweights premise: photograph preserved, summit already lost, grain now heavier. Ambiguity is present but not deeply textured; no counter-argument from corporate voice is allowed on-page, limiting complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “helmet adjusted,” “visor review,” chemical嗅觉 as temperature proxy. Diction is controlled, scientific without jargon drift; lunar vacuum metaphors stay physics-true. Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sentences for color bloom, clipped fragments for chemical release. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual idiom and succeeds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, high-density: “lunar dust settled around his boots” does triple duty (setting, tactile, elapsed time). One scaffold loop: “the climb… taken longer than planned” is restated three sentences later; minor. Mixed-metaphor risk at “dawning hush” / “dawnlit melancholy” but cadence justifies lyric repetition. No artifacts in closure beat; final line lands sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusion of lunar mineralogy + Victorian heirloom + photochemistry feels non-obvious and specific; hourglass grain as timing crystal is fresh. Premise reverses typical “first-landing” story into “last-witness” elegy, avoiding trope checklist. Risk is quiet endurance rather than explosive twist, coherent to tone. Could swap grain for another geologic talisman, so irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>
