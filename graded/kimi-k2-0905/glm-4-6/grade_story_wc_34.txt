<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The balladeer’s interiority is poetic but abstract; contradictory impulses (yearning to speak vs. solitude) are announced, not dramatized. Micro-choices—dip brush, align plate—are present yet feel ritual, not risky. No tangible cost is paid; the storm window closes but he simply “smiled,” leaving path foreclosed only atmospherically, not personally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: density of graffiti strokes & storm flashes escalates until final Charged Poise image reweights meaning (“bridge between worlds strengthened”). Orientation anchors arrive by ~70 words; transitions are fluid within single rooftop scene. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration—work is finished, energy spent, mist will hide art—but cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt; hence 0.1 shy of 8.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Misty courtyard above clouds acts as micro-setting: altitude limits retreat, storm light supplies strobe for alignment, wall texture guides graffiti angles. Spatial choreography remains coherent—brush, plate, pouch tracked across lightning beats. Final image of hidden mural relies on place-specific concealment, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes—deliver ghost’s message before thunder—are declared late (~60% mark) and tightened only by time pressure of storm; no trade-off or visible price is dramatized. Escalation is atmospheric (storm intensifies) rather than option-narrowing; balladeer’s tactics unchanged. Agency is present but low-stakes: he works faster, no resource lost, no path foreclosed on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of translation across liminal realms emerges through graffiti glyphs & storm flashes, never sermonized. Subtext resides in silence between lightning-thunder: communication gap as universal ache. Final image of hidden mural offers quiet Conceptual Repricing—art will be seen or not, cost is ephemerality—without moral. Nuance intact, but grandeur slightly undercuts by abstract longing never tested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person floats close to balladeer’s sensorium; diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) is consistent, patterned, and taught early. Rhythm modulates with storm—long sentences swell, fragments spark under lightning. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature sustains. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors stay meteorological, legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence pleasing, but occasional modifier stacks (“white sea of vapor,” “weathered hands,” “timeless moment”) create micro-redundancy. No hard loops; however, “weathered features / weathered hands” within 30 words is near-paraphrase. Punctuation clean, sentences varied; high metaphor density tolerated because pattern is storm-sensory. Closure line earns its brevity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of graffiti cryptography, cloud-top atelier, and algorithmic ghost feels idiosyncratic yet coherent. Not a re-skinned wizard; the occupation of “seldom-heard balladeer” encodes rather than sings, refreshing trope. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure pays off in final image. Specificity of homemade moss-ink & bolt-plate etchings anchors freshness.</comment>
