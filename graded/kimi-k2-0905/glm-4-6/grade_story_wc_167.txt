<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—e.g. “second spine” glasspanes, “overgrown thoughts” gulls—yet the glazier’s only micro-choice is skipping a stone. No contradiction under pressure, no relationship crucible, no visible cost when the sun erases the mist; the “earned stasis” is asserted, not dramatized. Daughter-memory and storm-hunch remain lyrical garnish rather than stakes-forcing forces. Character is vivid, but agency is observational, not consequential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple accretes meaning, cadence tightens toward “before everything shifts” refrain, closure lands in Conceptual Repricing—mundane illuminated, prism dissolved, cost felt as loss of fragile seeing. Orientation anchored by line 3, pattern taught early, transitions NA (single scene). No causal reversals needed under this lens; the final image reweights earlier optics. Meets 9- gate except cost is conceptual, not visibly paid by body/choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Prism atrium in mist” functions as micro-setting: it constrains perception, charges every refraction, and dissolves at closure, leaving the glazier with clearer glass. Sand, boots, wet stone, net-mending hands—tactile, selective, filtered through glazier’s bias for light and fracture. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome. Weather shift (sun burning mist) is timed to action, not backdrop. Meets 9+ micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture fleeting beauty before daylight erases it—signaled early and intensifies via countdown refrain. Pressure is situational: sun is unavoidable antagonist; glazier’s agency is attention, not intervention. No tightening of options, only deepening of pattern; cost is existential (loss of delicate seeing) not tactical. Sufficient escalation for lyric-accumulative design, but lacks visible price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: value hides in transience, visibility is voluntary labor. Subtext carried by image—rings, prism, boots in wet sand—never sermonizing. Final line (“light, in all its complicated, beautiful forms”) is only near-explicit statement, offset by charged image of next pane. Resists moral, invites ongoing looking; ambiguity lingers without confusion. No motif harvested late; all imagery seeded early and reweighted at end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is muscular lyric: “traded glasspanes slung over one shoulder like a second spine,” perceptual signature fused to trade. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for dawn hush, staccato “plink” for stone. No dialogue to test, no head-hop. Diction stays within glazier’s artisanal lexicon; filter verbs rare and purposeful. Experimental compression (“noctilucent reckonings”) taught early and paid off in closure image. Near 9+; minor over-wrought phrase “greedy light devouring” keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High figurative density in every sentence—sometimes three metaphors per line (“prism atrium,” “overgrown thoughts,” “nocturnal-daylight dialogues”). Pattern is consistent and voice-motivated, but peak beats (rings 4-7) risk purple haze that blurs causal clarity. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence, information dense. Mixed metaphors (“spine” + “atrium” + “rainbow droplets”) coexist without outright contradiction. Closure image stays sharp; earlier glitter could be pruned 15% for propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: artisan glazier + dawn optics + skipping-stone divination transforms familiar “stop and notice” prompt into specific, occupational ritual. Prism-atrium coinage feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Conceptual integrity high—no retreat into generic mindfulness. Risky lyric density pays off in final reconfiguration. Could edge 9+ with slightly more visible cost or irreversible consequence.</comment>
