<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s exhausted vigilance is viscerally embodied (“canvas-stained fingers traced…”) and her micro-choice to pocket the brooch primes the later exchange; the stranger’s mirrored fatigue and identical name arrive too late for relationship-as-crucible pressure, but Elara’s insomnia-driven perception stays consistent and idiosyncratic. Interiority avoids label-speak; the final smile is a credible, earned renunciation of sleep as escape. Motive is legible but never crystallizes into a visible high-stakes trade-off, keeping it just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: rain-trail pattern, brooch motif, and layered witnesses accumulate toward the final charged poise. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—Elara’s smile after the vortex—where cost (lifelong insomnia reframed as service) is felt through the reweighted image of “invitation.” One transition (causeway arrival) is legible; no orientation debt; no plot holes. Vortex imagery is slightly convenient but complicates rather than resolves; sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tidal island is sketched through selective sensory cues (brackish edge, opposing currents) that constrain Elara’s movements and literally separate her from the mainland; the brooch functions as micro-setting that warms against her hip and alters her stance. Spatial choreography is clear across the causeway and convergence pool. Weather (patterned rain) is active, not decorative, guiding every step. Final image ties setting to theme: isolation becomes circuit of witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning from sleepless experience—remains coherent; tightening happens when brooch exchange makes insomnia a communal conduit rather than private torment, narrowing future options (she must keep painting). No external antagonist; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; insomnia reframed as duty is felt, but no tangible loss (time, health, relation) is dramatized, capping it just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of witness-through-endurance emerges organically from Elara’s sleepless art and the lineage of amber bearers; no character lectures us on meaning. Final image reweights prior material: insomnia converts from affliction to chosen vigil without moralizing. Subtext of interchangeable identities (“Elara too, or perhaps always had it”) deepens the idea that private suffering is collective memory. Avoids tidy maxim; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lush, lyrical third-person adheres tightly to Elara’s perception (“haggard awe,” “brackish edge”) with rhythmic, painterly diction. No dialogue until the stranger’s four lines, each spare and goal-driven; voice convergence at climax reads intentional. Filter verbs are rare; sensory hierarchy fits an artist’s eye. No head-hopping; stranger’s interior stays opaque. Minor syntactic echo (“wryly earnest” twice) but cadence modulates with fatigue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, image, theme—without scaffolding; openings vary; paragraph cuts are clean. Metaphors mostly coherent (“tides of what came after”) though “universe is but layers of experience compressed” edges toward pseudo-profundity. No loops or paraphrase stacks; high density. One participle opener simultaneity slip (“pressing something cool… fingers traced”) is forgivable at this tempo. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: patterned rain as text, amber brooches as compressed memory archive, insomnia as communal antenna—elements interlock into a singular fable of post-war art. Familiar trope of mystical artifact gains local specificity via painterly insomnia and tidal physics. Risk of doubled name heightens theme without obscuring plot. Transformation test: swap insomnia for generic curse and story collapses. Feels inevitable yet newly observed.</comment>
