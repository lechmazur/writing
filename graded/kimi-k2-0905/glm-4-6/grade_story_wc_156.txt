<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. wonder—stays alive in her finger-stroke hesitations and the nickel’s heat; the final renunciation of the “solid” world is earned through tactile micro-choices. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Still, the nickel’s grin never complicates her flaw; it only confirms her, capping the score short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: shimmer-bloom pattern taught early, density increases until the nickel-cadence reweights the mural. Closure is a Charged Poise: chapel now “hums,” a conceptual repricing that costs her former certainty. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (tool tray, chapel stones) land by word 80. One causal micro-turn—the shimmer’s chord echo—tightens options without breaking lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment-as-constraint: the crystalline petal path literally sounds her next step; she cannot walk silently, so auditory setting shapes pace. Micro-setting extends to the nickel itself, whose warming carves a bodily limit. Final image—chapel ceiling as latent score—reprises the garden’s tonal blooms, charging closure. World rules stay consistent: sound = matter, never violated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to exchange certainty for curiosity”—is signaled in grinning-man’s first line and deepens when she forfeits the nickel’s tether. Escalation is textural: each bloom adds timbre-density until the garden’s crescendo forces her stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual but legible: she renounces the security of pigment-only reality. No secondary reversal needed; one tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated acoustics: restoration as re-sonare (re-sounding). Subtext lives in gesture—thumb on rogue cheek = thumb on fresco ghost—without overt statement. Final non-literal answer: mural becomes “music waiting to be heard,” reweighting prior pigment lore. Minus 0.1 for one near-epiphany phrase “she understood,” quickly balanced by embodied chord.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—restorer who hears color—remains stable; diction (“tide of patience,” “dry plaster ghosts”) is character-specific. Rhythm modulates: long anapestic sentences in chapel, staccato noun-phrases in garden, mirroring sonic shift. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is pure narrative texture. One lyric compression: “the chapel dissolved” is legible under taught shimmer-rule.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear varies cadence; no template stems. Mixed metaphors avoided: “tide” and “ghosts” both belong to restoration lexicon. One scaffold fragment—“the hobo_nickel cool in her hand” (underscore artifact)—is minor, outside closure beat, so −0.2 only. Density high: “grinning rogue seemed to wink” packs object, verb, personification in five words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hobo nickel as portal key to synesthetic garden, linking Depression-era folk-art with quantum acoustics. Transformation test fails if any other token replaced; rogue’s carved grin is irreplaceable trigger. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens wonder without gimmickry. No derivative premise detected; mythic-restoration trope is inverted through sound-garden, not recycled.</comment>
