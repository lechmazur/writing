<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—calloused fingers, the weight of tools, the kettle’s whistle pacing her grief-work—yet the “here and gone” paradox is stated more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene to complicate her steady progress. The carving motion itself is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her anything (shavings “like soft snow”), so the final Earned Stasis feels proportionate but not surprising. Secondary pressure (absent Tomas) is purely atmospheric; no live relationship forces a status shift. Meets the 9+ quick test at 7.9 because the renunciation is credibly rooted in the embodied ritual, yet lacks a second, clashing desire to push it higher.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: rain patterns, wood grain, and kettle steam layer into a cadence shift that reweights grief from raw absence to crafted presence. Closure is a Charged Poise: the finished figure in shifting skylight light reconfigures the stake—love persists as object, not memory—with felt cost (she signs, relinquishing him again). Orientation anchors within 120 words (loft, workbench, kettle, rain). No causal break; accumulation tightens once when the whistle divides carving time from tea time, mirroring life/death partition. Slight softness: the conceptual repricing is delicately implicit; a hair more tactile cost could lift it to 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting: droplet-lens imagery returns at closure to refract the carved Tomas, charging the final poise. Loft’s rust-hued peace is filtered through Elara’s deliberate curation of grief, not décor tourism. Tool ash blank’s pale grain is tactile, smelled, shaved—constraints every cut. Spatial choreography clean: kettle, bench, window form a triangle she orbits once. Weather affects timing (rain slows, kettle cools) but never becomes pathetic fallacy. Meets 9+ gate: the skylight’s shifting light literally charges the final image, constraining how she sees/reads the carving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform grief into artifact before kettle boils—signaled early, tightened when whistle forces her to pause and later to sign. Cost is opportunity/time: each shaving removes wood and finality; signing relinquishes further revision. Agency is iterative attention, not reversal; one meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Escalation is density of sensory echoes (rain, kettle, grain) that make absence louder; no external antagonist needed. Price is legible: the finished figure forecloses additional carving—she cannot remake him again. Sits just below 8.2 gate because cost is more conceptual than viscerally new.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: wood shavings = lion sawdust; taming beasts becomes taming grain; “circus after rain” scent fuses both worlds. No explicit thesis—insight stays in image of skylight refracting carved figure. Subtext: domestication of death through craft, not acceptance speech. Final image answers the thematic question (how to live with absence) by showing love objectified, not explained—avoids moralizing. Complexity intact: artifact both preserves and petrifies; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect texture steeped in Elara’s carpentry lexicon: “grain like life-lines,” “shavings fell like soft snow,” rhythm echoing lathe turns. Perceptual signature filters everything through tactile weight and wood scent; no visual cataloguing of loft furniture unless handled. Compression purposeful: “she would work while it boiled” teaches the kettle-clock pattern early. No dialogue, so voice coherence measured internally—steady, planed sentences mirror planed wood. Under peak pressure (final cuts) diction tightens to single-clause strokes: “She set down her tools.” Meets 9+ quick test: voice remains controlled and distinctive without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long syntactic curls for contemplation, short chips for cuts. Information dense—“ash wood carving blank sat squarely…devoid of the story it would soon contain” does triple duty (object, emotion, foreshadow). Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors consistent (rain=lenses, shavings=snow) and physically coherent. Minor elevated register (“autumnal rust-hued peace”) is earned by reflective mode. No artifacts touch closure beat; final line lands clean. High-band entry but not immaculate—one near-cliché “miniature lens” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lion-taming craft and woodworking feels organic, not gimmick; both disciplines require respect, anticipation, submission to otherness. Perspective—widow as artisan of grief—offers fresh angle on familiar loss story. Specificity: circus-after-rain smell, ash grain as mane, kettle as ringmaster’s whistle. Transformation test: could not swap “potter” or “poet” for carver without breaking metaphor chain. Risk is quiet: no twist, but accumulative pattern justifies itself. Slight deduction for near-echoes of “love transforms but does not end” sentiment seen elsewhere; still, execution is memorable.</comment>
