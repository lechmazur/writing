<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—yearning to write vs. fear of her own gift—are dramatized in embodied, scene-locked beats (trembling fingers, gasping at visions). The micro-choice to tilt the astrolabe again after each meteor steadily raises stakes; the final collapse and quiet hum show credible endurance with cost (exhaustion, stardust coat). No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Earned renunciation lands: she forgoes immediate word-output for the slower "rest" that re-opens possibility, a believable arc for a moonstruck dreamer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure (Resonant Reconfiguration / Charged Poise) is on-page: the astrolabe cools, dawn creeps, Elara stands with steady voice—cost felt in bodily exhaustion and the visible stardust she brushes away. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of meteor-tracing increases density, each flare reweights the stake of blocked creativity until the final quiet hum crystallizes meaning. Orientation clean by 120 words; single-scene default met; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening sufficient; escalation legible under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and brass astrolabe function as micro-setting: their shifting glow and gear-whispers directly constrain when/how Elara can trace stars, charging the final cooling image. Selective sensory hierarchy favors auroral color and metallic chill over broad landscape, keeping economy. Spatial choreography holds—no impossible positions. Weather (aurora, dawn) evolves with beats and affects visibility for star-tracing. Tool (astrolabe) state change—warm while active, cooling at end—mirrors internal shift, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing stifled creativity—signaled first paragraph. Escalation via accumulative pattern: each meteor traced tightens the possibility of release (visible stardust swirl, louder bone-whisper) until the final blaze reveals the “door.” Protagonist agency drives every increment; no external rescue. Cost is legible in bodily collapse and the quiet after-hum that forecloses immediate writing—an earned stasis. One meaningful intensification sufficient for 700-word piece; no reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: creativity as cosmic listening, silence as provisional fertile ground. Subtext in gesture—brushing stardust from cloak—carries more weight than any statement. Final image of cooling instrument and steady whisper reweights earlier fear into quiet possibility without moralizing. No thematic echo of prompt language; ambiguity (will she write tomorrow?) lingers credibly. Resonance built from specific particulars rather than abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate POV stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature distinct—she hears stars as bone-vibrations, notices remembered stardust residue, thinks in sky-calendar metaphors. Syntax lengthens under awe, contracts under exertion (“She laughed… swallowed by the aurora”). No dialogue to judge. Free indirect clean; diction stays within lexicon of dreamer-astronomer. Psychic distance tightens exactly at meteor-flare peaks, then widens for exhaustion—modulation purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and mythic resonance. One paraphrase loop minor: “the stardust remembered, too, swirling…” restates prior image (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; “golden tear” and “frozen dawn” stay coherent. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“flared,” “swallow,” “collapsed”) propel. No scaffold or template cadence detected. Clean copy, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of aurora-archway + star-listening creativity feels fresh; not a trope checklist. Astrolabe as memory-loom rather than mere navigation tool offers new inflection. Specific detail—“constellations no living eye had charted”—grounds originality. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure hum. Still recognizable “artist unblocks” arc, limiting upper band, but cosmic frame and sensory specificity distinguish it from generic templates.</comment>
