<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elijah’s “resiliently positive” trait is declared repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory action; he never doubts, snaps, or calculates cost. Interiority stays generic (“genuine satisfaction”) rather than visceral. The final beat offers Earned Stasis—he accepts permanence—but the choice is cost-free because the text never lets him want anything else. Hourglass glow is external cue, not internal fracture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ferry solidifies, hourglass now bi-directional, timelines unified—cost is the irrevocable loss of multiverse flux. Causal chain is thin—radio “interconnected patterns” hand-waves the merge—but the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; grotto, starlight, and sideways clocks anchor by line 3. One transition (three crossings → secret mission) is legible. Lens holds Accumulative: pattern density peaks at harmonic convergence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Starlit crystalline grotto, brass railings, and prismatic refractions are tactile and filtered through Elijah’s polish-rag attention. The ferry itself becomes micro-setting—its shudder under merger forces Elijah’s final tuning. Hourglass moves from empty to bi-directional sand, charging the closure image. Spatial track stays clean across dematerialization beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—merge timelines—arrives late, disclosed only after three routine crossings; early text presents no risk or opposition. Escalation is a single upward jump: secret radio tuning → merger tremor; no intermediate tightening or tactical loss. Cost is conceptual (loss of infinite possibilities) but not dramatized as felt price—Elijah never regrets the change. Agency is present but frictionless; no live option is foreclosed on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of permanence-through-transience emerges via hourglass inversion and solidified ferry, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext remains thin—no silence, gesture, or ironic gap complicates Elijah’s stance. Final image reweights “permanent transient” from paradox to lived condition, but emotional aftereffect is muted because Elijah’s interior cost is absent. Complexity is conceptual, not character-rooted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elijah’s perceptual filter: starlight patterns noticed because he polishes, radio voices heard as “overlapping yet distinct.” Syntax is steady, service-deck cadence; no poetic inflation. One micro-distance shift—”he could feel timelines knitting”—is earned during merger peak. Dialogue sparse but functional; “All aboard the Midnight Express” carries warm occupational idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained—prismatic starlight, multiversal ocean—never clogs the merger beat. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal accelerator,” “harmonic convergence”) is justified by concept-driven lens. One mixed micro-metaphor: “timelines knitting through the soles of his boots” is vivid enough to pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ferry-as-quantum-catalyst plus sideways clocks plus empty hourglass creates a memorable speculative service-worker tale. Tropes (ghost commuters, starlight cavern) are retooled through Elijah’s janitorial diligence. Risk is moderate—merger sequence could collapse into hand-wave—but text commits fully. Final bi-directional sand image feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
