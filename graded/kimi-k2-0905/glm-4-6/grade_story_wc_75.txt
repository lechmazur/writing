<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her body registers the tremor as a fracture in her own bones—and her micro-choice to bake an “L” for the fresco rather than only for kin shows a values hierarchy under pressure. The contradiction between curatorial duty and communal survival is enacted, not declared. Cost is visible in the ash taste of the bread. Voice convergence with Kaelen is brief and acceptable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the communal ingestion of art-as-kin re-weights the premise—mourning is now a survival tactic. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the bread ritual crystallizes meaning. Causality holds: tremor → pooled water → fresco loss → need to mourn → bread initials. Cost is unmistakable in the wheat-and-ash communion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The grotto’s slick floor and yeast-heavy air constrain movement and breathing; the emerald lens is handled twice, returning as a failed preservative, charging the final turn to edible memory. Sensory detail is selective—rosewater dread, limestone sweat—rather than catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: from overlook to ovens to communal circle. Environment shapes tactics: damp dictates bread as archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—rescue of dying arts—tightens when another fresco border dissolves, forcing the shift from observation to edible elegy. Agency is present: Elara’s decision to communalize the family custom narrows options (no external rescue) and creates visible price—eating the ash of heritage. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only deepening. Cost is tasted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gesture and image: memory must be metabolized to survive. Subtext resides in the loaf initials—tombstones that are consumed, making loss literal nutrition. Final line offers non-literal answer: “they baked their history back into their bones.” No moralizing; resonance is in the mouthfeel of ash.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter; emerald tint, yeast air, and bone-fracture metaphors are character-specific. Syntax breathes with pressure—long clauses when surveying, short pulses at the ovens. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her museum-guide lexicon (“catalogued,” “archives”). Head-hopping absent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from panoramic survey to staccato kneading beats; no template cadence. Sentences perform double duty: “damp, rosewater dread that clung to the limestone walls” embeds smell into setting and mood. Metaphors are coherent—waterfall sigh, bread as tombstone—without mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: museum conservation translated into edible memorial; displacement archived via baking. Risk is high—anthropophagic heritage—yet grounded in sensory credence. Transformation test fails if bread initials swapped out, proving specificity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
