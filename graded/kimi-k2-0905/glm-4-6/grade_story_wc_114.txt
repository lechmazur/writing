<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“auroral sorrow,” “stone in her gut”); the contradictory pull between scientific training and fault-tolerant visions is dramatized in the charcoal micro-choice. The swallowed-truth motivation anchors every beat, and the final naming of her brother’s erasure carries visible cost. Minor slip: the “diagnostic” phrase “fault-tolerant oracle” is used once without immediate embodied translation, but the next sentence corrects into lived sensation, so the slip stays sub-deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the smudged margins reweight the Edelweiss from purity to testament, making the absence’s gravitational pull legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of smudge → absence → brother’s erased warning—and the cadence shift lands with felt cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored within 60 words. Persistent constraint: the sextant and meteorological charts remain as frozen warnings, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mountain station is more than postcard: thin air frays reality, storm glass becomes a liar, and the sextant’s cold brass acts as micro-setting that constrains her final placement of the illustration. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—radio static, fever-fogged glass, charcoal grit under fingernails. Environment mirrors internal void without overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: tool (sextant) and recurring object (illustration) charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming the swallowed truth—threads from first line to last. One meaningful tightening: the second smudge uncovers the brother-shaped absence, foreclosing the option to keep believing the avalanche story. Cost is visible—the Edelweiss is forever marred, and she accepts permanent twilight. Agency is internal yet decisive; no coincidence required. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern break (pristine → smudged) reweights stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of weight = absence; no final-paragraph sermon, only the image of charcoal grounding the Edelweiss. Subtext lives in silence: the radio’s dead air, the sextant’s stillness, the unfilled margin. The auroral sorrow is left ambiguous yet emotionally specific. Resonant reconfiguration invites reflection on which truths society erases for convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: scientific precision (“method occupying margins”) collides with lyric synesthesia (“colors bleeding into corners”). Rhythm modulates from fever-daze long sentences to the staccato of charcoal scraping paper. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly interior. Register remains within a meteorologist-poet’s plausible lexicon; “auroral sorrow” is earned by prior atmospheric imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“the fever hadn’t been an illness but a violent inoculation, a statement she had been forced to embody”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (weight as gravity, absence as void). Rhythm breathes with the fever-break pacing. Minor near-repeat of “weight” thematic word twice in one paragraph, but the second use is reweighted by “gravitational pull,” so only hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—fault-tolerant oracle at a weather station—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. The Edelweiss as emblem of both purity and erased testimony is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The brother’s data-fracture warning re-casts avalanche into social murder without villain monologue. Risky lyric compression paid off: the story trusts the reader to leap from charcoal smudge to cosmic injustice. Transformation test fails if Edelweiss or oracle label swapped—confirmation of originality.</comment>
