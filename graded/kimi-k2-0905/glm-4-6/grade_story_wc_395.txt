<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession is concrete—he chases metadata ghosts and fabricates audits—but interiority occasionally slides into label-speak (“his motivation shifted from professional curiosity to a personal quest”). The final broadcast choice is earned by the breadcrumb trail, yet the turn lacks embodied cost on the page; we are told he “made his choice” rather than feeling the price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: 2319 → patch → Thorne → ghost node → pocket-dimension drop → song-key → broadcast. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the empire’s scarcity model is publicly cracked), but the beat itself is compressed to one line; the cost is announced, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The Archive’s low thrumming and the “echo of forgotten songs” give a tactile acoustic set; the micro-setting inside a defunct music algorithm is a fresh, choice-limiting arena. Spatial clarity wobbles once—“across the echo of forgotten songs” is lyrical but blurs physical locale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the revolutionary energy song—tightens when Elias realizes deletion protects corporate scarcity. One clear tightening: the lie about “deep-space navigation error” collapses once he hears the song’s frequencies. Cost is conceptual rather than personal, acceptable under Hybrid lens.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</answer><comment>Theme—memory as political weapon—emerges from the song’s re-appropriation; no moralizing summary. Subtext in Thorne’s sterile profile vs. his ghost-node IP is effective. Final image reweights 2319 from private clue to public key, a clean Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; perceptual signature leans auditory (“hummed,” “thrumming,” “echo of forgotten songs”). Diction stays within Elias’s tech-lexicon; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for reveal, staccato for audit query—without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances clue or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “his days spent excavating…his nights haunted…” is a template cadence; not in closure. Metaphors are controlled (“ghost in the machine”) and consistent. No loops or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Cold-case + corporate archive + song-as-renewable-energy-key is non-obvious. Pattern of 2319 taught early and paid off in public broadcast. Risk in “pocket dimension inside music algorithm” is bold yet internally coherent. Familiar “erased truth” frame is re-inflected through sonic metaphors.</comment>
