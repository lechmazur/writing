<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Anna’s grief is concrete (unsent letters), but the guardian’s interiority is almost entirely abstract (“stillwater tension,” “silent empathy”) without embodied contradiction. His single micro-choice—tilting the mirror to finalize the shutter pattern—earns the revelation for Anna, yet costs him nothing we can feel. The emotional arc lands for Anna, but the guardian remains a serene mechanism, not a crucified agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: shutter angles and mirrored light build density until the pattern resolves into Anna’s cathartic recognition—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in her tears and lingering silence. Orientation is clear by line 6; no因果 leaps or teleporting props. The only drag is a mild loop: “teach darkness the value of stars” is stated twice with no new inflection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain puddles, and dental mirror form a tight micro-setting whose reflective surfaces are causally necessary for the shutter-code to function. Light on wet wood, mirror flare, and water doubling the sky are selectively filtered through the guardian’s practiced eye, never touristic. Spatial choreography is pristine: mirror angle → shutter slat → Anna’s viewing spot tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Anna’s unread grief—surfaces early; the guardian’s quiet accumulation of shutter angles provides the single tightening that converts private sorrow into legible message. Pressure is textural, not causal, but coherent under the chosen lens. The cost is Anna’s tearful recognition, foreclosing her silence; escalation stops there, satisfying short-form depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—unsaid love can still reach the living—emerges solely through light-pattern and mirrored reflection, never sloganeered. The shutter-code acts as non-verbal subtext, reweighting Anna’s memory of her father’s silences. Final star-reflection on water offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing. One hairline echo of the prompt phrase “teach darkness the value of stars” keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to the guardian’s tactile precision: “angled it to catch the last light,” “brass fittings weathered to the color of lost hopes.” Syntax stays calm and spiraling, mirroring his slowed-time perception. No head-hopping; Anna’s interiority surfaces only through her whispered question and tears, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high but patterned: mirror-glint, water-glint, star-glint form a taught triad that pays off. Occasional elevated diction (“spiralingly calm,” “luminous truth”) nudges toward purple yet remains consistent with the guardian’s meditation-in-motion. No loops, no template cadence; paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “shutter-code as grief-message” conceit is fresh, merging low-tech carpentry with optically precise empathy. Dental-mirror calibration repurposes a mundane tool into a device of quiet revelation. While the silent guardian trope echoes genre archetypes, the specific integration of light-angles and unmailed letters individuates the piece.</comment>
