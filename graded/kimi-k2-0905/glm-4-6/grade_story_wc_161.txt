<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s obsessive need to preserve a lost song through pigeon-flight and dust-mote mapping is vivid, embodied, and internally contradictory; the Mars chip as silent vessel of his sister’s lullaby drives every micro-choice. The final release of the storm-cloud pigeon crystallizes a believable renunciation—he trusts his self-invented method, not people—with cost legible in the attic’s resumed solitude. Interiority rarely lapses into label-speak; instead, decaying paper scent and trembling bone tweezers externalize grief. Flaw: the “re-invented personal history” is asserted rather than dramatized in a single flash, so the past blurs slightly.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the bird’s departure reconfigures Elian’s stance from compulsive control to fragile trust in his own method, with the meteorite-chip cargo making the cost extraterrestrial and irreversible. Causal linkage holds: because he cannot bear the silence after his sister’s death, therefore he maps dust, trains pigeons, and launches the chip—each step narrows options until the loft door opens. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust motes, paper ledgers, and flight patterns layer into a denser pattern that peaks when the bird becomes a “spark of night flying into day.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and sustained.</comment>

<comment>The attic’s breathing decay, pipe-ghost aroma, and grimy skylight are filtered through a courier-trainer’s gaze that notices air currents as flight paths; sensory hierarchy is strict. Spatial choreography is immaculate: mesh door, waxed thread, bone tweezers, and the meteorite chip’s crimson flecks are handled in sequence without floating props. Environment directly constrains the final image—the loft door’s rectangle of light becomes the launch gate—so 9+ gate is met. One minor overripe phrase: “wildfire flowers” momentarily prettifies decay, but it is isolated.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserving the echo of the lost lullaby—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the chip is lashed to the pigeon: failure means eternal silence. Escalation is accretive: each flight log, dust pattern, and frantic wing-beat thickens the risk until the bird’s hesitation becomes the final pressure test. Cost is visible—once the chip leaves his hand, the meteorite and melody are literally out of reach—yet the tightening is single-arc rather than a second reversal, so ceiling is mid-8. No coincidence resolves; the launch is wholly agent-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of turning grief into a private cosmology: silence can be curated but never reclaimed. Subtext is carried in objects—dust motes as dying notes, meteorite as fossil sound—never preached. The final image of the attic quieting while an echo “learns to fly” offers a non-literal answer: preservation is betrayal of presence. Avoids thematic echo; no character utters a thesis line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s courier-gaze: skylight as sextant, dust as notation, pigeon wings as metronome. Perceptual signature is distinct—he “reads” air like sheet music—and diction never exceeds his self-taught attic lexicon. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Compression (“a dark question mark against the light”) is taught early and recurs, paid off in the bird’s launch silhouette.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “the ghost of pipe tobacco” (smell), “grain of rice” (size), “spark of night flying into day” (sight) triangulate in one sentence. No loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphor obeys physics—dust motes “wither” exactly as stars do. One register drift: “infinitesimal” feels academic for the POV, but it appears in low-pressure exposition, not the climax. Final line cadence slows to match attic hush, recharging prior motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of homing-pigeon logistics, meteorite shard, and dust-mote astronomy creates a fresh grief-ritual unavailable in stock plots. Risk—sending a Martian relic via bird to ancient astronomers—could tilt whimsical, but grounded specificity (bone tweezers, waxed thread) keeps it earnest. The “paper trail” concept is literalized as continental flight path, not meta-commentary. Transformation test fails if names change: the courier-pigeon trainer’s vocational lens is irreplaceable.</comment>
