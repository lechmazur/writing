<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Arthur’s interiority is evocative—his synesthetic sensitivity to “unspoken words” is embodied in every beat—but the promised internal contradiction (gift as burden vs. fuel) is asserted more than dramatized; no moment forces him to choose between isolating self-protection and revolutionary exposure. The micro-choice to smile at the baker’s unspoken worry is the single visible fork, and its cost is only implied. Earned stasis is credible, yet the absence of a tested limit keeps this short of 8-band intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the synchronized displays crystallize “wondering” as the new social currency, reweighting the town’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images rather than causal dominoes—and the pattern is taught early through the grotto’s echoing starlight. Orientation is secure within 120 words. A –0.3 for mild telegraphing of the midnight activation keeps it just outside 8.3.</comment>

<comment>The cobalt library columns, mist-fingers, and silver-coin starlight are not picturesque flourishes—they double as Arthur’s instruments, guiding his precise placement of mirrors and clocks. Spatial choreography is flawless across the commercial circuit; every prop state is tracked. The magnetic grotto’s “ tuning-fork truth” constrains Arthur’s tactical timing, directly charging the final image of windows flickering on “down to the second.” Meets 9-band gate but for one stock phrase (“like scattered silver coins”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can quiet wonder subvert compliant silence?—is voiced early and tightened by each mis-en-place beat; the escalation is density-driven, not causal, matching the Accumulative lens. The only felt price is Arthur’s sleepless circuit, a visible stamina tax that alters his final soft smile. A sharper micro-loss—e.g., a cracked lens or overheard cop—could have pushed cost legibility into 8.8 territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without dictation: “forests of second thoughts” grow from concrete seed-objects—chessboards with no win, clocks without numbers. The final image reprises the grotto’s star-coins now reframed as civic constellations, reweighting the premise that revolutions must be loud. Complexity is honored—no guarantee the town will keep wondering—yielding earned ambiguity rather than false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharp—Arthur “hears” metal and glass vibrate, sees “hesitant” mist fingers. Syntax flexes from long breathless rounds during stake-setting to clipped noun-phrases (“Understanding isn’t the goal. The goal is the wondering.”) that mimic clock ticks. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is n/a; single POV keeps interior texture coherent. Hairline slip: one “like water through fingers” cliché prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate: paragraph lengths stair-step to the midnight switch, sentence pulses accelerate with motion-sensor lights. Information density is high—each sentence handles atmosphere, motive, and tactic (“He could hear unspoken words rippling…confusion giving way to curiosity”). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. A single mixed image—“starlight filtered…like scattered silver coins”—is the only figurative muddle, and it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic rebel-coach who weaponizes chess puzzles and shop-window dioramas is a fresh synthesis; the premise could not transplant to another occupation without collapse. Risk is taken with the quietest possible revolution—no slogans, only mirrors—and the concept commits fully. The “tuning-fork truth” mechanic is particular to this magnetic grotto, forestalling swappability. –0.2 because the five recruits are named roles rather than lived individuals, slightly templating the ensemble.</comment>
