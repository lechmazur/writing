<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is rich—translator’s badge, coral graft, hand wound all braid his guilt and vocation—but the child’s motives stay opaque; her “shrewdly innocent” label never actively complicates his decryption. The micro-choice to point at the spiral is believable, yet her reciprocal knowledge (“same ocean”) feels bestowed rather than earned. Still, his final smile manifests credible renunciation with cost. Meets 9+ quick test for earned stance.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral’s hum + fountain image re-weights earlier trauma without tidy cure. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each metaphoric layer (mist, coral, cast map) tightens until the final smile crystallizes direction toward peace. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are all given in first 80 words. One micro-turn suffices for this length; no plot amnesia or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The misted atrium/fountain is not backdrop; it dictates slowed perception, allows the quiet decoding scene, and reappears in the charged final image. Coral fragment functions as micro-setting constraining touch and meaning-making. Sensory triage (muted pain, underwater echo) mirrors emotional anesthesia. All details return in the closing beat, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“how to read one’s own damage”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via tactile decryption of the cast map, each solved loop tightening Elias’s sense of shared vulnerability. Cost is emotional, not external: reopened “shrapnel” ache felt as map. No false antagonist or coincidence; agency is attention/interpretation under anesthetic haze—sufficient for lyric-accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of mutual translation of wounds emerges through concrete action, never sermon. Coral, fountain, and smudged ink form a quiet triad of mutable text/body. Final “direction toward the hole” offers conceptual repricing of emptiness as path, not void. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays consistently anchored to Elias’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Lyric diction (“twilight’s tears”, “lotus-hearted ache”) is motivated by his translator’s reflex for metaphor; rhythm swells then thins with anesthetic fade. Child’s dialogue sparse, idiomatically child-like (“It’s a code”). Filter-verb count low; fragments serve fleeting cognition. Pattern taught early and paid off at fountain image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Varied cadence, no template runs; sentences breathe during anesthetic lull then tighten at decryption. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, not purple—vehicles stay coherent (mist ≠ shroud later). Information multiplexing: coral = talisman, graft, pulse-tracker. Minor micro-movement (“shifted, her cast brushing…”) is purposeful tactile cue, not clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-war healing encounter refreshed by coral-graft body-mod premise and kid-code on plaster. Risk lies in lyric density; payoff justifies it. Specificity of translator-badge, reef-battlefield, and fountain-in-atrium keeps it from generic “soldier meets child” template. Not radically novel, yet synthesis feels organic.</comment>
