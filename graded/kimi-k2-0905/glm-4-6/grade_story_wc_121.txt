<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s obsessive looping is viscerally embodied—boots “barely touching,” tablet burning his palm—so we feel the cost of eternal iteration. Yet the interior contradiction (conquer vs. prisoner) is told in abstract bursts rather than dramatized micro-choices; the final “I have lost myself” lands as summary, not earned reversal. The beat where he ignores the dissolving double is a sharp glimpse of self-erasure under pressure, but it stands alone; more such concrete fractures would tighten the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the shattered tablet and ordinary street reweight the premise—victory equals mortality. Causal chain holds: each retracing tightens the labyrinth’s grip until the sacrifice of eternity is inevitable. Orientation is taught by the second sentence (viaduct, post-rain, neon reflection) and the experimental loop pattern is signaled early; the final image pays off the disorientation. Cost is visible in the extinguished glow and the plain rain, but the beat is slightly under-written; a sensory shard of what eternity felt like now gone would push it to 9-territory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The viaduct’s humming light and mirrored water function as both arena and clock; their shifting glow directly constrains when Kael can leap. Micro-setting—the tablet’s warmth against his palm—grounds every beat. Selective sensory economy (no tourist catalog of the city) keeps attention on reflective surfaces that literalize fractured selves. The final plain street, stripped of neon, is a reconfigured environment that charges the loss of transcendence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the self-replicating labyrinth—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each retracing until the only exit is mortality. Escalation is accumulative: each loop darkens the viaduct and multiplies ghost-Kaels, raising the cost of continued eternity. The decisive narrowing occurs when he “retraced his steps again, this time with purpose,” trading immortality for a single uncertain step. The price (glow gone, tablet shattered) is legible, but the beat could sharpen the bodily shock of becoming merely human.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: immortality is endless self-consumption, and freedom is the acceptance of ordinary finitude. The shifting glow/darkness motif reweights from wonder to menace to absence, charging the final rain-slick street with quiet loss. No moral is declared; the emotional after-effect is the hollow sound of rain on asphalt where infinity used to hum. Ambiguity lingers—was the labyrinth external or psyche?—but the cost makes the question resonant rather than vague.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual filter: “the darkness was brighter” reads as his paradox, not authorial flourish. Rhythm accelerates with clause fragments under peak pressure—“He jumped, gravity bending…”—then flattens into the plain final sentence, mirroring mortal aftermath. No head-hopping; even the dissolving double is external observation only. Lexicon stays within his experiential range (runes, glow, ripple) without register drift.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; most sentences advance image or pressure. Occasional micro-loop: “the darkness brightened again” appears twice with only slight rephrasing, dulling the second impact. Metaphors stay coherent—neon “veins,” viaduct “humming”—and never stack into purple. Strong paragraph cut-test: removing any middle paragraph would erase a causal loop or sensory anchor, so none feel scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The “procedural-generation curse” twist on immortality feels fresh: eternity as endless rogue-like respawn where the map is the self. The glowing viaduct and clay tablet are specific objects that could not be swapped without breaking the loop logic. Risk is taken with recursive structure, but pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Slight proximity to mythic “tablet of destiny” tropes is transformed through tech-noir setting and the final shattering that demotes god to pedestrian.</comment>
