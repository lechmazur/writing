<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s interior contradiction—empathy as math vs. the halo’s dissolve into feeling—drives the arc, but the borrowed-personality trait is asserted more than dramatized; only at the end do we feel cost when the borrowed skins melt. The micro-choice to press the fragment into his chest crystallizes values, yet earlier “transposed empathy” beats are summary, not embodied under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the printed line “cease calculating” reweights every prior equation, and the cost is the literal vanishing of self-contained stars. Causal chain holds: fragment arrival → workshop printing → collective dissolution; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The topaz workshop, letterpress chase, and crystalline fragment function as micro-setting: the fragment’s geometry fractures lamplight and later dissolves into Silas’s skin, directly enabling the final reconfiguration. Star-field ceiling supplies live clock and stakes scale. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the “return address shifted” line feels disembodied, not actionable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can empathy be solved like math?—tightens when the fragment overwrites his borrowed masks; the printed equation page is the visible price. Escalation is accumulative: each vanished star raises cosmic stakes while the press keeps clapping out emotional calculus; final collective reveal is a deepening, not a new reversal, but cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: empathy as non-computable is shown when equations spill from a press that once set disorientation type. The final printed line re-prices the premise; no character articulates the thesis. “Mathematics of emotion” recurs but is interrogated, not affirmed, keeping complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a perceptual signature—typographer’s diction of glyphs, chase, impression—while syntax elongates/fragments under halo contact. No head-hopping; POV distance stays shallow-third. Register slips once (“conceptual repricing” moment) into academic diction, but cadence modulates with emotional intensity and the pattern is legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; figurative layer is dense yet patterned—fractured light, constellations of type—without obscuring causality. A few scaffold phrases (“between vanishing stars” repeated) and one mixed metaphor (“sugar in water” for crystal dissolution) dull precision, but artifacts do not touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial shattering itself to feel via scattered fragments reframes both empathy trope and star-apocalypse. Letterpress as emotional particle accelerator is specific; workshop dissolving into “consciousness itself” risks abstraction but lands because prior type/page motifs earn the conceptual leap. Risk raises stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
