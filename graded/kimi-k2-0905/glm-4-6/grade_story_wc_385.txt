<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s “richly perceptive” curse is dramatized through embodied sensory overload—wind groans, starlight, canyon echoes—rather than told. His single micro-choice (lifting the shell, singing) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: truth over self-preservation. The earned cost is the city’s first tremor, a direct consequence of his decision that forecloses anonymity. Interiority stays canyon-specific; no diagnostic label-speak mars the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Spire’s lights flicker, its silhouette cracked, the universe’s hum now a chorus—undeniable conceptual cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of canyon-echo amplification tightens stakes until the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where) is secured by line 3; no penalty applies. No causality break; engineers’ silencing is revealed via echoed song, not expository dump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus is not postcard scenery; its stone throat literally catches starlight and conducts dissent, constraining Kaelen’s tactic—he must sing here or nowhere. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel-edge-sing-stand-turn, each move tracked against canyon wind channels. The shell’s cool spiral and the Spire’s flicker serve as micro-settings that charge the final image. Weather (wind) affects action continuously, never static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. civic collapse—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful deepening: the engineers’ phantom voices woven into song tighten the cost from abstract warning to visceral tremor. Protagonist agency drives every beat; coincidence is absent. The price—city panic, Spire fracture—is legible on the page and alters later options irreversibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: echo as refusal to be silenced, shell as conduit of buried memory. No final-paragraph moralizing; the cracked Spire silhouette is the non-literal answer. Subtext operates in canyon groans and starlight, never stated. The reweighting of “echo” from nuisance to insurgent resonance feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lush yet controlled lyricism—“reed-blown melancholy,” “stone throats catching starlight”—remains within Kaelen’s perceptual lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences for canyon sighs, clipped fragments for tremor. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction avoids pseudo-poetic filler; every image either constrains choice or charges closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or shell mythos. Zero paraphrase loops; no “the canyon was old and ancient” churn. Metaphors stay coherent—nexus as conduit, web as strata—without mixed vehicles. Opening and final lines are image-anchors, not scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: echolocation politics + geological whistle-blower + seashell as data-drive. The notion that a city’s foundation audit can be sung through stone fissures feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—lyric overload—paid off via disciplined sensory economy. No stock dystopic tropes; canyon and shell are irreplicable.</comment>
