<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The seeker’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection while embracing lethal solitude—are etched in embodied micro-moments (buckle-click, bark-braille). The final leap is earned: muscle-memory ritual + inherited talisman + silence-weight telescope into a visible forfeit of safe return. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak. Cost is felt: the arbor’s whisper recedes as the voice on the radio returns—trust reclaimed at the price of perpetual falling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence, pattern of buckle/bark spirals, and cadence of falling imagery tighten until the snap of canopy re-opens sound. Closure is a Charged Poise: the seeker drifts mid-air, options re-crystallized—return to arbor exile or follow the disembodied voice—cost legible in the vacancy below. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. One causal micro-turn: static clears → voice emerges → leap recalibrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The arbor-as-micro-setting constrains every choice: branch width dictates stance, bark spiral governs hand-route, altitude imposes hypoxic cognition. Parachute buckle functions as portable setting fragment, its chill and heft resetting attention whenever panic looms. Final image charges the buckle once more, penduluming against open sky—environmental cost made visible. Cloud-sea and insect-wing applause are filtered through altitude-addled perception, never tourist postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—tightens when radio silence flips to a lone voice calling the seeker’s name. Escalation is textural: each spiral traced in bark adds weight to the wager that someone still answers. The leap is agency; fortune does not resolve, it reframes. Cost is the unrecoverable altitude of exile—once descended, the arbor cannot be re-climbed tonight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of witnessing: only by stepping into un-sound can the seeker earn the right to hear his name. Subtext resides in touch—bark, metal, wind—rather than declaration; silence as positive presence. Final re-pricing: trust is not preserved by clinging to branch but by abandoning it. Avoids sermon; resonance lingers in pendulum swing of the buckle, re-weighted from relic to promise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice owns its pattern early (“the silence so profound it felt like its own heartbeat”) and sustains rhythmic control through free-fall compression. Diction stays within seeker’s perceptual lexicon—no academic register drift. Filter verbs serve altitude dizziness rather than detachment. Final clause “tonight, one was theirs to keep” modulates cadence to crystallize Charged Poise without head-hopping or register break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High-density lines routinely double duty: “The parachute buckle had once belonged to someone else—someone who’d jumped and never return” seeds backstory, object history, and stakes in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each spiral reference adds new sensory angle (braille, chill, pendulum). Figurative layering is patterned, not piled—mixed metaphors avoided. One clause of slight overstuff: “archipelago in a sea of fog” survives because it is the only visual panorama before immediate bodily action re-anchors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—lonely sentinel in sky-tree—reinvented through haptic pattern-reading and reversed sound ecology (silence as heartbeat). Buckle inheritance and braille-bark are specific fresh inflections; generic daredevil becomes ontological archivist. Risk of lyric stasis accepted and paid off with airborne reconfiguration. Could not swap arbor for any treetop; spiral motif and altitude physiology are integral.</comment>
