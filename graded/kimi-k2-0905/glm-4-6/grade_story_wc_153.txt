<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The medium’s interiority is concrete—she crouches, trembles, steadies herself through tactile cues—yet her contradictory fear/resolve never crystallizes into a visible wrong-choice moment; the apology she channels is not her own, so the cost is displaced rather than personally paid, keeping the arc one beat short of full earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard cools, words dissolve, labyrinth hums new harmony—an unmistakable after-state with felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural design holds because each condensed droplet layers the same stake until the moonlit crescendo reweights it; no causal contradiction, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mangrove roots, brackish water, salt-air, and fragmented moonlight are filtered through the medium’s biased attention; the gargoyle shard’s temperature shifts constrain her pacing and the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Finding the moment before deciding” is signaled early and tightens when each droplet narrows possibility to a single unsent line; the protagonist’s agency is attention/ritual endurance rather than decision, but the cost—physical chill, emotional tremor, final exhaustion—is visible and alters her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as inherited violence, apology as living ecology; the refrain of condensation on leaves lets the motif evolve without overt statement; the final dissolving letters reprice the premise—words are not missing but metabolized into air, a resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to sensorium, diction stays inside the medium’s mystic lexicon (“brackish,” “waxy,” “stone terror”), rhythm swells/softens with spirit song; no head-hop, no filter-verb stacks, clean elision of transit lines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied, sentences perform double duty (e.g., “The shard began to pulse faintly, its stony exterior warming…”), no scaffold or synonym loops; one mixed metaphor—“skeletal fingers” beside “windowpane”—is minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar trope set—medium, spirits, redemption relic—gains freshness through mangrove-as-liminal-archive and meteoric condensation as epistolary tissue; the risk of ambient lyric is underwritten by tight因果 stakes; synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicked.</comment>
