<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elaran’s “defiant artist” core is vividly dramatized through the sketch-journal and the escalating poetry raids; contradictory impulses (curiosity vs communal loyalty) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final decision to fracture the truth into bearable verses is prepared by every earlier poetic refracting, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—heartbeat as metronome, verses as lock-picks—without diagnostic self-talk. Only the elders remain off-page, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are absent; the single-POV crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each poetic session layers density until the spire’s seal fatigues. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 25. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the settlement’s “forged hush” is broken by the swirl of refracted truths, cost felt in the crumbling spire and Elaran’s steeling himself for confrontation. No causality break; every refracting beat tightens the stakes under the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, bone towers, and pale spire are re-used as instruments: towers act as sound-conductors that Elaran exploits, the spire’s changing appearance signals seal decay. Sensory hierarchy obeys artist-focus—visual line, echo cadence—never tourist checklist. Micro-setting (the journal page smudged with charcoal) constrains the final act of verse-scattering. The canyon’s acoustic rule-set stays consistent; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep vs unleash the contained truth. Escalation is the graduated poetic refracting that fatigues the spire; each session is a visible tightening visible in the sketches. Final cost: the spire cracks, Elaran forfeits innocence and communal silence. Agency remains his throughout—no coincidence, only cumulative resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refractive method itself: forgiveness is not erasure but digestion of partial truths. Subtext sits in the canyon’s Echoes that “hold what voices lost”—landscape as memory archive. No moral spoken; final image of verses drifting toward different ears enacts the theme without assertion. Complexity retained: the community may still choose denial, but the hush is already broken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elaran’s perceptual filter—sketch-line as sight-rhythm, echo-delay as aural texture. Patterned diction (“refract,” “spectrum,” “echo-canyon”) is taught early and paid off in the final vortex of sound. No head-hopping; distance tightens under candlelight, loosens atop the tower. Register remains artist-colloquial, never academic intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Varied sentence cadence mirrors echo-surges; no template churn. Metaphors stay physical and tested—spire as “containment device,” not abstract symbol. Minor scaffold: “each day as the ritual approached” repeats thrice but serves accumulative drumbeat. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Freshest inflection: poetry as lock-pick on a metaphysical seal. Bone-tower acoustics and truth-fracturing synthesize artist myth with geologic horror. Risk—quiet renunciation instead of spectacle—pays off in charged poise. Could swap names but not the fracturing method; concept is inseparable from execution.</comment>
