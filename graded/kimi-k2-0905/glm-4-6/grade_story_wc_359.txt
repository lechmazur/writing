<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bell ringer’s interiority is lyrically embodied—colors burst as tastes, sounds bloom as hues—so the synesthetic lens feels lived, not labeled. Yet the motivation to “certify wonder as essential” remains an abstract thesis, never sharpened into a concrete personal stake; we see no private cost or flaw that would make renunciation painful. Consequently the final Earned Stasis—walking away cloaked in cavern-song—lands as beautiful image rather than charged choice. Inner contradiction appears only in fleeting “repose vs. urgency,” not in a visible dilemma that forces a forked path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: cadence builds through sensory density until the aurora/cavern duet reweights silence into living harmony. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—wonder reframed from question to lived answer—paid for by the bell ringer’s relinquishment of the amber sheet and exit into dawn; the cost is the solitude of custodianship. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3, well under the 120-word window. No meaningful ellipsis or causal turn, yet pattern holds because pressure is textural, not consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice cavern, body, aurora, and amber sheet function as one composite instrument; their refractive interplay literally shapes the harmonic method that unfetters wonder, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp—apex fissures, crystalline vaults, floor-lit honey-glow—tracking bell ringer’s stance and sheet angle. Weather (auroral bleed) is causal conduit, not backdrop. Selective detail favors optic/aural synesthesia, but the narrow palette is purposeful, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transmute sculpted hush into living song—signaled early and intensified by auroral color-feed. One meaningful escalation: amber sheet flares until “difficult to look at,” forcing the bell ringer to release the song into the walls—this visible cost (abandonment of control) tightens the beat. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than opposition; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens. The final harmonic stills the cavern, but no option is foreclosed for the protagonist beyond leaving, so cost reads luminous rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder is not luxury but marrow, proven by the cavern’s audible blooming. No abstract sermon—meaning arises from the synesthetic alchemy of color and sound. Final image (ghost-song in dawn-lit silence) offers Conceptual Repricing: the world outside will never know, yet wonder is renewed—social cost of anonymity felt on page. Ambiguity is purposeful; no tidy moral, only lived answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient hovers at synesthetic shoulder, distance stable. Perceptual signature saturates every clause—ice “high, pure note,” aurora “cyanide-blue taste”—so voice is inseparable from POV. Rhythmic control escalates from hush-fragments to soaring cadence at unfettering, mirroring musical arc. No dialogue, hence no convergence risk; internal lyricism avoids monotony by varying sentence length and metaphoric voltage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: clauses swell and ebb like the piece they describe. Occasional stacked metaphors in peak beat (“kaleidoscope of sound and light”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and pays off at closure, so −0.3 only. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle or causal nudge. Tense stable, pronouns clean, no simultaneity errors; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of synesthetic perception with choral geology feels fresh, not borrowed. Premise commits fully: wonder is tuned, not debated. Risk-taking—lyric escalation instead of plot reversal—heightens coherence. Final “ghost of a song” recharges every prior hue and hush; inevitability is earned in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes; archetype (mystic bell ringer) is re-anchored in sensory neuroscience rather than mystic cliché.</comment>
