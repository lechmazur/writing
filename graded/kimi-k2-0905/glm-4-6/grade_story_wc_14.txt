<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s solitude-borne obsession is rendered with tactile, profession-specific rituals—charting a lamp’s hum, burnishing gold leaf—so his motives feel lived-in. The contradictory impulse (preserve ghosts yet invent new ones) stays active in each micro-choice, and the final beat of quiet satisfaction earns its poise because we have watched the precise labor that underwrites it. No secondary character appears, so status dynamics are N/A; head-count cap is irrelevant. The only bar to 8+ is that the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the last image of twelve glowing cards crystallizes both triumph and lifelong servitude to a vanished world. The causal chain (hum → data → gold → texture) is taught early and holds without gaps; the Orientation Test is passed by line 5. Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural—density of dawn sessions tightens meaning until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the phrase “the town’s silence had not claimed everything,” which reframes his labor as defiance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the fluorescent lamp’s corner, the chilled glass workshop, and the miniature bonsai canopy are returned to in tactile motion (brushing dew, charting vibrations) so environment directly shapes technique. Selective sensory hierarchy—pine dew, lamp hum, gold gleam—mirrors internal vigilance without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible object jumps. Just shy of 9 because the town itself stays off-stage silhouette rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve erased time textures—signals in paragraph two and tightens once: today’s “particularly resonant hum” promises a best-yet harvest, narrowing options to succeed or lose the moment. The escalation is density-driven rather than antagonistic, fitting Accumulative lens; cost is felt in spent dawn breath and the lifetime sentence of guarding silence. No reversal occurs, but single meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: archival grief can be transmuted into sensuous artefacts, but the archivist becomes artifact himself. Subtext lives in gestures—gold strips applied “with incandescent restraint” encode both reverence and captivity. Final image reframes prior material so theme answers its own question: if people vanish, their textures can still be touched, at the price of the toucher’s life being frozen in that act. No moral is declared; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited floats close enough for bone-vibration perception yet retains lapidary distance—“incandescent restraint” becomes both tone and perceptual signature. Syntax is rhythmically controlled: long breathy clauses mirror dawn inhalations, then tighten to clipped verb clusters during gold application. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The slight elevation of diction (“refract time into tangible components”) is justified by Silas’s precision vocation and never breaks lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical without drumbeat: sentence lengths wax and wane like the lamp’s warming cycle. Information density excels—one sentence often embeds tool, sensorium, and emotional calculus (“metallic surface, activating the history he had cultivated”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines act as harmonic brackets, returning to dawn light and gold glow to propel rather than decorate.</comment>

<comment>The concept of extracting temporal ambience from an electric hum and pressing it into gold leaf is not derivative; it fuses science-fair precision with alchemical wonder. Risk is taken and paid off: a quiet, static scene becomes high-stakes because the invented historiography feels mechanically possible. Specificity of method (frequency charts against atmospheric pressure) prevents swap-out with generic magic. Transformation test fails if Silas becomes “any artisan,” proving the premise is inseparable from this voice and place.</comment>
