<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s “persistent curiosity” is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized as a contradictory impulse that costs her anything; the final heroic act feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from flaw. Interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“profound gratitude for her persistently curious nature”) instead of embodied tension. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values—she simply follows the tech readings to the hidden documents. The sister-reveal is moving, yet Margaret’s absence from the scene keeps the emotional crucible off-stage, so Aria’s change is observational, not experiential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is linear and coherent: scratched photo → hearing-aid pulses → hidden compartment → exoneration. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with social cost (family myth shattered). However, the hearing-aid recordings of “energy pulses” function as a deus-ex-machina conduit: we are told they contain “evidence” but never shown how pulses translate to actionable proof, so the final leap relies on asserted rather than demonstrated causality. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Mist-clad atrium supplies atmospheric membrane and temporal boundary (“when the dead called”), but it never constrains Aria’s actions or tools; any quiet outdoor spot would serve. Sensory selection favors haze and hush, reinforcing twilight liminality, yet the space remains a decorative backdrop rather than an active obstacle or resource. Micro-setting inside the music box finally matters, but the atrium itself stays ornamental. Strong tonal consistency keeps the score above mid-band.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—giving Margaret’s sister posthumous justice—is signaled early and escalates once the pulses intensify. However, escalation is technological, not personal: the equipment trembles, documents appear; Aria risks nothing tangible (time, reputation, safety). The meaningful tightening is present—options narrow to “expose or bury the truth”—but the cost is borne by the dead, not the living protagonist, keeping pressure abstract. Sufficient for the word count, yet short of the visible price required for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of unheard voices emerges organically from Margaret’s deafness and the erased photograph; the final image of “truth would protect even the most vulnerable voices” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the scratched face—violence made visible—yet the story occasionally spells out its thesis (“Aria felt profound gratitude…”). Complexity is present but blunted because Aria’s own voice is never jeopardized; she remains a courier rather than a co-victim.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays tightly latched to Aria; perceptual signature favors tech-metaphor perception (“frequency sensors hummed with potential”). Rhythm modulates—long twilight sentences yield to staccato pulses—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing in narration) edges toward academic, but generally stays within Aria’s plausible lexicon. Clean, purposeful free-indirect control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; sentences multitask (“she worked during the most mysterious hour—when the dead called out to the living”). Minor loop: “persistent/persistently” appears three times in close proximity, and “pulses” is over-leveraged. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding that obscures causality. Final third is clean; artifacts do not touch closure. High density, strong read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” is a fresh speculative occupation, and coupling it with a deaf client’s hearing-aid archive is inventive; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. The scratched-out-sister trope is familiar, but reframing institutionalization through deaf-recorded energy pulses gives it new charge. Risk is moderate—speculative tech without rigorous exposition—but the emotional core carries it. Transformation is solid: remove the hearing-aid mechanic and the entire plot collapses.</comment>
