<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s stubborn refusal to accept the lens as irreparable drives every beat after the inciting package; his interiority is concrete (“muttered at 3:17 AM”) and his micro-choice to dive—despite no guarantee—pays visible physical cost. The endurance at the end (still chasing stillness) is earned stasis, but the emotional layering flattens slightly because we never feel the bodily toll post-dives; competence swamps flaw. Mrs. Hargrove’s spectral cameo supplies closure, yet her on-page pressure is zero, so the relationship crucible requirement is waived. Overall, a credible, character-bound arc with minor embodiment gaps.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse now rotates without electricity, Marcus accepts perpetual unrest, cost is felt (“chased stillness...slipping away”). Causal chain holds: package → basement failures → impossible-space dive → lens revival → nightly signals. The six-week gap is ellipsed, not broken, because the next scene pays the risk with the underwater retrieval. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. Meets 9+ quick test except the cost could be more viscerally embodied, keeping it just sub-exceptional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Velvet-lined lens, basement clutter, gelatinous manuscript cases—detail is selective, sensory, and filtered through Marcus’s professional eye. The underwater dome becomes a micro-setting that physically constrains the revival act, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent across three dives and library moves. Only minor generic lighthouse iconography keeps it from higher band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—give the lost dead a “permanent address”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when conventional repair fails, forcing the dive. One meaningful deepening occurs inside Mirrormere: occupying impossible spaces is the irreversible tactic that forecloses retreat. Price is legible (life-threatening expeditions, molecular tearing), although on-page physical aftermath is skipped. Coincidence never rescues; escalation is causal under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: burial is easy, self-burial impossible. The broken lens reweights from maritime rescue to post-mortem waypoint; final image of Marcus still wandering reprises the motif without moralizing. Subtext in spectral signals invites reflection on who tends the tenders. Avoids tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is undertaker-cold (“giving rest a permanent address,” “spirits than he’d cared to discuss”). Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Impossible, he muttered”). No dialogue to evaluate; interior voice remains cohesive, professional, exhausted. Psychic distance controlled; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences vary naturally. Minor template cadence in “six weeks and three life-threatening diving expeditions later” is the only scaffolding trace. Metaphors stay coherent (“fractured like frozen lightning”). No loops or mixed vehicles; clarity remains high at closure. A few adjectival boosts (“once-brilliant prisms”) flirt with purple but serve character awe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusing undertaker lore with underwater magical librarianship and crystalline afterlife optics feels genuinely fresh, not a prompt checklist. The impossible-space repair rule is foreshadowed early and paid off causally. Emotional risk (accepting eternal unrest) matches conceptual risk. Avoids quirky-for-quirk’s-sake; specificity anchors novelty.</comment>
