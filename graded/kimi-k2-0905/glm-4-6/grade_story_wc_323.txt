<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory tug—between abyss-born pragmatism and star-yearning wonder—is shown through embodied micro-choices: sealing the suit, unclipping the link, activating the holo. The “balancedly curious” trait is more than label: it licenses him to volunteer for an impossible syllabus and charge the anchor with new symbolic weight. Interiority stays concrete and salt-stained; no therapy-speak. Only the moment he “smiles beneath the apparatus” feels slightly performed; a visible breath or jaw-click would seal the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: alien data → Council mandate → Elias volunteers → first star-class → anchor re-priced as stellar bridge. Orientation is clean by line 10; single-scene default met. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the link becomes “a bridge between worlds,” crystallizing the new syllabus and the decades-long wait. Cost is felt—“might not occur in their lifetime”—but could be sharper if a student physically pockets the link or Elias hears his own pulse in the helmet.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Selection is ruthless: only the pressure seal click, the viewport glow, the link’s pitted iron, and the coral-star echo reach the page. Each detail does double duty—tool, body, atmosphere—while the holo-projector turns the dome into a micro-setting that constrains pedagogy. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible moves. Anchor-chain as micro-setting charges the final image; meets 9+ gate but slight over-prettiness in “luminous spires” keeps it just shy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—teaching star-navigation to the sky-naïve—is signaled early and tightens when Elias must make the abstract tactile via the anchor. One meaningful deepening: projector fuses iron to star-map, foreclosing pure theory. Cost is conceptual (lifelong exile from stars) but not viscerally paid on-page; a student’s trembling hand or Elias’s cracked seal would lift it higher. Agency stays with Elias throughout; no coin-flip resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—navigation as remembrance of the sky—emerges from the anchor’s re-pricing rather than exposition. Subtext hums in the coral/stars mirroring, the iron becoming celestial. Final image reframes exile as preparation, avoiding moral homily. “Somber marvel” tone is sustained, but the last clause “had to begin tonight” nudges toward thesis; a breath more ambiguity would reach 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with a perceptual signature attuned to pressure, metallic taste, and geometry. Syntax lengthens when he lectures, tightens when he clips the link—rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal idiom is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal; “he noticed” is earned. Elision of surface memories is taught early via relic link and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Information density high: one sentence can anchor body, tool, and heritage. Only micro-loop: “luminous spires… filtered daylight” sits near “bioluminescent corals… pulsed with gentle light” in adjacent paragraphs—slight shimmer surplus. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges anchor/bridge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of aquatic gothic with celestial aspiration feels specific and non-obvious; the anchor-link as stellar sextant is a fresh inflection. Tropes (hidden human city, alien star-maps) are transformed through pedagogy rather than warfare. Risk—lyric star-teaching in abyss—pays off via coherent closure. Could edge 9.0 if the cost were more bodily etched.</comment>
