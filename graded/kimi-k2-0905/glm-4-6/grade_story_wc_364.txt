<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quietly determined fire is shown through embodied micro-choices—collecting labeled fragments, descending without a torch, the deliberate circle—so the interior contradiction is present. The final kneel and tear-charged eyes sell the cost, but the “rubble within himself” line drifts toward diagnostic-speak, blunting peak embodiment. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. Overall, a credible arc from meek to purposefully transformed, but the interior language could be more concrete at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elias buys the silk, therefore he can reforge stone; because he labors underground, therefore a floating arch rises. Closure is a Charged Poise—the bobbing azure arch reconfigures village perception and Elias’s posture with visible conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and again at the cavern, satisfying the 120-word window. One minor elasticity break: the silk’s exact mechanics are elided, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The floating rock arches are not postcard scenery—they actively pressure Elias’s life and later literalize his goal of “coaxing resilience from rubble.” The orchard planet’s violet sky and crumbling geography are filtered through his blacksmith-eye for weight and structure, not tourist catalog. Micro-setting inside the mine is lived-in: phosphorescent lichens replace torchlight, spatial choreography tracks cleanly as fragments lift. Environment constrains the final image: the reborn arch rises against that same violet sky, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore arch stability—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when the first fragment floats: failure would re-prove his lifetime insignificance. Escalation is causal: each hour spent guiding silk energy subtracts stamina and social visibility (dawn arrival risk). The decisive turn is the silent molecular rearrangement that forecloses retreat—if the silk fails, the fragments collapse and his secrecy is exposed. Cost is visible: knees drop, eyes flood, wagon journey made under sleep debt; price alters later options (more silk to barter).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as structural integrity—arches fall when collectively forgotten, rise when stone remembers brokenness. Subtext lives in gesture: the act of labeling rubble is a quiet refusal to let history vanish. Final azure glow reweights prior motif (defiance) into communal spectacle, avoiding moralizing. One near-echo: “coax resilience from rubble” borders thesis, but it’s buried mid-story and recharged by image, so only minor deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “tracks of his quiet determination,” “weathered hands,” selective attention to weight and fracture. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“shuddered, then lifted”—then exhales with the kneel. No head-hopping; diction stays within blacksmith lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful; figurative muddle absent from peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety supports propulsion: short bursts for underground labor, longer lyrical coils for dawn reveal. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances choice or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor river/liquid night is allowed for pattern consistency. Minor density spike—“azure defiance” repeated—but it pays off in final image, so forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses fantasy-science (floating orchards) with intimate craft magic; not a template echo. “Bartered awakenings” as memory-for-structure is a fresh twist on repair tropes. Specificity of labeled debris archives gives the concept bite. Risk in quiet climax (no explosion) heightens coherence; payoff is the bobbing arch at dawn. Slight penalty for familiar “overlooked artisan saves world” arc, but grounded details keep it above median.</comment>
