<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s calm, repairer’s reflexes feel lived-in; the leaf-listening micro-choice (timing the clock to the leaf’s landing) crystallizes his interior contradiction between mechanical order and lunar entropy. The moment he collapses against the wall, chest heaving, supplies visible cost and earned endurance. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV interiority stays consistent, though “luminous ache” edges toward register drift. Overall, a credible, flawed competence that pays its final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the frozen clock hand and brightening Earth reconfigure stakes with undeniable cost. Causal linkage holds—leaf fall → timing tweak → tremor cease—without off-stage rescue. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. The inferred lens is Causal; escalation compresses via because/therefore until the final image. One hairline slip: “velocity recalibrated” is asserted, not instrument-shown, but final image carries enough conceptual cost to waive deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The clock mechanism and biodome leaf serve as micro-settings that directly constrain choice; the silver dome and cloud-wreathed moon supply tactile, POV-filtered detail that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under tremor pressure: sound of leaf > visual of Earth brightening. Spatial choreography tracks Kael’s sprint to biodome and return without drift. Reaches 9+ gate: tool (clock) and environment (observatory orbit) jointly shape tactics and final stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—observatory slipping from orbit—signaled early; escalation tightens via tremor crescendo and clock-hand frenzy. Protagonist agency drives the reversal: leaf-timing restructures chaos into thrust. Cost is visible (tools crash, floor lurch, bodily collapse). No external antagonist needed; pressure stays coherent under Causal lens. Could edge higher if a concrete resource loss (broken tool, cut hand) had altered later tactics, but the stakes still feel scaled to 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the repairer’s ethos: entropy can be bent but not erased; the still clock is not victory but negotiated truce. Subtext lives in the leaf’s whisper against cosmic vacuum—no moral spoken. Final image reweights earlier “luminous ache” into quiet, fragile equilibrium. Avoids sermon; resonance is oblique yet legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature—“argent light,” “frozen shutters,” “mockery of the void”—is optician-poetic without leaving his lexicon. Rhythm compresses under stress: fragmentary em-dashes mimic tremor breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs are sparse; when used (“he realized”) they tilt causal, not explanatory. Achieves 9+ quick test: distinct perceptual texture taught early and held through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric glide (“the observatory… the clock… the leaf…”) gives way to staccato crash beats. Information density high—single sentences layer tool, body, stakes. One paraphrase loop (“luminous ache” repeated twice) but occurs outside closure beat; −0.3 applied. No metaphor clash; lunar vacuum and leaf whisper cohere as conceptual contrast. Minor scaffold: “its silver dome catching the light” appears twice—accept as motif reprise, not churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—lunar clocksmith recalibrates orbital decay via falling leaf—feels inevitable in hindsight, not derivative. Leaf-as-timing-device transforms familiar entropy trope into fresh mechanic. Risk of preciousness is skirted by grounding in tactile repair jargon. No close echoes of famous lunar tropes. Conceptual integrity commits fully to low-grave, high-lyric register without retreat.</comment>
