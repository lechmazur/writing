<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “methodically curious” trait is shown through the meticulous video alignment and meteorite ritual, but the interior contradiction never becomes a live dilemma; the moment of shielded openness is announced rather than dramatized, so the micro-choice that costs him something is missing. The closure is a lyrical epiphany, not an earned renunciation, so the required visible cost is off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final paragraph reweights silence itself as the true map, with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric/accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the lens holds because pattern (silent video comparison → meteorite ritual → silence-as-map) is taught early and pays off in the final image. Orientation is secure by line 3 (who, where, when). The only slack is that the “tear” rule is asserted rather than demonstrated in scene, so the stakes never tighten through a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, fresco tears, and meteorite grit are tactile and bias-filtered through Elias’s map-framer eye; the vault’s curvature literally guides his body placement and ritual, and the final image of dawn light on wet stone recharges the earlier rust-tears motif. Meets the 9+ gate: the setting itself (vault + map + meteorite mixture) constrains the final ritual and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access the whispered chapel—signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the two silent videos overlap to reveal the doorway; this narrows options from “maybe myth” to “passage open now.” Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible loss is paid on the page, so escalation stays in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “silence as cartography” emerges through the accumulating images of torn maps, silent footage, and rust-fresco tears; the final reconfiguration reweights silence into a geography one can enter. No moralizing summary—theme stays implicit. The concept is fresh, but because the cost is oblique, the resonance is cerebral rather than gut-punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly inside Elias’s perceptual hierarchy (atlas margins, parchment fracture, meteorite grit). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, staccato prepositional fragments (“At precisely 3:47 AM…”) at the reveal. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction like “acoustic anomalies” and “dimensional fabric,” which remain within a map-framer’s plausible lexicon. A hairline slip: “shielded openness” is named rather than shown through syntax, but the overall texture is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or procedure; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (vault = question-mark ceiling, silence = map). Minor overwrought cluster in paragraph 3 (“visual cadence resonated… shadow that moved without source”) knocks 0.3; still clear and propulsive. Final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent-video forensics + meteorite ritual + acoustic cartography is non-obvious and specific to Elias’s profession. The whispered chapel as “space between moments” reinvigorates the tired portal trope. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversals—but the conceptual payoff is cleanly signaled. Not transformative enough to reach 8.5+ band, yet fresh within its micro-genre.</comment>
