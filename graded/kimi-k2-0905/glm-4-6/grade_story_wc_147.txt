<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marina’s mentor-promise and the vial-warmth give a clean emotional anchor; contradictory impulses appear only in the summary “override instinct,” never dramatized in a moment of hesitation or micro-choice. Interiority drifts into grand abstract nouns (“reshape understanding…”) instead of body-level fear or calculation. The final integration is declared, not visibly paid for on the page—no felt cost in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marina becomes the new signal, reweighting the premise from rescue to invitation; the cost is conceptual (loss of human form implied) but not felt on the page. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of “gathered hush” deepens until it crystallizes meaning. Orientation is met inside 120 words; the temple’s physics rules remain sufficiently consistent. One scaffold loop (“the gathered hush once more”) slightly dulls the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Underwater temple, crystalline spires, and gravity-defying water are vividly sketched and directly shape the descent tension; spatial choreography is clean. The vial serves as micro-setting object that constrains the final choice by “touching memories.” Sensory balance favors visual wonder; a tighter auditory or tactile pin could have heightened the hush motif. World rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find mentor truth / wield temple power—is signaled early; pressure tightens when oxygen drops and timeline distortion becomes real. One meaningful deepening occurs: the signal is invitation, not rescue, forcing acceptance of fusion. Cost is declared (“oxygen reserves dwindle”) but not enacted—no visible symptom or tactic change under deadline. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmission-across-silence emerges organically through the reversed distress call; no authorial moralizing. The vial’s shift from keepsake to dimensional key offers a subtle reweighting. Subtext operates in the invitation misread as plea, though the insight is stated more than dramatized. Final image avoids tidy profundity, leaving credible ambiguity about disembodied continuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hypnotic, cadenced texture that matches the “gathered hush” aesthetic. Diction stays within poetic register; no head-hopping. Filter verbs (“seems to”) are purposeful, maintaining dream distance. Occasional template cadence (“the gathered hush once more”) flattens rhythm; otherwise sentence variety and metaphorical coherence hold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is patterned (“gathered hush”) and pays off. One mixed metaphor (“silence… like a weight pressing against consciousness”) is forgivable. Proofing is clean; only minor scaffold repetition in “the gathered hush once more” dulls the ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The “distress signal as invitation” inversion and memory-carrying perfume vial offer a fresh synthesis of lost-explorer and ascension tropes. Specific perceptual filter—“gathered hush” as both auditory and metaphysical constant—creates memorable signature. Risk is taken with elliptical narrative and non-human closure; coherence survives. Could edge higher if cost were embodied rather than implied.</comment>
