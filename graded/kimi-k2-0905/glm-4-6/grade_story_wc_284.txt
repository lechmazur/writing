<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—survivor’s caution versus paternal remorse—are alive in every beat; the micro-choice to stamp the snow-cipher while swallowing the risk of trap shows the “prudently daring” trait in action. Interiority stays concrete (“phantom of warmth in the biting air”) and avoids diagnostic speak. The final renunciation—guaranteeing Althea a future by disappearing—pays off the established guilt and is causally earned. Cost is visible: he forfeits identity, contact, even the right to be remembered, fulfilling the closure under Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pillbox discovery → coordinate → snow-cipher → self-exile; each beat narrows options with clear therefore links. Anchors (who/where/when) fixed by line 3; orientation test waived because later payoff uses the same mist-bluff coordinates as the cipher canvas. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: palm on stone = physical seal of the guarantee, cost legible in the same breath as the erasing wind. No plot amnesia or convenient props; the pillbox’s reappearance is set up by Prague back-story and Prague betrayal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s mist, frozen ground, and wind-scoured plateau are not backdrop but tools: the plateau provides the only aerial-visible canvas for the code, the bluff’s stone becomes the literal “witness” he touches to seal his vow. Weather evolution (wind rising to erase footprints) is causally tied to the denouement, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is crisp: kneel at box → stamp plateau → return to bluff edge; no impossible positions. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual cliché, keeping perception aligned with a spy’s threat scan.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—secure Althea’s future—announced with the coordinate slip; pressure tightens once: cipher creation = irreversible commitment that forecloses his own escape (if seen, he dies; if not, he vanishes anyway). Coincidence absent; antagonistic force is the shadow service itself, represented by the pillbox bait. Cost is visible: he spends his last night crafting a message that will literally self-destruct, trading any chance of reunion for her immunity. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening is sufficient; this beat satisfies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restorative self-immolation emerges through image pattern: ivy/thorns pillbox → carved snow paths → wind erasure, all circling “fixing what’s broken” without once moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—no dialogue, only gesture—forcing reader to read covenant into boot prints and palm-on-stone. Final image reweights the whole premise: the spy who stole lives gives one back, yet the gift is invisible. Resonance is concrete, not platitudinous; the cost paid on the page prevents sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature (“silver hush,” “flat pearl sky”) is consistent, poetic yet restrained, matching a burned agent’s exhausted clarity. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical opening sentences vs clipped final paragraph, mirroring decision made and action ending. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Compression in “He would wait no longer” is strategic, not eliding vital beat but delivering decisive turn. Diction stays within ex-spy lexicon; no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is scaffold-free: no template cadence, no synonym loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“mist like cold, ectoplasmic water” sets tone without overwriting). High information density—each sentence layers sensory data, back-story cue, or tactical choice. Opening and final lines perform double duty: anchor atmosphere and stake / echo erasure motif. Copy clean: tense stable, pronouns unambiguous. No artifact touches closure beat, permitting 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle: spy redemption executed not through shoot-out but through ephemeral cartography—boot-print code that self-erases. Synthesis of winter cryptography + parental sacrifice feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken with near-static scene and lyric compression pays off in Charged Poise. Pillbox object re-purposed from romance relic to contract of death, transforming trope. Specificity (Carpathians training, Prague failure) prevents generic “burned spy” template. No close echoes of famous set-pieces.</comment>
