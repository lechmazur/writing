<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s rational-historian identity steadies every beat; his micro-choice to “sidestep” the master is perfectly in-character. The interior contradiction—rationality vs. the trembling awareness that truth will wound—is dramatized, not told. Cost is visible: the letter’s gilt edge “brushing his chest like a warning” embodies the price he already feels. Only mild safety-hedging keeps him from top-band: his flaw never quite compounds to a visible mistake before the last beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat is a because/therefore linkage culminating in the earned standoff and Charged Poise exit. Closure is clean—“I’m here to set us both free” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. One scaffold phrase—“like a forgotten promise”—recycles in the first and last paragraph, a micro-loop that dulls the final image by −0.1. Otherwise, prop and spatial tracking are flawless; orientation anchored by word 70.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The station is never a postcard: ivy limits reach, rusted track constrains exit routes, the single flickering bulb stages the fight. Micro-setting—the brass box and the letter’s gilt edge—literally charges the final image. Sensory selection shrinks under crisis (only the groaning door, skidding letter). The rosebush’s final absence is felt, not declared, meeting the 9- constraint test; yet the environment does not quite force a tactical change, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the noble lie or preserve public peace—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the master steps from shadow. Elias’s agency drives the reversal: his shout turns the fight into a moral choice that forecloses bargaining. Cost is legible—the master’s slumped shoulders, the letter’s new weight—but not yet socially paid; the world outside the station remains abstract, restraining escalation into the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirrored decay—station, rose, social fabric—without authorial commentary. The final reconfiguration (“some lies are prisons”) is spoken, yet it grows from the prior ivy-and-thorn imagery, earning its resonance. No tidy moral is imposed; the ethical calculus stays double-edged. Only a trace of sentinel echo in the last line keeps it from 9.0 territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—“emotional rationality” filters every image. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments appear only when he grapples, then lengthen as he regains analytical footing. No head-hopping; the master’s plea is observed, not ventriloquized. A single cadence drumbeat in “He…then he…” during the scuffle is minor enough to leave the 9-band within reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences perform double duty (advance action + charge image). One paraphrase loop—“decay…rotted…decay” across adjacent clauses—costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent (ivy strangles, gilt warns). Opening and closing lines are punchy, each re-inflecting the other. No filter-verb clusters or register drift; near miss for 9.0 but loop keeps it at 8.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “truth versus noble lie” frame is familiar; freshness comes from historian-as-combatant and the station-as-ruined-archive microcosm. Specificity of the brass box and rose-petal clock rescues the concept from abstraction. Risk is present—quiet standoff instead of thriller set-piece—and pays off in Charged Poise. Does not quite reach inevitability-level synthesis; swap Elias for another seeker and the beats still slot in, capping below 8.0.</comment>
