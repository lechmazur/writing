<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “mending what isn’t torn” gift is vivid and embodied, but his interiority slips into abstract thesis-statements (“the covenant of rust,” “quiet devotion of those who listen…”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The final smile feels tidy after town-scale salvation; no visible personal cost or foreclosed path is shown, so the renunciation/readiness lands as sentiment more than Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a bright, audible Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn and returned song—but the cost is external (town saved) rather than personal/POV. Causal chain holds: chip → resonance chamber → tether → light restored; however, the “missing inner light” problem is declared more than dramatized, so the tightening is felt more as lyric lift than as narrowed option for Elara.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: music-box gears, candle-oil stained fingers, bells-as-walls create tactile, choice-guiding terrain. The philosopher’s-stone chip’s amber pulse and starlight filaments give the final image its charge. Echoic labels (“Sevenbells,” “Great Darkening”) stay economical and anchored; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—is clear; pressure escalates via lunar twilight and dimming stone, but Elara’s agency is ritualistic (he follows inherited method) rather than risk-laden invention; no live option is closed to him except failure. Town-scale stakes dwarf personal cost, muting the felt price at climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of invisible wounds vs. visible repair emerges through acoustic reveal rather than lecture; final line offers conceptual reweighting (wonder found in brokenness) without moral tag. A trace of thematic echo remains—“the covenant of rust” named twice near start—slightly over-articulating the concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed third-person maintains candlelit intimacy; perceptual signature favors sound and gleam. Cadence flexes with tension—short chime-clauses accelerate the tethering sequence. No POV leakage; diction stays within artisanal lexicon; occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing,” “tinkersong wonder”) read as authorial rather than Elaran.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High sensory density without scaffold; metaphors stay consistent (music / light / rust). Minor template cadence in “his fingers… with a dancer’s grace” and later “moved like minuet dancers” reuses syntactic stem; a few adjectival stacks (“filaments of starlight he had collected…”) could trim. Closure line breathes cleanly, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fantasy trope mash-up (philosopher’s stone, eternal twilight, music-box soul) is refreshed by acoustic science and artisanal micro-repair optics. “Mending what isn’t torn” supplies a fresh inversion that pays off in resonance chamber logic. Town-saving climax is conventional, keeping the score from top band.</comment>
