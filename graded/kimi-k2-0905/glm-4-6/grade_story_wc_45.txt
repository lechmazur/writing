<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor’s contradictory impulses—scientific rigor vs. openness to the impossible—are dramatized in the moment she surrenders the tooth; the cost is the loss of her talismanic certainty, felt in the garden’s dimming. The child’s ancient weight is shown, not labeled, through gesture and dialogue. Interiority is concrete and profession-specific; the final micro-choice is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: surrendering the tooth reweights Eleanor’s epistemic rule-set with undeniable cost—the garden inhales, certainty’s cleft widens into understanding. Causal chain: corpse anomaly → tooth recognition → garden confrontation → surrender. Orientation is anchored by word 90; no lens ambiguity. One shard, single POV, one transition (drive to estate) within limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tooth functions as micro-setting: its warmth and iridescence constrain Eleanor’s skepticism and charge the final surrender. Garden impossibilities (crystallizing leaves, starlight branches) are filtered through her forensic gaze, guiding the choice to yield. Spatial choreography under the willow is clean; sensory hierarchy reflects medical training. Environment directly shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore ontological balance—tightens when the child demands the tooth; refusal is foreclosed by Eleanor’s trait of forgiving skepticism. One meaningful deepening: realizing the substitute body is invitation, not threat. Cost is legible in the garden’s dimming and the permanent loss of the tooth. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of scientific error-correction and Fae pattern-repair: mistakes become constellations when acknowledged rather than erased. Subtext in the child’s stone constellations mirrors Eleanor’s forensic bone-setting, reweighted when she surrenders certainty. No thematic echo; final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—balance restored, but human knowledge remains provisional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice carries forensic precision—“skeleton felt arranged,” “manacles of starlight”—yet allows lyrical compression. Perceptual signature is medical: iridescence under skin, warmth under tongue. Rhythm modulates from analytical to hushed awe without register drift. No dialogue contamination; child’s diction is ancient yet childlike, distinct from Eleanor’s clinical interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“starlight dripped”—and never muddies causality. High information density: tooth, corpse, garden, child, surrender in <800 words. Zero scaffolding; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fae-changeling lore is refreshed through forensic science; the tooth as ontological anchor feels inevitable, not borrowed. Risk taken: medical examiner accepts magic via empirical evidence—stakes heightened without gimmick. Specificity of bone-setting artistry and garden botany prevents generic fantasy drift. Transformation test fails if Eleanor were a generic skeptic; her profession is integral.</comment>
