<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eloise’s guilt and need to apologize are signaled early and embodied in her careful handling of the bottle; the moment she murmurs “Time to try something new” shows a micro-choice under pressure. Alistair’s remorse is conveyed only through disembodied voice, so his interiority is second-hand, slightly thinning the crucible. The mutual forgiveness lands with felt cost for both—her decades of running, his century of regret—earning the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain: bottle retrieval → current induction → voice emergence → apology → spectral release. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are cleanly in place by line 4; no disorientation penalty applies. Closure is a Decisive Change under Causal lens: the perfume bottle’s glow fades, Alistair’s echo dissolves, Eloise’s burden is explicitly lifted—“its ethereal tenant finally at rest.” Cost is visible in her trembling hands and the archive’s hush, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sheet-music archive is more than backdrop: dust trembles, shelves tower, proximity guides her ladder climb. The perfume bottle acts as micro-setting—its iridescent fragility constrains every gentle touch and charges the final extinguished glow. Orchard demolition outside supplies a live ticking clock that sharpens the hush inside. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props or impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the apology before the orchard falls and the ghosts scatter—is declared early. Pressure tightens once: the induced-current gamble could destroy the last link to Alistair; failure is named as “losing him forever.” The device’s hum escalates risk, forcing her irreversible plunge. Cost is paid on-page: the bottle’s glow dies, the whispers fall silent, her chance for forgiveness ends—either succeed now or carry guilt permanently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “imperfect miracles” emerges through the device’s half-scientific, half-ectoplasmic ritual rather than exposition; the miracle mends but cannot erase the orchard’s impending loss. Subtext resides in the bottle’s extinguished blue—regret transmuted into bearable memory, not triumph. Final image of the bottle returned “quiet monument” offers conceptual repricing: absolution is possible, yet demolition still approaches. No late moralizing; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Eloise; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: “voice a mix of gravel and starlight,” dust trembling “like held breath.” Syntax tightens under pressure—“She attached two slender leads… her hands steady despite the tremor”—mirroring her clamped calm. Dialogue is sparse but tonally right: Alistair’s crackling “You were just a girl” carries century-old static without slipping into exposition.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density, no loops. Figurative control: “mournful blue light” is singular, not stacked; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during current pulse, then exhales into the quiet final paragraph. One minor scaffold: “the bottle was once again just an old object” could trim “once again,” but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spiritualism with DIY electronics feels fresh; “gossip-column exorcist” and oscillator-generated ectoplasmic bridge are non-obvious syntheses. The perfume bottle as both literal relic and capacitor for regret is an inventive double use. Transformation test fails: swap bottle for locket, story still functions, hence not 9+. Yet tonal risk—ethereal grit—holds without kitsch, warranting high-band credit.</comment>
