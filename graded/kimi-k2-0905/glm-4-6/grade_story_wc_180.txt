<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is concrete—her quartz eye “whirrs,” dirt stains her fingers, and the ribbon scrape anchors filial ache. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. fear the seed is futile) act in-scene, but the daughter stays off-page so no status crucible can test the shift. The final renunciation—plant the bridge, accept waiting—earns its cost through prior ritual beats, though the emotional price is more implied than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each relic added to soil thickens symbolic density until the final image reweights “deciduous vows.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ribbon flutter re-casts the orchard as living contract. Cost is visible in the mender’s stained hands and mechanical eye strain; the persistent constraint of waiting shapes the exit beat. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (rope ladder, rafter sea) are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is tactile: roots “clung to stone arches,” fruit smells of regret, light dapples through stained glass. Setting constrains the mender’s ascent and kneeling posture, and the final image of ribbon against sapling charges the bridge metaphor. Micro-setting (ribbon, seed, rusted key) acts as choice-tool; their burial alters the symbolic field. Scale stays economical—no tour-guide excess—and sensory hierarchy favors touch/smell over visual cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can ritual mend a severed filial bond? Pressure tightens once: soil burial of relics narrows options from abstract hope to literal patience. No antagonist; escalation is accretive density, not causality. Cost is conceptual—acceptance of endless wait—felt in the exhale of vaulted ceiling; price alters stance rather than tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurring organic metaphor: vows like leaves shed/regrow rather than shatter. No explicit thesis; final ribbon flutter offers non-literal answer to whether contracts can be alive. Subtext in objects—melted candle smells of home—carries generational memory without exposition. Complexity intact: mender may be deluding herself; orchard might outlive both parties, leaving ambiguity fertile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to mender’s perceptual filter: “leafy sea,” “dappled rivers,” “mechanical heart.” Syntax lengthens then compresses with ritual rhythm; no head-hop. Diction “deciduous vows” coins fresh metaphor without jarring register drift. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long anaphora of “She…” mirrors liturgical cadence, paid off in final spare “Grow.” Figurative density peaks at orchard personification but never muddles causality. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds soil, object, or symbolic nudge. Filter verbs minimal; props tracked cleanly across ascent→burial→descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses sacred space with arboreal contract breach—fresh, not trope-reliant. Risk in lyric stasis rewarded: climax is planting, not confrontation. Specificity of quartz prosthesis + tattered ribbon creates indelible image unlikely in other texts. Transformation test fails if relocated; cathedral arches are necessary for vertical orchard logic. No echo of famous scene; voice synthesizes mythic and mechanical without gimmick.</comment>
