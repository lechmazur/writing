<comment>The summoner’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains abstract; we never feel a concrete contradiction inside him, only a serene resolve. His “mapping silence” is poetic label, not dramatized micro-choice under pressure. The final absorption of the crane-disk is calm acceptance, not a renunciation that visibly costs him anything on the page. Voice is vivid, but character reads more as atmospheric vessel than flawed agent.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern of hush-into-object early and holds it to a Charged Poise closure—the disk now thrums with contained fire, reweighting silence as weapon/peace. Causality is lyrical rather than because/therefore, but the final image lands with conceptual cost: the prophecy’s code is now his to carry. Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props. One soft loop: “tranquil blaze” repeats four times without new charge, dulling the final beat slightly.</comment>

<comment>The brook, moonlit paper wing, and hush itself function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the site is chosen for its last thread of sound. Spatial choreography is clean—the summoner kneels, unfolds, presses thumb, rises; props stay tracked. Sensory hierarchy favors hush over sight, fitting the abstract stake. The “terrestrially cosmic” scale is asserted more than tactilely felt, keeping it below the 9-gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—unmake sound-as-weapon—is signaled early; pressure escalates by density, not reversal: each fold of the crane tightens the hush until silence is weaponized into the sphere. Agency is present—he wills the transformation—but the cost is conceptual (now he owns the code) rather than viscerally felt on the page. No live option is foreclosed; instead, the world is gently reset to softer murmur. Meets lyrical tightening test but lacks a visible price that alters his next move.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: silence as both refuge and responsibility. The origami galaxy/earth duality reweights from fragile paper to contained cosmos, echoing the theme without statement. No moralizing coda; the final lullaby brook offers resonant reconfiguration. Ambiguity lingers—peace purchased by internalizing violence—yet the emotional after-effect is oblique rather than visceral.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric sustained with controlled compressions (“not words but the absence of them”). Perceptual signature is bias toward sonic absence and paper light; diction stays within poetic register without register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer breathless clauses during folding, short staccato when sphere ignites. No head-hopping; distance remains steady celestial observer. Repeated “tranquil blaze” becomes incantatory, almost but not quite tipping into template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density in every sentence risks purple overlap, yet pattern is taught early (“creased edges sharp as starlight”) and mostly coherent. One mixed metaphor: “hour stretched taut like a drawn bow” alongside “smoothed hush” later—tension vs. smoothing—creates micro-friction. Paraphrase loops minor: “the brook’s soft rush was the last thread of noise… the brook resumed its murmur” restates function. Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic; information density is poetic rather than propulsive, acceptable under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: origami crane as cosmic silencer, silence mapped like cartography. Risk is quiet lyric escalation without conventional conflict, but coherence holds. Avoids stock magic-system tropes; instead, metaphysics is folded paper. Specificity of “crease give way to something else” keeps it from generic spell-craft. Not radically groundbreaking, yet the angle feels non-obvious and internally inevitable.</comment>
