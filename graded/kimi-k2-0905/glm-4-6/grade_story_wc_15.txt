<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—stoic artisan vs. sleep-drawn mystic—surface in embodied micro-choices (pressing the warm plate to stone, stitching air). Yet the interior rationale for why she alone can ‘sew’ reanimation remains thin; the mystic gift is asserted, not earned flaw. Closure renunciation reverence rather than reclaim the sea is legible, but cost feels aesthetic, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of tide-loss → sleep-path → labyrinth → weave. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; canyon shift re-anchored through red-glow organs. Closure is a Charged Poise: orchid tapestries pulse with ocean’s absent heartbeat, re-pricing the vanished tide as invitation; cost is conceptual but undeniable. Causality intact; no late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Whorf-weaver’s perceptual filter shapes every descriptor: indigo fingers, salt-stained satchel, kelp-silk tensile in air. Labyrinth breathes as internal organ; copper plate warms, constraining her tactile choices. Canyon becomes micro-setting that alters weave tension. Final image of sunlit kelp-orchids recharges opening empty tide pools, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore/create beauty in place of absent sea. Escalation via deepening texture: each stitch thickens air, stakes shift from survival to reverence. Decision to sew rather than flee narrows options; visible price is exhaustion & indigo-stained fingers. Cost legible but not punishing; orchid solace feels transcendent more than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges: absence as generative space, broken precedents as invitation. Subtext carried in orchid image reframed from illustration to living tapestry. Final image reframes vanished tide not as loss but aperture; avoids moralizing. Slight abstraction keeps it from higher band—conceptual cost present, emotional bite muted.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric adheres tightly to Elara’s synesthetic craftsman diction: “sea-spun silk,” “threads catching light.” Diction stays within plausible artisan lexicon; rhythm swells & shortens with stitch tempo. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sustained under pressure. Copper plate warmth, indigo stain return as tactile refrain, charging closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Compression high: “tide pools—usually teeming… lay cracked” packs state change in one swing. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for labyrinth descent, staccato clauses for stitching. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors internally coherent (organ-glow canyon, kelp-orchid). Single soft spot: “impossible” used thrice in closing paragraph; minor repetition, not fatal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sleepwalking navigation + textile resurrection of vanished ocean inside organ-canyon. Orchid optimism literalised in kelp-silk breathes new life into eco-fantasy trope. Risk of abstract stakes mitigated by sensory specificity. Stays memorable; not derivative. Could push further if cost were more corporeal.</comment>
