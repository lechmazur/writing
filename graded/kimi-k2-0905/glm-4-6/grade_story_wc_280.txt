<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Arthur’s encore-longing is vivid and embodied (“translucent form illuminating dust motes”), but his shift from self-absorbed ghost to civic guardian is declared rather than dramatized; no interior friction accompanies the change, so the renunciation feels convenient, not costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the theater saved, coin left for the next dreamer, Arthur’s haunting reframed from solipsism to stewardship. Causal chain is soft—city officials and investors pivot off unseen synesthetic propaganda—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory echoes layers tighten until public taste literally changes, so the lens holds with felt social cost (“theater would be renovated rather than demolished”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Silver-barked apple trees that hum melodies Arthur can taste is highly particular; the garden’s threshold where the coin is placed becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image, constraining the next performer’s discovery and the theater’s future. Spatial choreography stays clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the theater—arrives late (paragraph 7) but is quickly braided with Arthur’s encore need. One meaningful tightening: the coin’s warmth signals the amplification of echoes, narrowing tactics to public-reality manipulation. Cost is conceptual—Arthur accepts permanent invisibility—rather than viscerally felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of art’s afterlife emerges organically from Arthur’s repeating performances; final image of “possibility itself” haunting the venue re-weights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the daughter’s sudden cinnamon scent is elegant, but theme stays safe, not risking darker notes of gentrification or exploitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric floats close to Arthur’s synesthetic sensorium; diction stays consistent (“sharp citrus for high C”) and rhythm modulates with the whistle-crescendo. No dialogue, so voice never contaminated; perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; only minor scaffold (“decades of performance had not merely…”) and one mixed metaphor (“temporal fragments worn thin”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line crystallizes the reconfiguration. No loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic ghost + tarot coin as amplifier + public taste rewiring. Risk of sentimentality is avoided by keeping Arthur alone and the civic turn conceptual. The orchard-as-afterlife-propshop feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick.</comment>
