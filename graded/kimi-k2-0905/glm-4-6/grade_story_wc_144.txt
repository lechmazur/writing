<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias’s blindness is never allowed to become a gimmick; every tactile micro-choice (the fountain test, the wire re-seating) is a fresh, character-specific beat that proves competence while exposing real limits. His calm is earned through repeated embodied risk—he can fail the patch, lose the drone, and the story lets that cost hover. Interiority stays in his fingers, not in abstract labels; the single voiced line “There” carries the weight of a decisive, irreversible micro-bet. The closure beat—drone aloft, mist thinning—crystallizes an earned stasis: he restores flight he will never see, and the reader feels the price of that permanent asymmetry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkage is immaculate: each wing-stitch → circuit test → fountain refraction check narrows options until the final wire spark literally re-animates the drone. The depot clock, ship horn, and mist lift are external therefore-triggers that synchronize with internal beats, tightening time without contrivance. Closure lands in a Charged Poise: the hummingbird hovers, feedback now “a song of direction,” reweighting every prior touch; the cost is the perpetual gap between Elias’s restored map and his own spatial darkness. No因果 rupture, no lucky off-stage fix—every hinge is on-page and finger-verified.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rail depot is never described for tourist color; it is revealed through rail-siding proximity, mist that blurs sight but sharpens sound, and the fountain’s refractive surface that Elias literally uses as a diagnostic tool. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the depot’s metal geometries and water-light interface constrain every decision—if the fountain ripple lies, the drone dies. Spatial choreography is immaculate; drone, bench, window, and horn distances remain trackable after every reach and swivel. One hairline slip: “ship’s anchor fully cleared the water” momentarily pictures a liner inside a rail yard; the metaphoric intent is clear, but the spatial overreach keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the drone’s navigational feedback before the ship sails—tightens exactly once, via the fountain-refraction reveal of a missed backup flaw; that micro-turn forces a final circuit patch under audible horn countdown. Agency stays tactile: if Elias misreads the shimmer, the drone will crash into the mist he cannot see. Cost is visible in the final image: perpetual asymmetry—he gifts sight to a machine he must pilot blind. The escalation is single but sufficient for 725 words; no reversal inflation, no coincidence rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the ethics of repair as transitive sight—mending the world’s gaze when your own is gone. Refraction, mist, and feedback become a quiet triad that re-weights “direction” from visual vector to haptic certainty. The closing drone-song is a literal re-voicing of data into melody, offering a Conceptual Repricing: navigation now = music, not map. No moralizing, no thesis tag—only the after-echo that every act of fixing widens an irreparable personal gap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s fingertip epistemology; every visual phrase (“the drone’s wings cracked”) is filtered through what his hands can verify, never an omniscient postcard. Syntax syncs with haptic tempo: long sentences for exploratory touch, staccato fragments at spark-moments (“The connection. A spark.”). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; “he could see nothing” is the only explicit blindness cue, yet the entire perceptual signature is built from texture, temperature, and vibration. Voice modulation under pressure is subtle but real: the single utterance “There” drops to a lower, magnetic calm that stills the depot air—dialogue as action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and un-showy; sentence openings vary across tactile verbs, prepositional anchors, and participial micro-breaths that mimic finger sweeps. Information density is high—every clause layers metal temperature, circuit status, and emotional valence without stacking metaphors. One minor loop artifact: “the depot’s mist… the mist outside… the mist now” appears thrice in 60 words; though functional as refrain, it edges toward template cadence and slightly dulls the closure shimmer. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero mixed metaphor; technical diction (synthetic thread, sensor alignment) stays accurate and POV-plausible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The blind repairer who refraction-tests circuitry via fountain shimmer is a fresh synthesis of steampunk tactile tech and lyric disability narrative; no familiar trope map matches this exact procedure. Risk is taken in real-time tactile exposition, yet clarity survives. The hummingbird-drone as synesthetic compass (sight → sound → direction) re-weights familiar post-industrial imagery without candy kitsch. While “mist-bound depot workshop” nods to retro-futurist cliché, the specific fountain-diagnostic method and the final asymmetry of restored flight offset derivation enough to feel memorable.</comment>
