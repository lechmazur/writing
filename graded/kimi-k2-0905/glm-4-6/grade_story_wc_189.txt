<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian’s observant passivity is consistent, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“I’ve learned to foresee change…”) that tells us the insight rather than dramatizing it. The micro-choice—setting the cicada down—carries symbolic weight yet alters no on-page option; cost is only asserted, not felt. Mara remains a silent mirror, so relationship-as-crucible is absent and status pressure is zero. Warmly observant trait is asserted repeatedly but never costs Elian anything or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide’s unification images the conversation finally ready to flow, reweighting the stake with conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tidal breathing and cicada endurance builds to cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty. One scaffold loop—“between states…between connection and isolation”—slows momentum but does not rupture causality. The ending beat is legible and earned under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Grotto, tidal pool, and jade cicada form a tight micro-setting whose constraints (rising tide, salt-etched wings) directly charge the final image. Sensory selection favors touch and temperature, matching Elian’s chronicler bias. Starlight ceiling and ancient stone are sketched economically; no white-room syndrome. The cicada’s salt-ridged surface reappears at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate by reconfiguring meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the difficult conversation happen?—is signaled early but remains abstract; the tide, not character agency, supplies the only visible escalation. No option is foreclosed; Elian’s monologue merely fills the pause until water unites the pools. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of transition) but not viscerally paid. One tightening beat exists—the cicada placement—but it does not narrow future choices or risk loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transition-as-life emerges through tidal imagery and cicada endurance, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in silence and starlight rather than declaration. Final image of unified pools offers resonant non-literal answer. One thematic echo—“transition periods aren’t emptiness to be feared”—drops in final third, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly fused to Elian’s perceptual filter: salt ridges, liquid thought, cicada warmth. Syntax lengthens and softens, mirroring tidal rhythm without monotony. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is rightly opaque. Diction skews lyrical yet remains within Elian’s chronicler lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic control is high; sentences ebb and flow like the tide. Two paraphrase loops (“between…between” and “texture of time” repeated) deduct −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Information density is strong; each sentence layers image, character, and theme. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh angle: using tidal pool chronicle as metaphor for conversational impasse feels specific rather than borrowed. Cicada-as-survivor-of-in-between is an elegant objective correlative. Risk is modest—quiet lyric rather than structural experiment—so no bonus. Avoids stock break-up or coming-out templates; the pause itself becomes the story.</comment>
