<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“breaths held underwater” as lived habit—yet the turn from uncertainty to certainty leans on abstract self-assertion rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path; cost is felt but not tethered to a specific forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the statue’s final golden glow crystallizes the premise that brokenness enhances beauty; the causal chain holds under an Accumulative lens, each pockmark→memory→gold line tightening the pattern until the last image reweights the whole. Cost is undeniable—“oblivion itself” reframed—and the 120-word anchor arrives on time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Acid sea, corroding hull, spinning gears, and the warming key ring are tactile, pressure-generating specifics; the body-as-setting appears in “lungs might permit” and “breath caught,” constraining narration speed. The final image fuses statue, workshop, and sea into one charged tableau.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—escalate via each golden stitch; the 137th-day star fall → child’s tear → clockmaker birth sequence tightens the weave, forcing the alchemist to keep speaking while submerged. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the price (corrosion, drowning risk) is more ambient than viscerally paid in a single beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating metaphor: fracture as enhancement. No moralizing; the final whisper re-prices oblivion without sermon. Ambiguity lingers—does the statue save him or merely outshine decay?—inviting reflection beyond the plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric-syntax signature—“quilts memories,” “kintsugi intentions”—taught early and held; compression like “its pockmarked surface telling stories he alone could read” is purposeful, not scaffold. No dialogue, so voice convergence waived; perceptual bias (acid glare = memory trigger) stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with submersion cycles; sentences vary openings, no template cadence. Figurative density peaks in the final third but pattern-earned (“golden lines flowing like mercury”). One paraphrase loop mid-piece (“between breaths held underwater” restated) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating kintsugi-atelier on acid sea is fresh synthesis; trope of broken-statue-repaired becomes vehicle for survival philosophy rather than ornament. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into preciousness, yet the closing reconfiguration feels inevitable. Specificity of “137th day before Great Drowning” counters genericism.</comment>
