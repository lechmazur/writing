<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s monomaniacal drive to “decode” the leaf is palpable in every micro-choice; the final surrender is foreshadowed by his escalating intrusions and their failure. Interiority is specific—”chlorophyll than with people,” “taut wire vibrating”—never generic. The only cap: no second character on stage, so status/relationship bullets N/A; solitary POV handled with consistent perceptual signature. Cost is embodied when rain pierces his skin, mirroring the leaf’s scars—earned stasis with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the moment he drops the tablet and lets the wind move him reweights every prior data-point. Causal lens holds: each storm beat tightens because his shield attempt worsens the leaf’s agitation, forcing final surrender. Cost is visible—soaked shirt, tablet abandoned, epistemic model shattered. No orientation debt; mossy trellis anchor appears by line 6, storm season by line 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The trellis is not backdrop but instrument: its slick lattices dictate how Elias can/cannot intervene, and the final dance is choreographed against its wooden grid. Rain’s ozone, leaf’s tremor, stem tension—all filter through botanist-biased attention. Environment constrains the culminating choice: only by stepping out from under the eaves into full storm can the metamorphosis occur. Micro-setting (leaf-as-object) charges the final image when it glistens “with a new light.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he force or yield to the leaf’s language—tightens once yet decisively: shield attempt fails → surrender. Agency remains causal: his own actions (logging, shielding, dropping tablet) escalate cost under storm pressure. No coincidence; wind and rain complicate but do not resolve. Price is on-page: tablet forsaken, body battered, epistemic pride drowned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: knowledge through submission, science transmuted into somatic empathy. Subtext lives in gesture—hand rising to wet cheek—rather than thesis. Final image reconfigures “reconstruct” from data-model to bodily mirroring, reweighting every prior number row. Ambiguity lingers: the leaf’s language remains unread, but now shared—complex, untidy, alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual grammar—“chlorophyll,” “taut wire,” “green semaphore”—never drifting to leaf-POV. Rhythm accelerates with storm: short clauses mimic thrash; longer reflective sentences precede surrender. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Compression taught early (“circuitously sincere”) pays off when syntax loosens into physical mimicry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentences carry double duty: “His diagrams failed him; the leaf’s behavior was too chaotic” couples internal state with external fact. Figurative language is spare, storm-tested—”stem a taut wire vibrating” is precise, not purple. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from measured botanist cadence to wind-driven staccato, mirroring surrender. Line integrity intact: no typos, no tense drift, no buried lead.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—botanist forced to unlearn observation by becoming observed—flips standard science-as-control trope. Linden leaf as co-protagonist elevates object to agent without anthropomorphic cheat. Specificity of “asymmetrical heart-shaped form” and “digital map of every shudder” freshens familiar storm-awakening arc. Risk taken: quiet ending, no antagonist, yet stakes feel absolute because epistemic identity is at hazard.</comment>
