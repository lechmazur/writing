<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s laughter and “storm-herald” label are repeated but never embodied in contradictory action; interiority drifts into cosmic exposition (“beautiful chaos”) rather than micro-choice. No visible cost or renunciation attaches to the midnight ritual; the closing “softened laughter” merely restates the opening mood. Character functions as atmospheric camera, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The piece accumulates lyrical texture rather than causal tension; stakes (“shape a new dawn”) stay abstract and off-stage. Closure is a restatement of stasis—Kaelen will keep laughing and steering—so no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration lands with cost. Orientation is clear early, but the lens remains accumulative/textural; no single tightening beat narrows options.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Emerald lighthouse,” “glass lantern wick,” and star-shadow choreography are sensuous and specific; the beacon-as-metronome image anchors time. The setting constrains no choice—Kaelen could be anywhere with a lamp—so the 9+ gate fails. Still, the tactile glass-light manipulations supply immersive texture that feeds the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (“shape a new dawn”) is declared but never tested; no reversible jeopardy appears. Escalation is poetic accretion—more refracted headlines—rather than a narrowing of options or visible price. Agency is ritual repetition without adaptive tactics, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of forgotten tactile knowledge versus digital ephemera is evocative yet stays didactic—stated in exposition, not dramatized via choice. The “ancient shadows” motif recurs but does not reweight meaning at the end; closure merely restates the premise. Subtext wants to emerge through light-pattern headlines, yet they remain metaphorical scenery.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice achieves a consistent incantatory rhythm; diction (“metronome that had kept time since long before the last print newspaper crumbled”) flexes syntax to Kaelen’s cosmic antiquity. Filter verbs are sparse; metaphor density is high but patterned early, so lyric surplus reads intentional. Minor lapses into abstraction (“beautiful chaos”) keep it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; openings rotate to avoid template monotony. Some metaphor layering approaches purple (“memories of futures not yet born”) yet stays coherent under lyrical lens. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected; information density is high. Closure line breathes cleanly, achieving image-led cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse-as-accidental-prophecy engine refreshes the keeper myth for the digital age; total-internal-reflection mechanics feel novel and specific. The “print newspaper extinction” time-stamp reframes the keeper’s anachronism without didacticism. Risk remains lyrical rather than structural—no rule-inversion or character reinvention—but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
