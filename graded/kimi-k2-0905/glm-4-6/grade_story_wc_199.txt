<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his finger-dances, whispered credo, and secret monuments all reveal a man trading ritual for revelation. The final shift from “sorter” to “keeper” is earned because every preparatory micro-choice (sorting, collecting, prodding) has been dramatized. Yet the emotional contradiction under pressure is told more than embodied; we’re informed “his heart seized” rather than shown a visceral stutter in his star-tweezer grip. Still, the visible cost—his room’s transformation from static shrine to living archive—makes the renunciation legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the speck’s dissolution reconfigures Elias’s vocation and reweights the world-rule that memories can return. Causality holds because every beat is tethered to the Three-Moon alignment, the prod, and the folkloric promise; the final image (“monuments to forgotten things now pulsed”) pays the conceptual cost. Orientation is nailed by word 50 (“ashen skyborne arbor”). Minor slack: the phrase “something emerges transformed always” is repeated four times, blunting the tightening cadence, but it never ruptures the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The arbor is never a postcard; its ash-trees’ dangling roots and misty below directly enable the seed-sorting labor and the balcony leaf-collection. Micro-setting triumphs: the wooden sorting tray, star-tweezers, and dewdrop resin all constrain what Elias can manipulate. Spatial choreography is pristine—every speck floats to a specific corner and alters that object’s state. Only the “galaxy-eyes” of the sprite flirt with cliché, but the image is brief and immediately transmuted into the ash-leaf glyph that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the dust or remain a passive archivist”—is signaled early and tightens when the prod incarnates a memory-keeper. The reversal (sprite → leaf → keys) narrows Elias’s options from curiosity to custodial burden; the price is the irrevocable loss of anonymity as his room becomes an open conduit for lost worlds. Cost is visible: “his room no longer felt small but infinite,” a spatial price that forecloses his quiet life. Agency is micro but sufficient for 700 words; the escalation is accumulative/textural rather than causal-chain, and it reweights the stake cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: hoarding versus releasing memory, the ethics of resurrection. The moonstone dust’s transformation from keepsake to bridge reprises the monuments motif, retroactively charging them as “anchors.” Subtext resides in silence—Elias never articulates a manifesto; the final image of infinite room is the non-literal answer. Only the phrase “mossy delight” edges toward sentimental abstraction, but it is offset by the concrete sensory spread of reclaimed history through his veins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: star-tweezers, vein-reading, thumb-sized sprite. Diction is elevated yet consistent—“cabochon,” “luminescent green,” “chimerical lotus”—matching his precision obsession. Rhythm flexes: long clauses for ritual, staccato for prod-reveal. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk. One POV slip: “Regional folklore told…” momentarily externalizes knowledge Elias already possesses, but the clause is brief and quickly re-interned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (action + world-rule). Figurative language is selective—“wings like dragonfly membranes” is the single simile in the climax, earning its keep. No scaffold loops; however, the refrain “something emerges transformed always” becomes a template cadence that mildly dulls momentum. Register remains coherent; no mixed metaphors or physics violations. Final line (“monument to all that would never be forgotten again) offers a crisp, inverted echo of the opening ritual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise flips the apocalypse: sky-city archivists rescue the earth below via dust instead of heroes fleeing downward. The synthesis of seed-sorting precision with cosmic memory-keeping feels fresh and inevitable. Risk is moderate—lyric repetition, micro-portal sprite—but the piece never retreats into safe generality. Only the “galaxy eyes” drifts toward stock wonder; the immediate transmutation into leaf-glyphs salvages originality.</comment>
