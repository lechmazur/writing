<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The locksmith shows interior contradiction—yearning for mastery while fearing the mirror’s verdict—but the shift from “fixing clocks” to “fixing herself” is asserted, not dramatized. The mirror’s father-memory is vivid, yet her present-tense micro-choices under pressure stay abstract (“worked quickly, her movements precise”) rather than revealing a hierarchy of values. The arc lands as Earned Stasis, cost visible in melting frost, but causality between gear-click and self-repair is more symbolic than embodied.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: mirrors warm, library thaws, future replaces past. Causal chain is lyrical—gear collage → mirror shatter → personal thaw—legible under Accumulative/Textural lens, cost felt. One soft patch: the prophecy scraps are named motive yet never constrain tactics; they disappear once the hall is entered.</comment>

<comment>“Frozen library above clouds” is immediate, tactile, and governs access (icy floor, fogged breath). Mirrors act as both setting and antagonist—distort gear reflections, force stance crystallization—meeting the 9+ gate. Selective sensory economy avoids tourist catalog; only visual and thermal details that pressure motion are kept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies when mirrors refuse to yield meaning until gear collage is complete. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each reassembly of gears tightens pattern, culminating in mirror shatter / identity reknit. Cost (tears frozen to lashes, childhood memory relived) is visible; moral calculus absent but not required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: repair as self-forgiveness. Final image—warm mirrors reflecting future—reweights opening “driftwood nostalgia” from loss to possibility. The eclipse–lock motif remains implicit, avoiding thematic echo penalty. Complexity: fixing can mend the fixer, yet the library’s stories remain unread—ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains controlled compression and selective perception (“tasted like forgotten winters”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained—prophecies known only as “scraps,” not decoded omniscience. Prose rhythm mirrors clock-swing cadence; gear-and-mirror imagery never drifts into purple. Slight register lift into “otherworldly energy” is earned by prior world-rules.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during mirror-blindness, lengthen during thaw. No scaffold loops; each descriptor (“crystalline windows,” “brass and steel components”) does fresh spatial work. Mixed-metaphor risk in “driftwood nostalgia” is accepted because it teaches tone early and pays off in final warmth. Information density high—single sentences deliver setting, mood, and bodily stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Frozen library + eclipse locksmith + clock gears is a fresh synthesis; high-altitude ice-archive feels distinct. Tropes (hall of mirrors, prophecy scraps) are filtered through tactile specificity rather than checklist ornament. Risk in lyric causality pays off: reader accepts gear collage → identity thaw because pattern is taught early and closure lands clean.</comment>
