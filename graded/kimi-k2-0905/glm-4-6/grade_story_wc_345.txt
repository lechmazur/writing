<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Gardener’s motivation is clear—restore the planet before the air fails—but she acts as benevolent stage-manager, never under pressure or contradictory. The living settlers remain a pleasant collective “we”; no individual interiority or micro-choice is dramatized, so the required “character under pressure” is missing. What saves the score is the communal arc from suspicion to caretakership, a credible renunciation of extractive habits, paid for in sweat and dawn chalk duty. Still, the ghost’s altruism is declared, not tested, and no settler is forced to choose between self-interest and the gardens—so the cost feels generalized, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each chalk glyph and bell-chime adds texture until the final cavern image reweights the stake from survival to stewardship. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—”the network of butterfly watering bells chimed steadily” makes the social cost of future neglect undeniable. Orientation is clean: “Season of Falling Stars” + “five years after crash-land” anchors time inside 60 words. One minor causality tremor: the settlers instantly decode spiral = coordinate map without failed attempt, but the pattern is taught by repetition and pays off at the central arch, so the ellipsis is justified.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting specificity is the story’s chief pleasure: bioluminescent butterflies pulsing in sync with a hovering brass bell is tactile and stakes the planet’s atmospheric engine. The floating rock arches function as both landmark and mnemonic grid for the nebula-pattern hunt, constraining movement and mapping. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (chiming) and light (glow, chalk at dawn) over visual inventory, mirroring the settlers’ nightly pilgrimages. Only the orchard itself stays off-page—no blossom scent or fruit—so the “orchard planet” tag feels nominal; the cap is 8.1 not 8.8 because the environment enters the final image but does not reconfigure tactics—caretaking is already secured.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—planetwide habitability—surfaces early and tightens through each decoded chalk message, a textbook accumulative escalation. Agency is collective: children race to copy glyphs, adults haul tools to caves; the visible price is dawn sleep and labor, but no single settler risks personal loss. The deepest tightening is the realization that bells + butterflies + nebula form one life-support circuit; this reweights earlier “pretty sky” as survival manual, a genuine deepening. Yet luck (the ghost does all guiding) and absence of opposition keep pressure moderate; the score peaks at 7.5 because cost is social, not sacrificial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: altruism can be engineered into strangers if the system teaches trust through shared labor and wonder. Subtext lives in the chalk glyphs—spirals, fractals, butterflies—whose meaning flips from mystery to instruction manual, a graceful repricing. No character sermonizes; the closest is the ghost’s single line “I’ve been waiting for you to become family,” which is plot, not thesis. Final image of new arrivals reading the legend at dawn offers quiet resonance: collective memory replaces individual heroism, satisfying the 9- gate test, capped at 8.8 because the insight, while moving, is singular rather than multilayered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is stable omniscient with nostalgic distance suited to legend-telling; diction stays within settler lexicon (“celestial bridges,” “dirt under her fingernails”). Rhythm alternates between long breathless sentences for star-strewn vistas and clipped beats for dawn rituals, supporting the accumulative design. No dialogue to test naturalism. Perceptual signature is mild—selection favors communal awe over individuated quirks—but the chiming bell motif threads through sentences as auditory heartbeat, earning texture points. Just misses 8.0 because syntax is competent rather than idiosyncratic; no phrase startles with inevitability.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean: zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, strong verbs (“shimmer,” “race,” “pulse”). Information density is high—each sentence either advances discovery or adds sensory layer. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line resolves by image (“cosmic wink”) that recharges earlier nebula. Two minor scaffolding traces: “for months following” is transit summary, and “years later” is a leap that could use one bridging clause, but both are strategic compressions, not artifacts. Closure beat is untouched; deduction is −0.2 for near-simultaneous “would continue / would fail” conditional pair; still lands above 8.2 cap for 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise fusion—ghost horticulturist maintaining exoplanet life-support via butterfly-linked bell network—is non-obvious and specific. Tropes (benevolent ghost, chalk messages, bioluminescent cave) are retooled through collective stewardship arc rather than solo heroism, resisting stock survivor script. The “nebula of respite” as living map freshens the sky-as-code device. Risk is moderate: no structural experimentation, but the accumulative legend form commits fully. Score capped at 7.8 because the settler culture, speech, and tech remain generically rustic—could transplant to any pastoral colony without alteration—but the biological-bell gimmick is memorable enough to lift above mid-band.</comment>
