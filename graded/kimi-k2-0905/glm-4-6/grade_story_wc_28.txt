<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Elara’s “gentle radical” contradiction is embodied in every gesture—soft fingers pressing a jagged tessera that draws blood, the refusal to flee the fire-memories she never lived. The retrocognitive curse is dramatized, not labelled: she flinches at screams we don’t hear, keeps working. The renaming obsession is the only motivational spine; no second character or status crucible appears, so relationship bullets are waived. Cost is present—the cut palm, the looping trauma—but the final “bloom” feels more hopeful than the price paid, a hairline softening of Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each placed tessera adds density until the plaza’s atmosphere, not its masonry, shifts. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “garden waiting for its first bloom” renames the graveyard without erasing ashes; cost is the perpetual reliving of fire she didn’t witness. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; mosaic shards and minaret anchor place and time. No meaningful tightening beyond the first stone—each next stone is a promise, not a narrowing—so escalation plateaus; that caps the score below 9.</comment>

<comment>The plaza is rendered through knee-level touch—warm-cold air, chipped lion mane, tessera’s bite—rather than postcard panorama. “Shattered sky” and “skeletal walls” are familiar post-apocalypse signage, but the body-scale immediacy (blood on mosaic, sun’s weak heat battling chill) keeps them fresh. Micro-setting (tessera as both tool and relic) constrains every micro-choice and charges the final garden image. One stray cliché—“ghosts of the fire rising”—dents the otherwise idiosyncratic sensory filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can a single act of renaming loosen the retrocognitive chokehold? Pressure is situational—memory assaults her, plaza offers only fragments—but agency is steady: each pressed shard is a refusal to surrender the past to despair. No second reversal; the pattern simply accretes. Cost is real but static (cut skin, looped trauma) rather than escalating; hence the tension plateaus rather than tightens toward a final fork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: mercy is aberrant because it beautifies ruins that “don’t deserve” it, yet the only path left. The mosaic’s renamed lion→watcher quietly answers the opening question of whether empathy can be armored. Final garden image offers Conceptual Repricing: the plaza is re-valued from graveyard to seedbed. A half-sentence of prompt-like thesis (“aberrant mercy was the only kind left”) is offset by immediate re-embodiment in action, so thematic echo penalty is minor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s synesthetic perception—warm coldness, scorched color, stone that “bit.” Rhythm mirrors her looping curse: long clauses when memory floods, abrupt fragments when she presses tessera. Diction is poetic yet precise (“retrocognitively trapped,” “litany of hope”) and never drifts into editorial voice. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests entirely on perceptual signature and syntax—both sustained without slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “She carried a minaret mosaic tessera in her palm, its colors scorched but not erased” compresses history, object, and metaphor in one muscular line. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (lion→watcher, ashes→garden). One mixed moment—“warm coldness enveloped her, the embrace of a world healing”—leans abstract, but the tactile setup earlier earns it. Final line “The world listened” lands as crisp Charged Poise without syntactic flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The retrocognitive caretaker who literally renames rubble into hope is fresh; the mosaic tessera as both relic and tool repurposes the tired “found object” trope. Warm-cold paradox is risk-taking diction that pays off through sensory repetition. Risk distinction +0.3: the piece bets everything on lyric accretion rather than plot reversals, and the garden closure justifies the wager. Slight deduction for near-familiar post-fire imagery; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>
