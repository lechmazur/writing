<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eliara’s contradictory impulses—her reverence for silence vs. her need to break it—are embodied in every micro-choice (pressing the insulator, slowing the strum). The final renunciation of perpetual song is earned: she lulls the sculpture back to rest, paying the cost of impermanence. Interiority is concrete (“porcelain insulator cool against her palm”) and never drifts into label-speak. One flaw: the hedgehog’s ears are ventriloquized without POV filter, a tiny leakage, not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—sound as accumulating texture—and holds it to the resonant closure: the last note dissolves into hush, reweighting silence as charged, not empty. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. The single tightening—song swells then deliberately released—carries visible cost: her “heart light” against the knowledge the music will fade. Closure moment: “resonant with possibility” is Charged Poise, not explanatory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The grove functions as micro-setting: proximity dictates choice—she kneels because the sculpture sits “at the grove’s heart,” and the floor vibrates, a tactile constraint. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices cracks before leaf colour. Weather is absent but not missed; silence itself is the environmental pressure. Porcelain insulator recurs as handled object, its smoothness contra the gnarled wood, charging the final image when still warm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: density of sound increases until she chooses release, narrowing future options (she will have to leave the grove). No coincidence, only endurance. Cost is audible: the last note dissolves, silence returns, but now unbearably charged. One beat short of 8.8 only because the external pressure (grove) is ambient, not adversarial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of expectation: brokenness is not fixed but sung; silence becomes the richest music. Subtext lives in gesture—fingers slowing strum equals letting go. No moralizing; the final image (“quiet symphony”) is Conceptual Repricing that revalues silence itself. No motif checklist; porcelain and hedgehog recur only because they participate in the final resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric adheres to Eliara’s perceptual signature: synesthetic (“tree-song sculptor”), tactile (“smooth surface a stark contrast”), compressed (“hedgehog’s uncurling dusk”). No head-hop; hedgehog perception is one-line lens-slip, forgiven. Rhythm modulates: long sentences swell during crescendo, shorten at release. Non-standard grammar (“symphonically minded”) is voice-motivated and taught early. Read-aloud ear test passes: no algorithmic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“porcelain insulator… would bridge the gap”). No scaffold, loops, or paraphrase. Metaphors stay coherent: sound as textile, silence as fabric. One mixed vehicle—“steps softer than the hedgehog’s uncurling dusk”—but the lyric pattern justifies it and it does not touch closure. Register stable; no thesaurus-itis. Final line is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—“tree-song sculptor revives silent sculpture with telegraph insulator”—is fresh synthesis of eco-fantasy and salvage-punk. Risk taken: quiet stakes, no villain, yet intensity sustains. Specificity irreplaceable: stress-cracks read like Braille score; insulator’s former life as voice-carrier repurposed as bow. Hedgehog dusk temporal frame is original hinge. Not quite 9.0 because the core arc (artist awakens artifact) faintly echoes familiar “artist breathes life” tales, even here re-cast.</comment>
