<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s quiet obsession and “moth-in-a-jar” secret give him a distinct interior life; his micro-choices—unclasping the case, layering photos, stepping back—track a believable arc from private ritual to public revelation. The calm trait never slips even at the climax, showing credible self-consistency. Cost is present but oblique: he forfeits solitude and any future use of the case, yet the forfeiture is implied rather than dramatized, keeping the score just under the 8-band.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each added photograph increases density until the arcs merge into a living mural. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias staggers back, the pattern complete, the lullaby audible—charged with conceptual cost: his archive is now communal, no longer hoarded. Orientation is clean by line 4; causality is internal but coherent under the accretive design. One minor scaffold: “as vines climbed…so too did his understanding” repeats the earlier vine motif without new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lavender/metal mingled scent, the scavenged lightbox, and the dove-gray case are re-used, handled, and finally abandoned, so every key object constrains or charges the closure. Spatial choreography is crisp: case at feet, projection on wall, field leaning in. Factory ruins stay offstage but function as screen and metaphor, satisfying the micro-setting gate. No orientation debt; all anchors land within 60 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: turn private pain-archive into collective healing. Pressure escalates via density: each new arc narrows the possibility of keeping the work secret. The decisive tightening is the moment the arcs form wings/nest/heart—Elias’s option to remain sole keeper disappears. Cost is conceptual (exposure of his secret) rather than visceral, so it just misses the 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern—black-and-white arcs merging into colorless wings—rather than assertion. Whimsy is earnest but never twee because the lullaby is heard, not stated. Final image reweights all prior sorrow as shared constellation, resisting moral label. One soft echo of “transmute pain into masterpiece” edges toward thesis-speak but is saved by its earlier placement, not the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: medicinal lavender, metallic tang, hinges sighing like an old secret. Rhythm swells and subsides with the layering beats; no filter-verb clusters. Diction is elevated but consistent with an archivist who thinks in textures. No dialogue to contaminate voice. One template cadence—“then the next, and the next”—is brief and pattern-serving, not distracting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers scent, object, or emotional physics. Metaphors (nest/heart/wings) converge cleanly at climax without mixed logic. No synonym loops; “arc” repeats only when the pattern demands it. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive. A single paraphrase loop—“a lullaby of survival” immediately after “hummed a lullaby”—drops the score a hair.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The photograph-arc healing engine is fresh, not a trope re-skin. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulative structure in under 800 words—pays off via taught pattern and legible closure. Specific detail (dove-gray case, scavenged lightbox) keeps it from feeling like generic magical realism. Could swap lavender field for any ruined pastoral without structural harm, so irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>
