<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"furiously tranquil" embodies the paradox—but emotions tilt toward performed lyricism more than embodied contradiction. The ancestral flashback supplies motive yet occurs in summary, so the final forehead-touch feels slightly unearned. Still, the micro-choice to press the acorn cap into the floor crystallizes values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inherited vortex is recalibrated into "hers to command," with the price of ancestral franticness erased. Causal chain is lyric-loose ("whispering the lost language of equilibrium") but pattern-taught early and paid off in the geometric ice-reordering. Orientation is swift: starlight, atrium, seed saver by line 2. One causal gap: how descending entropy translates to time-reconfiguration is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound atrium functions as micro-setting that literally hardens into a keyhole; starlight and glacier-heart light constrain visibility and mood. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: cold is registered as "heat of purpose," a selective perceptual flip that charges the beat. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, press, step through darkness. The setting evolves causally with the entropy reversal, earning high-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming the texture of borrowed time—is signaled early and tightened when the floor opens inward. Protagonist agency is high: every beat is her deliberate ritual act. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of ancestral urgency—but legible on-page. No secondary pressure or tangible loss, so escalation stays lyric-moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as serenity through entropy-reduction: order reclaimed from chaos. The oak acorn cap and seed-saving ancestry provide concrete particulars; no abstract sermon. Final image of "profound peace" reweights the earlier frantic spiral without moralizing. Slight abstraction in "texture of borrowed time" keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance and fractal diction ("fracturing shell," "vortex inheritance"). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for trance, staccato "She knelt. She pressed." for action. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature is cosmological yet intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each ice crystal a "tiny verse"—and pays off in closure image. One paraphrase loop: "wild serenity" echoed as "wild serenity" without new charge. Otherwise high density, clean grammar, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Seed-saving time-bender via entropy-decrease is fresh synthesis of climate-SF and soft physics. Risk taken in lyric causal mechanics; clarity survives. Cultural specificity limited, but speculative premise transcends generic. Transformation test: swap acorn for key-card and whole arc collapses—element is essential.</comment>
