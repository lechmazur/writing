<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s face-blindness is never used to complicate a single beat—no misrecognition, no social friction, no tactical error—so the trait reads as label-only. His “greatest portrait” claim feels unearned because the sky-moment is pure success without a visible cost or renunciation tied to his flaw. Interiority is vivid (“hands raw,” “heart pounding”) but never contradictory; we get no simultaneous doubt/elation that would fracture his calm. The coin’s indentations map the mechanism but not Elias’s psyche, so the emotional stakes stay safely external.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: the sky-image endures in memory while the library collapses, reconfiguring Elias’s identity from face-painter to sky-keeper; cost is felt in the building’s death and his raw hands. Causality is accumulative/textural: each lens placement layers light until the room becomes a cosmos; the demolition clock supplies situational pressure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by word 60). The “centuries-old coin” teleporting into the scene without prior mention is a micro-prop glitch but does not break the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hollowed tree-trunk library is tactile, odor-rich, and fractally mapped; its grooves “stretch into infinity,” charging the final sky-fractal. Spatial choreography is flawless—floorboard, safe, lenses, ceiling—every move tracked. The demolition roar grows from distant to imminent, tightening the clock. The coin’s indentations function as micro-setting, aligning wood grain to hidden latch, so environment literally shapes Elias’s next move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: craft a sky-mirror before the wrecking ball erases canvas and artist. Escalation is situational: each prism click narrows time and raises the cost of failure; the outside boom becomes visceral countdown. Agency is present—Elias adjusts, positions, staggers out—but the final image is victory, not renunciation, so the price feels light. No visible constraint persists afterward; the sky inside him is gain without loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: beauty resides in pattern and light, not in human faces. The fractal sky reweights the premise that portraiture must depict people, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext flickers in the scholar-guild silence—they valued pattern over preservation—yet the story avoids sermonizing. The final “he felt seen” risks thematic echo, but the phrase is brief and earned by the inversion of blindness into vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains a perceptual signature driven by touch, sound, and reflected light rather than sight. Syntax lengthens during the luminous build-up, then fragments as the trunk crashes, mirroring Elias’s pulse. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent. The occasional elevated phrase (“fractally precise”) fits the concept-driven rather than vernacular mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is varied, sentences doing double duty: “He traced the grain…his fingers memorizing textures his eyes could not” advances setting + character in one breath. Occasional scaffold—“the library trembled…inside the sky held steady”—is justified by the situational lens. Metaphors stay coherent (sky inside wood) and do not congest the climax. Two near-paraphrase lines (“He walked away…He walked on”) appear in the denouement, a minor loop that does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The face-blind portraitist who paints sky-fractals inside a dying tree-library is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The scholar-guild backstory seeds conceptual depth without exposition dump. The demolition countdown converts a potential cliché into situational pressure. Risk—lyric accumulative structure, no antagonist—pays off in a closure image that feels inevitable yet unforeseeable.</comment>
