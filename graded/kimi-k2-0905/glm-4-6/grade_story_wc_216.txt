<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “quiet, persistent need to understand the texture of time” is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulse or body-level cost; interiority stays safely paraphrased. His single micro-choice—descending the silo—follows the urn’s GPS-like instructions rather than a visible internal clash, so the ending’s consolation feels imported, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain (fragment → coordinates → journal → consolation) is linear and coincidence-free, satisfying short-form economy. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias reweights his “borrowed time” from curse to gift, with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The lens holds, though the tightening is mild—one breadcrumb equals one descent, never truly narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s metallic echo and “strange, unfamiliar hues” of light are sketched with selective sensory strokes that mirror Elias’s attenuated perception of time. Micro-setting succeeds: the urn fragment and hollowed alcove function as portable environments that constrain handling and guide descent. Spatial choreography stays clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will Elias piece together the lost record before his own time expires?”—is clear early, yet pressure stays flat: each garage-sale clue obediently yields the next piece without resistance, cost, or time leak. The sole tightening is informational, not tactical; options never narrow, and the borrowed-time heartbeat never forces a sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as defiance of temporal erasure—emerges cleanly through the capsule’s scattered fragments and Elias’s cataloguing obsession, avoiding overt thesis lines. Subtext is modest but present: the urn’s “impossible weight” silently argues that meaning outlasts measurement. Final image reconfigures prior dread into quiet stewardship, achieving modest resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature (“texture of time passing”) recurs without drifting into committee voice. Syntax stays lean, resisting purple overload. No dialogue to test, but narrative diction remains within plausible lexicon for a solitary archivist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean, but repeated noun-phrase openers (“The…”) and templated “his fingers tracing / his breath catching” sap rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “a puzzle with missing pieces, its mysteries just beginning to unfold” restates the prior sentence. No mixed metaphors, and closure line avoids clutter, keeping artifact damage minor.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combining garage-sale cryptography with a post-numeric time collapse is a fresh hybrid; the concept’s oddity feels specific, not gimmicky. However, the capsule’s creators remain offstage, so the societal transformation reads as convenient backdrop rather than lived consequence. Still, the synthesis of mundane thrift-shop code and ontological rupture shows inventive risk within flash length.</comment>
