<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation—finding his sister—remains legible and personal, but the interiority drifts toward abstract summary (“translate distance into closeness”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure tests his resolve until the final cylinder spin, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. The wax leaf reprise supplies a crisp externalized beat, yet the emotional arc is told more than dramatized. Fits the Track-A single-POV default cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (“therefore” heat-transfer revelation) narrows the search and is tethered to the sister’s prior tech. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—dawn bridge rendezvous—where options are reweighted and cost is felt in the emptied cylinder. Orientation is anchored by word 80, satisfying the 120-word gate. One scaffold loop—“the wild hush”—recycles without payoff, a −0.2 nudge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Scrapyard textures are selective (scrap-pile mountains, ravine harmonics) and filtered through a body-hound’s perceptual bias. Micro-setting tool—the wax-leaf plate—constrains the final decryption beat, earning the 9-gate test. Spatial choreography stays clean across the kennel-workshop-bridge axis. One missing weather cue at the bridge keeps it just short of 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sister’s fate—signalled on page 1. Escalation is single but meaningful: thermal groove transfer that forecloses the “silent cylinder” path and forces tomorrow’s dawn stake-out. Cost is conceptual (hope now externalized) rather than viscerally paid on-page, so 8.8+ is capped. Agency is Elias’s technical tweak, not a moral gamble, keeping tension cerebral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved communication versus permanent loss emerges through the wax-leaf/phonograph doubling, never sermonized. Final image—twin moons over empty cylinder—offers a resonant non-literal answer: technology has transmitted longing, not reunion. Subtext of amber as both prison and passage is subtle and earned. No thematic echo label appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s sensorium; diction (“tinted revelations,” “mechanical language”) mirrors his synesthetic gift. Rhythm tightens under pressure—clipped clauses during thermal transfer—without register drift. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Occasional over-nominalization (“conceptualized vibrations”) slightly dulls immediacy, −0.2.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between longer atmospheric coils and short sensor pings, avoiding template cadence. Figurative layer is disciplined: mixed-metaphor risk (“diving bird” needle) is brief and functional. One paraphrase loop—“the wild hush” repeated identically—costs −0.2. Closure line is clean, with no scaffold. Proofing is immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: battlefield scent-hound retrained as groove-reader; phonograph-as-cryptograph is novel yet internally rigorous. Wax-leaf/auratic technology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in technical exposition is balanced by concrete payoff. Not quite paradigm-shift territory but lingers memorably.</comment>
