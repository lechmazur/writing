<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kenji’s slow-spoken bonsai tutor trait is more label than embodied: his single voiced apology arrives only after 90% of the text, too late to shape prior choices. Interiority drifts into therapeutic abstraction (“emotions have their own magnetic fields”). The 23-year pine linkage to the marriage is clever, yet the emotional cost is asserted, not dramatized. Earned stasis is visible, but only just—hence solid, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the compass re-orients toward open horizon, not Aiko, and Kenji accepts un-sent apology with visible cost (“cerulean regret washing over him”). Causal chain holds—lace pattern → diffuse memory → compass settles → final snip—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Set-up/payoff for compass and 23-year pine is tight; no teleporting props. Single-scene orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Salt-laced air, wet-earth scent, and tide-slap give instant tactile anchor; islet size is never detailed but implied through bonsai scale. Weather remains an active pressure—breeze swings compass needle, tide audible as metronome. Spatial tracking clean: no impossible prop positions. Micro-setting rule met: antique lace and compass function as handled “rooms” that constrain ritual steps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the color of unspoken apologies”—is early and personal. Escalation is textural: each lace-guided pass, each compass wobble, thickens regret until the horizon re-weights it. No external antagonist; pressure is tidal and internal, coherent under chosen lens. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, capping score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bonsai/lace parallel: care without courage equals miniature life. Cerulean regret is returned in final image, re-pricing the compass’s meaning. No moralizing; grandmother’s maxim stays implicit. Ambiguity lingers—he still hasn’t spoken—yet the emotional after-effect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Kenji; perceptual signature filtered through horticultural attention (“each a world unto itself”). Rhythm mimics slow speech—long vowel clusters, comma-anchored pauses—without monotony. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors grounded in island flora and maritime relics. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “salt-laced air carried the scent of wet earth up from the soil that covered the small island” sets smell, scale, isolation). No synonym loops; “cerulean regret” appears only at opening and payoff, earning its repeat. Figurative density peaks in final paragraph but remains coherent. Minor hedge—“he mused”—drops score 0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ghost-ship compass repurposed as emotional lodestone is fresh; lace-as-manual twist avoids cliché. Bonsai-islet after breakup could feel familiar, but specificity of 23-year pine synching to marriage length lifts it. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric instead of confrontational scene—yet coherence rewards the choice. Not quite an “inevitable in hindsight” synthesis, hence below 8.5.</comment>
