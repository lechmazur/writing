<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is continuously embodied in micro-actions—steady hands, calibrated breath crystals, murmured frequencies—so motive and method fuse. No contradictory interiority, but because every beat is filtered through the same single trait, we never feel a split-second doubt that might raise the cost; the absence of visible flaw keeps her just shy of 9-band complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each measured frequency adds density and the clock of “illusions fade to memory” tightens cadence. Closure is a Charged Poise—slide sealed, data saved, meaning made legible—visible cost in the final “quartz hush” that now isolates her. No orientation debt; anchoring crystalline air + circling workstation arrives by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen library is no postcard: breath-crystals form usable time-markers, brass apparatus cools skin, mists outside press solitude. Micro-setting rule satisfied—lantern slide constrains every choice; its glass warms or dims in direct response to her probe. One minor over-lux repetition (“crystalline air” twice) does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue meaning before Great Forgetting—signaled early; each 0.3 % luminosity drop tightens the frame. Escalation is steady loss, not reversal, matching Accumulative lens; final preservation is earned endurance, not luck. Visible price: she accepts eternal vigil inside the sealed chamber—cost made legible in “await the next collection.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: vows → frequencies → data → memory, reweighting love into scientific artifact. No moral spoken; final image of sealed slide quietly asks what remains when feeling is converted to number. Ambiguity lingers: has she saved or sterilized love? That question lands cleanly on prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—numbers, crystals, brass—never slips. Prose rhythm mirrors her pulse: long clauses for calm calibration, two-beat fragments (“Dissolving. Nothing.”) when time narrows. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction precise but never academic-overreach. Earned hush at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic drum; each sentence advances task or cold. Only micro-loop: “luminous vows” appears four times—yet each recurrence tracks brightness drop, so serves pattern. Metaphors (quartz hush, dying star) stay consistent with frozen glass motif; no mixed vehicles. High density, zero scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—cataloguing transcendent love as pure frequency—feels fresh and conceptually committed. Risk: lyric repetition of “frequency X terahertz” could flatten but instead accumulates elegiac urgency. Transformation test fails only if vows were generic; here each hertz is tethered to one mortal promise, so specificity saves it.</comment>
