<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is warm and consistent—“the past speaks in patterns”—but never surprises us; contradictions are announced, not dramatized. The beat where he pockets the locket and vows to “continue her work” is pure summary; we witness no micro-choice that costs him anything. Earned stasis is asserted, not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The closure is a soft reconfiguration: the mailbox opens and the community weeps, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the neighborhood’s self-image. Causality is loose—accumulative anecdotes replace because/therefore linkage—yet the pattern is legible and the cost (shared vulnerability) is felt in the final image. One shard transition (courtyard → library) is cleanly handled under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Vibrant mosaic tiles” and “sandstorm calm” are vivid but decorative; no spatial constraint ever narrows Elias’s options. The courtyard returns as a postcard backdrop for the finale rather than a tool that shapes tactics. Micro-setting (the locket’s weight against skin) does charge the closing image, just clearing the 9+ gate, yet the cap holds because the environment never actively complicates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“prove listening heals”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete loss (time, reputation, safety) is risked or paid. Pressure escalates by accretion of neighbor stories rather than narrowing options; the single micro-turn is the locket popping open, which changes knowledge, not tactics. Visible cost is community catharsis, not protagonist sacrifice; agency stays observational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mailbox archive: collective memory as communal glue. The final image of answered letters avoids overt moralizing; resonance rests in the ribbon that matches the locket, a quiet reweighting. No character voices the thesis aloud, dodging the Echo penalty, yet the insight remains comfortingly tidy rather than unsettling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptions; diction skews literary yet consistent (“discerning curator of forgotten treasures”). Syntax loosens into occasional template cadence (“He… then he…”) but no drumbeat persists. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which is competent but not idiosyncratic enough for top band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with high information density—each neighbor vignette advances pattern. Occasional softening filters (“seemed,” “felt like”) dull one or two peak beats; no mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality. A single paraphrase loop (“stories waiting to be told… stories waiting to be heard”) knocks back from 7.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The “locked mailbox of vanished archivist” is familiar, but the inversion—archive was outbound, not inbound—adds fresh sting. Specificity of Tuesday hymn, elm brick, ribbon match transforms trope into lived ritual. Risk is modest; the piece chooses warmth over formal experimentation, keeping it safely within conventional feel-good territory.</comment>
