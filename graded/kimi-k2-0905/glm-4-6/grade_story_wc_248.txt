<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—guilt over fire vs. need to finish the trail—stays alive in every brush-stroke. Micro-choices (paint the leader’s eyes, burn the treaty) visibly cost her and foreclose return to anonymity. Motive linkage to mother is told, not dramatized, muting causal bite. Still, the “tender volcano” refrain embodies her ambivalence without therapeutic jargon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: burning the restored treaty scatters both archive and guilt, turning past arson into ritual release. Causal chain (fragments → murals → map → cave → burn) is linear, no teleportation. Single-scene orientation is met; mountain shed and waterfall anchor by line 3. The “because” feels accumulative rather than peril-tight, but lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere filters through Elara’s paint-stained fingers—dust, ink, cold waterfall spray—selective and sensory. Cartographer shed, cave table, and linen scraps function as micro-settings that constrain supplies and sequencing. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment mirrors mood yet avoids overt symbolism, earning high-band texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue the forgotten promise”—is signaled early and narrows when she realizes the treaty must be destroyed, not archived, to free it. Escalation is accumulative: each fragment widens knowledge rather than raising external peril. Visible cost appears on the page (tears smudge ink, ashes hit water). Agency is intellectual-artistic rather than survival, fitting lens but capping intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: erasure vs. restoration—libraries burned, portraits defaced, then repainted and released. No moral sermon; the final image (ashes in water) reweights history without dictating meaning. Recurrent eyes/mirror motif accumulates resonance only at closure; earlier mentions feel decorative, preventing 9+. Subtext in mural additions (unbroken rose) is strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice owns a painterly perceptual signature—charcoal under nails, canvases as thinking tools. Syntax modulates from fluid long strokes to short match-strike fragments. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk. Occasional poetic lifts (“volcanic tenderness”) verge on precious but stay character-bound; register stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high information density per line. Figurative layer is thick (volcanic, storm-cloud eyes) yet internally coherent; no mixed metaphors at climax. Minor loop: “paint and perseverance”/“paint and purpose” echo. Closing image is crisp, unscaffolded. One typo: “acntmporary” for “a contemporary” costs a hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of archival mystery with painter-detective who solves by pigment, not cipher. Vandalized self-portrait as map key is genuinely non-obvious. Risk-taking—burning the very document she saved—earns conceptual bite. Familiar “lost civilization” frame is re-animated through tactile restoration process rather than treasure lore.</comment>
