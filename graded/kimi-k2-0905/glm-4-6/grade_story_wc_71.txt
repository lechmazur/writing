<comment>Elias’s “creeping normality noticer” obsession is concrete—his fingers ‘brush the shard,’ he ‘positions the teacup on the roof,’ micro-choices that externalize an interior contradiction between scientific cataloguing and mystical hunger. Interiority is particular: “like a photograph fading in sunlight” is his idiom, never abstract label-speak. The attic renunciation costs him his prior observer distance—the house’s “groan of almost audible pleasure” forecloses future neutrality, visible cost on the page. Flaw: no second character, so status crucible bullet does not apply; headcount stays within default.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the attic placement crystallizes both the house’s awakening and Elias’s forfeiture of detached study—“the structure groaned with an almost audible pleasure” is the exact image where cost becomes undeniable. Accumulative lens holds: each displaced object (teacup, latch, shard) intensifies ambient aliveness until the cadence peaks. Causality never breaks—every migration is witnessed, no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“Tuesday morning on Elm Street”) and re-anchored at Harbor View; no penalty.</comment>

<comment>The orris shard itself functions as micro-setting in the attic climax—its “violet fingerprint scent” and “compressed magnitude of quiet” physically constrain Elias’s stance and trigger the house’s groan, satisfying 9+ gate. Bay-spring macro-setting is filtered through Elias’s bias: salt air, starlit sky, “streetlights blinked on… casting elongated shadows that seemed to bow,” sensory choices that mirror his awestruck narrowing of attention. Spatial choreography is clean—objects migrate room-to-room under his tracking gaze; no floating props. Weather (spring breeze) is causally linked to blossoms opening, reinforcing the breath metaphor.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove houses can be awakened—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when the shard’s hush magnifies perception; the attic placement forecloses his observer neutrality, visible cost. Escalation is accumulative: each displaced object heightens ambient hum until the attic beat delivers the decisive intensification. No coincidence resolves; all pressure is internally generated by Elias’s doctrine. Price is on-page: he leaves “knowing he’d witnessed confirmation” but can no longer remain a passive noticer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sanctification through displacement reweights the boundary between living and non-living. Never stated; instead the teacup on the roof reprises the early image with new charge. Subtext operates in gesture—his fingers ‘brush’ the shard, a silent communion that replaces explanatory monologue. Final image of streetlights “daydreaming” offers conceptual repricing: the whole neighborhood is now potentially awake, moral complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s perceptual signature: “photograph fading in sunlight,” “auditory gold,” “wooden bones” are his metaphors, not authorial intrusion. Psychic distance tightens under pressure—short clause “the world fell silent” mirrors the shard’s compression. No head-hopping; POV modesty observed: he “understood then” is inference, not omniscient leap. Rhythm modulates from languid accumulative cataloguing to the staccato placement triad, mirroring escalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence length, no template cadence. Information density high—one sentence links shard, scent, and cosmic pressure without padding. Metaphors stay coherent: “compressed magnitude of quiet” extends auditory gold without contradiction. Only micro-slip: “drooping shutters” edges toward stock image, but offset by fresh coinages elsewhere; does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Fusion of domestic animism with perfumer’s chemistry feels non-obvious and specific to this narrator’s obsession. Doctrine of displacement is fresh, not a trope shelf. Risky lyric compression taught early (“crept normality noticer’s instinct”) and paid off in final attic groan. If names were swapped, the orris-violet chemistry and bay-spring breathing would collapse—transformation test passed.</comment>
