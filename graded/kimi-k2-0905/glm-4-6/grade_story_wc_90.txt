<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism, lightness-when-happy trait, and archival quest are cleanly anchored; the micro-choice of drawing the crystal from a child’s tear-photo crystallizes her values. Interiority is mostly concrete, but the beat where she “extracts a single thread of light” drifts into abstract summary rather than embodied contradiction under stress. Because the final renunciation (staying aboard to secure the gate) is prepared by earlier self-confrontation beats, the arc earns its stasis, yet the lack of visible physical cost keeps the score shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pacifist refusal → archival method → tear find → stitching → gate opens → chosen guardianship. The Orientation Test is satisfied within 120 words (who/where/when aboard derelict ship). Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she forecloses crossing over, pays with lifelong solitude, and the tear’s warmth transferred to the recording system makes the cost legible. One minor causality bump: “reality began to thin” is declared rather than shown through sensory consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The memory chamber’s cold, the crystalline tear residue, and the metallic groan as dimensions thin supply concrete, POV-filtered details that constrain method and mood. Micro-setting principle met: the archived photographs act as tactile terrain that must be scanned, floated-over, and mined. Spatial choreography stays clean throughout the single-scene window. While broader astropolitics are wisely elided, the ship never fully feels lived-in beyond the archive—no scent of recycled air, no flicker of failing lights—keeping it short of 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open a locked dimension for post-human renewal—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when each stitched pass costs emotional weight. Agency stays continuous: every escalation stems from her tactile choices (float-scan, lift crystal, draw thread, stitch). The visible price—body growing heavier, happiness draining—fulfills cost clarity under causal lens. A sharper tactical adaptation (e.g., a mis-stitch that forces compensatory move) would have pushed this into 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: compassion as practical technology, not abstraction; shadow work reframed as archival love. The shift from “humanity’s failures” to “seeds in fertile ground” reweights the premise without moralizing. Kwan Yin’s tear functions as charged callback—its warmth transferred to the recorder implies future non-human inheritors, a subtle conceptual repricing. Final paragraph’s “final, profound act” skirts thematic echo territory but is saved by concrete image of her returning lightness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is filtered through Elara’s mystic-archivist lens—she sees “microscopic crystalline structures” and feels “ancient power,” never drifting into omniscient exposition. Syntax stays lightly lyrical, matching the ghost-float rhythm, then compresses under stitching pressure. No dialogue to test, so voice distinctiveness relies on interior diction; occasional elevated phrasing (“ghostly resolve,” “immeasurable compassion”) is internally consistent with her mystic training. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene phases—longer sentences for floating search, clipped fragments during stitching. Information density is high; most lines advance goal or atmosphere. Two paraphrase loops (“humanity’s final wars… humanity facing its inevitable twilight”) and one mixed metaphor (“stitch open the barrier”) slightly dull the peak beat; they do not touch closure but keep the score below 8.0. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of archival conservation with Buddhist reliquary myth feels fresh; tear-tracking across decades-old photographs is a specific, non-obvious method. The pacifist-scientist mystic is an unexpected archetype combo whose internal logic holds. Risky choice to end on renunciation rather than crossing the gate pays off via earned stasis. While “last human child” and “recycled ship” are familiar tropes, their recombination through compassionate documentation rather than heroic colonization lifts the piece above template.</comment>
