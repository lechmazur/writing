<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the stars yet choosing earthbound service—are palpable in her micro-gesture of placing the glass; the renunciation costs her the chance to keep the talisman, making the endurance earned. Interiority stays concrete through sea-glass touch and salt-air breath; no stock “epiphany” lines. Only one character on stage, so relationship crucible absent; flaw (patient stillness) directly enables the final gift, not balanced by visible mistake. Meets 9− gate: contradictory in-scene impulse + causal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each return to polishing thickens the “stillness” pattern until the last gleam reweights the stake. Closure image—glass left glowing—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (she relinquishes the object). Orientation clear within 50 words; single scene, no teleport. No causal reversal, but for this lens a decisive cadence shift suffices. Cost legible: “her heart light” signals forfeiture of private consolation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto’s slick curves and jasmine scent constrain her ritual movements; the sea-glass itself functions as micro-setting whose transformation is tracked beat-by-beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys her watcher bias: visual touch, tactile polish, olfactory salt. Spatial choreography holds—kneel, lift, place—no floating props. Weather/moisture directly enable the mist-glow finale. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—share starlight without fire—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens as each polishing rotation trades her private time for public glow. One meaningful deepening: glass shifts from dull shard to “pearl of stillness,” narrowing her option to keep it. Cost visible: relinquishment of the newly precious object. Agency全程 hers; no coincidence. Enough for high band but not 8.8+ because external world response (who receives the light?) remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated image: dull glass → quiet star; no authorial statement required. Final reconfiguration equates “stillness” with luminous service, reweighting earlier orphan loneliness. Subtext in silence: she never speaks, yet choice shouts. Resists moral; ambiguity lingers—will anyone find the glass? Emotional after-effect palpable. No echo lines or final moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature strong: “zephyr bloom,” “pupil dilating in reverence,” syntax lengthens during polish, shortens at release. Free-indirect clean; no filter-verb stacks. Past-tense stable; diction stays within star-watcher lexicon. Rhythm mirrors tide/rotation—varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Lyric elision taught early (“stars she could only watch, never touch”) and paid off. No head-hop; single POV holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density: “coiled like a sleeping serpent” packs place + threat + beauty in five words. No paraphrase loops; each polish stroke adds new sensory angle. Metaphors consistent—sea, sky, breath—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph cuts purposeful. Minor scaffold: “memories resurface” twice in opening; does not obscure causality or dull closure. No artifact in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar orphan-healer trope made specific through gem-craft astronomy and salt-air grotto; “pearl of stillness” concept freshens standard star-quest. Synthesis feels inevitable after first paragraph. Not overtly risky—linear lyrical mini-arc—so no bonus bump, but no derivative deduction either. Detail set could not swap into another tale without loss.</comment>
