<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—guilt, longing, lethal tenderness—are etched into every spectral gesture; the bead’s warmth and the “lovingly venomous” refrain dramatize interior split without therapeutic gloss. The renunciation at the end (she fades, forfeiting reunion) is earned by the chain of past betrayal→debt→repayment traced in the bead’s pulses. Visible cost: his hand passes through hers, her form dissolves, bead clatters—concrete forfeiture legible on page. One sentence drifts toward label-speak (“a promise broken under a blood-red moon”) but the embodied chill/ozone/veil kisses overwhelm it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: bead flare→memory collapse→her vanishing re-weights the orchard’s glow and his future nights. Causal lattice holds—each bead pulse is a because/therefore trigger that tightens recognition until touch is impossible. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“endless night…glass panes frosted”) and never drifts. Cost is visibly felt: the bead’s residual warmth literalizes the price he’ll carry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—silver-bark trunks, luminous pomegranates, ozone scent all channel attention toward the bead-triggered epiphany. Spatial choreography clean: her veil brushes cheek, bead falls to damp earth, he kneels—positions track. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV botanist bias: bark texture, blossom scent, phosphorescent shed prioritized over visual catalog. Final image (orchard humming with echo) reuses prior anchors rather than inventing new scenery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—debt repayment/memory restoration—tightens exactly once: bead flare→memory flood→she vanishes, narrowing future to solitary remembrance. Agency is hers; the final choice to let go is dramatized by her literal fade. Cost is the reunion itself foreclosed, leaving him holding the warmed relic. Coincidence absent; pressure is internal karmic causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of venomous love as immortal debt emerges through bead’s glow rather than exposition; no moralizing line tells reader what to feel. Final image—orchard continuing to hum—offers open-ended resonance: love survives as after-sound, not moral lesson. Ambiguity is purposeful: was repayment worth annihilation? Counter-reading invited. No echo of prompt language or thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic free-indirect stays inside botanist’s perceptual filter—scientific diction (“luminous pomegranates”) collides with lyric fragility (“lace of a bride’s veil torn by time”). No head-hop; ghost focalization is externalized through sensory intrusion (cold kiss, scent) rather than internal leap. Patterned repetition of “lovingly venomous” teaches cadence early and pays off at bead flare. Minor register drift: “susurrus of regret” edges toward purple, but cadence justifies it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses (opening) to staccato gasps (“He gasped, stumbling back”) under escalating pressure. Metaphors stay internally coherent—bead as anchor, love as poison, orchard as resonant chamber—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Final line anchors echo without syntactic scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical greenhouse + spectral debt + botanist POV produces unfamiliar experiential palette. Ghost-bride trope inverted—she seeks repayment, not reunion, and dissolution is victory. Bead as memory-currency feels specific to this world logic. Risk of lyric overload is embraced but controlled by tight causal frame.</comment>
