<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. surrender to the shell—are kept alive in every beat; her trembling chest, bare feet on dew, and micro-choice to “activate” crystals embody the interior war. The arc from quarantined isolation to archivist of grief is credibly earned, propelled by on-page resonance trials that visibly cost her stamina and innocence. Grandmother’s journal functions as lived-in inheritance, not exposition dump, shaping Elenas tactics. Final smile carries Earned Stasis: she accepts perpetual stewardship of ghosts, foreclosing the easier option of forgetting—cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crystal station thickens sensory density and reweights the stake until the garden itself vibrates with archived sorrow. Closure is the Charged Poise image of Elena walking barefoot through standing waves—cost is the tacit promise to tend these ghosts forever. Orientation clean at ~90 words; single transition at “hours passed” is legible. No causal break; “tragic radiance” and “resonance grid” rules stay consistent. Minor slip: late introduction of “silk-textured leaves” feels post-hoc, but does not rupture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Garden is handled as tactile instrument, not postcard: crystals must be spaced among midnight-blue roses whose petals literally tremble in sympathy with memory waves, constraining placement and timing. Dew, velvet petals, and pearlescent shell catch starlight to create micro-setting that charges final dawn image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stone bench to grid perimeter to center. Moisture on leaves reappears as dew on Elenas feet, tying body to ground. World rules (sound = memory interface via calcium chambers) stay consistent without expo-dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elena drown in quarantined grief or master it?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens at each crystal activation. One meaningful deepening: when shell shifts from vague whispers to coherent command, the option to ignore it disappears, forcing public commitment. Cost accrual visible: physical fatigue (dew-kissed bare feet, night-long labor) and emotional toll (chest tightening, ghost walk). Agency is continuous—she chooses grid spacing, activates stations, final promenade—no luck solves the problem. Coincidence absent; escalation strictly via her resonance tuning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory stewardship emerges organically through ritual action; no character sermons. Subtext in shell’s “tragically radiant” timbre implies beauty inseparable from loss, paid off when dawn light hits the same adjective on shell’s surface. Final image of “gardening your ghosts” reweights earlier horticulture details without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: future grief may still overwhelm, but Elena’s stance is crystallized. Avoids tidy maxim; complexity held in standing wave metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>POV remains tight third-person limited to Elena; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is scientized lyric—“melodic frequencies,” “vibrational frequency,” “resonance structures”—yet filtered through sensory body (taste of frosting, soil-smell hands). Syntax mirrors attention: long hypotactic sentences during reflection, fragmentary bursts (“Next.”) under pressure. Psychic distance contracts cleanly from skeptic analysis to embodied tremor. Diction stays within plausible range for a literate inheritor of odd estate; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from languid twilight cadences to staccato activations, supporting nocturnal tempo. High information density: one line often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“velvet petals…absorbing the emotional frequencies”). Metaphors are coherent—sound as light, memory as wave—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances grid or grief. Read-aloud ear test passes: no template cadence. Minor scaffold: “resonance structures” repeated three times in close succession (−0.2), but pattern taught early and serves ritual refrain, so artifact does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—mystical inheritance, grief garden—feels refreshed via acoustics-as-memory science and precise horticultural engineering. Conceptual synthesis of seashell acoustics with standing-wave archiving is non-obvious and specific to this piece. Risk taken in merging hard-science diction with lyric ghost-story pays off without clarity loss. Proximity check: no direct echoes of well-known scenes. Transformation test fails only if relocated to non-garden setting, proving integration. Could use sharper socio-cultural specificity for top band, but originality is solid.</comment>
