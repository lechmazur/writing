<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s obsession with time-dilation is concrete and embodied in the drone-ink ritual; the final micro-choice—accepting transience—earns its poise. Yet interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“he had learned to quiet its noise with silence”) that flattens contradiction. No second character appears, so status crucible is waived; the tracker’s competence is balanced by the ink’s refusal to stay, a credible limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last line reweights the premise—vanishing ink becomes legible time-text—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: because the ink dissolves, Kael must internalize the map, costing him permanence. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. One shard, single POV, default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Wind-carved canyon and eclipse after-image function as micro-setting: the scorched sand supplies the only surface the ink can mark, directly constraining the ritual. Drone’s metallic wings and dissolving oil-sheen provide tactile specificity without catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: Kael kneels, traces, stands; drone hovers, returns. Environment mirrors internal state only through action, not overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode time’s stretch—tightens once: the ink’s acceleration forces Kael to internalize the pattern before total loss. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forfeits external proof, accepting impermanence. Agency is present—he uncorks, traces, smiles—but pressure is situational rather than antagonistic; no second tightening beat. Coincidence (vial half-buried) complicates without resolving, allowable under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: cognition’s rebellion against erasure—beauty resides in disappearance. Subtext lives in gesture: ink fading = memory’s fight for permanence. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing. No motif checklist; the hummingbird and ink recur only as tools, not symbols harvested late.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is tracker-specific—pattern-seeking, wind-attuned. Syntax lengthens then compresses with ink’s lifespan, mirroring tension. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Filter verbs are sparse; diction stays within Kael’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and compressed; sentences carry dual duty—description advances concept. One paraphrase loop (“the ink didn’t dry; instead, it dissolved”) is forgivable. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of eclipse, drone, and vanishing ink feels fresh; not a trope checklist. Conceptual risk—time-dilation as cognitive protest—pays off. Could swap canyon for desert without breaking arc, so not fully irreplaceable, but specificity of tracker’s gaze keeps it above median.</comment>
