<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Margaret’s interiority is vivid—her bewilderment is repeatedly embodied (head-ache, palm-warmth, brightened disquiet). Yet the nonlinear premise keeps her from making consequential choices; instead she “accepts” and “wonders,” so no credible renunciation or tightening is earned. The note she leaves is the only micro-choice, and it merely repeats the prompt phrase rather than revealing a personal cost. Flaw stays minor because the piece is lyric-accumulative, but character agency remains thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Margaret walking away “with the strange joy of someone who had learned to love the spaces between moments” reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt—the curator must now find her own successor—so Earned Stasis is credible. Orientation is waived: deliberate disorientation (inheritance timing, asteroid jump) pays off by teaching the orchard-as-interior-space pattern. One causal slack: why the bathroom triggers breakthroughs is never seeded, a tiny motivation gap that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the pistachio-shell inner curvature becomes the entire astral orchard—an irreplaceable spatial hinge. Sensory selection is POV-driven (iridescent oval, crystalline fruit) and integrates with action (she pockets, re-enters). Museum and bathroom anchors are sketched with minimal but sufficient strokes; the asteroid is lyric, not geographic, so exact spatial tracking is forgone. No environment constrains a final tactic, capping Q3 short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“inherit knowledge without erasing self”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density, not cause: each orchard visit layers more versions of Margaret until identity blurs, a textbook accumulative tightening. Cost is conceptual (loss of linear self) rather than visceral; because no live option is foreclosed on the page, the band stalls just below 7.0. The requirement for one meaningful deepening is met, yet the price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of cataloguing infinity. Subtext sits in the self-writing notes and the orchard of unlived moments; no character lectures us on epistemology. Final image of “loving the spaces between moments” offers a non-literal answer that circles back to the first page without moralizing. One small echo of prompt language (“simply complicated existence itself”) nicks half a point for near-thematic-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is genuinely textured: rhythmic anaphora (“nonlinear inheritance wasn’t about time but about consciousness”) and curated diction (“esoteric artifacts,” “astral orchard”) cohere to a curator’s erudite distance. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is selective (she notes iridescence, not wall color). Experimental compression (“she would inherit it next Tuesday, or perhaps had inherited it last year”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue to test, hence no voice convergence; internal syntax stays stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density is high; most sentences double-duty (e.g.,“Each piece of fruit contained a stolen moment…” advances setting and stakes). Minor loop: “simply complicated” recurs eight times, a touch over-leveraged, but the phrase is motif-coded so penalty stays light (−0.3). No mixed metaphors or scaffold, but the repeated adjective-noun pairing borders on template cadence, preventing 7+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pistachio-shell-as-universe is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of micro-cosmos tropes. Risky nonlinear structure is embraced rather than explained away, and it pays off in closure. Orchard-as-repository-of-narrative-gaps is an ingenious reweighting of “between the first and last page.” Some phrasings flirt with conceptual convenience (“infinite number of their alternate selves”), but the specificity of curator-voice and the self-writing catalogue notes keep it from feeling template.</comment>
