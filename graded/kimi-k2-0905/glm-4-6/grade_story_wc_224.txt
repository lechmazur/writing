<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—"chest tightening painfully," fingers brushing feather/stone—yet the arc is almost pure reflection; no second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The buried-talent reawakening is tracked through sensorial micro-choices (touching feather, watching mirror), but the decisive “crossing” is still interior and forecast rather than enacted, muting the cost visibility needed for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: hand on silver mirror, thunder inside ready for release—cost legible as possible never-return. Lens = Accumulative/Textural: cadence of nightly substitution, growing seed-reality, map of “state of being.” Orientation anchored by ~80 w (“deepest vaults… mountain”)—passes test. One minor causality gap: how the feather absorbed stone power is asserted, not dramatized, but doesn’t rupture pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bookstore-mountain is living, corridors breathe, shelves shuffle texts toward her—environment literally guides choices. Micro-setting objects—mercury-glass mirror, obsidian stone, feather—constrain tactics and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: metallic air, velvet shadows, feather texture against skin. Minor overglow: “scent of aged paper mixed with something metallic and eternal” edges toward abstraction but fits POV’s synesthetic mysticism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—substitute unendurable memories with a walkable home-reality—signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each seeding intensifies the thunder inside, shelves conspire, map shifts to “state of being,” foreclosing return. Cost is felt (physical drain, growing irreversibility) but not yet concrete—loss still prospective. Meets 600-word scale; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges as “home is not place but a buried talent for world-creation.” Final image of thunder poised for release offers conceptual repricing: the price of making home may be exile from origin-reality. Avoids overt moral; ambiguity lingers. Subtext carried in tactile objects and mirror imagery rather than statement. Feather/stone polarity quietly reweights “soft conduit vs. hard knowledge” without说教.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays faithful to seer’s synesthetic lens: “silver distorted her reflection like water disturbed by an unseen hand.” Rhythm swells/contracts with ritual repetition, mirroring nightly obsession. No dialogue, so voice distinctness measured through diction alone—passes. Compressed elision (“she would deliberately substitute reality…”) is taught early and paid off in closure. Almost no scaffold; syntactic variety supports incantatory momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Sentences perform double duty: “obsidian, inscribed with symbols that seemed to shift when she wasn’t looking” seeds both world-rule and character paranoia. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—mercury, mirror, seed, thunder—tight to theme; no mixed metaphors. High information-to-word ratio; near-zero paraphrase loops. Minor register spike: “concepts in the soil of possibility” is borderline grandiloquent yet fits lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Fantasy trope quartet—mirror, obsidian relic, living library, world-seeding—is fused through haptic obsessions and geologic scale: mountain-bookstore as organism. Seer’s talent is not prophetic sight but generative horticulture—fresh inflection. Feathers as conduit avoids wand cliché. Risk: lyric accumulation could swamp clarity, yet pattern holds to resonant payoff. Specificity of “mercury-glass” as material and metaphor lifts the frame above generic portal fantasy.</comment>
