<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scholar’s interior contradiction—yearning for answers while fearing their silence—is dramatized through micro-choices (whispering “Growth,” then “Silence”). His palm against the glass and the tremor-free final clasp embody embodied cost; the refusal to publish or share is Earned Stasis with felt weight. Flaw: no secondary pressure, so status dynamics untested; still, his solitary arc satisfies single-POV demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: “a fragile testament” reweights the premise under Accumulative lens—density of quiet accumulates until the final image. Causality holds: crystal’s remembered chimes narrow his options to witness, not explain. Cost is legible in the hush he now carries. Orientation anchors by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the cascade of collapsing sounds forecloses further inquiry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The crystal operates as micro-setting; its cool facets and internal luminescence constrain his final choice to cradle rather than dissect. Library’s “heights lost in suspended hush” mirrors interior state, charging the final image. Dawn light evolves from “first light finger the spines” to “deepening dawn,” tracking time without exposition. Spatial choreography clean: palm on glass → table → podium → clasp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to decode the pattern of growth”—tightens when the crystal reveals geometry of decay; agency drives the test words. Visible price: he forfeits scholarly mastery for custodial witness. Under Accumulative lens, density of silence intensifies; no coincidence. One deepening: realization that pattern is loss, not expansion. Cost legible: he accepts lifelong burden of unspoken testimony.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge’s collapse into witness. Motif of “fractured sequences” reframes growth as erosion; no moral stated. Final image reweights silence from absence to sacred relic. Ambiguity lingers: is preservation or paralysis? Concrete emotional after-effect: reader feels hush settle like dust. Avoids thematic echo; no character sermonizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: reticent scholar compresses diction (“He cleared his throat, the sound barely a rustle”) yet opens to lyric interiority (“ghost choir”). Syntax mirrors hesitation—clause-heavy until the final short clause “Its work was done.” No head-hop; POV stable. Filter verbs minimal; “seemed to remember” is earned inference. Rhythm breathes with the dawn light cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: “salvaged from the library’s grand fixture before it was disassembled for scrap” supplies history and scarcity in one line. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or sound. Metaphors precise: “first light finger the spines” (synesthetic), “crystal had testified” (organic personification). No mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines echo glass/hush without repetition. Read-aloud rhythm varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—“world that had run out of things to say”—is fresh synthesis of linguicide and elegy. Crystal as sonic memory vault reconfigures familiar apocalypse into intimate acoustic archaeology. Risk of lyric quietude paid off: final image crystallizes rather than explains. Specificity: “last dictionary printed” dates the silence; chandelier scrap grounds the fantastical. Transformation test fails if any element swapped; hence, high originality.</comment>
