<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fingers “know the rhythm,” the atlas page’s salt-softened edges felt in pocket—but the shift from grief to acceptance is compressed into a single lyrical pulse rather than dramatized micro-choices. Flaw: the crucial “smile” arrives without embodied contradiction or visible cost, tilting the arc toward epiphany rather than earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atlas page becomes “blueprint for what could be reborn,” reweighting loss into motion. Causal chain holds: tapping consoles → tide data → coastline ghost-image → Elias walks out, tide licking ankles. Cost is felt in the station’s sighing release and the pocketed page’s soft crumble—implicit but legible. Minor drift: “paths disappeared because they were never meant to last” edges toward thematic overtell, yet it is anchored in the console’s stuttering re-patterning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sea-level station as micro-setting constrains every move: rusted console, salt-fried parchment, groaning metal bones. The atlas page itself functions as portable shoreline, its tear-patterns aligning with tide timings—object-as-landscape that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Elias notices corrosion before sky, data before danger. No orientation debt; who/where/when clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens when console numbers stutter into coastline shapes, forcing Elias to re-price memory itself. Escalation is textural: density of salt, rust, and rhythm accumulates until the atlas folds into blueprint. One visible cost: the station’s creak shifts from dying-whale groan to release-sigh, audible price of letting go. Agency is contemplative but active—three final taps = decision to walk—consistent with situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tidal logic rather than thesis: disappearance ≠ erasure but phase-shift (coral calcium → seabed foundation). Subtext resides in tactile silence—no dialogue, only metal creaks and finger taps—inviting reader to hear loss as transmutation. Final image of pocketed atlas reweights earlier grief into mobile cartography of possibility. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “salt and possibility.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: precision “0.03 m above datum” fused with whale-death metaphor. Rhythm mirrors tide—long sentences swell, fragments ebb. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on internal cadence and it holds. Filter verbs (“felt,” “sounded”) are purposeful, aligning with Elias’s data-tuned sensorium. Compression under stress (“three slow taps”) crystallizes without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“atlas edges curled like salt-fried parchment” is specific, not decorative. Opening and closing lines echo station heartbeat, creating frame-rhythm. Micro-slip: “numbers flickering…meaningless” borders abstract tell, but immediately grounded in finger-tap response. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of climate-science granularity with mythic tide-memory feels fresh; avoids standard eco-doom tally. Atlas page as living tide-map is unforeseen yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric contemplation in lieu of plot, but risk serves compression and closure. Specificity of coral calcium becoming “foundation of something new” rescues metaphor from generality.</comment>
