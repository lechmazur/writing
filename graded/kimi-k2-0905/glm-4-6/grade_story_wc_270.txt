<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maeva’s insurgent fire is credible for 73, her telepathy grounded in tactile fern-contact, and her final glyph-tracing act carries visible cost as traditions rupture around her. Interiority stays concrete (“symbols danced before her tired eyes”) and her endurance reframes elder strength without cliché. The absence of on-page opposition or relationship crucible keeps her just shy of 8-band complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: plant memory → kite discovery → glyph decoding → amber rupture → hybrid flora. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the embryo’s release reweights destiny rules and the valley itself pays ecological cost. One soft teleport—the kite appears “near the springs’ edge” without prior spatial cue—nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Volcanic mist, geothermal vents, and fern-filtered telepathy anchor who-where-when within 50 words; the hot-spring caldera later constrains her descent and supplies the embryo’s hiding place. Micro-setting (palm-sized amber under boiling water) charges the final image. Occasional atmospheric shorthand (“otherworldly vigor”) slightly undershoots 9-band specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free destiny versus implanted fate—tightens once when the glyphs reveal twin futures; the amber crack is the irreversible turn that forecloses tradition-as-prison. Cost is legible: ancestral seal broken, ecosystem mutates, Maeva accepts unforeseeable hybrids. Pressure stays causal under the lens; no escalation dip.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges through living imagery (hybrid plants sprouting) rather than thesis statement; the kite script functions as subtextual key, not allegory. Final image of “ancient roots” adapting avoids moralizing and invites lingering ambiguity about progress versus loss. One near-platitude (“predetermined by those who could only control the present”) slightly softens 9-range punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maeva’s geriatric perceptual signature: slanted light on parchment, knee ache on basalt, synesthetic “plant song.” No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates from long inhalations of description to staccato glyph tracing, supporting tension arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense: one sentence often delivers setting cue + emotional tilt + plot pivot. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; volcanic and vegetal imagery stays coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“earth’s heated womb”) flirts with register drift but remains anchored in mythic tone she would use.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic geriatric insurgent decoding a kite to crack destiny-amber inside a volcano-spring. The hybrid plant payoff retroactively justifies the botanic telepathy rule. While “rebel elder” and “ancient McGuffin” are familiar tropes, their convergence here feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Slight risk hedge in keeping New Regime off-page prevents full 8.5+ boldness.</comment>
