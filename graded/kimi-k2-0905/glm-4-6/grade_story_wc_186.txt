<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—bare feet reading vibrations, retrocognitive flashes of ancient hands—but his contradictory impulses (restore order vs. surrender to cosmic accident) are stated more than dramatized. The one micro-choice—turning the focusing ring—feels singular; we don’t see earlier failed attempts or visible trade-offs that would foreclose alternatives. Earned stasis is present: he accepts the cracked prism as amplifier, but the cost is lyrical assertion rather than embodied consequence. Still, his perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the beam’s new spectrum reweights “coincidence” into cosmic pattern, with the cracked prism itself as visible price. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; tension tightens through density of starlight + silence rather than option restriction. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (spiral stairs, glass hum). The lens holds from first paragraph to last, but the final cost is more luminous assertion than visceral loss, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glass pavilion functions as both environment and instrument: its hum modulates with wind pressure, its facets dictate where Kaelen places fingers. Moonlight-into-rainbow is specific physics; “shard of hush” acts as micro-setting lodged inside the crystal, constraining the final amplification. Spatial choreography is clean—spiral ascent, summit housing, turning ring—every move tactile. The tower’s ruined grandeur is filtered through Kaelen’s astronomer-custodian lens, never touristy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove meaning inside ruin—is declared early and tightened when the shard must be coaxed to amplify rather than shatter. Escalation is accretive: each celestial alignment increases chance of dispersal; the humming pavilion rises in pitch, audible pressure. Agency is present—Kaelen rotates the ring—but the decisive turn is interior (accept imperfection) more than external risk. Cost is conceptual: silence converted to light; felt but not bodily, capping climb just below the 8.8 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from refraction metaphor: brokenness as amplifier of pattern. No moral is stated; the final image of sunrise intersecting engineered spectrum reweights “coincidence” without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—fingers tracing cracks, pavilion key-change—rather than exposition. The notion that ruin can store hush and then release it as power offers genuine complexity, resisting tidy uplift or despair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person poetic texture sustains glass-music consonance—“crystalline structure,” “fractured rainbows”—without losing clarity. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is sensory-physical (“bare feet knowing every vibration”). Psychic distance tightens under star-strike: diction compresses to fragment shards, hush, beam. Rhythm mirrors pavilion hum, sentences lengthening then snapping short at climax. Voice stays custodian-astronomer precise, never drifting into epic omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but information-dense; each sentence layers astronomy, tactile motion, and memory flash. Metaphors are coherent—light as audible hush—never mixed. Minor scaffold: “three years of observations” repeats; “pattern” over-used near end, but loops do not infect the closure beat. Opening and closing lines are strong image-anchors; no paraphrase loops in final third. High read-aloud rhythm with purposeful paragraph variegation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse beacon restoration is familiar SF bones, yet the “shard of hush” as stored apocalypse silence is fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Retrocognition serves theme rather than gadget, letting history refract through cracked glass. Risk lies in lyric compression—success depends on reader accepting cosmic pattern as payoff—but execution commits fully, no safety hedge. Specificity of star-path math and pavilion acoustics keeps concept grounded.</comment>
