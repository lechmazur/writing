<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The warden’s contradictory impulses—guard versus resurrector—are alive in every beat: the sip of liqueur that both burns and comforts, the photo laid down as both offering and trap. His embodied emotion (“burning a precise, humane line”) is character-specific, not diagnostic. The final renunciation—turning away after charging the night with memory—carries visible cost under the Accumulative lens. Interiority stays concrete; no stock phrasing or safety-hedged morality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the photographs as fallen stars crystallize the new boundary between drowned past and tellable future; cost is the sleepless burden he chooses to carry. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each placed photo tightens the town’s resurrection-call rather than forcing external plot turns. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“midnight ridgeway”). No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights all prior material under the inferred Accumulative drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The reservoir-as-mirror, the gravel’s “dusty hush,” the sapphire label glowing at dusk—each sensory hit is filtered through the warden’s vigilance and memory, never touristic. Micro-setting triumph: the flask and photographs function as portable landmarks that constrain where he walks and what he relinquishs. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track boots, hand, wall, waterline, final placement. Environment charges the final image—the silence after the chime is the setting speaking back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the town be kept “drowned” or must it be spoken—signaled in first paragraph. One meaningful tightening: the third photo (his own child-hand) forces the recognition that erasure is impossible; option narrows from “expunge” to “guard-and-tell.” Cost is the perpetual vigilance he embraces in the mirrored hush. Agency remains observational yet decisive under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory cannot be flooded, only re-storied. The sapphire label’s color migrates from flask to tavern sign, reweighting “Resurfacing” from warning to invitation. Subtext in gesture—laying the photo, turning away—carries the moral calculus instead of exposition. Final image of “stars fallen to earth” offers resonant non-literal answer: stories are constellations we consent to guard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains a perceptual signature of listening silence and bruised light; diction (“tinsel song,” “precise, humane line”) stays within warden’s poetic-technical lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long tidal sentences for patrol, curt clauses at placement beats. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Free indirect slips are clean: “his duty felt heavier” is internal sensation, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“the aroma of anise and regret rising in the still air”). No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—reservoir as bruised moon, photos as fallen stars—without mixed logic. Zero scaffolding; each paragraph advances placement or memory. Closure line breathes cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Flooded-town trope is refreshed through the warden’s inverse mission: not to keep water out but to keep memory submerged until he chooses release. Photographs as resurrection breadcrumbs invert usual ghost-town elegy into forward-telling ritual. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: stillness itself becomes escalating pressure. Specific detail (sapphire label’s color migration) prevents swapability with any drowned-town tale.</comment>
