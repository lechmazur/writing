<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The tuner’s motivation—restore balance via sound—stays abstract; no interior contradiction or embodied cost complicates his march. He is more mythic device than psyche, so the “wild hush” payoff feels given, not earned. Still, his unwavering gait and the town’s concrete reactions supply a minimal arc of change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each footfall layers resonance until the final town-breath reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—archway blazing, cobblestones humming—visible cost is the tuner’s exit and the town’s new, fragile song. Orientation is swift; only the late-first mention of “collapse” is a slight telegraph, not a breach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cobblestones, archway sigils, and the fork itself act as micro-settings that constrain every beat; removing any would break the sonic mechanics. Sensory selection is urgent—glow, pulse, echo—never tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is pristine; no impossible positions or drifting geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—town revival—tightens through sonic density; each new resonance forecloses the option of remaining ghosted. Cost is legible: cracked windowpane, smoking chimney, the tuner’s solitary departure. Agency is accumulative rather than decisive, fitting the lens; still, escalation feels inevitable rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of acoustic restoration emerges through concrete sonic acts; no character mouths “balance” as thesis. Final image reweights the premise: the fork falls silent, now vessel for the town’s song—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost. Ambiguity lingers—will the song hold?—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, incantatory cadence that mirrors tuning. Diction stays within the tuner’s quasi-timeless lexicon; no head-hop. Compression—“infinitely patient grace,” “wild hush”—is patterned early and pays off in the final hush. Syntax varies to breathe with each new resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary, paragraphs pulse. Information density high: one line often layers sensory, causal, and metaphoric work. Figurative language is coherent—sound as thread, light as memory—no mixed metaphors. Minor template cadence in “He…then he…” but it serves ritual momentum, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The sonic resurrection of a ghost town via footfall tuning is a fresh synthesis; trope of healer-mage is re-anchored in acoustic mechanics rather than spellcraft. Specificity—ebony fork drinking light, sigils humming—prevents generic fantasy glaze. Risk lies in near-allegory, but concrete sensory grounding keeps it from abstraction.</comment>
