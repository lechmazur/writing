<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. wonder-struck child—surfaces early and tightens at the mushroom. The decision to stay and map “broken constellations” is the only path her twin drives allow, so the cost feels inevitable. One slip: “chronically curious” is asserted twice rather than dramatized in gesture, a micro-label—still, embodied urgency in kneeling/thermos/hand on glass keeps her above stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the greenhouse becomes a porous membrane, her lifespan its toll, reweighting every prior folkloric rule. Causal lattice holds—light-through-wreck pattern → map → memory return → acceptance of thinning veil—each beat because/therefore. Orientation anchor (sunk orchard) planted in first 60 words, no debt. Cost is legible: “protective field weakens with age” = irreversible biological tariff paid forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse dome and wreck-mast shadows are returned to twice, each time reframing tactical options (how light hits glass dictates which rune she sketches). Mineral crust and sea-spray residue are tactile constraints on fingertip and notebook. Spatial choreography stays crisp—boots on gravel, knees at rim, thermos set down—so the body functions as micro-setting. Final image of “decades folding” is charged by the same water surface introduced in para 1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover missing three days—declared by line 6 and tightened only once, but decisively: knowledge return forces lifelong vocation to mutate into guardianship. Agency is attention/notation rather than external victory; nevertheless it forecloses retirement or denial. Cost (“your protective field weakens”) is felt, not abstract. No reversal, yet because/therefore escalation suffices under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as ecological symbiosis—emerges through mushroom–glass–wreck constellation rather than statement. Subtextual hinge: the beings need her aging to thin the veil, turning her lifelong expertise into terminal service. No tidy moral; ambiguity whether this symbiosis is parasitic or sacred lingers. Final “discoveries yet to come” avoids sermon yet lets dread seep in.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice fuses scientific precision (“mycological chronophysics”) with incantatory cadence; both registers owned by same obsessive observer. Free-indirect skips stay clean (“she would have dismissed…”) and align with her professional hedging. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses at bubble/ revelation, mirroring tachycardia under wonder. No head-hop; single POV holds with confident perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “glass fractured into something resembling ancient star charts” packs visual, tactile, mythic data in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new angle on light-water-mushroom triad. One near-purple patch—“decades later…where morning and evening can occupy the same moment”—but pattern is taught early and pays off, so forgiven. Final line cadence echoes opening boots-on-gravel crunch, giving circular music.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fairy-ring-as-chronal-wound and shipwreck-constellation map synthesize mycology, maritime decay, and astrophysics into an image set I haven’t seen conjoined before. The idea that folklorists are unpaid border-patrol for dimensional leakage is fresh and logically extended: her life-force is literally the toll. Risk in collapsing time inside a parenthetical—decades later happening now—could have misfired, but here it crystallizes theme. Specificity of Mercer family name, chlorine-apple memory, mineral-filmed glass make the concept irreproducibly this-story.</comment>
