<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation is evocatively fused to his grief, giving every beat of ash-handling bodily stakes; the “quiet ache of missing” is shown through trembling fingers, shallow breath, the dropped shard. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One contradiction—he claims charlatanism yet never acts from self-interest—remains undeveloped, muting full complexity. The final caress and whisper earn a credibly costly endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer (rocking chair fade, ash grain, porcelain gleam) thickens until the mask glow re-weights the stake. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the vanishing point recedes, the mask holds, Elias remains altered. Cost is felt in the single dropped shard and the gallery’s exhale. Minor slack: “incomplete information” method is named late and never operationalized, a soft set-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Gallery is sketched with economy—sloping floor, white mist, pedestal—yet every prop obliges Elias’s posture and gaze. The rocking chair’s dying rhythm doubles as clock and heartbeat, constraining tempo. Ash dust becomes atmosphere, literally coating the air and mask. Spatial logic holds across kneel, reach, dropped shard; no clutter, no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trap the “fleeting emotion” before gallery dissolves—signals early and tightens as each ash grain falls. No antagonist needed: pressure is entropic, the vanishing point’s threat of erasure. One deepening: the dropped shard proves fragility can still bite after transformation. Cost is legible in the lost shard and the smile that knows the mask could shatter tomorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of broken→bound, scatter→gather, lie→truth without sermon. The mask’s glow re-prices “safety” as an illusion that must be replaced by acceptance of breakage. No moralizing final line; “I see you” is address, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is the mask memorial or self-portrait?—a productive counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “dust and regret” smelled, ash “familiar in his palm,” gallery exhales. Syntax elongates then compresses to mimic rocking-chair decrescendo. No dialogue, so voice purity rests in diction—no POV leakage, no register drift. Velvet pouch, porcelain wing, charcoal dust: nouns carry tactile idiolect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, image-dense; every sentence advances texture or stakes. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor density spike—“shattered porcelain shards, each fragment sharp enough to cut, yet delicate as butterfly wings”—but the dual image is paid off when the shard actually falls. Final paragraph breathes cleanly to single-line whisper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Occupation “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” is fresh world-building; coupling it with grief-craft gives conceptual lift. Vanishing-point gallery feels like Borges-lite, but the ash-binding ritual re-roots it in Elias’s specific loss. Risk taken: lyrical accumulation over causal plot, yet coherence holds. Could swap porcelain for glass without breaking arc, so irreplaceability is partial.</comment>
