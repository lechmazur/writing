<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Finn’s interiority is vivid—his narrating-to-the-void habit externalizes thought without diagnos-tic label-speak. The bookmark as talisman anchors contradictory impulses: preservation vs. release. The renunciation of the vase for the teardrop is earned, but the “thawing heart” epiphany is rushed; one more micro-choice under pressure would have sealed the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bookmark fused in cooled cobalt glass reweights the premise—safety zone becomes scar. Under Accumulative lens the密度 increases by returning images—icicle drip, steam hiss, glass fracture—each beat re-prices the thaw metaphor. Causality holds: abandonment of vase → teardrop decision → cost sealed in scar. Orientation clean by sentence 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Abandoned floodgate control room is not postcard; its rusted console and scorpions of rust constrain stance—Finn’s torch is the only live valve. Micro-setting rule: the bookmark becomes portable “control panel” for memory. Cobalt glass color choice is directly shaped by glacial light through dirty window. Spatial choreography holds across kneel-plunge-press sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—craft an object that holds both freeze and thaw—signalled at bookmark crease. One meaningful tightening: abandoning the planned vase when icicle image reframes purpose; this narrows options to single teardrop. Cost visible on page: scarred bookmark imprisoned forever—no reversal. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image set—ice drip, steam, fracture, scar—never sermonized. Thawing heart rendered as material contradiction: cold cobalt glass holding warm leather memory. Final reconfiguration invites counter-reading: is scar safety or new imprisonment? Resonance earned through particulate glass imagery, not abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is contemplative-lively hybrid: ornate diction (“nascent world”) yet rhythmic self-narration mimics craftsman’s patter. Perceptual signature distinct—glass seen as light-capture vessel, rust as scorpion. No filter-verb stacks; psych distance tight in torch beats, widens during steam hiss. Dialogue absent by design; voice sustains monologue without drumbeat syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear varied: long breathy sentences for melt, staccato for shock. Information density high—“cracked leather bookmark” does triple duty: tactile, symbolic, plot device. One mixed metaphor: “weighty lightness” repeated but justified as thematic oxymoron. Zero loops, no scaffold. Final line recharges “winter’s snow” motif without cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: glassblower monologue in derelict flood-control station literalizes “emotional thaw” as glass physics. Bookmark-as-scar transforms familiar memento into irreversible fracture. Risk—lyric address to empty room—pays off by making absence the audience. Could edge higher if thaw concept carried one more tactile reversal.</comment>
