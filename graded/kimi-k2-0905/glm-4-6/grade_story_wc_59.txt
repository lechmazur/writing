<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s longing is vivid—grease-stained robes, trembling hands cradling the egg—but interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“What if they meant to die beautifully?”) that tells us the stakes rather than dramatizing a fresh contradiction. The final smile-and-fall registers as earned renunciation, yet the micro-choice that commits him (placing the egg in the coil) is summarized, not felt in the body. Still, the singular obsession holds and the cost is legible, satisfying the 9− quick test boundary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands: palace falls, bird born, Kael’s death-price paid—an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal chain is thin (why does copper-wire + prism = resurrection?) but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each gear-hum intensifies until the stalactites snap, tightening the cadence toward collapse. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the lyric repetitions (“quaking reverie,” “beautifully painful”) function as pattern-break rather than redundancy. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The suspended palace is not postcard backdrop; its vibrating crystal floor and groaning anchors physically constrain Kael’s every move and finally kill him. Micro-setting works—the egg’s obsidian surface mirrors the cavern darkness he has never escaped, charging the final burst of light. Sensory selection stays tight to POV: grease, dust, gear-hum, never tourist-catalog. Environment shapes tactics and final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore organic beauty or concede to iron permanence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through escalating gear-screams that foreclose retreat. No antagonist needed; the palace itself applies coherent pressure. The decisive turn (cracking the egg) is Kael’s agency with irreversible cost: his own death. Price is visible on-page (“palace plummeted”), though the causal escalation between assembly and cosmic rebirth is slightly elided.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: survival at the price of beauty is no survival at all. Subtext lives in gesture—frayed prince caressing an egg older than his dynasty—rather than explicit thesis. Final image reweights every prior gear as a tombstone now cracked open by song. The ambiguity (“world was beautiful again” seen only in imagination) invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is saturated with mechanical diction (“symphony of useless precision”) that contrasts the bird’s later silence. Rhythm modulates: longer hymnic clauses build to staccato sparks (“copper wires sparked, the prism fractured”). No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Patterned lyric repetition is taught early and pays off in final cadence, keeping elision legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong nouns/verbs (“stalactite anchors snapped”) carry momentum; only minor scaffold (“quaking reverie” repeated thrice). One paraphrase loop (“beautifully painful / painfully sweet”) survives cut-test. Mixed metaphors avoided; physical logic consistent. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful. Final third free of artifacts, preserving 9-band eligibility elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Familiar “last seed of lost nature” trope is refreshed by clockwork cavern and prince-as-tinkerer, grounding myth in tactile grease and copper coils. Specificity—egg etched with winds he has never breathed—makes the abstraction felt. Risky collapse-of-world ending is earned because the palace’s every groan foreshadows it. Not radically new, but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
