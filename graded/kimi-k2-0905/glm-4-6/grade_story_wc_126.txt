<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid—“the hush unbearable, not absence of sound but of purpose”—but her contradictory impulses stay mostly in reflective summary rather than in-scene collision. The violin/bowl micro-choices are present yet feel predetermined by poetic design, not flaw-driven risk; the “tear that is not sad” is a performed epiphany rather than an embodied cost. A credible renunciation is implied, but the path feels lyrically pre-ordained, so the final stance lacks a palpable fork not taken. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and consistent, meriting high-band proximity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer thickens the chronic hush until the final image reweights it as canvas, not void. Orientation is secure within 60 words; the greenhouse, shipwrecks, and orchard are anchored before music begins. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “I had to become its next note” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. The slight reserve: the bowl’s tremor is described rather than tactically tested, so the Decisive Change is more symbolic than material—still, it satisfies the 9− band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fractured glass dome, damp boards, and bronze bowl constrain stance—Lyra must play kneeling, ear to metal—while the charred soil and sapling supply the final recharged image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: acoustic detail dominates, visual color enters only at sunset. Spatial choreography is clean: violin set aside, bowl lifted, walk to edge tracked without drift. The shipwrecks function as metaphorical elders yet remain spatially fixed, satisfying the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transform the chronic hush from void to canvas—is signaled early and deepens through each musical iteration. Escalation is textural: each note thickens the silence until the sapling’s unfurling reweights the stake. Cost is legible: bleeding fingers, tear, and the final bow-lowering show price paid. A sharper tactical loss—e.g., a melody permanently abandoned—would have pushed this into 8.8+ terrain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shifting resonance of silence: from grief-ash to creative ground. The bonfire-story tradition is interleaved as method rather than preached as moral; the final whispered “The song continues” is image, not thesis. Subtext is carried by bowl vibration and leaf tremble, avoiding abstract assertion. The only near-tell is “beauty of imperfection,” but it is immediately grounded in sapling sight, so the resonance lingers clean.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lyra’s acoustic perception; no filter-verb clusters dilute immediacy. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo paragraphs yield to single-sentence diminuendos—without drum-beat monotony. Diction remains within a rural violinist’s lexicon; “mendicant’s bowl,” “chronic hush,” and “echo-harbor” feel coinages organic to her world. The closing image of amber light on fractured glass is a controlled psychic-distance pull-back that serves cadence, not POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the wood beneath her feet still damp from the evening mist” seeds both sensorial ground and later bowl resonance. Metaphors are few but precise: shipwrecks as “broken elders” concisely elders the world. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each clause advances image or pressure. A single soft spot—“the grace of things left undone” edges toward maxim—yet its brevity keeps purple risk minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The post-burn orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is a fresh synthesis of eco-SF and magical realism; the acoustic violinist as silence-conjurer feels non-obvious. Risk is taken in making silence itself the antagonist, yet the piece commits fully rather than retreating to noisy spectacle. The transformation of mendicant bowl into resonating chamber grows inevitable in hindsight. Slight deduction for echo of familiar eco-grief motifs, but specificity of sensory method keeps it above median.</comment>
