<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s obsessive interiority is rendered in concrete, body-level detail (prism vibration up the arm, forehead pressed to quartz). The contradiction between scholarly detachment and raw need is kept alive in-scene; the final “truthful lie” renunciation is earned by the prior sensory build. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived. Micro-choices (raising prism, palm on hood) visibly enact the hierarchy: proof > personal cost. Flaw: motivation stated early but never seriously tested or doubted; no visible mistake or blind-spot compounds—cost is atmospheric, not character-forced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the prism dulled, frost melted, but Elias’s stance is crystallized—he forfeits external proof for internal certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost pattern adds density until the hush becomes tactile, then evaporates, re-weighting the premise. Cost is legible in the final image (“battlefield of yesterday’s peace”). Orientation anchored by line 5; no teleporting props. Minor elasticity: “truthful lies” thesis is asserted more than dramatized, but it reconfigures meaning at the end, satisfying CR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz arbor functions as micro-setting: crystalline supports literally vibrate under Elias’s touch, constraining his barefoot grounding and amplifying sensory input. Mist and frost are not backdrop but active media—mist clings “like a shroud,” frost patterns are the canvas for communion. Car window becomes the pivotal environment-in-miniature; its fern-ice is handled, thawed, and re-weighted. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile > visual, matching mystic’s priorities. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography holds from arbor to hood-touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotions—tightens through accumulating sensory evidence rather than external opposition. Pressure escalates via density: each frost stanza adds emotional cargo until the hush peaks, then dissolves, forcing Elias to accept unverifiable certainty. No antagonist needed; the conflict is epistemic. Visible price: prism warms and reverts to “mundane glass,” dramatizing the forfeiture of repeatable proof. Slight reservation: escalation is atmospheric, not tactical—one sustained crescendo rather than forked choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: the impossibility of evidencing interior resonance is lived, not lectured. “Truthful lies” motif ripens in the final paragraph—Elias will now narrate certainties he cannot show, a conceptual repricing with social cost (madness or guru status implied). Frost patterns as “long-unread poem” reconfigures meaning from décor to archive. No moral sermon; the ambiguity between proof and projection is preserved. Minor echo of “objects absorb emotions” thesis-statement early, but it is quickly embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “each crystalline support humming with a patience that was almost tactile” is idiosyncratic, not generic. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences during immersion, clipped finality when spell breaks (“He pocketed the prism”). No head-hopping; prism warmth is felt only through his hand. Diction stays within mystic register without thesaurus drift. Free indirect slips are clean: “the narratives he extracted would be his own constructions” maintains ironic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; figurative layers serve hush-building rather than ornament for its own sake. No template cadence or synonym loops; each metaphor extends the conceit (frost as stanza, battlefield). Filter-verb count low; perception rendered directly (“prism cold against fingertips”). One paraphrase risk: “patience that was almost tactile / almost impossible” could compress, but cadence supports breathlessness. Final line returns to concrete image, avoiding abstract summary. Copy-clean; no tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: frost on windshield as emotional archive is non-obvious and fully committed to. Prism as translator-device avoids generic crystal trope by its very muteness at climax. Conceptual risk—quiet ending with no data—pays off by reweighting proof itself. Stakes stay intimate, resisting inflation to cosmic. Specificity of “fern-like ice” and “quartz arbor” anchors universals. Transformation test: story collapses if windshield swapped to mirror or lake. Near-establishment of new mini-genre: mystic epistemology flash.</comment>
