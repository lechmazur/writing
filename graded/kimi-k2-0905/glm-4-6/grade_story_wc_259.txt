<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The historian’s lifelong hunger for forbidden knowledge is stated early and re-iterated, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“joy surged…anguish coiled”) rather than dramatized in a single, embodied beat. The climactic “pattern-breaking” dance is a decisive action tied to her motive, yet the prior failures of other historians are told, not shown, so the personal cost feels second-hand. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; micro-choices under pressure are present but abstract. Still, the arc from detachment (veil on) to total immersion (veil off, atoms within) provides a visible stance shift with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final line reweights the premise—she now carries the lost world inside her, foreclosing ordinary life. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated “atoms of nostalgia” imagery and twilight light pulses intensify rather than因果-link. Orientation (who/where/when) is secure by line 3; no penalty. The only causality gap is how “avoiding patterns” mechanically purifies atoms—rule is stated but not demonstrated in a test/failure cycle, a minor soft spot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Underground archive and bronze pagoda act as micro-setting: spatial limits force the ritual at twilight; ceiling shafts and facet-light are returned in the final image, charging closure. Sensory detail is selective—tactile vibration of memories, fractured light—filtered through the historian’s epistemic priorities. No geographical drift; objects remain anchored. The lost civilization stays off-page, evoked through sensory fragments rather than expo dump, keeping atmosphere tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake is clear: possess the forbidden knowledge without being destroyed by repetition like her predecessors. Escalation is textural: each unpredictable movement thickens the ambient hum and vision intensity until the final “frequency attunement” reweights her identity. Cost is conceptual—she can never return to pre-knowledge innocence—visible in the closing image of the veil being replaced as mere formality. No coincidence; pressure is internal and coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge is a parasitic preservation that colonizes the knower. Subtext resides in the veil motif—discarded then replaced, now cosmetic rather than protective—showing the irreversible intrusion of the past into present identity. No moralizing summary; final line “carrying what was lost between worlds” lets the paradox resonate. The anguished joy is implied in the same breath, not labeled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person locked to the historian; perceptual signature is scholarly-obsessive—“trembling fingers,” “whispers across continents,” “decoded fragments”—distinct from generic epic diction. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Patterned repetition (“steadily unpredictable”) is taught early and paid off at climax, justifying cadence. Filter verbs minimal; syntax stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Some sentences stack metaphor—“atoms of nostalgia,” “essence of what had been”—in high-pressure beat, risking purple, but density stays below the −0.7 threshold. One paraphrase loop: “she had come to purify…purification required avoiding patterns” adjacent; −0.2. Grammar clean; no simultaneity errors. Overall propulsion high enough to keep 8-band within reach but not flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of memory-storage nanoparticles with archaic ritual feels fresh; “atoms of nostalgia” is a coinage that literalizes metaphor without breaking world logic. The twilight-locked prism archive is a new variant of the “last repository” trope. Risk is taken in the non-causal purification rule; partial success keeps it from gimmick. Specificity of saffron veil as scholarly badge grounds the concept in anthropological texture.</comment>
