<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stunt double’s fear of enclosure and adaptive trait are shown through bodily tremor, seashell grip, and refusal to bolt—clear micro-choices under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“his phobia screamed”) without label-speak. Yet the transformative betrayal is only asserted (“he wasn’t the man he’d believed”), never dramatized, so the identity fracture feels announced, not earned; this caps the score below 7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: placing the silent shell on the rusted table crystallizes the new stance—vulnerability as weapon—with felt cost (phobia faced, shell abandoned). The causal chain holds: notes → decryption → confrontation → symbolic surrender. However, the betrayal’s origin and mechanism remain off-page, a motivation gap that keeps the Decisive Change slightly hollow; hence low-7.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library under indifferent stars is viscerally anchored—“groaning shut,” “ozone,” “rusted floorboards creaked”—and the micro-setting (child’s cast, seashell) constrains decryption choices. Spatial track is clean; no orientation drift. While the macro-library could be sharper, the final image (shell on rusted table) recharges the motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim stolen identity—is signaled early and tightens once: smudged notes force decryption under claustrophobic threat. The single escalation is protagonist-driven (kneel → decrypt → confront), but the cost is mostly emotional assertion; no concrete loss (tool, blood, social credit) is felt on-page, keeping pressure below the 8-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as power—emerges through final shell surrender rather than slogan, but the story still frames it in thesis language (“Vulnerability is power” appears verbatim). The refrain is brief enough to avoid heavy penalty, yet prevents higher resonance; ambiguity is present but not deep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is strong—“stars like scattered salt,” “skeleton stacks”—without filter clutter. Rhythm modulates with stress (short clauses during tremor, longer during decryption). No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal idiom remains coherent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sensory density is high but purposeful; no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. However, three near-identical “seashell whispered” phrases within 100 words create a template cadence that dulls the climax beat. Minor overwrite in peak beat keeps the score sub-7.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The seashell-as-confessor and decryption-of-cast-notes fusion gives a fresh twist to the stock “amnesiac betrayal” trope. Yet the core engine—mysterious notes reveal true self—remains familiar; specificity is high but concept is recognizable, capping originality in the low-6 band.</comment>
