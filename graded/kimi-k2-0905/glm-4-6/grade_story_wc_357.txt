<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s curiosity and pilot instincts are credibly fused; every beat on the inverted rivers is filtered through her trained perception, and the final vow to “return as a student” crystallizes an earned stance. Interiority stays concrete (“the hum of her vessel a familiar anchor”) without drifting into explanatory labels. The only flaw: we glimpse no contradictory impulse mid-scene; her drive is single-track, muting the contradiction test for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the arrow’s glow reframes orchard resilience as stolen, balanced energy—cost is felt in the final image. Causal chain holds: arrow extraction → sapling surge → recognition of symbiotic pact, all under the Accumulative lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears within first 60 words; no penalty. Minor slack: the gravity-clock never tightens decisions; time feels ambient, not urgent.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and bioluminescent flora are sketched with economy yet continually guide piloting choices; the arrow-embedded boulder doubles as micro-setting that hosts the decisive extraction. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kael’s profession—she notices hull vibrations and water vectors before visual spectacle. Final tree with scarred bark is re-weighted by arrow’s containment glow, nudging the 9+ gate; still, one more tactile interaction with the environment mid-scene would have clinched it.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the source of resilience”—tightens once: the arrow’s catalytic trait rewrites orchard survival from innate to learned adaptation, a knowledge turn that narrows Kael’s moral options (exploit vs. study). Cost is present (orchard’s vulnerability exposed) but lightly felt; no tool, time, or personal loss alters her tactics. Sufficient for high band, yet lacks a visible price that echoes into her future.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: resilience born of absorbing violation, growth paid for by stolen energy. Arrow’s glow in containment silently re-prices galactic agriculture, inviting reader unease rather than moral. No platitudes, no final summary; meaning accretes through inverted rivers and scarred bark. The final smile in “whirling silence” offers charged poise—purpose laced with latent consequence—meeting the 9-band test.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; no head-hop. Diction is pilot-technical (“gravity inversion,” “containment unit”) yet salted with lyrical compression (“liquid spines,” “quiet chaos”). Rhythm swells and contracts with action, mirroring inversion cycle. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; dialogue absent, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density, and loop-free; sentences open variedly, no scaffold. Metaphors (“liquid spines,” “stolen energy”) stay consistent with physical logic and are sparingly deployed, avoiding density penalty. One paraphrase hiccup: “resilience wasn’t just survival; it was a response” restates prior insight—minor −0.2. Closure sentence (“arrow tip glowed…waiting for its next chapter”) lands with crisp propulsion, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<comment>Gravity-inverted orchard, arrow catalyst, and sentient echoes braid into a fresh bioscience-fable; synthesis feels inevitable, not grafted. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in final glow. Tropes (pilot explorer, ancient artifact) are retooled through ecological stakes and symbiotic guilt, passing the transformation test. Within-band distinction earned for structural risk that sharpens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
