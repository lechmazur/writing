<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The herder’s isolation and precognitive curse are vivid, but her interiority drifts into generic cosmic awe (“shimmering like false dawn”) rather than embodied contradiction. The embodied moment when she presses her palms into the dust is strong, yet the prior emotional beats feel performed rather than lived. The change—understanding friction is hidden—arrives as an external download, not a crucible forged from her own misread visions; cost is conceptual, not personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: friction is invisible, not absent, and the herder becomes its conduit—an earned reweighting with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain (stones → dust → insight) is coherent under an Accumulative lens; each beat thickens pattern density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty. The sequence never risks failure that would foreclose a live option, so tension tightens only once, limiting escalation bandwidth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and dust-charged stones form a lived micro-setting that directly constrains placement and timing; spatial choreography is clean. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the humming dust and slipping eels provide tactile counterpoint. The environment evolves—glow, resonance, levitation—causally with each placement, charging the final image. World rules stay consistent; the absence of friction is learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore friction via pattern mastery—signals early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when dust settles into hidden geometries, reweighting the stake from desperation to comprehension. Agency is present, but the cost is conceptual (knowledge) rather than a forfeited want; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; a sharper physical risk (bluff collapse foreshadowed) would have tightened cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge resides in negative space, transmission over possession. The painted stones’ shift from ritual tool to revelation vessel reweights meaning without moralizing. Subtext lingers in the mentor’s disappearance and the herder’s solitude, suggesting pattern mastery may not restore community. Final image of “borrowed dawn” offers resonant, non-literal answer—light was never hers to keep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice carries a consistent cosmic-lyric register, syntactically varied with purposeful elongation that mirrors auroral sweep. Perceptual signature is biased toward geometric pattern and cosmic scale, fitting a precognitive herder. No dialogue to test, but interior diction stays within plausible lexicon. Filter verbs (“seemed to whisper”) are少数 and voice-motivated, not distancing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates well; high information density in compressed phrases like “collapsed star dust levitate, drawn toward the pattern.” Occasional modifier stacks (“shimmering curtains of aurora that danced”) edge toward purple but stay within lyric contract. One paraphrase loop (“sacred patterns… patterns… patterns”) mildly dulls propulsion. No scaffolding; final line lands clean with image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—frictionless world and precognitive eel herder—is fresh, fully committed, and followed to logical end. Synthesis of geomancy, cosmic dust, and invisible friction feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure pays off in resonant closure. Could edge higher with a sharper personal cost, but transformation test passes: story collapses without her exact pattern-meditation.</comment>
