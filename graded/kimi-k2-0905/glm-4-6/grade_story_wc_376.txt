<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Elara’s leaf-skin honesty tic is a vivid, embodied flaw that forces micro-choices (hiding the map fragment, confronting Marius); the wilt/gold toggle is shown, not labeled. The final decision to broadcast the lost conversations is credibly motivated by her accumulated sensory and moral pain. Marius is thin but functional as pressure conduit. Interiority occasionally drifts into thematic abstract (“crushing weight of withheld truths”) yet stays anchored to physical symptom. Meets the 9− quick test except for one stock phrase, so caps at high-7 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: shredded map discovery → postal plate → public revelation chain is legible. One tight time-jump (“For weeks she committed…”) is signaled and pays off. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s new candor culture is undeniable, and Elara’s permanent skin fade is the visible cost. Orientation clean by 120 words; no teleporting props. Slight causal soft spot: how fragments survive aquifer radiation is unexplained, but not closure-critical, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse city, toxic sky, dried oasis, and pressurized postal tubes are sketched with selective sensory strokes (“iridescent dust,” “zinc-etched”) that feed choices (map route, message tubes). Body-as-setting works: her wilting skin is the immediate environment that constrains secrecy. Spatial choreography clear in the under-floorboard extraction and hub crawl. No single prop or environment charges the final image enough for 9+ gate; the setting informs but does not crystallize the last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she survive complicity in silence—tightens when the plate fragments prove official lies. Mid-story deepening (Marius already knew) narrows her options to expose or endure; she chooses exposure at cost of permanent skin fade. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric pattern. Price is visible, but second beat of external pushback (council threat etc.) is off-page, keeping it below 8.2+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: secrecy as slow radiation poisoning—of water, skin, civic body. Subtext in Marius’s visits (he brings water, yet carries poison knowledge) is elegant. Final image of “gold-spattered patterns wherever candor took root” reweights the leaf motif without sermon. One near-echo of prompt phrasing (“candor in small moments”) in penultimate paragraph keeps it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lush, calligrapher-sensitive diction (“gold-tipped brush into the morning’s first light”) sustains perceptual signature. Free indirect style clean; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates: long fluid sentences for greenhouse calm, shorter clauses during plate reading. Dialogue sparse but tonally consistent; Marius’s diction distinct from Elara’s interior. One template cadence run (“she would… she began… she noticed”) mid-text prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often paints setting + emotion + stakes. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Scaffold minimal—only one paraphrase loop (“lost conversations… silenced conversations”). Occasional elevated register (“conceptual cost,” “conceptual repricing”) momentarily cracks POV lexicon, but beats are short. Clean copy; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of botanical body-mod and dead-mail mystery feels fresh; neither trope dominates. The “truth-as-photosynthesis” concept grows naturally from world rules. Risk taken with quiet, distributed climax—citywide candor bloom rather than confrontation—pays off. Could swap greenhouse for another sealed habitat without breaking arc, so not quite 8.5+.</comment>
