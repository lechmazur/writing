<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tomas’s reluctant caretaker interiority is vivid—gnarled trees, bronze birds, inherited blueprint—but his contradictory impulses (save strangers while feeding the orchard) stay stated rather than enacted in-scene; the single micro-choice (triggering the device) is earned yet emotionally underplayed, so the cost feels legible but not viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: find nut → assemble device → guide traveler → pay frost-touched cost; orientation anchors by line 5, closure is a crisp Charged Poise—Tomas turning back to the approving trees—whose conceptual price (his humanity drips away with the frost) reconfigures the stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orchard-light, mechanical-bird acoustics, and frost-crystal visuals are selective and POV-filtered; the cliff-labyrinth geography stays coherent and literally channels the traveler’s escape, while the frost-line micro-setting tightens the final ticking cost, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save tonight’s traveler—signals early; pressure tightens as frost descends and birds circle; protagonist’s agency (assemble, cast blue path) directly forecloses the “let another die” option, paying the legible cost of his own further corrosion, landing cleanly under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant complicity emerges through orchard imagery and the blueprint’s failed-experiments lineage; final image of trees “rustling with something like approval” reweights the moral ledger without moralizing, achieving quiet conceptual repricing, though subtext stays slight for this length.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“wings that cut the air like razors,” “frost kisses”) carries a darkly lyrical yet precise texture that mirrors Tomas’s offhand exactitude; no head-hop or register drift, and rhythmic compression under bird-attack pressure is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, high density (“wires woven from strands of moonlight” does triple duty), no scaffold loops; one mixed metaphor (“blue light that cast shadows like reaching arms”) slightly blurs physics but occurs pre-closure and doesn’t obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing orchard-curse folk-horror with steampunk birds and a nut-based MacGuffin feels fresh; the “graceless beauty” tone and inherited failure blueprint subvert standard savior arcs, while frost-clock and impression-based navigation offer specific, non-generic inflections that would break if swapped.</comment>
