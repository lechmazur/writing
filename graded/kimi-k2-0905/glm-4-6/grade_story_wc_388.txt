<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya’s skeptical-professional lens is vivid early (“sharply observant eyes”), but her interiority stays mostly conceptual (“didn’t believe in curses, but did believe in patterns”). The shift from mercenary debunker to witness of wonder is legible, yet the emotional cost is stated rather than embodied—no contradictory impulse or visceral toll appears on the page. Still, her micro-choice to leave the hood off inside the pavilion foreshadows renunciation and the final reframing feels character-specific, so the arc barely earns its closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: orchard anomaly → shredded letters → diamond truth. One clean transition (cabin to pavilion) keeps time coherent. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the diamond’s flaw was what made it perfect” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The final image crystallizes options without mechanical exposition, satisfying the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The radioactive orchard is rendered through selective sensory filtration—fruit hues against “perpetually hazed” sky, clean air inside the pavilion—so setting constrains choice (removing hood). Micro-setting rule qualifies: the diamond on obsidian acts as a charged object that reconfigures meaning in the last beat. Spatial anchors (gates, cabin floorboards, pedestal) track cleanly; no orientation drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—expose fake miracle—flips to “excavate truth from comfortable lies,” signaled early and tightened once via letter assembly. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal: Maya forfeits her debunker identity without a visible price, keeping the score sub-8.8. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no off-stage shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of flaw ↔ perfection, anchored in the diamond image and orchard survival. No explicit moralizing; the final line offers resonant reconfiguration. Subtext operates in gesture (removing hood, choosing not to debunk). Complexity—humans lost balance pursuing flawless systems—is implied, not asserted, though the insight leans slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Maya’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“plump with amber apples,” “radioactive morning light”—is vivid yet remains within a professional observer’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, crisp fragments for discoveries (“Piece by piece…”). One lapse: “comfortable lie” is reused verbatim; otherwise voice coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No mixed metaphors or loops, but two near-paraphrase pairs (“truth…comfortable narratives / comfortable lies”) dull momentum slightly. Density is high; every paragraph advances knowledge or image. Artifacts stay clear of closure beat, so 9+ not disallowed, yet the slight repetition caps the score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic oasis plus cursed-corporate relic is fresh synthesis; the diamond as quantum filter rather than MacGuffin avoids trope fatigue. Specific detail—“isotope-transform resonance,” shredded executive letters—grounds the sci-fi premise. Final inversion (flaw enables flow) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry.</comment>
