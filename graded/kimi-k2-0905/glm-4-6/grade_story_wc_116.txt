<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s “observe without judgment” motive is stated early and re-iterated, but it never collides with a test that forces a visible cost or choice; interiority is atmospheric rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values or forecloses a path, so the promised arc of reality-looseness stays ornamental. The ending’s “renewed understanding” is asserted, not dramatized, leaving the character static. For 600–800 words, one credible renunciation or failure-to-act with cost would have elevated this into publish-now territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds sensory density until the final image of crystallizing obsidian reweights the premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—memory-layered reflection—whose cost is the keeper’s continuing, unshared solitude; the price is felt but not sharpened by an on-page trade-off. Transitions among library, swan-fold, and refuge are legible, though the middle third drifts into lyric catalog without tightening the stake. One more beat where silence or reflection forecloses a real option would have pushed this to 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective detail—vine-cracked mortar, moonless twilight on glass, paper creased into “impossible geometries”—is consistently filtered through the keeper’s alien attention. The obsidian wall functions as micro-setting: its changing reflective surface literally charges the final image by storing prior visitors, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean across the three shards; no floating rooms or white-room gaps. Economy is exemplary: every sensory note either mirrors decay or prepares the mirrored closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness change without judgment—remains abstract; no external or internal obstacle ever threatens it, so pressure stays flat. Silence, river, and obsidian accumulate texture but do not tighten options or impose a visible price. The only micro-turn is noticing new reflective properties, a perception rather than a choice with cost. Because no escalation forecloses a path, the conflict plateau is below the 6.0 threshold for meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through recurrent images of rust, vine, layered memory—never sermonized. The final crystallization of obsidian re-weights the concept of preservation-as-reflection, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: is witness without judgment liberation or paralysis? The refusal to moralize is purposeful, but the lack of an embodied test keeps the insight cerebral rather than visceral, capping resonance short of 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is distinctively lyric, syntactically elongated, yet controlled—“thoughts diffusing until only pure witnessing remained.” No head-hop; psychic distance stays tightly interior to the keeper. Register never drifts into academic filler; diction stays within a mystic archivist’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for catalog, clipped fragments for perception shocks—evidence of deliberate musical scoring that survives the read-aloud test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Density is high—single sentences layer time, decay, and metaphysics without scaffold. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; every metaphor is internally consistent (obsidian as memory strata, silence as living presence). One mixed vehicle—“language decay and rebirth itself in cycles”—is forgivable at this length. Clause rhythm varies; no template cadence, and the final image lands clean, propelling the thematic reprice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The origami swan as dimensional key, silence as regenerative force, and memory-layered obsidian synthesize into a fresh metaphysical ecology. These choices are not mere quirk: the swan enables the entire plot, silence shapes the keeper’s stance, obsidian delivers closure. Risk of abstraction is high, but specificity of sensory detail keeps the concept grounded. If the keeper had faced a genuine temptation to intervene, the innovation would have felt inevitable rather than evocative, nudging 9+.</comment>
