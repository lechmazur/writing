<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>A lone figure with no name or distinguishing trait beyond his cosmic job-title; we are told he “witnesses” but never see him decide, doubt, or even flinch. Internal contradiction is declared (“wanderingly exact”) yet never dramatized in scene—he drifts through cathedral prose rather than acting under pressure. The promised sacrifice of “certainty” is asserted, not embodied; no micro-choice shows him paying that cost. The result is a cipher who could be swapped for any other robed seeker without altering a beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece opens with deliberate disorientation—good—but never teaches us how to read its spiralling syntax or collapsing geography, so the Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4). Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing (the blank dictionary page that both defines and undefines), yet the cost is abstract, not felt; the final hush lands as an aesthetic gesture rather than a lived change. Causality is replaced by litany: each sentence restates the same metaphysical tautology without tightening options. Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred, but the pattern never breaks or deepens—only thickens into echo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “ancient temple library lost in time” is evoked with lavish, omnidirectional imagery—columns breathe, shelves tower, pages glow—creating an oneiric hyperspace that stays consistent. Sensory selection skews visual/weightless, but the POV is cosmic, so the bias feels motivated. The library subtly shapes possibility: corridors contract to his mental state, pages offer blankness when needed; this constrained mutability charges the final image. Missing tactile or olfactory detail keeps it just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (“unravel cosmic illusions”) but never localize into a concrete risk or irreversible fork; the protagonist faces no live test, only ritual choreography. Pressure is static awe—every sentence inflates the same sublime note—so no meaningful tightening, deepening, or cadence shift occurs. Agency is purely metaphoric: he “releases the accumulated burden” rather than choosing against an alternative. Under Accumulative lens, the required density-increase never arrives; the hymn simply loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—language as the sh fractured mirror of reality—emerges through the glowing dictionary and blank final page, avoiding explicit sermon. Subtext operates in image (spiral architecture, levitating lexicon) rather than exposition, inviting the reader to supply the paradox. Yet the concept is announced repeatedly (“scaffolding of reality,” “cosmic illusions”) blunting nuance. Resonance lingers, but the absence of character cost keeps it intellectual rather than emotional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice owns a cathedral-grand register—long Latinate clauses, liturgical cadence—that remains consistent with the metaphysical premise. Perceptual signature is present: the narrator notices weight, luminescence, recursive syntax, matching the POV’s cosmic-archivist bent. No head-hopping; distance stays omni-lyric. Occasional template cadence (“as he…, the library…”) nicks the top band, but rhythmic control under syntactic overload is impressive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Individual sentences are often exquisite, but figurative density is near 100 %—every line stacks metaphor upon metaphor—creating a purple haze that slows propulsion (−0.5). Mixed-metaphor risk is high yet usually avoided; when it slips (“universe’s hiccup…shattered mirror with no reflection”) the physics collapses momentarily. Paraphrase loops recur (“to unravel…to unify…to weave”) handing the reader the same cosmic tautology in new garb (−0.3). Nonetheless, cadence breathes with emotional rises and the final blank page lands clean, sparing the closure beat from artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of esoteric library, spell-book-as-reality-source, and spiral pathworking feels fresh—an original synthesis rather than patchwork tropes. Risk-taking is high: abstruse metaphysics, non-linear space, blank-lexicon finale—yet coherence holds. Specificity of image (columns spiraling in mathematical mysticism, pages glowing with internal starlight) prevents generic abstraction. The concept commits fully; no retreat into conventional plot safety.</comment>
