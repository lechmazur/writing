<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation as living-obituary writer is a vivid contradiction that drives every beat; his decision to stay and write the gardener rather than leave on the last ship crystallizes his own “explained absence.” Interiority is sensory and specific—“calloused hands…pruning rose stems as if they might reply”—never lapsing into label-speak. The arc does not require a second on-page character; Elias’s stance toward the gardener is the crucible, and his final solitude is the earned cost. Flaw: the gardener’s backstory is recounted more than dramatized, so the deepest emotional pressure is vicarious rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blue thread slipped back into pocket reweights all prior absences into an atlas of integration rather than erasure, cost felt in Elias’s “breathtakingly present” loneliness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of copper-plaque echoes, leaf color, thread color, and gardener myth tighten until the final cadence shift. One transition (garden→bench) is legible; no orientation debt. Micro-turn: writing the gardener’s life becomes Elias’s own obituary-in-advance, foreclosing his own departure. Cost is visible—“breathtakingly present” solitude—so 9+ gate is open; capped at 8.7 because gardener causal role is off-stage, slightly softening protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden is not backdrop but syntax: every path, plaque, and skeletal apple tree constrains Elias’s attention and finally his decision to stay. Micro-setting works—blue carpet thread functions as portable palace, a literal weft that mirrors the textual weaving of lives. Autumn chill, dusk light, and star glint are selectively filtered through Elias’s artist-eye, never tourist-catalogue. 9+ gate met: thread-in-starlight charges the final image and reweights all prior absences into a single glistening map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map healing through absence—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Elias chooses to write the gardener rather than chase the ship. Escalation is accretive: each plaque, rose, and leaf layers pressure until the act of writing becomes the irreversible choice that forecloses departure. No coincidence; cost is the felt solitude of the final line. Could edge higher if gardener’s absence had been dramatized on page rather than recounted, which would have sharpened the trade-off under Elias’s agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—copper labels, blue thread, pruned roses—never from thesis statements. The final image reweights “explained absence” into a living atlas without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide whether Elias’s solitude is wound or wisdom. Only micro-flaw: one sentence—“writing obituaries for the living had taught Elias that healing wasn’t about erasure, but integration”—leans toward echo; saved by immediate return to sensory image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias’s perceptual grammar: “lonesome splendor,” “azure blue still vibrant,” “garden acknowledged its losses.” Syntax mirrors artist-attention: long, painterly sentences for dusk, then short clause at final slip of thread. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture and does. 9+ gate open; capped because one clause edges toward editorial summary rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene tempo: longer cadence for twilight bloom, single crisp beat when thread catches starlight. Figurative control high—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Density strong: one sentence often fuses setting, emotion, and concept (“Writing obituaries…integration—the geography of understanding…”). Minor scaffold: “explained absences” repeated exact phrase three times; does not touch closure, so −0.2 only. Elsewhere, verbs are strong, pronouns clean, no filter-stack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Core premise—obituarist for the living—is fresh and thematically inevitable. Garden-of-labels is a specific, non-generic invention that transforms familiar grief-into-landscape trope. Blue carpet thread as portable palace fragment is lovely particular. Risk is quiet—no twist or formal rupture—so originality is mid-high rather than explosive. Transformation test passes: swap thread, plaque text, or gardener myth and the emotional circuitry collapses.</comment>
