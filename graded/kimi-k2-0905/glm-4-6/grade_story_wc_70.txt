<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s curse of involuntary truth-telling is dramatized early and shapes every interaction; the interior contradiction between needing secrecy and being forced to speak truth charges each beat. His micro-choice to hand the lacquer box to the girl is a credible renunciation that forecloses his own comfort and completes his arc. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“a curse that made his job…a peculiar form of torture”) that momentarily floats above embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers image-objects (tower, poem, drone wing, lacquer box) until the final gesture reweights their collective meaning. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the girl accepts the box, the street-lamp flickers, and the cost—Elias’s loss of his private wonder—lands without exposition. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 60; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lightning tower, lacquer box, and drone wing each constrain choice or charge the final image; the tower’s gaunt silence and the box’s cool surface are returned to in tactile ways that steer action. Selective sensory filtering (“honeyed glow,” “whisper of the wind”) mirrors Elias’s narrowed emotional bandwidth. Spatial choreography remains clean across the spiral ascent and descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Elias decides to copy the poem and relinquish the box. The cost is felt: he gives away the only private magic he still possesses. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the value of remembered beauty outweighs functional utility. The final image (girl holding the box, lamp flickering) offers a non-literal conceptual repricing that reweights the earlier “failure” as gift. No moralizing, no thesis statement—just the silent hand-off and light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—“nectar dusk,” “silver sheen”—without head-hop. Syntax tilts toward lyric compression but remains legible; the matchbox riddle is voiced in cadence that feels ritual, not expositional. Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext (merchant flees after Elias’s blunt truth).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Occasional elevated diction (“gaunt frame,” “systemic failure”) fits the tower’s grandeur but nudges slightly above Elias’s probable lexicon, keeping the score just sub-8. Closure beat is clean of figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “truth-teller toll-keeper” and “drone-beehive blackout” synthesize into a fresh permutation of post-collapse wonder-story. The architect’s poem-log is a delightful, non-obvious world-detail that pays off emotionally. Risk is present but modest; the concept’s freshness carries the category without gimmickry.</comment>
