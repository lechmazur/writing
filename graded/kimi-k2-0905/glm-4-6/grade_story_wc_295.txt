<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s lucid-dreamer trait and word-healing gift are asserted more than dramatized; only one micro-choice—offering the telegram—carries visible cost. Interiority is lush but drifts into generic “growing anxiety” labels. The mentor’s grief is credible, yet the shared burden shift feels sympathetically bestowed rather than earned by her actions. Contradictory impulses stay verbal, not embodied.

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the two agree to co-carry the prophecy load, cost framed by the sunrise and the still-pulsing stars. Causal chain is present—telegram ➔ shared truth ➔ joint stance—but the mentor’s late entrance splits the scene and blurs the midpoint pressure. Orientation is secure inside 120 words. Lens holds as Causal; however, the mentor’s prior secrecy motive is retro-explained rather than seeded, softening the final weight.

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory brass, daylily-pressed telegram, and star charts are tactile, purpose-driven, and return in the final image. Telescope and variable-star patterns directly constrain the decoding task; the midnight hour tightens the crucible. Sensory palette is balanced—visual, haptic, even olfactory hint from daylilies. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props.

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode inscriptions before prophecy claims another victim—is signaled early and tightens once: mentor appears, forcing Elara to decide whether to shoulder the burden with him. Cost is present—shared sleepless night, grief exposed—but the price feels more emotional than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on-page. Agency is cooperative rather than confrontational, fitting the elegiac tone but muting the peak pressure. Escalation is gentle; one meaningful deepening satisfies the length, yet the lack of external antagonist keeps the score sub-8.8.

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges through star-prophecy metaphor and the mentor-widow telegram rather than overt statement. Subtext in “words that heal” is hinted but not deeply mined. Final sunrise image reweights the night’s dread into communal guardianship—quiet but resonant. Avoids moralizing; lets grief and stellar clockwork speak.

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Prose is lyric but disciplined—controlled metaphor, rhythmic variation, no scaffold loops. Astronomical diction is accurate yet filtered through her emotional lens. Dialogue is sparse and natural; only minor convergence at closure, acceptable for the elegiac mode.

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information density is high—each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Metaphors (“temple inscriptions seemed to mock her”) are apt, not overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; only hairline slip is “growing anxiety” cliché, too minor to dock further.

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusing lucid dreaming with variable-star prophecy yields fresh mythic texture. Daylily-pressed telegram as grief relic is specific and memorable. Mentor’s late-night intrusion reverses the typical apprentice-reveal beat, though the trope of hidden expedition curse is familiar. Risk is moderate; emotional specificity keeps it from reading as stitched prompt response.
