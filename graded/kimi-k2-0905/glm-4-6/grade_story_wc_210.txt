<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian’s wish-for-rebuilding motive stays steady, but interiority lapses into generic “weight in his chest” and “heart raced.” The decisive renunciation of easy restoration is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told he “rejected false comfort” instead of watching a moment where he could have chosen it and turned away. No contradictory impulse is shown on-page; the tension is purely declarative. Earned change is present but under-costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bottle cools, townspeople greet him as neighbor, founding identity flips. Causal chain holds—each envisioned module triggers visible town growth—yet the final beat is summarized (“he knew this was only the beginning”) rather than crystallized in one charged image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held. Cost is felt but diffuse, not pinned to a single sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory selection is tight—“sand as smooth as powdered glass,” lanterns glowing “without fire or wind.” Paper-lantern cove re-enters as micro-setting: the lanterns dim in response to Elian’s hesitation, then brighten as he chooses, so environment directly shapes beat. Spatial choreography stays clean; no anchor drift. World-rule consistency maintained (bottle warms/cools in sync with creation).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—founding a living civilization—signals early. Single meaningful tightening occurs when lanterns dim under his hesitation, forcing the balance decision; cost is legible but lightweight (no personal loss beyond effort). Escalation is purely accumulative: each memory adds a town-quarter; no external opposition or reversed option appears. Agency remains internal-conceptual rather than risking anything external.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of earned creation vs. false comfort emerges through event, not sermon, until final paragraph’s “he had rejected false comfort”—a mild thematic echo that slightly lowers band. Subtext of neighborly equality (not savior) is effective in last image. Final reconfiguration reweights the bottle from burden to forgotten relic, satisfying CR. Complexity acknowledged but not deeply probed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical distance stays stable. Diction leans poetic but consistent—“salt-bleached wood,” “broken metronome”—anchored to Elian’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for memory cascades, clipped fragments at hesitation. No dialogue to judge. Internal voice avoids filter verbs; perceptual signature is color-light focused. Minor template cadence in “He pictured… Then… Next…” sequence (−0.2).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror town-assembly beats. Metaphors mostly coherent; one mixed strain—“infrastructure of possibility” is abstract. No synonym loops or scaffold. Information density high: one sentence often delivers sensory detail + world rule + emotional correlative. Closure line is clean, but preceding sentence packs three abstractions that thin the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses alchemist + bottled wish + ghost-town-civ-sim; fresh angle on “city-building” fantasy. Execution keeps wonder without exposition dumps. Risk is moderate—accumulative vision rather than battle—but stays coherent. Specificity of rice-paper lantern lore and tide-craft resists generic fantasy template. Ending reversion to “creation never ends” is familiar uplift, slightly diluting ingenuity.</comment>
