<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’ interior contradiction—stoic artisan vs. seeker of communal grief—is palpable in the micro-choice to carve migration trails instead of names; embodied tension in fingertips on granite and ribbon. The spectral grandfather functions less as a second character than as a refracted aspect of Elias’ memory, so relationship-as-crucible is waived. Motive stays anchored to “shape of collective grief,” powering every chisel stroke; the only flaw is a glancing therapeutic self-label (“he knew he had found what he was looking for”) that slightly dilutes rawness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the monarchs die, therefore he carves their path; because the ribbon once tied a childhood knot, therefore it becomes the template for stone. One clear Decisive Change—he leaves the ribbon unrolled as tomorrow’s poem—carries conceptual cost (he surrenders ownership of the verse to the families). Orientation is tight (who, where, when by line 3). Closure could be sharper if a physical beat (snapping the ribbon, cracking the chisel) externalized the price; as is, cost is felt but lightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, damp earth, and monarch grease on panes are filtered through a stone-carver’s eye—tools and wings matter more than botanical labels. The bench, ribbon, and granite slab serve as micro-settings that physically constrain how Elias can stand, coil, or carve. Final image of “shimmer of ghostly wings” recharges the setting rather than abandons it. Only nit: no scent of granite dust itself, a missed tactile specificity that would have crowned the workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—render collective grief legible—tightens when carving names shifts to carving flight paths, narrowing future commissions to living memorials that move. Stakes stay internal yet socially charged: if he fails, families receive only static stone rather than migratory solace. Cost is present (he gives tonight’s poem away, works past dusk), but external jeopardy remains abstract; a single butterfly corpse lodged in the carved groove could have made price visceral. Still, escalation is coherent and character-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-motion emerges through monarch migrations, ribbon flow, and the refusal to fossilize sorrow in fixed letters; no sentence sermonizes. Subtext glints in the unrolled ribbon left behind—tomorrow’s traded poem now belongs to strangers, a quiet sacrifice. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Only a hairline slip of abstract “collective ache” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’ perceptual sieve—chisel weight, ink bleed, dying light angle. Syntax lengthens during meditative beats, then fractures into staccato gestures (“He carved deeper”), mirroring tool rhythm. No head-hopping; grandfather’s voice is filtered through leaf rustle, not quoted. Diction remains artisanal—“grooves,” “serpent,” “cool stone”—never drifts into workshop jargon overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: advance hand motion, shade mood, seed metaphor without purple drift. No template cadence; openings vary from participial breeze to noun-edged declaratives. Figurative layer (“ribbon...dormant serpent”) is sparse, pattern-taught early, paid off when ribbon slithers unrolled at end. One near-loop—“the ribbon wasn’t just an object; it was...”—survives because it crystallizes grandfather’s lesson; no clarity occlusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of graveyard craft, butterfly ecology, and ghost pedagogy feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Monarch migration carved in granite reverses expectation of immutable epitaph, supplying fresh emotional geometry. Risk is quiet—no gothic pyrotechnics—but coherence justifies restraint. Could push further if a client family intruded to challenge the new form, forcing Elias to defend the innovation aloud.</comment>
