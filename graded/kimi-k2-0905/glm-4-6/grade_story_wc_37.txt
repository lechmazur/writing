<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Keeper’s interior contradiction—fragile conviction vs. memory fracture—threads the lute-play; embodied shivers & cupped-glow micro-choices chain to final communal chorus. Cost earned: “his scattered memories now a constellation” (CR). Flaw: diagnostic phrasing “he remembered his purpose” floats above visceral beat; once, not fatal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each orchard bloom thickens song-density until “woven dawns” spill through mica, re-pricing the realm’s light rules. Closure (CR) paid in the keeper’s kneeling release; persistent constraint—eternal night only thinned, not broken—keeps stakes honest. Early orientation clean by 120 w; one causal micro-teleport “he pressed palms… light spilled” forgiven under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mica window functions as micro-setting: constrains keeper’s posture, focuses light-beam, captures final star-map. Alchemical orchard’s phosphorescent bark and perpetual-night cold supply immediate sensory stakes; greenhouse walls breathe with song-vibration. Space tracks cleanly—no impossible distances or prop drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reignite communal fire—signals early; tightening occurs when keeper’s second try forces him to cup & channel the newborn light at personal memory cost. Agency = swaddling & singing; failure path (prior shatter) lingers as conceptual price. Mirror-world rule keeps pressure coherent; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of art-as-repair emerges through iterative song-bloom images; no explicit thesis. Subtext in “shadows softened” implies social forgiveness without slogans. Final reweighted mica-star-map offers non-literal answer: memory is the dawn we weave. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity persists in night’s partial retreat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintained; perceptual signature filters world through synesthetic song-light (“petals unfurling inscriptions”). Rhythm escalates with short clauses during lute crescendo, exhales into longer cadence at collapse. No head-hopping; diction stays within mythic register keeper would possess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid figurative density supports mythic mode; only one mixed metaphor (“seams of gold stitching… reality”) under peak beat. Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences open with body, tool, image, avoiding template loops. Minor filter verb cluster “he could coax…he could swaddle” rescued by tactile immediacy that follows.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-keeper + alchemical orchard + song-photonics feels inevitable in hindsight; no close pop-culture echo. “Woven dawns” trope flipped from craft cliché to cosmological re-lighting. Risk-taking in lyric escalation pays off via earned conceptual cost rather than twist. Specificity of heartwood lute & mica granularity anchors originality.</comment>
