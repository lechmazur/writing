<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s collector identity is lightly sketched (pouch, seeds) but never tested under pressure; his “infinite patience” is asserted, not embodied in micro-choices. The weaver’s gnarled hands and wave-smoothed voice give tactile individuality, yet status shift is only hinted. Interiority stays atmospheric rather than contradictory, so motivation feels steady but not scalding. Closure image of “quiet, brilliant heart” lands as CR, not character-driven renunciation—cost is conceptual, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of rope-knot readings builds density toward Conceptual Repricing at the end—fulgurite’s return reweights “remember” rule. Anchors clear by line 6; no orientation debt. Single scene, one micro-turn when rope self-weaves; causality is symbolic, not because/therefore, but coherent under lyric contract. Closure beat—“fulgurite pulsed once…all was still”—pays cost by sealing the dock in timeless fog, foreclosing further decoding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Golden dock, snow, fog, and creaking planks compose a micro-setting that literally conducts the fulgurite’s flare and the weaver’s emergence—environment charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tilted toward tactile cold and hushed sound, mirroring Elias’s attenuated patience. Spatial choreography stays clean: kneel-stand-offer axis tracks without drift. Dock’s “sacred ground” rule is learned through action, not dump, and constrains exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve what the world forgets”—is declared early; pressure escalates only interpretively as each knot decoded adds cultural density, not practical jeopardy. No visible price (time, risk, forfeiture) is exacted; tension is aesthetic, not visceral. Agency is attention-based; Elias’s decoding narrows interpretive options but never endangers a tangible want. Closure cost is conceptual (conceptual repricing of memory’s value), satisfying under lyric lens yet light on felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-texture emerges through knot language and fog that “never lifted fully,” avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext resides in rope uncoiling itself—authority passes from collector to weavers without pronouncement. Final snow silence reweights earlier “oceanic hush” into earned stasis: knowledge preserved but voiceless. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide if preservation equals vitality—but slight sentimentality in “quiet, brilliant heart” softens edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “fingers brushed the coarse rope,” “fulgurite glass cool in his palm.” Diction favors Latinate tactile verbs (“coax,” “trace,” “resolve”) that mirror patient collector mindset. Rhythm lengthens with fog, contracts at flare—voice modulates without drumbeat monotony. Weaver’s dialogue—“You coax the rope”—is sparse, wave-smoothed, distinct from Elias’s interior curator voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies: long anaphoric fog lines alternate with crisp knot verbs. Information density high—most sentences deliver sensory data plus symbolic load. Two mixed-metaphor hazards: “lightning’s frozen scream” and “library” for rope verge on excess but serve concept. Minor scaffold: “the fog swirled” appears twice within eight lines; doesn’t obscure closure but keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Knot-as-archive concept refreshes mnemonic trope; fulgurite key re-forges cliché relic into natural-cultural fusion. Setting’s eternal snow-fog dock feels fresh against typical temperate harbors. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off via self-weaving rope spectacle. Still, seed-collector angle remains decorative—swap occupation and story holds—limiting transformative quotient.</comment>
