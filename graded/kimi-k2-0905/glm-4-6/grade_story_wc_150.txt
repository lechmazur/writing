<comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her satchel strap, the “warmly curious” flutter—and her lineage-loss motive gains mass through the sundial fragment. The moment she kneels to seat the disk, her contradictory impulses (restoration vs. exile cynic) collide on-page, paying visible cost with the silver-light snap. Status/relationship crucible is absent, so full 9.0+ gate not met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is clean: because her father’s map → therefore the orchard tomb; because the socket waits → therefore the sundial returns. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the click re-weights her exile story into homecoming, silver light the felt cost. Lens holds from first root-snake image to final breath of faith restored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard is not scenery but hydraulic pressure: roots gripping limestone dictate where she digs; perpetual twilight narrows sensory bandwidth to scent and chill. The sundial socket is micro-setting that literally shapes the final move. Spatial choreography never drifts; every shovel scrape stays anchored to the slab’s edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single stake—recover lineage worth—tightens once: empty socket forces the choice to surrender the last portable relic. Cost is the loss of future mobility implicit in leaving the sundial; she pays by foreclosing exile identity. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word arc; one meaningful turn meets bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of regeneration through decay emerges from orchard ecology and tomb dust, never sermonized. Final image re-prices exile as compost for new roots; resonance is oblique yet legible. No echoic platitudes; insight stays inside the silver-lit dust motes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers at intimate distance, perceptual bias vivid—“impossible perfume,” “gnarled veins.” Syntax flexes with pressure: long clause for descent, fragment at click. No head-hop; diaspora returnee lexicon stays consistent. Dialogue absent, so voice judged on narration alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; few filter verbs, no scaffold loops. One stretched metaphor—“roots snaking like veins”—but physical logic intact. No artifacts near closure; final sentence breathes cleanly. Minor over-modification (“impossible perfume,” “fragile thing”) holds below 9.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard reverses standard gothic death-space into life-source; diaspora returnee restores rather than loots ancestor tomb. Concept feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than twist—so tops at 8.3.</comment>
