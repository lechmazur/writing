<comment>The technician’s quiet, almost sacramental absorption of the room’s grief makes his every micro-choice (hand hovering, dust-reading, ladder climb) a credible extension of his vocation. The mainspring-in-pocket moment crystallizes a renunciation: he carries away the site’s last secret, accepting the mantle of perpetual witness. Interiority remains tactile—“his burden weightless in its familiarity”—never devolving into diagnostic self-talk. Contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mourner) coexist in-scene, powering the closure.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns, cracks, and ghost-traces build density until the mainspring’s extraction releases the pressure. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure = Charged Poise: the room’s “bittersweet release” reconfigures meaning without expositional summary. Cost is felt in the pocketed weight that replaces the prior “weightless” burden—an on-page shift.</comment>

<comment>The ticket office functions as both crime-scene and reliquary: every peeling poster and fractured plaster flake is handled or dust-scrutinised, constraining his method. The water-stained medallion becomes a literal access panel; the ladder’s ricketiness heightens the final ascent. Micro-setting (the lath cavity) supplies the hiding nook that charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy stays under professional gaze—temperature drop, metallic glint—never tourist-catalog.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: decode the ghost-event hidden in the ceiling. Tightening occurs when the swirl-pattern fingers the mainspring’s location, foreclosing further observation—he must act. Escalation is textural: dust, cracks, calliope memory accumulate until the sphere-of-force expulsion pays the price (stumble down ladder). Cost is visible: the room’s sorrow lifts, but he gains a new, denser burden in his pocket.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the consonance of mechanical decay and human tragedy: ceilings hide both joists and grief. Subtext reads in his refusal to vocalise—grief is processed through touch and retrieval, not speech. Final image (cold dense weight vs. prior weightlessness) reprices the premise: understanding extracts a toll. No moralizing; the mainspring’s quiet gleam is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person distant stays locked to technician’s perceptual signature—“skillfully observant eyes,” “calligraphy of neglect”—creating a forensic lyric texture. Syntax lengthens during vision, then tightens into tool-action clauses. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows to palm-skin temperature at climax. Filter verbs serve voice: “he saw” keeps the ghost as external data, not omniscient revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image, pressure, or tool-use. Metaphors stay physically coherent (fractured plaster “whispering,” dust “shroud”). High information density: one line can layer sensory detail, back-history, and method. Rhythm breathes—long clauses for vision, staccato for ladder work—without monotony. Closure line is spare, letting the pocketed weight do final work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of elevator-repair diagnostics with ghost-hunting is fresh, yet grows inevitably from character skill-set. Dust-pattern reading as séance is a non-obvious synthesis that could not survive substitution. Risk: using a mainspring—an obscure horological part—pays off when its coiled-tension metaphor reweights the trapeze fall. Specificity of circus ceiling as memory-storage feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
