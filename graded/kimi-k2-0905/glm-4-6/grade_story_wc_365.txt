<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kael’s need to excavate a “withheld truth” drives every beat; his synesthetic mapping of walls/air gives interior contradiction (“a skill both curse and salvation”) and embodied cost. The micro-choice to nudge the datapad probability is credible, irreversible, and paid for immediately by the shard burning hot. The only flaw: near-total absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics idle and flattens crucible pressure. Still, the interior map-maker voice is specific, flawed, and changed at exit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the resurfaced “Chimera Log” reweights Kael’s entire past with undeniable social cost; the lens is Causal (because he redirects the log, therefore the file re-emerges). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive before word 60; transitions between time-shards are legible and patterned. Cost is visible: shard scorches palm + collapse back to “grimy floor.” Minor loop: “the withheld truth was…/the withheld truth was…” echo costs it the 9-band, but causality stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The repair bay’s rust-eaten textures, ozone tang, and ghost-machinery hum are filtered through Kael’s synesthetic bias, constraining his paths (“narrowed perception to immediacies”). The gleaming past version is rendered in economical, contrasting strokes. Spatial choreography is clean: workbench → spanner → shard → collapse. While the bay itself does not charge the final image (the shard and the file do), its atmospheric weight supplies the “before” that the log reframes, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the buried lie that ruined the spaceport—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when Kael redirects the log, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is one-shot but sufficient for 700-word scope: the nudge triggers immediate physical cost (shard burns) and future social exposure. No antagonist on page, yet the erased archive functions as coherent external pressure. The reversal is earned; coincidence merely enables shard activation, never resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as an atlas whose coordinates must be bodily paid for. Subtext lives in gesture—touching rust edges, fingertips quivering—rather than exposition. Final image of “stone” versus earlier “whisper” offers resonant reweighting without moralizing. One echo of prompt language (“weight of a withheld truth”) is barely audible and does not sermonize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s synesthetic register: “rough texture imprinting,” “metallic tang of ozone,” “chaotic symphony.” Diction remains within plausible spacer-outsider lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm compresses under stress—single-clause bursts during shard burn—then widens for exhausted aftermath. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids therapy-speak. Voice is coherent, specific, and modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory map, motivation, and world history (“ghosts of machinery…murder of half-remembered dreams”). Metaphors are controlled; no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase loop on “withheld truth” phrase costs −0.2. Opening and closing lines are sharply cadenced, propelling entry and exit. Read-aloud ear test passes; only hairline repetitions keep it from 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic cartography merged with multiverse heist feels fresh, not a trope checklist. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—mapping addiction and bodily cost are idiosyncratic to Kael. Risky compression of entire alternate-timeline sabotage into one beat pays off cleanly. No close echoes of famous sf scenes. Concept commits fully; premise integrity intact.</comment>
