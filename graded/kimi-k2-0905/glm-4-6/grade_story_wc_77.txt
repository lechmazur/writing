<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The interiority is vivid—“its lingering luminance still burning like a dying star against my skin”—but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are told more than enacted; the decisive turn depends on accepting the mirror-death, yet the emotional cost is asserted rather than embodied in a final micro-choice. Voice remains consistent, yet the “photographically cursed” trait never constrains an on-page action; it functions as label rather than limitation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: embracing the dying mirror-image reconfigures the curse into artistic agency, with the clasp’s fade as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of mirrored deaths builds density until the final reweighting—but causality between “unbosoming” and mirror-reconfiguration is implied rather than dramatized in a single beat, slightly blunting the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors and the silver clasp act as micro-setting that literally constrain path and choice; the shifting hallway of deaths is tactile, lived-in, and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the mirror-surface is the necessary canvas for the conceptual turn, so narrowing is purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions—while the carnival’s disrepair stays offstage, keeping focus on the mirror-maze that alters tactics.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over the photographically cursed afterlife—is signaled early and tightens once: choosing the death-mirror path forecloses escape and reweights the curse as medium. Pressure accumulates through mirrored iterations rather than causal reversals; the cost (eternal dying image accepted) is legible on the page, yet escalation is more atmospheric than tactical, limiting upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme—art forged from death’s residue—emerges through the mirrors’ recursive deaths and the final re-pricing of curse as brush. Subtext operates in silence: the act of embracing the mirror speaks the theme without moralizing. The closing “gallery” image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the paradoxical dream-dictionary mechanic is asserted late, slightly diluting prior organic buildup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a consistent, fevered lyricism—“repulsive allure,” “lingering luminance”—that reflects post-resuscitation disorientation. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as mirrors multiply, matching mounting stakes. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature remains distinct and paid off in the final mirror-embrace without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned—mirrors, luminance, dying stars—taught early and recharged at closure, so density penalty is waived. One paraphrase loop: “reveal everything – your fears, your truths” restates prior beat without new pressure, −0.2. Otherwise high information density and zero scaffold; final image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “photographically cursed resuscitated witness” angle offers a fresh synthesis of liminal-art trope; transformation test fails if names change, because the mirror-curse mechanics are specific to photographic distortion. Risk-taking—choosing eternal death mirror—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight proximity to Lynchian funhouse/limbo tropes keeps it shy of top band, but the gallery inversion feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
