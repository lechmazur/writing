<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The thief’s longing is embodied early (“urge to press his ear against destiny’s door”), but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized until the final mirror beat; micro-choices are few and low-cost. The renunciation is legible and carries luminous imagery, yet the causal path from flower-code obsession to self-recognition is summarized, not pressure-tested. Emotional specificity is strong in the final paragraph, but earlier beats lean on abstract labels (“luminous disbelief”). Still, the character passes the 9- gate test with a visible cost: leaving the portrait untouched reframes his identity and forecloses his old quest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A coherent Causal lens is held throughout: each beat is linked by because/therefore logic (decode flowers → apply moonbeams → silence → smile → renunciation). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar’s dulling and the woman’s eye-smile reweight the premise—destiny is self, not portrait. Cost is felt in the ache of silence and the jar’s loss of glow; persistent constraint is the now-capped moonbeam tool he must carry forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emerald station mist, golden sunset, and abandoned gallery are sketched with economical sensory strokes; spatial choreography stays clean. The jar acts as micro-setting/object that constrains the final choice (its dimming triggers renunciation). A hairline slip: “emerald luminescence” is repeated without new inflection. Still, the environment mirrors interior shift (glow fades as ego dissolves) and charges the last image, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—possession of illuminated moments—signals early and tightens once: silence voids his plan, forcing reinterpretation. Escalation is causal under lens: failed decoding → smile → renunciation; cost is the forfeiture of the portrait and the jar’s spent light. No coincidence resolves; agency remains his. The tightening is single but meaningful; meets 8.8- gate though price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without abstract labels: illuminated moments reframed from theft to self-creation. The final image—thief walking into night with dulled jar—offers resonant non-literal answer: destiny is walked, not opened. Subtext operates in the woman’s eye-smile and the jar’s dimming. One soft echo of prompt language (“pressed his ear against destiny’s door”) survives without dramatized cost, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly, honey-and-starlight diction that fits art-thief sensibility. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs are minimal; syntax modulates from languid to clipped at silence beat. Meets 9- gate with rhythmic control and taught pattern of light imagery paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense but patterned: “shadow painted in honey,” “liquid starlight”; taught early and revisited at closure without muddle. One paraphrase loop: “golden hour was gone, but its light lingered” slightly restates prior sentence; −0.2. Otherwise high density, varied rhythm, no scaffold. No artifact touches the closure beat; remains eligible for 9+ but density keeps at 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Premise—art thief steals living portraits with moonbeam jar—is fresh synthesis of heist and metaphysical yearning. Transformation test fails if names change, but flower-code mechanic and emerald station are specific enough. Risky lyric compression is mostly earned; slight over-reliance on light metaphors. Within-band +0.3 for bold poetic heist; not higher because twist (portrait = mirror) is foreseeable in genre.</comment>
