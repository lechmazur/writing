<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s serene mask and slow release of the puppets from strings give a credible arc, but the interior contradiction between commercial calligrapher and underground agitator is asserted rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice; the final “uncommonly serene” reset feels inherited, not paid for by visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the cut strings and unprompted puppets create a Resonant Reconfiguration—stories are freed from teller—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the campfire stick’s shift from active prop to inert wood supplies felt cost. Causality holds across the mosaic shards, though the month-long ellipsis is a soft patch rather than a motivated gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The radar dome as repurposed surveillance-turned-studio is sketched with spare, tactile cues (“still reverberated with echoes”) and recurs to frame the final release performance; the campfire stick serves as micro-setting that constrains each puppet vignette, satisfying the 9+ gate. Bar interiors are generic, but selective detail keeps momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who controls narrative truth—tightens as Elias moves from commissioned safety to subversive bars; the final freeing of the puppets forecloses his authorial grip with visible cost (loss of control, stick abandoned). Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, but the deepening pattern reweights stakes effectively under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ownership of meaning is a conversation, not a commodity. The reversed parables and unprompted puppets embody the argument without sermon; the final image reconfigures prior material, offering resonant ambiguity rather than a moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains calm, meteor-hush diction that mirrors Elias’s surface serenity; rhythmic control heightens in the final paragraph without head-hopping. Compression (“weeks passed”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure, keeping psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“darkness descended like a velvet curtain”) and does not clog high-pressure beats. Strong verbs carry motion, and paragraph cuts tighten the arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The puppet-as-ethics-test in dive bars feels fresh; reversing creation into autonomous story-life offers a non-obvious synthesis. Risk in structure (mosaic time) is purposeful and heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
