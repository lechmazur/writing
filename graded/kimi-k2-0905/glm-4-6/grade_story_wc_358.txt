<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—flight patch prickles, fingers tremor—but the epiphany that “silence is a weapon” arrives as a labeled summary rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choice is present (kneeling to sample soil) yet the final renunciation is only asserted, not dramatized with felt cost. Competence is well-sketched, but struggle stays intellectual; emotional stakes plateau.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain lands: additive → wind vortex → biochemical silence → intentional weapon, each link logged on-page. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“questions, not solutions” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. Orientation locked by 120 words; no lens drift. Persistent constraint (his own blind spot as ex-flight engineer) shapes the final image, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Container labyrinth actively directs wind vectors that enable the dispersal mechanism; steel canyon functions as micro-setting that constrains sensor placement and discovery beat. Sodium lamplight, salt scent, and corrugated palette are filtered through investigator POV, guiding attention to meteorological anomalies. Environment charges the final image: silent monoliths bear witness, reweighting the port from workplace to crime scene. Tool-as-setting (surveillance kit) is handled tactilely and its readings drive the turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand how systems fail before they recur”—tightens when evidence points to deliberate sabotage, foreclosing the comfort of accident theory. One clear deepening: chemical trace converts mystery into weapon hypothesis, narrowing options from “what happened?” to “who waged this?” Visible price is investigator’s shaken self-trust (patch feels tight, fingers tremor). Escalation is causal, not repetitive; no reversal but sufficient tightening for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: expertise breeds blindness, silence as engineered control. Subtext lives in the flight patch—pride turned reproach—without authorial commentary. Final image of rescue teams finding “warnings” not “explanations” invites reflection on epistemic limits. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature honed by professional metrology—wind vectors, additive ppm—reads investigator-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for survey work, abrupt fragments (“Containers stood like monoliths”) under dawning dread. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Free-indirect slips clean; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong nouns/verbs—“corrugated surfaces,” “affixed sensors”—minimize adjectival bloat. Occasional stacked prepositional phrases (“within the steel canyon”) slightly dilute propulsion but never obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final sentence cadence earns its weight, re-charging silence motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Silence-as-biochemical-weapon via aviation additive is fresh; investigator-as-former-flight-engineer supplies ironic expertise without feeling contrived. Container-wind-dispersal geometry is particular, not borrowed. Premise synthesized rather than gimmicky; risk taken with quiet ending that refuses explanatory catharsis. Could verge higher with more idiosyncratic investigator tics.</comment>
