<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. initiate—is vivid and embodied (finger on glass, forehead on glass). The final renunciation is earned: he re-tunes the prophecy and walks away, losing his sky kingdom. Interiority occasionally slides into abstract labels (“turbulence in his soul”) instead of concrete sensation, muting pressure. Still, the split heart drives every beat and the cost is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias refuses both factions, forecloses the observatory path, and pays with exile; the cost is legible in the final image of his boots on mud. Causal chain holds: altered frequencies → dispersed crowd → his descent. One continuous scene, one implicit transition (dawn); orientation anchored by ~100 words. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory is tactile: cobalt glass trembles under lightning, vacuum tubes glow amber, rain patterns shift. Micro-setting of the radio bench constrains the final act of retuning. Spatial choreography clean—no floating bodies. Weather directly shapes choice: clearing storm signals moment to leave. Final image reweights the cobalt glass from isolation to abandoned relic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who controls the next dawn—signaled early via prophecy fragments. Escalation: each radio burst narrows Elias’s options until he must sabotage Maren’s certainty. Visible price: 30-year exile above clouds ends, notebooks left behind. Agency is internal—frequency shift—but causally decisive. No coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: every pure light casts necessary shadow; dawn requires darkness. No moralizing final sentence—meaning crystallizes in the image of empty observatory awaiting “another heart divided enough to see whole truths.” Ambiguity is coherent: reader left to decide if Elias saved or doomed the world. Subtext carried by weather and radio static, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is astronomer-poet: clouds become “shifting patterns of human destiny,” glass “luminous with captured storm energy.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“The observatory will fall. Or the prophet shall.”) No filter-verb clutter; metaphors stay within science-mystic lexicon. Voice modulation mirrors storm crescendo and quiet dawn exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density: “cobalt glass portico trembled as lightning struck nearby, its deep blue suddenly luminous with captured storm energy” does three jobs—sensory, plot, symbol. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor—“map drawn in static”—but cleared immediately by radio imagery. Final line cadence matches quiet resignation. Minor: occasional adjective padding (“weathered notebooks”) could trim.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomer-as-prophet sabotaging another prophet via radio interference, using storm physics and ancient heresy. Not a trope clone. Conceptual risk—lyric prophecy inside hard-science framing—pays off without gimmickry. Specific detail (vacuum tubes, frequency dial) grounds the mystic. Could edge higher if Elias’s forbidden texts had sharper particulars, but angle feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
