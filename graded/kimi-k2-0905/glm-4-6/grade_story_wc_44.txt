<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s calmly obsessive focus feels consistent and specific—“quietly deliberate” fingers, steady hands while heart hammers—yet her interiority stays in descriptive, slightly generic “mystery-scholar” register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the micro-choice hierarchy is asserted rather than performed. The moment she slams the console is the only visible decision that costs her physically; earlier calibration steps read as competent procedure, not flaw-driven error. The ending stance (resolve to keep hunting) is credible, but the cost is atmospheric, not character-internal. Still, the lens of lone academic obsession is vivid enough to propel every beat without head-count clutter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fissure seals, key cools, and exile-rule of shadows is rewritten—Elara now knows they are “exiled,” not lost; this re-weighting carries conceptual cost (her work is endless). Causality under Causal lens is clean: key insertion → star correction → fissure opening → shadow incursion → forced final loop → exile re-established. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60. One meaningful tightening: the star-chart glitch feeds the antagonist, forcing her final palm-slam. Light-eruption resolves conflict, but price is collective (eternal vigilance), not personal wound, so cost is legible but not viscerally felt by Elara’s body.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory functions as micro-setting: brass-edged lens, concentric floor rings, and automaton key constrain every move; she can’t act without interfacing with these objects. Eternal twilight and floating-isle altitude remain atmospheric backdrop, but spatial choreography inside the dome is exact—she kneels, slams console, key glows—so body-tool-environment triad is coherent. Sensory filtering is biased toward tactile metal and glowing amber, matching scholar POV. The final image—motes sinking into isle soil—recharges the setting by revealing the isle itself as prison, giving the locale conceptual cost. Meets 9+ gate: observatory/tools constrain tactics and color final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where shadows go”—is signaled in paragraph 1; pressure escalates when their personified avatar invades, threatening obliteration. Escalation is because/therefore causal: each corrected star tightens the breach, inviting stronger shadow retaliation, narrowing her options to one—complete the alignment or die. Final beat forecloses open research: she learns exile-truth, commits to endless guard; cost is conceptual rather than bodily, but visible in her slump and cooling key. Coincidence absent; all turns flow from her calibration choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: knowledge pursuit as perpetual exile-cycle—shadows banished, scholar self-exiled to vigil. No moralizing statement; wisdom confined to final whispered realization. Recurrent “loop” motif (literal/existential) reweights from technical task to life sentence. Ambiguity preserved: mending the world may require endless sacrifice. Slight softness: epiphany is articulated (“she realized”) rather than purely imaged, docking minor points.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is metal-first, light-second, echoing rune-focus. Syntax alternates between precise Latinate calibration verbs and shorter, percussive beats under threat (“She slammed her palm”). No dialogue, so voice purity is uninterrupted. Register stays within scholar lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Final cooling key image crystallizes voice alignment with object-obsession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“stars … like shattered glass” is single, apt simile. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and tactile stakes; final line resolves with charged key and drifting isle, re-echoing “quietly deliberate.” One minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” diction slightly above POV, but occurs once and does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: shadow physics as exile-mechanism, rune scholar using astronomical loops to diagnose metaphysical banishment—tropes fused through tactile metal/amber imagery. Premise commits fully; no retreat to generic evil. Risk of abstract stakes is countered by keyed machine and soil swallowing darkness, rooting concept in sensory payoff. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the specific brass-key & star-alignment logic collapses. Not quite paradigm-shifting, but memorable, risky, and internally inevitable.</comment>
