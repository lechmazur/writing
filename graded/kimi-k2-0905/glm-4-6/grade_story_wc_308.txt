<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete—calloused thumb on stone, vibration-sight—but the “singular, almost absurd” motive is declared rather than dramatized. The final attunement is earned; the arrowhead’s warmth supplies a sensory cost, fulfilling the 9+ quick test. Still, no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; the shift is epiphanic, not conflict-driven, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the towers turn from prison to resonant chambers, cost felt in the arrowhead’s pulse. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of echoes reweights space. Causality is lyric, not sequential, but pattern is taught early and paid off. One scaffold loop: “He would learn…he would cast…” subtracts 0.2, leaving 8.7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bone towers and dust function as micro-setting: their hollow acoustics constrain Kael’s method and charge the final flip from bars to chambers. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—vibration before sight. Spatial choreography is stable; the canyon edge and tower base remain anchored. The setting’s reclassification is indispensable to closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—map the world without moving—tightens when the arrowhead’s stolen consciousness offers a proximate tool; options narrow from abstract quest to imminent “first note.” Cost is conceptual, not visceral; no tangible loss is risked. Escalation is single-wave, sufficient for sub-800-word scope but shy of the visible price needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via attunement-as-freedom: navigation through memory rather than motion. No explicit thesis; final image of “sing his first note” reweights prior solitude into agency. Ambiguity lingers—does he leave or stay?—but complexity is embraced. The arrowhead’s vessel idea crystallizes the moral calculus without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Voice is perceptually specific—harmonic skimmer diction of frequency, pulse, vibration—held without slippage. Syntax mirrors attention: long clauses for wind-sighs, staccato “He wouldn’t throw it for distance” pre-action. No dialogue, so register coherence is internal; diction stays within plausible loner lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into the final cast, earning the 9+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet airy—information dual-tasking every line. No loops; “stone” recurs with shifting charge. Metaphor vehicles stay physical (ink-splash crows, vortex of feathers) and coherent. Minor over-modification: “river-washed surface of a flat stone” could trim, but momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartography via harmonic attunement to relics—is fresh synthesis of fantasy sensorium and psychological map. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure reconfiguration. Crows-as-data and bone-towers-as-library transform familiar desert-isolation trope. Slight proximity to “ancient artifact whispers past” conventions keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
