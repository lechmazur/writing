<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—atomically reflective skin as both shield and mirror of isolation—but her “brittle awakenings” remain abstract labels until the final line. The shift from curse to opportunity is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice on the page enacts the turn. The sundial-touch is the closest we get to embodied decision, yet it triggers no visible cost or irreversible change. Motivation is coherent, but the climactic reframe feels pre-announced rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s shadow moves to her consciousness, reweighting solitude into guardianship with felt cost (“shield against oblivion”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of morning rituals and memory surfacing—held cleanly to the end. Orientation is swift: who, where, when anchored by word 80. No meaningful tightening mid-text; pressure plateaus rather than escalates, keeping the piece just below the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The tidal library, brass sundial, and stone circle hum are sensuously particular and return to charge the final image. Spatial grounding is secure: floating sanctuary, cloud banks below, stone circle center. Weather and cosmic tides mirror emotional cadence without overt symbolism. Environment never constrains a tactical choice, so it stops short of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure is steady-state memory-sorrow; no mid-story beat narrows options or raises price. The final reframe is insight, not irreversible action; cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Escalation remains flat under Accumulative lens, satisfying the single-deepening requirement but lacking a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of solitary guardianship emerges through recurring sundial-and-memory imagery rather than assertion. Final image of “independent bridge” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext operates in the hum frequency she alone hears, implying continuity beyond species death. One hairline echo of prompt language (“brittle awakenings”) appears in final paragraph, nudging score down from 8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains metallic, celestial diction that reflects Elara’s alien sensorium. Rhythm swells and ebbs like the library itself, mirroring emotional tides without monotony. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs (“she thought she heard”) are sparse and motivated by uncertainty; perceptual signature remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“atomically reflective,” “tidal library”) and pays off at closure. One mixed-metaphor risk—“crystalline shell around her heart”—but physical logic holds. Information density strong; every sentence advances memory, image, or emotional cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Last Dragon-Kin archiving extinct species through cosmic library is fresh, yet “final of her kind” and “floating archive” are recognizable tropes. Specificity of atomically reflective skin and sundial tracking consciousness elevates the frame. No bold structural risk; lyric accumulative mode is safe choice. Transformation test passes: Elara’s guardianship stance could not swap into another setting without collapse.</comment>
