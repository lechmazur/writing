<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is viscerally embodied (the watch hand burns his palm); his contradictory drives—profit from false memories vs. need for Mara’s absolution—collide in the final invitation to the shore. Micro-choices (placing the gear on the railing, voice cracking) show a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The earned shift: confessing complicity while still clinging to the ritual that got him there—inviting her into the driftwood confessional—feels both flawed and inevitable. His eidetic-yet-erased sister memory is the one unmotivated blank; it nicks the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: “As long as you understand… carrying it alone” reweights the premise—shared burden may be lighter, or heavier, but the option is now legible. The watch hand’s reappearance in Mara’s fist crystallizes the cost of every prior beat. Causal chain holds: false memories → brother’s suicide → terrace confrontation → invitation to shared ritual. No off-stage resolution; every turn is on-page under an Accumulative/Textural lens that lands clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace at dusk is never backdrop: color leaches into violet/blood, mirroring guilt’s temperature; the railing becomes the literal fulcrum where the gear—and truth—are placed. The “forgotten shore” acts as micro-setting whose etched driftwood carvings serve as confessional booth; their tactile use in the final invitation makes the environment constrain choice. Spatial choreography is flawless: Mara’s measured steps across the terrace stones echo minefield metaphor. One hairline slip: “cobalt” is over-repeated (three times), barely grazing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias share the unbearable weight—tightens when Mara closes her fist around the gear, foreclosing solo penance. Escalation is textural: each mention of “sieved hush” adds density until the filter finally lets the suicide truth through. Visible price is the invitation itself—he risks losing the solitary ritual that has kept him functioning. Slight reserve: the brother’s suicide is declared, not dramatized, so cost is conceptual more than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse equation: shared guilt may weigh less—or more—than hidden guilt, never stated, only enacted in the gear hand-off. “Sieved hush” motif shifts from muteness to filter-rupture; driftwood confessional reprises as communal act. No moralizing; final line leaves the answer literally in someone else’s eyes. The cobalt color wheel (sea → terrace → twilight) quietly re-prices memory as something that can be collaboratively re-carved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a precise perceptual signature: regret is “the same color as the terrace,” time is a detached gear tooth. Syntax tightens under pressure—“His fingers unconsciously traced…”—then fractures into the cracked admission. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual: “Ready to talk about it?” cuts the hush like glass, the glass image that has already described their brittle marriage. No head-hop; Mara’s interior is legible only through Elias’s biased reading of her sculptor’s eye.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is selective, each metaphor carrying weight: “guilt had settled in him like a disease” justifies the terrace’s viral color spread. No mixed metaphors; “sieved hush” maintains acoustic filter logic throughout. Rhythm breathes with beats—long sentence for terrace sweep, fragment for gear placement. Only micro-loop: “the same color as his regrets” echoes earlier “same color as the terrace”; the tautology is purposeful, but still a blip.</comment>

<comment>The false-memory black-market genealogist who cannot remember his own sister is a fresh, non-obvious irony; the driftwood shore as confessional converts a familiar grief-ritual into a collaborative forensic act. Conceptual integrity: the story refuses to resolve whether shared guilt is lighter—leaves the couple walking toward an uncertain tide. Risk in the quiet, image-driven ending pays off because the gear hand-off makes the cost undeniable. Minor proximity to “frozen sea” trope is re-inflected through cobalt specificity.</comment>
