<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory selves—crisis-actor performer and near-drowned survivor—are vividly anchored in body memory; the tremor before touching the board, the knee that buckles at missing pawns, makes internal conflict physical. Motive progression is legible: from performing trauma to collecting “small gestures,” each micro-choice (kneeling, tracing squares, spelling words in dust) pays off the mission to unbind performance from lived pain. Cost is felt: the final “remember” is an earned renunciation of further performance, knees already gray with dust. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; slight over-reliance on abstract noun phrases (“luminous void”) keeps it from 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: the absent pawns trigger the pattern of walking → spelling → unbinding; each lap tightens the same question—how to archive what is missing. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “gesture” traced in fresh dust crystallizes her new stance; cost is visible in her cracked knees and echoed breath. Orientation is taught early via acoustics, marble, board; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern intensifies rather than reverses; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rotunda acoustics and echoing footstep-scuffs are exploited, not just described: the whisper returns her own words as external confirmation. Chessboard as micro-setting constrains movement—kneeling, tracing squares—its geometry dictating the choreography of grief. Dust (visual, tactile) is handled twice and reappears charged in the final “gesture”; fulfills 9+ gate. Sparse but selective detail keeps spatial line clean; broader D.C. interregnum atmosphere implied, not dumped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering erased stories via small gestures—signals in sentence-3 and deepens with each traced word; tightening occurs when missing pawns force her to write “survive” rather than merely observe. Escalation is textural: each spelled word adds moral weight; the final “remember” is the visible forfeit of anonymity (she leaves legible evidence). Agency remains hers; no external coincidence. Cost (knees, breath, exposure) is legible; could be sharper for 8.5+ but meets 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—history resides in absences, not monuments—emerges through recurring empty squares and final dust-script; no explicit moralizing. Subtext in silence: the hush between governments parallels her hush between selves. Luminous absence as motif accrues explanatory power rather than decoration; image of unseen pawns reframed as invitation, not void. Complexity preserved: no tidy claim that documentation heals, only that it must be done.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice: lyrical, slightly elevated diction fits an archivist-poet; rhythmic repetition (“each step…each letter…each exhalation”) taught early and modulates under pressure. No dialogue, so focus is narrative texture: long sentences mirror circling gait, short fragments at peaks (“She kneeled.”) mimic breath-catch. Perceptual signature—dust motes as data, echoes as archive—remains coherent. Occasional abstraction (“nomadic penumbra actualizing”) borders on register drift but stays within POV’s self-coined lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong information density: a single sentence often layers metaphor, motion, and thematic reprise (“chessboard without pawns became a metaphor…”). Metaphors are internally coherent (echoes = seeds, absence = invitation) and avoid muddled logic. Rhythm varies: cumulative clauses imitate circling, then tighten into punch-clauses. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; no filters clogging immediacy. Occasional elevated phrasing is earned by lyric mode; closure beat remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: crisis-actor skill repurposed as historiographic method; walking-spelling as data-entry in a building that “collects” official truths. Risk of preciousness is averted by anchoring every abstract coin in sensory grit (dust, knee-ache). Absent-pawn metaphor could feel schematic but gains irreversibility when she literally writes inside their vacancy. Specificity—not gimmick—drives originality; remove any detail (echo, board, dust) and arc collapses.</comment>
