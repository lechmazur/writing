<comment>The prophet’s solitary, ritualized music-making gives a consistent, embodied motive—“turn obstacles into instruments”—but no interior contradiction or escalating choice ever tests that creed; the mallet strikes only fruit, never a true dilemma, so the promised “visible cost” never lands on the page.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sonic layer thickens texture toward a Charged Poise that reweights survival as endless composition.  Yet the closure, while resonant, lacks a felt price—no option is foreclosed, no tangible loss attached—and the orchard’s rules (saltwater trees, bone mallet) are taught only by assertion, not through causal trial, so the reconfiguration stays conceptual rather than costly.</comment>

<comment>The floating salt-orchard is vividly particular: hollow fruit bells, hook wind-chimes, driftwood deck that vibrates underfoot.  These micro-settings double as instruments, constraining every sound the prophet can draw, and the final image of the spinning circle charging the night sky is inseparable from the music’s meaning—setting literally charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes are announced early—“survival made music”—but pressure never tightens; no storm, visitor, or resource limit forces a trade-off.  The prophet’s agency remains static (tap, listen, dub), so escalation is purely additive texture rather than a narrowing of options or a rising price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: survival as endless, fractal music.  The final silence-then-next-note image reweights the ordeal without moralizing, offering a quiet Conceptual Repricing that life continues because the prophet keeps composing—an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at poetic distance, diction salted with nautical precision (“stillescence,” “orchust”) yet never drifts from the prophet’s synesthetic ear.  Rhythmic mirroring of wave cadence and sonic layering is deliberate, consistent, and paid off in the hush-to-next-bar ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm surges and ebbs like tide; clauses carry triple duty (image, sound, motion) with almost no scaffold.  One paraphrase loop—“each obstacle found its note, each challenge its rhythm”—is forgiven because it serves as mantra, not filler, and arrives before the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The salt-water orchard that sings rather than feeds is a fresh, risk-laden conceit; the fractal-dubbing survival method fuses music theory and maritime drift in a way that would collapse if any component were swapped.  The prophet’s smile into the next blue hour feels inevitable yet non-obvious—originality earned, not asserted.</comment>
