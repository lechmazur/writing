<comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—guilt over the shutdown vs. his need to keep navigating—stays embodied in tiny, credible acts: fingers tracing the compass, breath held at the shimmer. The “blessed pariah” label is shown, not told, through the station’s frozen panic hologram and his solitary vigil. His micro-choice to draw the ghost-sky rather than the memory-sky is a visible pivot that costs him the comfort of nostalgia, earning the explorer stance. No other character is on stage, so relationship bullets are N/A; headroom to 8+ would need a sharper external test of his flaw.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: “because” he sketches, he sees the overlay; “therefore” he redraws, re-inscribing his exile as cartography. The closure beat—aligning fresh sketch to compass while the phantom sky fades—pays off the setup of the family custom and reweights “true north” from myth to self-made bearing. Cost is legible: the old commemorative sky is abandoned, the silence now “alive with potential.” One minor grind: the phrase “quiet mantra” is abstract summary just before the first custom use; a concrete cue would tighten orientation.</comment>

<comment>The deck, compass, and window glass operate as micro-setting: the compass’s metallic chill and the plasteel’s reflection are returned at the climax to steady his new bearing. Temporal dilation is sensed through narrowed perception—“seconds could feel like eternities”—rather than exposition dump. The glitched hologram below anchors the shutdown timeline without a tourist catalog. Environment never stalls momentum; instead, the shimmer on the glass literally bends the usable sky he must chart.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can he convert isolation into meaningful navigation?—tightens once: the ghost sky appears, forcing the switch from remembrance to discovery. That single reversal narrows his options to “map or sink,” a visible trade-off paid by abandoning the half-finished memory sketch. Agency remains causal under the lens; coincidence (the shimmer) complicates but does not save him. A crisper material loss—charcoal snapped, parchment torn—would have pushed the cost to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without labels: the idea that direction is made, not found, is dramatized when he turns a mourning ritual into a surveying tool. The compass re-anchors from “relic of a sane world” to active instrument, re-pricing nostalgia as forward motion. Silence modulates from tomb-like to “alive,” a sonic image that reconfigures exile. No paragraph sermonizes; the final smile is earned specificity, not sentiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays inside Elias’s perceptual filter—“echoing silence,” “black velvet canvas”—with rhythmic, slightly archaic cadence that fits a lone chrononaut. Compression is taught early (“tomb of echoes, where silence stretched like taffy”) and paid off in the closing “scratch of charcoal… a sound of defiance.” No head-hop, no filter-verb glut. Dialogue is absent by design; voice remains coherent and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong density: “gilded compass rose applique he’d salvaged from the bridge” does triple duty—object history, tactile focus, thematic seed—in one phrase. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (taffy, velvet, smoke). One paraphrase loop—“silence… echoing silence” in adjacent clauses—dings −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with action. Closure image is clean, no purple flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Temporal-castaway trope is refreshed by making the survivor’s hated decision (pulling the plug) the very skill that lets him read splintered skies. Sky-sketching as cartographic rebellion is a fresh inflection of the old “sailor maps stars” motif. Risky structural choice—single reflective scene, no antagonist—pays off because the ghost sky supplies external pressure without personifying it. Feels inevitable in hindsight: only a pariah who broke time could see between timelines.</comment>
