<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet, methodical nature is consistently rendered through embodied detail—peripheral vision, brass-fitting fingers—yet the interior contradiction between “store wonder” and the cavern’s fading magic is asserted rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat. The final act of boxing the crystal is credible, but the cost feels administrative, not visceral; we see no moment where he forfeits an alternative path. Competence overshadows flaw; the risk of failure is theoretical, so the earned quality of his quiet smile is moderate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing crystal in velvet reweights the premise—wonder is now portable, the cavern’s future uncertain—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: shattered timer → studied angles → repaired harvest → stored echo, each beat tightening the pattern. Orientation is swift; marble cavern, solitary locksmith, wounded season are anchored within 60 words. The only minor drag is the mid-story reflective block that pauses momentum without altering present tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble acoustics are not backdrop but instrument: the north passage sings at noon, the western wall gathers children’s laughter, every surface calibrated to Elian’s peripheral ear. Light angles, crystal facets, and velvet box form a micro-setting chain that directly enables the harvest and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—sound first, light second—integrating setting into action without tourist catalog. One hairline slip: “frozen ripples in a timeless pond” edges toward postcard, but the cavern’s acoustic life quickly reclaims specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder before the season heals barren—is signaled early and tightens through each acoustic measurement. No external antagonist is needed; the “wounded season” acts as coherent pressure, deepening toward the final quiet. Escalation is accumulative: each mapped angle increases the potential loss, narrowing to the single morning test. Cost is present but abstract—the cavern’s future silence—rather than a concrete forfeiture felt by Elian in body or choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: conservation of the ephemeral against practical world’s advance. No character moralizes; the timer’s whir and the crystal’s aurora do the arguing. The final image—box glowing in a cellar of reason—reweights “reason” from practicality to archival reverence without stating the shift. Ambiguity lingers: will anyone ever open the box? That uncertainty feels earned, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual signature—sound before sight, angles before explanation—syntax calm and latinate, mirroring a locksmith’s patience. No head-hop; even the children’s laughter is filtered through his peripheral ear. Occasional elevated diction (“codex of how echoes were captured”) risks register drift but remains consistent with his reflective precision. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for study, clipped fragments at the test moment, then quiet cadence for exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: “He fitted brass custom-worked components, adjusted resonant frequencies, calibrated…” carries three jobs in one line. Figurative control is tight—echoes as condensation, cellar of reason—without mixed-metaphor clutter. One minor loop: “wounded season” is repeated three times in close proximity; trimming one would sharpen. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; the final image lands clean and luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The echo-harvest locksmith is a fresh synthesis: part sound-engineer, part memory-archivist, rooted in tactile brass rather than sci-fi console. Marble cavern as acoustic tape-deck feels inevitable in hindsight, yet not borrowed from familiar tropes. Risk is taken in quietness—no villain, no explosion—but the stakes remain legible through sensory specificity. One could swap “wounded season” for “dying year” with minor edits, a trace of swappability that keeps it just under the 9.0 gate.</comment>
