<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—selfish seeker vs. sacred pilgrim—remains active in every beat; the embodied tremor-language and ring-warmth keep emotion off the diagnostic couch. The final renunciation (mapless, note-less) is earned by the prior dowsed melody and costs him his former identity. Micro-choices (bare feet, splay-fingered dowsing) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Flaw is not hedged: blindness is not super-power, stillpoint does not cure, only re-weights.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: “he finally saw” reconfigures the premise—stillpoint is state, not place—cost is the cooling ring and the forever-internal map he now carries. Causal lens holds: each note-reception tightens options until silence is the only remaining path. Orientation anchor (“the ultrasonic forest”) appears by word 18; no debt. No teleporting props; ring’s language-absorption is set up early and paid off in the final cooling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest functions as micro-setting: the trees’ frequencies and yielding floor constrain how Kael moves and senses; ring and bark are the handled “tools” that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—sound/touch over sight—selective and urgent. Spatial choreography is clean: each forward step is a reaction to a new note, no impossible positions. Weather is absent but not needed; world rule (ultrasonic hum) stays consistent and learned through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet the internal storm—signals early and tightens with each note: C minor → G sharp → B flat progressively narrows external noise to internal silence. Agency is present: Kael chooses to kneel under the B-flat blow, accepting the cost of silence. No external antagonist needed; conflict is situational-pressure vs. endurance. Visible price: the ring cools, the forest hush becomes irreversible, foreclosing his former mapmaker identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of mapping: external cartography collapses into internal stillness. The final image—“a single, perfect note”—reweights all prior sonic detail without moralizing. Subtextual tension between selfish quest and sacred discovery remains unresolved, offering ambiguous resonance. No abstract thesis statements; insight is earned through the concrete dowsing sequence and the cooling ring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: tactile tremor-grammar, taste of honey on the tongue, ring-warmth under fingernails. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long lyrical cadence early, short clauses at B-flat crescendo. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Elision (“an hour later”) is taught early and paid off in accelerando toward stillpoint. Diction stays within plausible blind mapmaker lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does two jobs—“the ground itself spoke to him in tremors” reveals world rule + character method. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent: “yielding like a lover’s sigh” keeps tactile consistency. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Minor register elevation (“liquid sunlight”) is brief and motivated by epiphanic moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: blind mapmaker + ultrasonic forest + musical dowsing feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test fails if Kael is swapped for sighted cartographer—blindness is integral to tremor-language. Risky lyric escalatio succeeds: accumulative note-trail replaces traditional plot reversals. No close echoes of famous scenes; premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
