<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s gentle, almost devotional stewardship of silence is embodied in every micro-gesture (kneeling, palm-cool vial, slow exhale), but her interiority never cracks into contradiction or visible cost; the motive stays singular, serene, untested by a counter-impulse. No relationship on stage means no status crucible; the terraces act as chorus, not pressure. The result is a lyrical persona more than a dynamically flawed agent, so the “change” is atmospheric, not character-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the prisms soften, the vial clears, the hush becomes “a lullaby”—a perceptual reconfiguration that costs her nothing visible and forecloses no path. Causality is accumulative: each orbit and breath thickens texture until quiet “learns” comfort. The lens holds, the image lands, but the price is purely conceptual; a tougher editor wants a drop of sweat or a relinquished chance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is protagonist: the prism terrace refracts both starlight and Elara’s attention, its facets steering every slow-breath decision; the gondola rails, storm-glass base, and orbital drift physically anchor the scene. Sensory triage is POV-true—she notes hush over hue, temperature over topography—so the world never feels catalogued. Micro-setting (vial, rail, prism base) repeatedly constrains gesture and timing, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stake is single—restore acoustic balance—signalled early. Pressure accumulates via vial clouding and hum deepening, but the tightening is atmospheric, not strategic; no option is closed, no tactic altered, no visible price exacted. Escalation is textural, which fits the lens, yet lacks a beat where Elara must renounce or risk something tangible. Peace arrives as gift, not trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as learnable solace—emerges through prismatic light and vial clarity, never articulated. The final lullaby image reweights the train-echo void without sermon. Complexity is modest: no counter-argument to silence’s value is allowed on stage, so the idea feels pure rather than tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric hover stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“fluidly logical,” “fractal hues”) is consistent with her vocation. Rhythm duplicates orbital sway—long sentences, comma drift, no drumbeat—so voice becomes music matching motion. No dialogue, no head-hop, no register rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each sentence layers sense-stuff while advancing orbit or breath. Minor loop traces appear (“the vial was... still” x2) yet never stall the final image. Metaphors stay physically coherent (light as breath, terrace as lung), avoiding purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The floating prism garden tuned by sonic cartography is a fresh speculative micro-world; the storm-glass-as-db-meter repurposes Victoriana into meteorological tech. Conceptual risk is quiet—no rebellion, no violence—yet the piece commits fully to its low-temperature novum. reader recall will hinge on the hush-made-lullaby, a memorable reconfiguration of ordinary silence.</comment>
