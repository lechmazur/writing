<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession is credibly rooted in his trade; the crystal-handling choice dramatizes his will to “teach dust.” Yet the interiority stays atmospheric (“his heart pounded”) rather than contradictory; no genuine flaw complicates the final act, so the renunciation feels pure, not costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the humming crystal reweights the orchestra hall from tomb to library under an Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric rather than tight—lyrics “shift like sand”—but the final image (“dust danced around him”) crystallizes the new status with undeniable conceptual cost: the broadcast ends, Elias becomes conductor of silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The ember alcove’s mist, dial-glow, and hollowed-out book function as micro-setting that literally houses the crystal; these tactile objects constrain the discovery beat and charge the final image when their glow fades to “whisper.” Spatial choreography stays clean; orchestra pit, archives, and alcove orbit logically around Elias’s traverse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—restore stories—tightens when the lyric指令 “Find the ember…” forces a single discovery; the dust’s rising glow is the visible price that reweights the hall. No secondary antagonist, but the “story famine” acts as situational pressure; escalation is poetic, not causal, yet the final silence of the radio still registers forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulates: dust as both residue and seed of narrative. The closing “thistled calm” reprises earlier velvet-dust imagery, reconfiguring extinction into germination without sermon. The concept of “teaching dust” stays oblique, inviting reflection on preservation vs. creation; ambiguity is purposeful, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “mist curled around him like a cloak of forgotten time.” Syntax swells with lyrical anaphora but breathes at crisis (“He took the crystal…”). No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction; “ember alcove,” “story famine,” and “thistled calm” coin fresh idiom without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary length and opening; no filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective (“dust motes in the sun”) and never muddies causality. High information density—each clause adds sensory or emotional tilt; “the broadcast’s voice lingered, a secret hum” compresses aftermath into one resonant phrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “story famine” trope is familiar, but the dust-as-medium and pirate lyric-signal freshen it. Risk is quiet: lyric accumulation rather than twist. Specificity of orchestra copyist labor grounds the magic; transformation test fails if dust becomes generic memory, but here dust is literally animated by song, making the concept inseparable from setting.</comment>
