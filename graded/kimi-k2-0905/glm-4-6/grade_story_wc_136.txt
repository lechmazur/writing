<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mapper’s contradictory impulses—precision versus surrender to the uncanny—are dramatized in the moment he presses the punch to the gate; the trembling hand, frost-breath, and boots sinking into fog embody fear and resolve at once. Yet the interiority leans on stock phrase “mix of dread and exhilaration” and awards himself a therapeutic summary smile at the end, blunting ambiguity. The punch’s weight and warmth give two tactile beats, but no secondary character presses him, so status crucible is absent. The arc lands as renunciation rather than conquest, satisfying Earned Stasis, but the cost feels conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the punch dissolves, the mirrors shatter, the mapper walks away, leaving the fortress open but unoccupied—an undeniable before/after. Causal linkage holds: each arrow-crack he follows tightens options until the gate demands the punch as key, no coincidence. Orientation is clear by line 60. Minor flaw: “the hour that divides bad habits and new starts” is announced twice rather than shown by clock or chime, but this does not rupture the lens. Accumulation cap applies for one soft reset—mirrors break without cutting him, a fleeting safety hedge—yet the final image reconfigures meaning, so cap is −0.8, not fatal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The starlit vault, mist-thick tracks, and phantom platform form a micro-setting that actively liquefies underfoot, forcing the mapper to treat fog as solid ground—an environmental constraint that charges the final image. Lantern-circle, frost-breath, and punch-weight narrow perception to immediate survival tools, never sliding into tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: arrows converge, gate looms, hall of mirrors sequenced without position drift. The setting’s rule—“cracks glow and widen”—is taught early and paid off when the gate consumes the punch, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to unspoken truths—tightens when arrows stop at the sealed gate, converting the punch from tool to price. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: each step he chooses narrows retreat until the gate demands the punch’s sacrifice. Cost is visible—loss of the punch and confrontation with shattered selves—but the mirrors break without physical harm, slightly softening visceral price. Still, the final renunciation forecloses return, satisfying the lens under Causal track.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the journey matters more than the fortress, truth is plural and self-birthed. Mirrors fragment the mapper into buried selves, reweighting “unspoken truths” from destination to internal cartography. No moralizing line tells us this; the open gate and walked-away path enact the insight. The punch’s dissolution into mist offers a lyrical Conceptual Repricing that lingers without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice sustains a hushed, moon-lit register—long vowels, trembling lantern, starlit vault—without purple drift. Syntax lengthens then compresses under pressure, mirroring the mapper’s analytical artistry: “He’d mapped routes before, but tonight’s path was invisible…” Perceptual signature is sharp—he notices cracks, ink-bleeding maps, cold metal weight—never explaining what he already knows. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal diction stays consistent, avoiding filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are few and coherent—mist as shroud, spires as needles—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies: opening clause-chain gives way to fragment bursts at gate breach. Minor scaffold: “the arrows ahead glowed faintly, their light pulsing like a lantern at the end of a tunnel” re-states visibility already implied; paraphrase loop triggers −0.2. No template cadence, no artifact in final third, so 9+ not disallowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartographer + phantom train + cracked pavement arrows feels inevitable yet uncannily new. The punch-as-key and mirrors-as-truths transform familiar quest tropes into internal topography without exposition dumps. Risk—walking onto fog-solid tracks—pays off when fog becomes the final mirror. While echoes of “phantom train” and “fortress of truths” flirt with allegory, specificity of frost, lantern, and ticket punch anchors the concept in sensory life.</comment>
