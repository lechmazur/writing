<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Librarian’s interiority is lyrically rendered but generic—no idiosyncratic contradiction or micro-choice until the palm-to-palette beat. Emotion stays atmospheric (“a sudden swell of belonging”) rather than embodied friction. The final stance is crystallized, but cost is diffuse; no path is foreclosed with visible price, so renunciation reads as gentle acceptance rather than Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the palette’s glow reweights the archipelago’s absence into presence. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than because/therefore; pattern is taught early and held. Anchor (who/where/when) is lyrically delayed but ultimately functional to closure; no orientation penalty. Cost is conceptual—dream now resident—but not sharply felt on the page, capping the score just below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s engine: tide-worn shelves, lantern-fractured gold, sunrise hues on a palette that literally constrains the librarian’s actions. “Whispering archipelago” is never mapped, yet its sighs, mangroves, and gull-cries pressure the ritual. Micro-setting (palette-as-tool) charges the final image; environment, body, and object are inseparable. Proper-noun economy is perfect—no place names wasted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early; pressure intensifies by accumulating light strokes rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: the palette’s glow surges only when palm meets surface at sunrise, narrowing success to this single moment. Cost is conceptual (shared dream transferred), not tangible; price is felt but not visibly forfeited. Escalation is lyric-densifying rather than option-narrowing, appropriate to accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reconfiguration of longing from absence to resident light; no moral is stated. Motif of “cipher” remains abstract—never enacted as concrete puzzle—so subtext is carried by image alone. Final image (palette pulsing in sync with heartbeat) offers non-literal answer: longing is not solved but inhabited. Avoids overt thesis, though “luminous absence” edges toward prompt-echo; kept below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric POV maintains consistent perceptual signature—attention to fractured gold, dew-kissed archives, liquid memory. Syntax lengthens and contracts with dawn’s crawl; no head-hop or register drift. Palette, camera, and sunrise are rendered through tactile, biased noticing. Voice modulates from hushed reverence to quiet triumph without breaking diction ceiling; near 9.0 but final paragraph softens rhythm slightly too much.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; metaphor density peaks in the opening 100 words, risking purple, but pattern is taught early and paid off. Occasional soft repeats—“light” appears 8× in 800 words—create shimmer rather than loop. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final third stays legible, allowing 8-band, but “luminous absence” phrase recurs without fresh inflection, holding it below 8.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Premise—librarian painting dawnlight into a dream-capturing palette—is non-obvious and executed with conceptual integrity. Tropes (librarian, sunrise, archipelago) are transformed through sensory specificity and ritual logic. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over causal plot could feel ephemeral, but coherence holds. Fresh angle on “capturing dreams” via light-as-paint keeps it above median originality.</comment>
