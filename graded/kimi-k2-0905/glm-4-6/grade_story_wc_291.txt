<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s face-blindness and ritualized method are consistently dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tweezers, charcoal strokes). The interior contradiction—he can’t see faces yet “sees” ghosts in evidence—drives every beat and culminates in the Earned Stasis of leaving the portrait on the museum steps. Cost is legible: he forfeits recognition and comfort, carrying “the weight of Lena’s story” into the fog. Minor slip: the abstract label “dormant empathy” is stated rather than embodied, blunting peak pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait-as-resonance reweights the quarry from mute absence to felt presence. Causal chain holds—ribbon find → sketch process → portrait completion → abandonment ritual—each step foreclosing retreat. Accumulated imagery (mist, charcoal, crimson slash) tightens the stake without external coincidence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; one deepening suffices. The conceptual cost is undeniable: Elias’s lifelong estrangement from faces is reinforced, not cured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The quarry, ribbon, and charcoal tools are not backdrop but tactical constraints: damp stone smudges lines, silk ribbon dictates color palette, mist obscures distance and time. Spatial choreography is immaculate—body, tweezers, paper, rock surface tracked without drift. Weather (mist, cold) directly governs pace and perception narrowing. The abandoned museum steps re-enter as closure site, completing an environmental loop. 9+ gate met: the ribbon-as-tool crystallizes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy via artifact resurrection—is signaled early and deepens through each charcoal stroke. One meaningful tightening: the ribbon’s crimson bleed into mist turns the quarry from mute dump to tear-veiled witness. Protagonist agency is continuous; no external coincidence intervenes. Cost is conceptual: Elias accepts perpetual alienation from living faces to gift the town a mirror. Sufficient for 8-band; lacks a second irreversible forfeiture that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inexorably from method: empathy is not recognition but resonance built from fragments. The opposition stone/silk, absence/presence, life/death is re-priced in the final image—portrait as veil of forgotten tears—without overt statement. Subtext lives in gesture: folding the paper “carefully” equals a burial. The refusal to supply a face keeps moral ambiguity intact. Only hairline slip: the phrase “world that had forgotten how to grieve” drifts toward thesis; earlier particulars already earned it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is a controlled lyric third-person, compressed yet rhythmic: “stone lips parted by mist” teaches metaphoric pattern immediately. Perceptual signature is Elias’s synesthetic attention—color as emotion, texture as identity—maintained without filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so indirection and subtext operate through image and silence. Final sentence’s fog swallowing the quarry echoes the opening yawn, completing taught cadence. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” territory but stays within POV’s artistic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: each sentence layers job—advances charcoal stroke, deepens mist, re-crimsons ribbon. No scaffold loops; synonym churn absent. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ribbon as lifeline, mist as veil). One mixed image—“quarry’s breath cold on his neck”—is instantly disambiguated by tactile context. Clause variety and paragraph rhythms modulate with pressure peaks. Copy-clean; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist who resurrects cold cases via anti-portraits—concept born from character necessity, not gimmick. Masquerade ribbon repurposed from cliché to chromatic nerve of the drawing. Situational stakes invert detective trope—guilt is known, empathy is missing. Risky lyric accumulation paid off when pigment of ribbon literally re-colors the mist in final image. transformation test passed: swap any element and the whole dissolves.</comment>
