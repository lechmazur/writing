<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “scintillatingly somber” mood is tied to the damp parapet and the whisk in her hand. The contradiction between demure routine and bold night-walk is dramatized, not declared. Yet the final beat—offering the whisk to a loom no one uses—feels symbolic rather than costly; no live option is foreclosed, so the change stays ornamental.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the loom reweights her nets and future mending with luminous meaning. Causality is lyric/accumulative; the fireflies’ path is not random, and her following them is motivated by craft-empathy. The cost is conceptual but legible—she now knots “with memory of the glowing loom.” One soft spot: the loom discovery is coincidence-assisted; the insects, not her agency, choose the stop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The whispering parapet, rain-slick stones, and abandoned workshop are filtered through a net-mender’s gaze—she notes warp, weft, tension. The bamboo whisk is handled twice and finally placed on the loom, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is clean: parapet → ivy arch → cobble lanes → workshop. No object teleporting; the city stays dark and wet until dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find proof that hidden effort weaves the world—tightens when the loom’s string-structure mirrors her nets, reweighting her craft. Escalation is accumulative: each waypoint (parapet → lanes → workshop) adds density rather than new opposition. No tangible price is paid on-page; the cost is conceptual appreciation, not forfeiture. Firefly season supplies urgency, but dawn arrival is predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: nets, loom, firefly traceries. The final image reframes every future knot as luminous without moralizing. No abstract thesis is spoken; the whispering stones and the whisk carry the reweighting. Subtext is carried in gesture—placing the tool on dust—rather than statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s craft-filtered perception: “stones seemed to hum,” “light a language.” Diction—“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”—is risky but consistent with her philosopher-nett-maker bent. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for contemplation, shorter fragments when fireflies brighten. No head-hopping; the city stays observed, not explained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is musical without drumbeat repetition; sentence openings vary. Information density is high—each sentence adds image or motion. One minor loop: “hidden effort that stitched the world together” is conceptually restated three times in different guises. No metaphors clash; “moon paths” extends cleanly from firefly light. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing net-mending philosophy with firefly cartography is fresh; the loom reveal feels inevitable in hindsight. The bamboo whisk as conductor is a small, risky leap, but it is seeded early and recharged at the end. No borrowed famous scene or trope template. Risk is taken and coherence holds, meriting the +0.2 bonus.</comment>
