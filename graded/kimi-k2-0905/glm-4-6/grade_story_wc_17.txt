<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s perceptual sensitivity is dramatized through bodily shivers, trembling gloved hands, and the moment he “let the images flood his mind,” giving us embodied cost. The motivation—“to discover what walls dream about”—is peculiar yet consistent, driving every beat; the diary/negative chain escalates his obsession rather than merely decorating it. Interior contradiction is present: curiosity vs. dread as he senses the woman’s fate may become his. The final renunciation (“he felt chosen”) lands as Earned Stasis because we have felt the sensuous price of listening too closely; still, the beat is compressed into one rhetorical flourish, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the negative’s image reweights the premise—cartography is not mad science but mortal service. Cost is visible in the pocket-burn strip and the audible whispered name. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: ivy, ash, and echo accrue until the final cadence shift (“legacy’s burden was not weight—he was direction”) reconfigures meaning. Pattern is taught early (“corridor echo cartographer”), transitions are legible, orientation anchored by line 3; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ivy-veined walls function as micro-setting: their damp cracks “pulse” and literally lean in at the end, constraining Elian’s exit and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy adheres to a cartographer’s priorities—texture, vein-pattern, acoustic drip—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is crisp: passage→chamber→hearth→wall, negative extracted, image glimpsed, ivy rustles. Tone stays hush-lost, matching post-climate quietude. The environment’s liveliness is the story’s rule-set; no 9+ only because exterior world rules (climate shift consequence) are asserted not demonstrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he survive the walls’ dream-archive?—tightens when the woman’s blurred face warns him; options narrow to “return to map them” or be swallowed. Agency is perceptual: he chooses to keep listening, forfeiting safety. Cost is felt (heart pounding, pocket burns). Under Accumulative lens, ivy/rust/negative density escalates until the whispered name crystallizes stance. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (finding the strip) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through motif inversion: cartography flips from control to servitude. The woman’s archival drowning becomes the paradigm for post-climate preservation—memory is both salvation and prison. Subtext in the final sentence (“direction” vs. “weight”) reweights legacy without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is chosen-ness freedom or doom? Emotional aftereffect is quiet awe rather than sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-archaeological: “ivy-veiled,” “brittle secrets,” “jars of preserves” create a consistent poetic texture that mirrors Elian’s hypersensitivity. Rhythm swells then narrows—long sensory sentences contract to the staccato of “he felt chosen.” No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight internal. Compression (“the corridors…whispering her name”) is purposeful, taught early, paid off. Diction never exceeds a contemporary cartographer’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (ivy=setting+symbol, negative=clue+threat). No synonym loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphor check: “coiled like a snake” beside “cold as the grave” is acceptable because both serve temperature+danger. Final-line paradox (“not weight—direction”) lands clean. Minor overwriting in “stubborn secrets” phrase (−0.1) but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—“mapping what walls dream”—is non-obvious and sustained with conceptual rigor. Climate-shift backdrop avoids cliché by remaining acoustic rather than dystopic. Risky lyric accumulation pays off: the same ivy that decorates early becomes an actor at the end. Fresh inflection: cartography as martyrdom. Transformation test fails if Elian is swapped out—his perceptual vocabulary is irreplaceable. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
