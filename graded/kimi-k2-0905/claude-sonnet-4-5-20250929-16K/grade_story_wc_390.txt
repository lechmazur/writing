<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Maren’s engineer-logic versus grief-strained intuition is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—pressing palm to ice, unhooking recorder, humming a counter-frequency—each of which externalizes the “logically emotional” trait with visible cost. The interior contradiction holds: she calculates resonance while weeping, refusing both destruction and erasure, culminating in an earned renunciation that crystallizes Kael into the chorus. No stock therapy-speak; even “sonic absolution” is filtered through physical vibration in her teeth. The only flaw is a slight late convenience: Kael’s instantaneous freeze could use one prior beat of bodily adaptation foreshadowing.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is airtight: key’s growing warmth → discordant ice-song → Kael’s translucent intrusion → Maren’s harmonic pivot. The sunset clock tightens the single scene, while the climax—the moment she hums the complementary overtone—delivers a decisive change that reconfigures both the marina’s fate and Kael’s body. Cost is legible: Kael locked into eternal chorus, Maren forfeits the simpler “release” solution, accepting perpetual maintenance of memorial ice. Closure image of her dark coat against night after amber light offers resonant reconfiguration under causal lens.</comment>

<comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: ice floes’ distance, acoustic conductivity, and sunset color pivot directly constrain tactics—she must stay within arm’s reach to feel stutter, must finish before light fails. The key’s brass warmth against frozen chest, the whistle through Kael’s adapting bones—these micro-setting details charge the final harmonic image. Proper-noun economy perfect: no gratuitous Arctic jargon, only “crypt keeper,” “Faroe cliffs” as necessary anchors. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly across pier descent, ice press, and climb back to lighthouse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“protect sacred artifact without unleashing resonant collapse”—is signaled in the third paragraph and tightened when Kael demands “free it.” One meaningful escalation: the song’s jagged skip forces her from passive listening to active counter-composition, foreclosing the binary of shatter vs. silence. Cost is visible: Kael’s bodily freeze, her acceptance of lifelong stewardship. No coincidence; every pressure stems from prior ice-memory or her engineered choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: engineered harmony versus cathartic erasure; memory as structure rather than burden. Final requiem image reweights “absolution” from elimination to curated resonance—an answer felt, not preached. No late symbolism graft; the key and ice-song recur with accumulating weight, culminating in the charged poise of eternal chorus. Counter-readings possible—whether preservation is mercy or hubris—inviting reflection beyond page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains Maren’s perceptual signature—auricular bias, stress arithmetic, synesthetic warmth in brass—without leakage into Kael’s interior. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments when ice stutters, elongated hymnic cadence during harmonic overlay. Dialogue sparse, crackling with frost subtext; Kael’s diction remains slightly more abstract, marking outsider status. No filter-verb clutter; every “felt” is justified by her engineer calibration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or paraphrase churn; each sentence advances image, stakes, or acoustics. Figurative language is selective—translucent flesh, tuning-fork skull—never crowding the engineering precision. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves to image of coat disappearing into night, echoing earlier color palette. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: clipped beats under discord, open vowels in sunset description, then tight closure—no algorithmic pattern.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses Arctic acoustics, sacred engineering, and memory ethics into a fresh synthesis: “sonic absolution” as architectural problem. Transformation test passed: swap ice for desert, premise collapses—harmonics, cold conductivity, and frozen breath are irreplaceable. Risky lyric compression—sunset as moral crucible—pays off in final image. No derivative echo; avoids frozen-ghost cliché by making Kael’s fate an engineered metamorphosis rather than spectral revenge.</comment>
