<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maia’s interiority is concrete—she “breathed shallow in the sycamore hush,” feels the trance loosen her perception, and drops her own stone as a deliberate micro-choice that signals her re-priced stance. Keiran’s backwards-aging body is a living cost, but because he is a mentor figure, his decisions are mostly off-page exposition; the visible alteration of his physique supplies the embodied price that compensates for his limited on-stage agency. The teacher/student status crucible is present yet static—no power shift occurs—so the relationship beats serve as thematic echo rather than character-forcing pressure. Closure still lands cleanly under Maia’s earned shift, so the minor mentor-agency gap caps rather than breaks the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: starlight ripples, stone rings, and magnetic shimmers pattern-build until Maia’s final stone-drop crystallizes a Charged Poise that reweights presence/absence. Causality is thematic rather than plot-based—each stone teaches a micro-lesson that accretes into her conceptual flip—but the links feel deliberate and accumulate visible cost in Keiran’s vanishing body. Orientation is anchored within 60 words via the floating platform, violet starlight, and rainwater pool, so the exotic frame is immediately legible. Closure satisfies the cost test: the final image of simultaneous arrival/departure is an on-page RR that makes the paradox palpable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto’s starlight “pooled in impossible colors, violet bleeding to copper” is sensory, selective, and immediately tied to the meditation goal; the same light refracts in the pond rings at closure, charging the final image. Body-as-setting (Keiran’s reversing age) functions as a lived prop that constrains his teaching urgency. Spatial choreography is clean—stones drop, ripples expand, bodies remain kneeling/sitting on a drifting platform. The mineral aurora is irreplaceable: its color-shift cues the perceptual lesson and reappears in the last line’s shimmer, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maia’s wish to disappear versus the need to inhabit presence/absence simultaneously. Pressure tightens once—after the second stone she sees absence as structure, foreclosing the vanishing option. Cost is conceptual but legible: Keiran’s erasure literalizes the price of “being both,” and Maia’s final stone-drop accepts that dual state. Agency is internal—no external antagonist—but the choice still reconfigures her stance under the Accumulative lens, meeting the 8-bar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of ripples/void rather than abstract assertion; the final image of “visible in their very vanishing” reframes earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—Keiran’s ever-younger hand, the dark crescents between waves—so the lesson is felt, not preached. No thematic echo line articulates the thesis outright, avoiding penalty. The aftereffect is a hush of simultaneity that lingers beyond the page, earning the high-band nod.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single, stable third-person limited anchored in Maia; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is lyrical and synesthetic—“starlight pooled in impossible colors,” “sycamore hush”—consistent with a meditative focalizer. Compression and ellipsis (“three years ago...”) are taught early and paid off in the final reversion image. Rhythm modulates from long hypnotic sentences to the staccato “Another stone. More rings.” under rising trance pressure, demonstrating controlled voice without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid—each sentence layers image, emotion, and concept without scaffolding: “the rings seemed to pulse with their own rhythm... dark crescents that appeared and vanished.” No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; figurative language is restrained to two metaphors per beat, avoiding purple drift. Filter verbs are almost absent; perception is direct. Opening and closing lines are sharp, book-ending the lesson in image. Minor cadence echo (“appeared and vanished, appeared and vanished”) is pattern-taught and payoff-visible, so allowed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The backwards-aging mentor and ripple-as-void metaphor synthesize into a fresh angle on the ubiquitous “let go” trope; the inversion of vanishing as a form of presence feels non-obvious. Specificity—violet-to-copper starlight, magnetic mineral aurora—anchors the concept in irreplaceable detail. Risk is taken with an almost plotless lyric structure, yet coherence and closure hold. Transformation test fails: swap names/places and the emotional arc still functions, capping the score just below 9-band excellence.</comment>
