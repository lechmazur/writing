<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to documentation while time dissolves—stays concrete via micro-choices: handwriting loops matching old scrolls, reaching for fresh bark, deciding to keep writing. “Jaded wonder” is performed, not declared, in the eye-roll while gasping. Flaw (compulsive chronicle) complicates every beat and drives the final renunciation of order. Cost is felt: she forecloses the possibility of linear self-coherence, accepting perpetual fragmentation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “There was always more chaos to distill” crystallizes the eternal loop with visible cost—she will keep writing, keep losing. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of scroll-after-scroll reweights stakes without requiring causal plot turns. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and stay legible. No meaningful causality break; all impossibilities are premise-accepted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Birch bark functions as micro-setting: its organic curl and sap scent constrain her method—she writes on it because paper feels dishonest. Cabin, altitude, and weathered grave supply tactile, POV-filtered detail that mirrors internal brittleness. Final image of wind “November—or March?” externalizes temporal slippage. Object-state coherence: scroll edges stay brittle, lamp flickers, no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—can narrative order survive temporal shuffling?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation occurs through density: each new scroll written shrinks the remaining future/past, tightening the loop. Cost is visible: jealousy toward past selves intensifies, options narrow to “write again or vanish.” No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from action: the need for story-linear meaning collides with lived non-linearity. Subtext lives in object handling—birch bark as organic memory versus sterile paper. Final line reweights premise: meaning is not distilled, only re-attempted. Avoids explicit moral; resonance lingers in the eternal present tense of writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is perceptually specific: “brown and brittle as October,” “tangled fishing line,” “jaded wonder” all root in Mara’s chronicle-eye. Syntax mirrors fracturing—em-dashes, parenthetical tenses—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. POV distance stays tight; inference is labeled as inference (“perhaps”) and knowledge stays strictly character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose carries high density: one line often does three jobs (atmosphere + tactile cue + metaphor). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for looping memory, fragments for jolted time. No mixed metaphors; “folded like origami” fits paper/bark motif. Minor template cadence in “or was it…?” repetitions but they serve disorientation pattern, do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lucid-dream scholar turned victim of her own method, jealous of her past competence—turns familiar time-confusion into lived professional self-haunting. Grave-as-memory rather than prophecy reweights linear death. Risk of second-person self-ghosting paid off in lyrical image. Concept commits fully; no retreat to “it was all a dream.”</comment>
