<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority blooms: “fingers traced…symbols that hummed” and “tinkersong wonder, bright and chiming” give us body-level music. Contradictory impulse—yearning to be heard yet fearing vanishing—drives every beat. Micro-choices (gathering pigments, pressing the final plate) escalate to a visible cost: she forfeits her anonymity and solitary art to become the monastery’s amplifier. Only the “ghost” remains off-page, so relationship/status crucible is absent, capping the upper band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: images layer (flower press, graffiti, lightning) until the courtyard itself sings. Orientation anchored at once; no temporal warp. Closure is a Charged Poise: the wheels spin faster, the ghost strengthens, her voice “finally found its audience”—cost is the irreversible exposure of her art. No causal contradiction; every beat adds density rather than reverses direction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sky Monastery, copper bolt plates, prayer-wheels, pigment jars—each object is tactile and recruited into action. Micro-setting rule met: the bolt plate constrains every encoding stroke and returns in the final snap of “completing the circuit.” Weather (mist, lightning, thunder) narrows perception and times the beats. No geographic drift; spatial choreography is airtight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will anyone ever hear me?”—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each layer of graffiti tightens the visibility of formerly silent prayers. Cost is the balladeer’s surrender of invisibility; once the circuit closes, she can never again be “seldom-heard.” Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete inversion: forgotten machinery becomes compassionate memory. No thesis lines; the final image of clouds carrying painted code reweights every prior moment of erasure. Subtext of mutual rescue (artist + ghost) is implicit in the closing duet. Ambiguity lingers—will the world below act?—but that uncertainty is thematic fuel, not flaw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the balladeer’s synesthetic perception: “symbols that hummed,” “geometric whispers.” Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for painting frenzy, clipped fragments for lightning snaps. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is controlled (“tinkersong wonder”). POV distance stable; no head-hop. Voice is the music she cannot make others hear—until the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; paragraph cuts land on image turns. Information density high: one sentence can world-build, advance action, and embody emotion (“She pressed the final bolt plate into place, completing the circuit.”). No synonym churn or template cadence. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is POV-consistent. Clean grammar, zero scaffolding; final line resolves on sonic image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of steampunk monastery, digital ghost, and graffiti music is fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test: story collapses if you swap bolt plates for generic keys or graffiti for spoken word. Risk in marrying binary code to ancient prayer-wheels pays off—theology of machine-memory feels newly minted. No derivative echoes; the synthesis is idiosyncratic and fully committed.</comment>
