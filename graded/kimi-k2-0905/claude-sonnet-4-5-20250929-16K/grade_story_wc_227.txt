<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her ritual narration under threat, the tactile memory of her grandmother’s lacquer charm, her fingers trembling as acid hisses against brass. Contradictory impulses (terror vs. compulsion to mend) co-exist inside single beats. The final micro-choice—pouring her own grey uncertainty into the statue’s throat—costs her the last illusion of certainty and is earned by every prior match of essence to crater. Only minor gap: we are told “she wished she possessed such certainty” rather than shown a specific physical signature of that lack.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: each pockmark-as-template discovery tightens the next action; the acid wave is external coincidence that complicates rather than resolves. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—statue’s golden exhalation re-weights the premise: damage is map, not flaw. Cost is legible in the final image: Mira’s smile of acceptance while the sea calms beneath a dawn that was never there before. Minor hairline: the “centuries-old figure” rule is revealed late, but the pattern is taught in the same beat and immediately tested, so no causality break.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brass hull, acid spray, gear-grind rhythm, and perpetual twilight are filtered through Mira’s alchemical gaze—every sense choice points to corrosion/repair tension. The workshop itself functions as micro-setting: its tilting floor and glowing vials constrain her speed and sequence of placements. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible reaches during the final frantic pour. Acid sea and dawn breakthrough serve as environmental mirror of inner illumination, charging the closing image.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the quilt before the platform sinks—is signaled early and tightened by each successfully matched essence vial. The acid wave arriving at the exact moment of final placement raises physical cost and forecloses retreat; survival now depends on the artifact she is completing. Escalation is driven solely by her agency under pressure; no off-stage rescue. The price is felt: her uncertainty is literally poured away, leaving her in irrevocable openness.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of luminous repair emerges entirely through the statue’s transformation—no explicit sermon. The kintsugi concept is re-priced at closure: the gold is not metal but crystallized human memory, visible in the dawn light. Ambiguity remains—Mira is still uncertain, but that uncertainty is now a vessel, not a wound. The final breathing statue offers a non-literal answer: meaning is the aggregate of breaks, not their erasure.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mira’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax compresses under threat—“She removes the first vial...” mimics her own staccato self-narration. Diction stays within alchemical register without drifting into faux-antique. Only micro-slip: “cathedral” wave momentarily breaks idiom, but the image is brief and serves scale.</question>

<comment>Rhythmic control mirrors pulse of gears and surf; sentence length varies to accelerate or breathe. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare and precise—“grief, blue as drowning” compresses color and fate into three words. High information density: each sentence places a vial, tilts the deck, or charges the statue. Minor register hitch noted above does not recur.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi as emotional alchemy on a floating workshop above acid sea feels inevitable rather than quirky. The statue-as-template twist is foreshadowed by “deliberate pockmarks” yet still surprises. Risk is taken—quiet, interior climax inside a disaster set-piece—but coherence remains. Could edge higher if the grandmother’s journal had left a single cryptic line that retro-clicked, but originality is solid.</comment>
