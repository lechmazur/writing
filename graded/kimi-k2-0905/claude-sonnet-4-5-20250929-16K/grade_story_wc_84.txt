<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s ex-military identity and “frequency of belonging” ache are concrete; the pilgrim remains generic. The final decision to transmit is motivated, but the interior cost is stated more than embodied. Stakes escalate cleanly, yet the pilgrim’s passivity limits relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drone’s ascending signal reweights “missing pieces” into an active belonging network with on-page cost—Mara forfeits her spectator stance. Causal chain holds: chip → star-map → transmit choice. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One shard, single transition inside observatory; within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Observatory dome, drone telemetry, and dusk light are filtered through Mara’s technician eye; each constrains altitude and scanner placement. Chip-as-micro-setting returns in 3-D projection, directly enabling the final uplink. Textural specificity (“LED arrays casting sharp shadows across weathered astronomical instruments”) embeds ancient/modern tension without catalogue drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find personal frequency—tightens when chip patterns match live sky, narrowing options to “send signal or stay silent.” Cost is conceptual but legible: Mara trades anonymity for network exposure. Escalation is single-wave but sufficient for 700-word frame; pilgrim adds thematic pressure, not antagonistic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: relic technology + star trails = belonging as reciprocal transmission. No thesis statement; final image of drone climbing carries the reprice. Subtext in chip glint and fractured dome mirrors broken/connected self. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about who answers back.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps perceptual signature sharp—numerical altitude, scanner jargon, military memory flash. Rhythm flexes: long dusk sentence vs staccato telemetry readouts. No dialogue contamination; pilot lexicon intact. Filter verbs minimal; drone as proxy body extends POV without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Opening sentence anchors voice and metaphor; no scaffold repetition. Information density high—each sentence advances data or emotional charge. Metaphor vehicles (“broken tooth”) consistent; no mixed logic in peak beat. Clean copy; pronoun track stable. Final line cadence echoes launch count without template thump.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fused premise—antique typographic chip as star-map transponder—feels inevitable post-reveal. Risk in military→astronomy pivot paid via grounded drone specifics. Avoids “lost pilgrim” cliché by making journey secondary to data extraction. Fresh angle on “belonging” as radio ping, not tribe. Specificity rescues concept from nostalgia.</comment>
