<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The potter’s calm, observant interiority is vivid and consistent; her micro-choices (speaking to trees, placing the glass, leaving part of herself) dramatize the earned insight. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the internal conflict is only implied, capping the score below 8.8. The final “leaving something behind” is a gentle renunciation, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the oasis’s layered caretaking tightens meaning toward the Charged Poise closure. Causality is lyric rather than sequential; the pattern is taught early and lands with conceptual cost. The “sharp gentleness” repricing is on-page in the final paragraph, reweighting the premise. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lantern glass functions as micro-setting; its prismed colors charge the final image and constrain her daily ritual. Wasteland vs. oasis opposition is economically sketched yet sensory (warm stones, thrumming air). Spatial choreography stays clean across the three-week span. Environment shapes her stance; the oasis leans toward her kindness—an irreversible constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why places resist entropy—is signaled early and deepens through pattern recognition rather than external opposition. The tightening is cognitive: dawn/noon/dusk timelines narrow her attention, forcing her to add her own layer. Cost is conceptual (she leaves part of herself), not tactical; visible price is muted, holding the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges silently: attention as anti-entropy. The lantern glass’s shifting light and the trees’ lean toward kindness reweight the idea without thesis statements. Final image of “accumulated kindness” reframes prior particulars. No moralizing; resonance is organic, charged by the Conceptual Repricing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within the potter’s calm, tactile register. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, shortens during ritual acts—reflecting wheel-thrower rhythm. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric compression avoids loops; figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“kiln of entropy,” “copper light”). Sentence variety supports breathing space; no mixed metaphors. High information density—each sentence layers time or care. Final paragraph achieves quiet crescendo without prose clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fractured-timeline oasis tended by phototropic trees is a fresh synthesis; trope of wasteland miracle is subverted by kindness-as-physics. Risk-taking lies in quiet lyric structure; coherence holds. Conceptual payoff feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (lantern glass, sun-pattern navigation) prevents generic transfer.</comment>
