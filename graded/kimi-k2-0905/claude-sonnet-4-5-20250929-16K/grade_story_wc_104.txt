<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “chains as choreography” embodiment and the final bolt-cutter moment give visible, felt cost; her quiet librarian lie and the choice to reveal the jar crystallize a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—she notices “iron links singing soft percussion against her hip bones,” not abstract freedom. The patiently strategic trait is dramatized through nightly mapping of the keys, not labeled. Only minor slip: the young soldier’s instant conversion feels slightly under-cooked, muting the relationship crucible.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because she mapped the keys, therefore she locates the vault; because liberation armies are nearing, she must impede them to save the seeds. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—chains removed, seeds handed forward, cost legible in her trembling freed hands. One tight scaffold: the carnival-game layout taught early (“Ring Toss at two o’clock…”) pays off in the five-pace move. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Abandoned prize counter, piano bench, and rusted midway booths are filtered through Mira’s dancer-body and thief-eye: she notices “stuffed bears with missing eyes,” not generic decay. The metal-jar seeds become the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—five measured paces, northeast corner, wall panel yield. Selective sensory economy: no visual overdose, sound of boots builds tempo. Setting constrains choice—only this booth layout yields the vault location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the seed vault from both incoming regimes—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when boots approach; options narrow to “impede them, buy minutes.” One meaningful escalation: her decision to stand, raise chained hands, and lie “I’m the librarian” trades personal safety for seed survival with on-page cost (possible execution). Agency is decision, not force; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The price—loss of anonymity and potential death—charges the final image under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “resilience planted in dry soil” emerges from the seeds’ concrete labels and her chained grace, never abstract slogans. Final image of freed hands lifting jar reweights “planting” as communal, not solo act. Subtext in corn-husk arrow carries network survival without exposition. No moralizing; the soldier’s “Show me” invites reader to decide what freedom means. Ambiguity lingers: will new regime repeat erasure? Complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature vivid—“iron links singing soft percussion,” not generic clink. Syntax mirrors dancer rhythm: long sentence with comma pivots mirrors chain arcs. No head-hopping; soldier’s interior limited to observable stare and hand move. Diction consistent: “cataloging, destroying” matches bureaucratic lexicon she fears. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy preserved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control: varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information density high—“three years since the regime branded her a traitor for smuggling hope” compresses backstory with motive. Figurative language sparse and coherent; “chains like ribbons” appears once and pays off in final release. No loops or synonym churn. Minor overworld: “soft percussion” and “singing” are close cousins but compressed in one phrase, forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: seed vault + abandoned carnival + chained dancer codes yields a premise unlikely to work elsewhere. Arrow fletched from corn/ wheat stalks turns agricultural loss into resistance icon. Risk of soldier conversion is taken and mostly earned by prior seed imagery. Specificity—“desert marigold,” “heritage varieties”—anchors universality. No stock tropes; liberation army as potential new oppressor complicates typical rebellion arc.</comment>
