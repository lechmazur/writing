<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her neutron-star lens on collapse vs. transformation feels lived, not pasted. The final refusal to wash her hands is a micro-choice that costs her sterile identity, earned by twenty-eight days of observed dust. Flaw is present: she clings to control yet yields, but the contradiction is mostly told in reflective blocks rather than dramatized in-scene. Still, the arc of inherited impulse → witnessing looseness → embodied mess lands with credible humility.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the dust-coated palm reweights her life-long preprocessing quest, visible cost in surrendering scientific distance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust layers, wing powder, sprouting vines accrue until meaning tilts. Pattern is taught early (shattered glass → strata photographs) and transitions are legible within the single scene. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse shards, salt rime, and ceiling-joist tomatoes are specific, sensory, and filtered through Mara’s scientific eye. Environment constrains her movement (crunching glass, sagging frames) and finally stains her skin—micro-setting that charges the last image. No impossible geography; spatial choreography clean. Details evolve causally: flood → silt → sprouting seeds; pattern taught by 25% mark.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will Mara keep her scientific remove or accept messy transformation? Escalation is the daily accumulation of dust/growth that deepens tension under Accumulative lens; one meaningful tightening arrives when the fresh butterfly forces the paradox of new life in decay. Cost is visible: literal grime on her palms, symbolic surrender of analytical distance. No reversal, but the stance crystallization suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: purity vs. messy becoming, neutron-star endpoints vs. greenhouse re-seeding. Subtext lives in the dust layers and the refusal to cleanse. Final image reweights earlier neutron imagery without sermonizing—accepting “beautiful mess” feels earned. Avoids explicit thesis statement; no thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: precise scientific diction (“striations, geological record”) braided with lyrical compression. Perceptual signature consistent—Mara notices density, packing, decay rates. Rhythm breathes with scene—short clauses for crunching glass, longer cumulative sentences for dust strata. No dialogue to corrupt cadence; no POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with concrete noun or motion, avoiding template cadence. Information density high—each line layers sensory data and metaphoric freight. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Minor scaffold: “had come here every day… not to salvage… but to observe” is efficient backstory, not loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star physics + post-flood greenhouse ecology as dueling models of transformation. Premise is specific to this voice; butterfly-wing soil creation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet, observational arc is justified by accumulative closure. Not quite groundbreaking but memorably particular.</comment>
