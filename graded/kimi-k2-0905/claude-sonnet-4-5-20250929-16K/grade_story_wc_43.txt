<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s “decisively kind” trait is shown through immediate, costly action—seventeen phone calls, creative labor—yet interiority stays general (“a prayer made flesh”). Richard’s regret is embodied in the vinyl shard; Linda arrives already softened, so the reconciliation lacks visible struggle. The earned change is Richard’s, not Maya’s, leaving her somewhat archetypal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: diagnosis → request → phone campaign → arrival → goodbye. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: father dies with daughter and shard, cost legible. One shard break (three-week ellipsis) is allowed; pattern taught early. Orientation debt waived—cloud-hospice image anchors immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mountain hospice above clouds is more postcard than pressure, yet the vinyl shard functions as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography clean; lavender-ozone scent mentioned once but not exploited. Strong auditory filter (Ella, piano) compensates for visual generality. Fits Track A default.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye”—signaled early. Escalation via Maya’s phone crusade: each unanswered call tightens failure risk. Cost visible when Linda finally arrives; alternative path (permanent silence) foreclosed. No reversal, but deepening suffices for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of mended fractures emerges from vinyl motif and reconciled silence; no overt thesis stated. Subtext resides in handshake & “I’m here,” not explanation. Final hymn reweights mundane into elegy. Avoids sentimentality yet edges toward comfort—could risk richer moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person omniscient maintained; diction consistent (“cotton-sea of clouds”). Dialogue sparse, natural, subtextual. No head-hopping; Maya’s perceptual signature thinner than Richard’s. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for cloud passages, clipped for phone calls.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence variety good. Occasional elevated metaphor (“calcified silence”) but never muddled. No loops or scaffold. Information density high—each sentence advances image or beat. Clean copy, tiny filter hiccup: “she explained” could drop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Music-therapist-in-hospice is fresh angle; vinyl shard reprise gives specific twist to familiar estrangement plot. Risk level moderate—structure stays conventional. Transformation test: swap vinyl for letter and story still works, so originality capped short of excellence.</comment>
