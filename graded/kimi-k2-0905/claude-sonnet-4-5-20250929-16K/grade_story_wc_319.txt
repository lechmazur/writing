<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The guardian’s slow surrender to feral embodiment, then her regained upright stance after donning the pendant, gives two credible micro-choices that re-weight her identity; dimensional homesickness is embodied (ice in hair, ache in chest) rather than labelled. Interior contradiction—human reason vs fox-like crawl—remains visible throughout, peaking as she internalizes the garden’s wrongness. The cost is felt: she forfeits certainty, accepts permanent boundary-state exile, and this renunciation is causally seeded by earlier failures to remember systems. Voice occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing (“interiorizing exteriors”) that edges on therapy-speak, keeping it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: upright guardian tending inter-dimensional shelves, carrying homesickness as manageable weight. Causal chain: pendant discovery → recognition of boundary logic → voluntary assumption of guardian role; cost is the irreversible loss of her original dimension and name. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of frozen stillness gives way to living mist-library. Light-boundary rule is taught early and re-appears in final image, satisfying payoff; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen roses, frost-call-numbered books, and pendant silver create tight sensory hierarchy filtered by POV priorities. Micro-setting (pendant) constrains the decisive choice; garden mist literally guides her crawl path. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from thorn-bush to shelf-line. Cold as persistent environmental antagonist shapes action—she moves on all fours to conserve heat. Final image of melting-ice call numbers re-anchors transformed library, charging ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guardian’s need to belong somewhere—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation via deepening: stillness → boundary awareness → voluntary acceptance of boundary-keeper role; each stage forecloses return to original library. Pendant touch is the visible price moment, burning cold against sternum. No external antagonist, yet uncertainty functions as coherent pressure; acceptance is active stance crystallization under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing epistemic exile emerges through recurring frozen/kinetic imagery rather than assertion. Pendent’s silver light reframed as negotiator between illumination/withdrawal reweights earlier boundary motif. Final image—reading frost-books—offers non-literal answer: knowledge itself migrates across dimensions. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in unreadable flickering titles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, matching dream-veil premise. Syntax grows shorter under stress (“She stood upright… bones creaking”), then lengthens again in library calm. Metaphor engine stays consistent—light negotiates, frost is thought—without overwriting. No dialogue, so voice distinction not required; perceptual signature (noticing borders, shelving logic) remains guardian-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long hypotonic clauses mirror fog, then staccato verbs (“She stood… walked”) mark stance shift. Information density high—“petals suspended in ice like thoughts” does sensory + thematic double duty. One mixed-metor borderline: “boundary where light decided whether to illuminate or withdraw” anthropomorphizes light but fits taught rule. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; closing sentence “She pulled the first frozen book…” propels outward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Frozen inter-dimensional library feels fresh synthesis of portal-fantasy & bibliophile grief. Conceptual move—making uncertainty a “friend” rather than enemy—flips standard portal-rescue arc. Pendant-as-light-negotiator object avoids cliché cultist tropes; its burn enacts cost. Risk in lyric disorientation pays off with coherent closure under Accumulative lens; stakes stay human-scaled to displacement rather than cosmos-saving.</comment>
