<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—radiant yet doubting—remains vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to “press her glowing palm” against the map fuses trait to action. The final renunciation of luminescence costs her visible identity, earned by prior causal chain. No stock labels; emotion stays sensory (“heard the geese returning north, their honking loud with joy”). Secondary characters absent, so relationship bullets skipped; head-count clarity maintained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s emotional economy is rewired, cost felt in Mara’s extinguished glow. Causal lens holds: each shard placement tightens the lock until the final click re-opens the fountains. Orientation anchored by second paragraph; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—final shard—suffices for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fountains evolve from dry stone to singing infrastructure, constraining the final release; the stained-glass box’s “outside normal time” property directly shapes Mara’s tactile struggle. Constellation map functions as micro-setting that dictates shard placement. Sensory selection skews visual, but compressed word-count justifies narrow bandwidth. Spatial choreography clean across single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore feeling-memories—signaled early; escalation delivered through shard-collection beats that foreclose retreat. Final placement costs her residual glow, a visible price. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One deepening suffices; no explicit antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: remembering requires active release, not possession. Final image of “singing fountains” reweights the opening silence without moralizing. No thematic echo violations. Ambiguity lingers in source of the geese’ pause, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature—“luminous skeptic” filters every notice. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences for patience, crisp clauses for shard clicks. No head-hopping; diction within her lexicon. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets skipped.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“insect in amber” condenses time-lock. Zero paraphrase loops; information density high. Copy clean, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Memory-theft via frozen geese and sidereal box feels fresh synthesis of climate fabulism and myth. Recurrent breadcrumb motif taught early and paid off in constellation key. Risk in time-fracture glass justified by closure clarity. Specific urban fountain lore resists generic anywhere-city.</comment>
