<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s return-from-capital motive is cleanly anchored; the spiral shell and Kael’s blindness cue her “revalue” pivot. Interiority stays concrete—hand-to-shell, tear-tracks—without label-speak. The final joint stance (“teaching…how to spiral”) costs both their old paths, earned by prior beats. Only minus: no contradictory impulse enacted in scene—she never hesitates to stay—so change feels smooth, not wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: together they commit to bottling sight itself, a conceptual repricing with felt cost—Kael’s sight clock and Mira’s abandoned commerce. Causal linkage holds: because he is going blind, therefore she gifts memory-suns; because she left to commodify, now she returns to salvage meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 6; no penalty. Lens (Hybrid→Causal dominant at end) is stable. Minor slip: “six-month” blindness datum arrives in dialogue without prior plant, but it narrows, not breaks, options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus functions as micro-setting: drifting sparks mirror memory-suns, constrain visibility, and charge the final image (“ember-glow of twilight’s end”). Spatial choreography clean—distance tracked in handshake/step-close. Tool-body-object triad met: columella curl re-centers in palm at closure, reprising logarithmic spiral as literal handle on their new joint purpose. Weather/twilight arc supplies visual countdown that paces the reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve Kael’s sight-experience—signaled early; escalation is emotional deepening rather than external reversals: blindness secret → gift of memory-suns → joint alchemy pact. Each beat tightens cost: Mira forfeits commercial path; Kael accepts dependency. Agency is shared consent to bottle light; no coincidence resolves. Could wish for one sharper external obstacle, but pressure stays coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: value of presence over commodity. Spiral shell and bottled suns reweight “density of being seen.” No articulation of thesis—final image of joined hands around spiral conveys repricing without moralizing. Subtext in silence (“I’m losing the light”) carries both blindness and trust. Complexity preserved: she gains vocation, he loses sight—no tidy equipoise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-single POV keeps modest distance; perceptual signature alchemist-vision—light caught in jars, logarithmic curves—remains consistent. Syntax grows incantatory under emotion (“amber remembers…gold carries…rose-white holds”) without purple drift. Dialogue sparse but subtextual; Kael’s lines pursue consent, not exposition. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally at climax. Voice distinct enough to lift above generic lit-fantasy cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often couples sensory detail with conceptual weight—“ember nexus pulsed…fed by their combined presence.” No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (light as breath, spiral as path). Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences yield to fragment-like gift hand-off. Minor over-alliteration in “dying light like a promise” but does not obscure causality. Clean grammar; pronoun chain unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy of emotion-based light jars paired with blindness countdown feels non-template. Spiral shell reprises as both mathematical proof and keepsake without symbolic over-insistence. Risk of sentimental meet-cute is averted by cost (commerce forfeited). Not radically avant-garde, but specificity of “scientifically romantic” vocation and memory-pigment suns gives memorable angle. Could not swap with generic fantasy romance without loss of core motor.</comment>
