<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ren’s lifetime of pacifist guilt is rendered in concrete, body-level memory; every micro-choice (measured breath, measured step) is tethered to the ship’s failing air and their own refusal to fight. The contradictory impulse—passivity vs. the need to act—peaks when stitching strangers’ grief to their own, making the final weightless passage feel earned rather than ascribed. Interiority stays particular: “salt crystals catching light like tiny galaxies” is a perception only this caretaker-of-ghosts would notice. Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: they will never again walk a deck under normal gravity, yet that forfeiture is accepted on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: grief photographs, pendant warmth, and buoyancy form a repeating texture that reweights at each return. Closure is a Charged Poise—Ren suspended between membranes, body translucent, cost legible as perpetual weightlessness. Orientation is anchored by word 35 (“Ren moved through its corridors”) and the pattern of tear-shimmers is taught early, so no penalty. The final image reconfigures meaning: the locked dimension opens not by force but by accumulated compassion, satisfying the RR test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The Meridian is sketched in three strokes—“patchwork quilt of salvaged titanium,” recycled-air bioluminescence, gravity that fails when joy rises—yet these details immediately constrain tactics (Ren must stitch while weighted or tied). The body itself becomes micro-setting: pendant temperature and floating feet determine where and how the climax can occur. Spatial choreography is pristine; no object drifts or teleports. Because the gravitational anomaly directly charges the final image, the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can a pacifist reopen a sealed dimension without violence? Pressure intensifies via texture—each stitched tear adds literal weight to the membrane they must breach. One meaningful tightening: when the photographs tear open, renunciation is no longer an option; passage requires accepting permanent weightlessness. Cost is visible on-page: Ren’s soles leave the deck for good, a price that cannot be reset.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of violence and mass: refusal to fight makes the body lighter, yet only that lightness can breach the lock. Subtext operates in silence—the absence of any voiced plan mirrors the absence of aggression. The final image reweights “shadow work” from psychobabble to literal cosmic engineering. No moral is stated; the reader is left to feel the paradox that compassion may cost the companioned gravity of being human.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled lyricism: long cadences for corridors, spider-silk micro-phrases for stitching, a final lift into weightless brevity. Perceptual signature is consistent—Ren notices corrosion, salt galaxies, warmth of jade, never an omniscient catalog. No dialogue appears; hence no voice convergence. The experimental compression (“They began with a photograph…”) is taught early and paid off when photos ripple open, satisfying elision rules.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Syntax varies from 28-word elegiac rolls to three-word fragments (“Today they would stitch.”) that mimic needle punctures. No synonym loops; “stitch” is repeated only when the action demands. Metaphors stay coherent—tears as galaxies, hull as quilt, joy as anti-gravity—each reappears to charge closure. Zero scaffold sentences; every line advances image or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—emotional mass inversion as interdimensional key—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk is high: a pacifist victory that still wrecks the body, a locked dimension breached by accumulated grief rather than heroics. Specificity anchors universality: salt crystal galaxies and recycled-air strips prevent abstract loftiness. The synthesis of Buddhist pendant, junk-ship hospice, and quantum membrane is non-obvious and inseparable from this plot.</comment>
