<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Eliane’s interior contradiction—steady hands vs. eroding boundary—plays out in embodied micro-choices (setting mirrors, breathing with the dream). The final renunciation (burying the mirror) is causally earned and carries visible cost, satisfying 9+ quick test; only a trace of label-speak in “being firmly grounded was the only way to survive” keeps her from full 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: dream escape → mirrors as counter-instrument → synchronized breathing → capture → burial all link because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mirror-on-grave image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—boundaries restored but at the price of eternal vigilance. No causality breaks, no orientation debt; cost legible in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fog-droplet-as-tiny-sun reprises at climax, directly enabling the mirror-capture tactic; environment charges closure. Micro-setting (sextant, silver-backed glass) constrains every beat. Spatial choreography clean—mirrors placed in circle, dream tracked by arc. Idiom stable, no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent district collapse—tightens when dream grows solid and cuts geometry into mist. One meaningful deepening: Eliane sees stars inside fog, foreclosing the “erase boundaries” option and forcing containment instead. Cost paid on-page: she forever inherits the watching role, mirrored in the burial act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: mirrors as boundary-keepers, fog as star-container. Final image (mirror on grave) offers non-literal answer—acceptance of necessary separation—without moralizing. No thematic echo; resonance built from sextant-to-mirror-to-grave trajectory. Complexity preserved: dream is beautiful yet must be caged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Eliane; perceptual signature—silver, frost, glass—filters every sentence. Syntax mirrors breath rhythm, cadence shifts with dream pulse. No head-hopping, no register drift. Free indirect clean: “she could see what Gregor had seen” remains in-character knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; high density—every sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language coherent: “suspended diamonds” → “glass mountains” → “frozen apples” form tight metaphor chain. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraphs cut cleanly. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fog-as-star-field is fresh synthesis; dream-crystallization rule followed to logical, dangerous end. Risk in lyric escalation pays off—geometry in mist feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test: story collapses if fog is ordinary. Specificity (silver-backed glass, sextant arc) prevents generic fantasy slide.</comment>
