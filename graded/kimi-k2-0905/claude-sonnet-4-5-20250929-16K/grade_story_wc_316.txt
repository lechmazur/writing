<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Kenji’s numbness and slow reawakening are rendered through embodied tremors and tearing eyes rather than labels; the moment he names his clone “brother” the interior contradiction resolves with visible cost. Micro-choices—flinching at the jar, voice shaking in court—track a believable hierarchy of values under pressure. The only drag is a touch of therapy-speak (“ego death,” “complement”) that slightly flattens the peak beat; still, the arc from dissociation to felt paradox feels earned and specific to this voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because Kenji cannot feel, therefore he mis-uses meditation; because he sees the brain as complement, therefore he cedes the suit. The orientation anchor lands by line 4, the tightening occurs when he labels the brain “my complement,” and the final renunciation in court carries undeniable emotional cost—“I felt it—actually felt the tremor.” Closure is a clean Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the legal and existential rule-set is rewritten on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The floating dojo, reality-rewriting plains, and brain-in-jar operate as both backdrop and pressure source: the tethered cables and stuttering forests literalize unstable identity. Micro-setting—the jar itself—becomes the pivot object that constrains Kenji’s final choice. Sensory selection stays biased to his narrowed affect: visual chill of amber fluid, auditory hum of cables. One minor slip: “Montana/what used to be called” is generic; still, the world rules remain consistent and the final image recharges the jar’s obsolete label.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who owns a life when identity is divisible—tightens when Kenji realizes the clone is not duplicate but complement, foreclosing the option of zero-sum victory. Escalation is single but meaningful: the custody hearing is the crucible where emotional numbness must break or calcify. Cost is legible: he forfeits sole claim to his past and accepts shared vulnerability, paying with tears in open court. Under causal lens, one deepening is sufficient and lands with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox—“neither is the duplicate”—without moralizing. The brain jar reframes from immortality tool to brother totem; history’s rewrites mirror identity’s fluidity. Subtext lives in silence: Master Yoon’s smile and the obsolete label in storage speak louder than exposition. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: felt life resides in accepting irreducible multiplicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kenji’s perceptual signature: he notices “borrowed physics” hum and the jar’s electric pulse, not exposition dumps. Syntax mirrors his detachment—cool, clipped—then fractures into shorter clauses as feeling returns (“I felt it—actually felt”). No head-hopping; Master Yoon’s dialogue carries subtext without ventriloquizing her interior. Distinct rhythmic control under pressure lifts the voice into the 9-band; only a single filter verb (“he admitted”) keeps it from perfect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density, and loop-free; every sentence either advances pressure or re-images the jar. Metaphors are spare but precise: “blade through silk,” “stuttering waves.” No scaffold or synonym churn; paragraph cuts test clean. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line recharges “obsolete label” with conceptual cost. Rhythm accelerates into the courtroom beat without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The custody-of-clone premise is familiar, yet the twist that the original must cede ownership to reclaim feeling is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Floating dojo above mutable Montana, reality engines rewriting history, and Zen forms that weaponize emotional acceptance synthesize fresh angles on identity and grief. Specificity—“amber fluid,” “borrowed physics”—prevents abstraction. Risky structural choice to hinge everything on a quiet courtroom speech pays off because the emotional cost is visceral.</comment>
