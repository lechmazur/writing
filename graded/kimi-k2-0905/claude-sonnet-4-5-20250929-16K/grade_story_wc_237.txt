<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—shame vs. need to expose scars—collide on the platform; the micro-choice to exhale frost onto the page instead of hiding it crystallizes the arc. Interiority stays concrete: “hands trembling,” “breath wanted to escape but couldn’t,” no therapy-speak. The final renunciation of secrecy is earned because every prior beat links the scars to the rune design; the cost is the perpetual visibility of trauma. Voice remains singular and northern-wind touched throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The causal spine is immaculate: grandmother’s superstition → breath-frost realization → scar-map rune → master’s approval, each because/therefore link tightening options. The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rock sways, storms gather, Kael’s scars glint “like captured stars,” reconfiguring stakes without declarative summary. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no props teleport. Persistent constraint—public scars—shapes all future scholarly identity; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The floating tea-platform is not backdrop; its knife-edge width forces Kael to kneel motionless, magnifying tremor and breath control. The crow quill’s trimmed barbs, inkstone chill, and canyon updraft are returned in the final sway, physically charging the “captured stars” image. Micro-setting (scarred arm) literally constrains the rune design—without those ridges the spiral could not exist. All sensory notes serve the stakes; no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove worthy of the scholar’s seal”—is signaled in paragraph two and deepened when the only allowed ink source is personal pain. The meaningful tightening occurs the instant Kael redirects frost from shame to stylus: that single stroke forecloses anonymity forever. Escalation is causal, not loud; options narrow from “hide or fail” to “expose or be exiled.” Price is the permanent publicity of disfigurement, paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges purely imagistically: frost as preservation, scars as alphabet, storm-breath as scholarly credential. No character spells the lesson. The final image of glittering breath “between storms” reweights the grandmother superstition without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Counter-readings linger—whether institutional acceptance truly heals—and that ambiguity is invited, not smoothed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filter: “tea ceremony platform barely wide enough for two cushions” is a scholar’s measurement, not an objective one. Syntax lengthens during suspended breath, then fragments at quill contact, mirroring pulse. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within a scriptorium-trained lexicon. Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext when Master Yerin’s finger “traces the spiral without touching,” enacting approval through restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are spare and coherent: “ice is water waiting to transform” is extended without strain. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line resolves by action-image (“The next storm could come. They had found their anchor…”) without scaffolding. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the held-breath conceit, then releases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of tea-ceremony aesthetics with runic transcription is fresh, as is using literal frost as ink vehicle. Superstition-as-cipher and scars-as-alphabet transform familiar trauma tropes into systemic world logic. Risk—quiet climax with no antagonist—paid off because pressure is internal and coherent. Without the frost-scar fusion the story collapses, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
