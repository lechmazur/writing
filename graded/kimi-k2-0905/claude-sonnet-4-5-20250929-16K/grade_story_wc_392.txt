<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sara’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the tremor she refuses to acknowledge under the lantern light is character-specific. The contradictory pull between bureaucratic survival and ancestral duty is held in simultaneous tension rather than alternated, satisfying the “both-at-once” test. Micro-choices—each photo, each measurement—are visible acts of rebellion that foreclose the safe-report path with cumulative cost. The lantern inheritance motif could feel safer than her flaw, but the final climb re-weights it as lived risk, not inherited talisman.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she finds fresh scratches → therefore she photographs; because fibers mismatch → therefore timeline fractures; because evidence accrues → therefore she must act. The closure beat—“ready to let her findings reverberate”—is a Decisive Change that swaps silence for exposure with career-and-safety cost legible on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One shard, single transition at climb-out; within scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel’s dripping acoustics and overhead rumble are filtered through Sara’s investigator bias—she notices metal scratches before water stains. Brass lantern, silt-preserved boot prints, and repositioned camera are micro-setting objects that constrain tactics (where she can stand, what she can prove). Spatial choreography is clean: left-hand lantern swing, crouch, panel hinge angle all track. Final daylight re-entry recharges the underground details with exposed-air risk, earning the 9-gate “object charges closure” test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—publish the truth vs. keep her job—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Chen’s drafted report is revealed. The reversal arrives with the fiber discovery: accidental drowning becomes deliberate entrapment, foreclosing the easy-sign option. Cost is visible—she forfeits career protection—but the beat is single; no secondary escalation. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; coincidence only complicates (rains return) without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance of moral responsibility—emerges from the lantern’s re-pricing at closure rather than thesis statements. Subtext operates in the silence after the last sentence: the “reverberate” is an unanswered threat, inviting reader projection about reprisal. No final-paragraph moralizing; the image of rain-washed daylight offers non-literal answer that exposure is now irreversible. The inherited memory fragments remain ambiguous enough to sustain counter-readings (trauma echo vs. literal haunting).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays inside Sara’s perceptual filter (water warnings = auditory paranoia). Syntax lengthens under pressure—“water level markings on the walls told another story too”—mirroring analytical overload. No head-hopping; Director Chen exists only as external threat, maintaining distance discipline. The brass-lantern diction recurs with brassy consonants that clang against tunnel echo, giving rhythmic signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes: short beats for photo clicks, longer clauses for evidence accrual. No synonym loops; “water” returns only when state changes (drought → flood). Mixed metaphor check clean: “symphony of persistence” extends acoustic motif without clashing physics. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she saw… she tasted…”) is anchored inside inherited-flash device and pattern-taught early, so waived from artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Whistle-blower-execution inside infrastructure-corruption is familiar turf; freshness comes from the underground-railroad lantern repurposed as evidence light, welding historical liberation to present disclosure. The entangled-memory angle risks gimmick but stays restrained—fragments never resolve into tidy ancestral possession. Specificity of drought-flood timing and fiber evidence lifts the piece above template police procedural. Risk is moderate; payoff clean.</comment>
