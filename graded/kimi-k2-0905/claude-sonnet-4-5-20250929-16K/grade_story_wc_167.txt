<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Samuel’s contradictory impulses—duty to replace glass vs. compulsion to save the atrium—are alive in every micro-choice (unlocking but not working, dropping stones to “read” light). His embodied emotion (“searching the panes for meanings”) and grandfather-haunted interiority feel particular, not therapeutic. The final renunciation (leaving with the portfolio, not tools) costs him the easy paycheck and is earned by the stone-born patterns he has learned to decode. Occupational detail (lead came, hatch for cleaning) is folded into action, not exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: commission → secret experiment → portfolio that may halt demolition. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive in the first 90 words; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the satchel now contains “illumination” rather than glass, reweighting the premise—value is proved in refraction, not spreadsheets. Cost is visible: Samuel forfeits conventional labor for uncertain persuasion, walking away “carrying illumination” instead of wages.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism atrium functions as micro-setting: its glass floor hatch and angled panels enable the stone-drop experiment that drives every beat. Sensory hierarchy is glazier-specific—he notices condensation on lead came, not generic “beauty.” Pearl Bay dawn is filtered through fog, tide-level darkness, and emergent light that the panels reorder into teachable patterns. Spatial choreography is perfect: we track satchel → stone → hatch → water → wall projections without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the atrium—signals in paragraph four. Pressure escalates through each stone-drop: every new pattern is evidence that must outshine profit rhetoric. The meaningful tightening occurs when Samuel realizes the patterns “never repeated exactly,” forcing him to compile rather than replace. Cost is legible: he trades paid labor time for unbillable research, staking reputation on optics rather than invoices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from the particular: frozen silica “still dreaming of flow” becomes a metaphor for overlooked value. Noctilucent reckonings remain untranslated for others, so the ending’s ambiguity—will the developer see?—invites reader reflection without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: the developer’s “fingers tracing the lead came” betrays doubt that spreadsheets can’t voice. Final image reweights “clear complexity” as a social currency, not just an aesthetic one.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Samuel’s perceptual signature—light is “revelations,” condensation is “beaded on every surface.” Syntax mirrors glasswork precision: clauses are cut and fitted like panes (“concentric circles fractured into rainbows”). No head-hopping; the developer appears only through Samuel’s interpretive lens. Grandfather’s diction (“Watch how light bends”) is cleanly italicized as remembered speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for mist, staccato for stone strikes. Metaphors are coherent—water rings as “bell in a distant chapel”—and kept sparse so the final “illumination in his satchel” lands clean. No loops or scaffold; “stone...stone...stone” is purposeful anaphora, not churn. Information density is high: one sentence slips in lifetime craft, present tension, and metaphor (“forty years cutting...searching the panes for meanings”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of glazier craft + light physics + endangered architecture feels fresh and inevitable. The “noctilucent reckonings” trope is transformed from atmospheric footnote to evidentiary weapon. Risk—quiet climax via portfolio而非confrontation—pays off by aligning with Samuel’s reflective temperament. Specificity (lead came, hatch cleaning port) anchors the concept in lived occupation.</question>
