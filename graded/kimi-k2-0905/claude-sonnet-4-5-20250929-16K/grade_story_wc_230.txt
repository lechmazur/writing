<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s solitude, her methodical foraging, and the embodied shame of broadcasting her loneliness are vivid; the micro-choice to press the glass eye to her temple crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The “door closing softly” is a perfect embodied metaphor for regained interiority, and the cost—she will now descend alone again, still storm-scarred—lands with felt weight. Interior contradiction is present but could be sharper under higher pressure; the neighbor’s visit is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the relational crucible. Still, her flawed endurance earns its stasis, and the specificity of truffle scent in damp ravine air keeps her from archetype.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: the glass eye’s click shut reweights the entire premise—empathy is no longer compulsory—and the cost is legible in her solitary descent. Causality holds: because she cannot lie, she must isolate; because she finds the relic, she can occlude; because she occludes, she regains agency. The Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: each mention of storm, root, or banned text thickens the texture until the final image reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (rope bridge, oil lamp, cot) are fixed early and return charged.</comment>

<comment>The hanging orchard is not backdrop but tool: the swaying bridge forces her confident footing, the ravine’s updraft carries truffle scent, the storm-battered trunks require her body to twist and reach. Micro-setting qualifies—the glass eye’s gold flecks swim in lamplight, constraining her decision to trust it. Weather is causal: horizontal rain drives her indoors to the textbooks, then back out to test the occlusion. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices root-grip, oil-wrapped cloth, the faint fungal musk that city-dwellers never learned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she reclaim a private self—signals early and tightens once: the neighbor’s weeping broadcast proves the cost of continued exposure. The meaningful deepening occurs when she registers the “door closing softly”; options narrow from forced broadcast to chosen silence. No reversals are needed; the pressure is situational and accumulative, culminating in the crystallized stance on the bridge. Cost is visible: she forfeits communal empathy forever, accepting perpetual solitude as the price of coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the value of privacy is argued through fungal scent, storm-raw knuckles, and the neighbor’s tears. Subtext operates in the glass eye’s pale blue—an empty socket now full of withheld feeling. The final image of her descending alone reweights “fractured grace” from wound to tool; no moral is declared, only enacted. Avoids thematic echo; the closest—“constant empathy was its own torture”—is anchored in her body on the swaying bridge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: she catalogs root systems, scents, banned footnotes, never city slogans. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses under storm pressure: “She pocketed the glass eye carefully.” No dialogue appears; thus no voice convergence issues. Register remains within her plausible lexicon—no academic jargon invades her ravine tongue. The rhythmic control of “door closing softly” versus “storm-battered apple trees” mirrors her inner shift from noise to chosen silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences multitask: “Wrapped in oilcloth beneath an oak’s exposed roots: an antique glass eye, pale blue with gold flecks that seemed to swim in the light” delivers prop, texture, and metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors stay physically coherent—gold flecks swim, not “shattered galaxies.” Opening and closing lines are propulsive: first anchors vocation and peril, last recharges “storm-scarred and surviving” with newfound agency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus premise is familiar, yet the inversion—seeking occlusion rather than connection—feels non-obvious and inevitable here. The truffle-forager profession is not quirky ornament; her nose-trained attention justifies noticing the oilcloth bundle. Discarded psychology texts as grimoire freshens the banned-knowledge trope. Final image of her descending to search for others who need their doors returned converts personal fix into mission without sentimental uplift. Risk distinction +0.3: the orchard suspended above a ravine is a bold spatial choice that heightens isolation and stakes.</comment>
