<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Kessa’s embodied tremor, pulse-anchored interiority, and the final steady-handed turn all feel earned; the pendant’s hum makes micro-choices legible under pressure. The only slack is a slight over-label of “nervousness” early on instead of purely somatic cues. Still, her hierarchy of values (wonder > speed) crystallizes in the farmer beat and charges the closing image. Cost is visible: she surrenders protective haste and accepts emotional exposure.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: pendant activation → thickened time → wonder exchange → steadier return. Each escalation is because/therefore; no teleporting props. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses perpetual hurry and the hollowness Orin warned about; cost is felt in the final line where “jittery perhaps” admits the fear endures even as hands steady. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3; later spatial cues remain coherent.</comment>

<comment>Aurora, ridgeway stones, and the pendant’s copper patina are filtered through courier bias—what’s stable, what sings. The lights shift from pretty backdrop to child-dragon lens, charging the final image. Micro-setting rule met: pendant-as-tool constrains the farmer-scene choice and recurs at closure. Selective sensory economy keeps momentum; no static catalogue. Weather (aurora intensity) tracks causally with emotional beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—carry wonder, not just parcels—surfaces early and tightens when she chooses conversation over haste; that choice forecloses the self-protective speed option. Pressure grows under causal lens: each pulse of the pendant costs time vulnerability. Herbalist beat reiterates the price: conversations become flowers that “never stop blooming,” proving irreversible commitment. No coincidence; escalation is her agency to extend moments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: routine is fertile ground, wonder is cultivated, not found. Subtext lives in gesture—the farmer setting down tools mirrors Kessa setting down fear. Final image of steady hands and humming pendant reweights prior tremor into earned poise. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Counter-reading possible: is she now trapped in the same cycle? Ambiguity is productive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is courier-practical (stone stability, wind lore). Diction stays within mountain vernacular; no academic drift. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during aurora awe, shorter during pendant throb. Filter verbs serve voice (“felt its delicate structure”) rather than detachment. Dialogue minimal but natural; farmer’s “dragons dancing” idiom distinct from Kessa’s interior register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Sentences carry double duty: “leather strap… bouncing against her ribs” grounds anxiety and props line. Metaphors are consistent (time thickens like honey) and don’t collide. Zero paraphrase loops; tight compression in “three seasons hadn’t filled” avoids backstory bloat. Copy-clean; no typos. Opening and closing lines bookend with tactile propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trove—magic pendant, aurora trail—recast as quiet social engineering rather than epic quest. Dragonfly relic’s function (time-dilation for empathy) feels novel and specific; removal would collapse entire logic. Risk taken by making climax a conversation, not peril, yet tension holds. Fresh angle: couriers as deliberate myth-gardeners. Could wish for sharper local detail (valley names, courier oath) but length constraints honored.</comment>
