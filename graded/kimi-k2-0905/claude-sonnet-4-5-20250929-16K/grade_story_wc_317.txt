<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Miranda’s motives are sketched—save the indie escape room—but her interiority stays generic (“heavy with possibility,” “understanding that she had found her answer”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the corpse-flower success feels gifted, not wrested. The final choice to refuse buyouts is declared, not paid for with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bloom re-weights her business model and refusal of chains. Causal chain is soft—mentor’s posthumous seed arrives without prior setup, growth is impossible, crowds materialize off-stage—but the lens (Hybrid → Accumulative) holds. One meaningful tightening: turning the plant into a live puzzle shifts revenue and strategy. Cost is implied via independence, not felt on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mill-by-creek, moonlit garden, storm-washed air: selective sensory detail anchors each beat. The brook’s “eternal song” and midnight bloom create nocturnal atmosphere that directly feeds the escape-room mystique. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save Labyrinth’s End from corporate takeover—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via Accumulative pattern: seed → viral plant → revenue spike → higher offers. The reversal (using the bloom as puzzle) narrows options, but the cost of refusal is off-stage; stakes feel abstract. One visible forfeiture (mentor’s death) is backstory, not on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of artisanal resistance to commodification emerges through the corpse-flower metaphor—rare, uncloneable, fetid yet alluring. Subtext is strongest when the stench becomes part of the story experience. Final paragraph drifts toward explicit thesis (“she would keep Labyrinth’s End independent, wild, unique”), trimming resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays close to Miranda; perceptual signature favors puzzle-solver diction (“orthogonal angles,” “solution clicks”). Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for plant growth, shorter beats for revelation. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior voice remains consistent, if slightly elevated above casual speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, varied in cadence; figurative language is selective (“leaves unfurling like dark secrets”). No loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated phrasing (“storm-born silence,” “charged with possibility”) flirts with register drift but stays within lyrical tolerance. High density; every paragraph advances premise or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower-as-business-metaphor is fresh; grafting botanical rarity onto indie-versus-chain conflict feels inevitable in hindsight. Mentor’s posthumous puzzle-seed campaign risks contrivance, yet the specificity of the Titan arum bloom keeps it from template territory. Risk-taking in merging nature spectacle with escape-room design pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
