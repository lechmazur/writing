<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Marcus’s interiority is vivid (“cremation urn fragment pressed against his ribs”) and his motive—finding a way to measure unmeasurable time—drives every beat. The moment he slots the urn shard and hears the click crystallizes a credible, earned shift from lost to entrusted. No secondary character shares the scene, so relationship crucible is N/A; his solitary stance is fully dramatized. Flaw: one slide toward diagnostic self-awareness (“borrowed-time timekeeper” repeated) but corrected by embodied cost at descent.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus leaves with new purpose and Chen’s experiential framework, cost paid by the ache of Samuel’s ashes now warm in pocket. Causal chain intact: urn fragment → triggers capsule → reveals Chen’s message → redefines timekeeping. Orientation anchored by 60 words (“emerald silo… prairie light”). Lens held: Causal, because each beat narrows options until only Chen’s anti-numeric path remains.</comment>

<comment>Green-glass silo filters light into usable wavelengths—setting actively re-tools perception, not postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography clean: ladder ascent, floor crouch, descent at dusk. Prairie cold and rusted ladder echo internal erosion of old chronology. Micro-setting (urn shard) charges final image; its warmth against ribs is tactile proof of reclaimed rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—time measurement without numbers—tightens once: the click of the urn shard forecloses futile equations and forces adoption of Chen’s sensory clock. Price legible: Marcus forfeits analytical certainty for embodied duty (“weight of responsibility” now literally in his coat). No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word arc.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: time as lived texture vs. abstract quantity. Chen’s diagrams of frost-feel and grief-weight reprice the premise without sermon. Subtext in garage-sale poetics (“heavy as three summer storms”) smuggles old worldbut the final image of warm ash reweights earlier elegy into stewardship. No moralizing paragraph; resonance stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: numbers as shapes, midnight as color. Syntax flexes under pressure—short clauses during click moment, longer reflective cadence inside glass chamber. No dialogue, hence dialogue bullets N/A. Filter verbs minimal; sensory diction (“jagged edge pressing”) keeps immediacy. Register stable, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare and tested (“monument to an era when numbers still meant something”)—passes ear-read. High information density: one sentence = climbed + found capsule + noted ash mix. Only minor scaffold: “time capsule lay where he’d found it last week” could compress, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The inversion—numbers become feelings, timekeeping becomes anti-metric—is fresh, fully committed, and grows naturally from character need. Garage-sale code as dead-drop channel and ash-infused shard as calibration key are specific, non-obvious inventions. Risky lyric compression works because closure reverts to tactile image. Could not swap silo or shard without collapsing logic.</comment>
