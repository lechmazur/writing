<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s curator reflex is shown believably—she “handled the aged locket with careful reverence,” catalogs Iris through neighbors, and courts no epiphany. Interiority stays concrete; the choice to approach Iris is small but earned. Flaw: her grief-motive is asserted (“learned too late…”) not dramatized, muting internal contradiction. No status/relationship crucible on-page keeps score below 8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Iris re-enters courtyard community; cost is her raw sobbing and the visible pile of ignored letters—Charged Poise achieved. Causal chain intact: locket→address→mailbox→Iris. Orientation anchored by l.60; no ambiguity. One soft spot: mailbox payoff is off-stage (they “went to the basement,” scene cut) blunting Decisive Change image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Courtyard is sketched via sensory triage—bougainvillea color, fountain burble, tai-chi scrape—each filtered through Maya’s listening lens. Spatial choreography holds; no white-room. Brass key and locket micro-setting constrain choice. Factory-building details stay generic, and mailbox interior is skipped; environment never forcibly narrows final tactics, capping below 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can listening lure a shut-away woman back to life?—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Iris appears in tears. Maya’s agency is to approach and offer key; this single beat re-opens Iris’s life, but cost is borne by Iris (sobbing, letters) rather than Maya, so protagonist price is oblique. Accumulative lens holds; one meaningful cadence shift sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief witnessed in communal listening—emerges through neighbors’ mosaic voices, never sermonized. Final image of Iris hearing “small things” resists moral tag, achieving resonance. Subtext lives in gestures: tai-chi serenity vs. Iris’s shuddering shoulders. Avoids tidy bromides; complexity accepted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maya’s perceptual idiom—objects “whisper stories,” dawn paints walls “color of fresh wounds.” Syntax stays lean, lightly lyrical; no filter-verb glut. Dialogue sparse but natural (“Sad story,” not breaking flow). Voice converges slightly with Iris in final paragraph; brief, acceptable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length, no template cadence. Information-dense: locket, key, address delivered in three brisk clauses. Minor loop: “always at dawn, always alone” is proximate restatement; “sandstorm calm” metaphor returns four times—pattern taught but edges close to churn. No clarity loss at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: grief unlocked via thrift-store curator + neighborhood oral mosaic. Locket→key→mailbox chain feels novel yet inevitable. Risks quiet resolution without thriller twist; choice honors theme. Familiar “dead partner → recluse → return” spine keeps it from top band.</comment>
