<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maria’s “dynamically observant” trait is asserted more than dramatized; only one micro-choice (climbing down to read the wrap) is shown, so the interior contradiction/test under pressure is thin. The final decision to bear witness through song is credible but cost is asserted, not embodied. Still, her perceptual specificity and the embodied fiddle keep her above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maria’s stance crystallizes when she pockets the flake and adds the new verse, with felt cost (“luminous disbelief”). Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern of names + song cadence reweights her mission. One scaffold flaw: the glass flake isTeleport-dropped onto the seat with no causal trail; luckily it is later tied to the wrap reveal, so the break is minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mountain pullout and fluttering mesh are viscerally anchored; scaffolding distance and slope under boots track cleanly. The mesh-as-setting actively constrains the discovery beat—names only visible at full wind-taut tension—so environment shapes tactics. Sensory economy favors wind/light/touch over visual catalog. Micro-setting (fiddle case, glass flake) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she accept witness to the vanished?”—tightens once when she sees the names and again when she decides to sing. No reversible opposition, but pressure grows accumulatively: each spoken name layers obligation. Cost is conceptual (now responsible for the disappeared) rather than visceral; still legible under lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of witness-as-amnesty emerges through image pattern (glass, mesh, song) rather than statement. Final line reframes bridge-songs from metaphor to archival duty—earned reweighting. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains (will the songs free or merely remember?). Pixelated amnesty concept risks jargon, but is grounded in the mesh flakes of light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maria’s musician sensorium—sound, wind pressure, harmonics. Syntax mirrors cadence: long lyrical sentences for climb, clipped fragments at discovery. No head-hop; perceptual signature distinct. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels like narrator intrusion, but rare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). One paraphrase loop: “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” appears twice with no added charge—minor loop. Metaphors stay coherent (glass flake = frozen raindrop), no mixed vehicles. Clean tense control; information front-loaded efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Vanishing-hitchhiker trope is refreshed via collodion plate + construction-wrap steganography—specific to high-altitude roadwork. Bridge-song tradition fused with cold-case archive feels organic. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant final note. Not wholly unprecedented, but synthesis is memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
