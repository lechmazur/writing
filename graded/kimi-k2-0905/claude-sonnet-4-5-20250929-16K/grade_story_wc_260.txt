<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—gentle caretaker vs. complicit academic—is embodied in the notebook beats and the arm-grip moment with Prism. The final renunciation (resignation + independent application) is causally earned by the reflective sequence and carries visible professional cost. Still, the epiphany is slightly over-articulated (“true compassion required strength”) and the self-forgiveness feels a touch therapeutic, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dawn quiet, Prism’s tail curl, and the stacked documents reconfigure stakes with felt cost (career security forfeited). Causal chain is clean—fraud discovery → notebook truth → resignation—and the lens (Causal) holds. One micro-drag: the “three days” tick is told late, so the initial orientation wobble costs −0.2, but the payoff at closure waives heavier cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fogged terrarium glass, humidity drip, and starlit valley create a coherent micro-climate that literally cages her choices. Prism’s shedding skin and color-shift serve as body-setting extensions that charge the final image. While the workshop never becomes a tactical obstacle, the misted glass physically traps her gaze and forces the decision beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity vs. animal welfare—tightens once when she chooses to blow the whistle yet stay as caretaker. The single meaningful turn (notebook draft → resignation letter) narrows options under Causal lens and prices her out of funded security. Pressure is coherent but solitary; no external antagonist or ticking permit deadline escalates beyond the internal pivot, capping it short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of ethical reconstruction emerges through the chameleon’s shed and the notebook’s layered pages rather than thesis statements. Final image of Prism’s tail as “promise” reweights prior fraud without moralizing. One soft echo: “shimmering stillness” is named twice, slightly declawing subtext, but the resonance holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mara’s sensory filter—humidity on glass, claw pressure on forearm. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then shortens to staccato note-form for the report beats, mirroring decision momentum. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature; the reptile-color metaphors could verge on purple but stay within her professional gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative layer is restrained to chameleon palette and mist, avoiding metaphor clutter. One minor loop: “windows fogged… misted leaves… mist rolled” repeats “mist” without pattern-teaching, a −0.2 scaffold hit, but it never obscures causality or dulls the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fraud-exposed researcher turns whistle-blower is familiar terrain, yet the herpetological detail (color-shift as communication, tail-shed as method) supplies fresh specificity. The parallel between chameleon skin and academic self-reinvention feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; no formal experiment, but the quiet biological metaphor elevates the stock premise.</comment>
