<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Summoner’s interiority is lyrical but generic; “tranquil blaze of focus” is label-speak, not embodied contradiction. She acts—mapping, trading hush—but the cost (solitude entrenchment) is asserted, not dramatized on her body or choice. Still, her calm agency propels every beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s causal spine.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: wing → trace → trade hush → blur journal → dust. Closure is Earned Stasis: world saved, her solitude deepens; cost legible in the final smile of ignorance. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn (wing crumbles) tightens the last beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Brook, paper dust, and forest breath are filtered through summoner’s ritual attention; micro-setting (stone, satchel, ink smear) constrains the mapping act. Night-cycle progression is tracked without spatial drift. However, environment never endangers or materially limits her; it’s a backdrop, not a crucible, capping 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hush the prophecy before alignment”—is signaled early and escalates via countable ember-locations she must extinguish. Each traded hush narrows her future: deeper erasure duty, permanent isolation. Cost is visible in the apprentice’s ruined page and her own dawn-kneeling stiffness; alignment reduced to “merely astronomical” is a clear win with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: salvation through curated ignorance; resonance lands in the final smile that embraces uncelebrated heroism. No moralizing—meaning arises from the inverse mapping of silence. The crane’s dust reweights the opening image, offering conceptual repricing without statement. Ambiguity lingers: what else has she erased?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to summoner’s perceptual filter: cool air traced, paper “worn soft,” hush as tactile currency. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for trance, clipped fragments at dust moment. No head-hop; diction consistent with scholarly rural recluse. One register spike: “terrestrially cosmic” feels academic but is diegetically motivated by prophecy text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; figuratives (“embers scattered across a dark landscape”) are sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. One paraphrase hiccup: “prophecy spoken in code” / “prophecy’s sharp edges” within three lines—minor. Closure image crisp, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fantastic premise—reversing prophecy by erasing collective memory—feels fresh yet inevitable here. Crane wing as data-storage and ritual focus is a lovely reframing of trope. Solitary hero saving world from un-knowable doom reverses chosen-one cliché. Risk is moderate; could push further into ecological or political implications, but within 750 words the angle is memorable.</comment>
