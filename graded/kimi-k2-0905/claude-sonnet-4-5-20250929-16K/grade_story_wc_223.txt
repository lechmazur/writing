<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s shift from paid pretender to obsessive archivist of vanished pawns is visceral and embodied; the contradiction between rehearsed disaster and lived collapse drives every micro-choice. Her “benevolently ruthless” cruelty is shown through exacting gait-coaching that costs both her and survivors real pain, earning the final stance. Interiority stays concrete—smoke taste, marble chill—never sliding into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the colleague’s single-scene challenge, while efficient, slightly underweights relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the gallery itself becomes living archive, the pawns’ walks forever imprinted in stone and air—cost paid in Mara's exhaustion and the survivors’ repeated reliving. Causal chain holds: interregnum chaos → sanctuary discovery → acoustic archive method → final crystallized stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with “old parliament's whispering gallery.” No lens ambiguity; the accumulative/textural pattern is taught early and tightens into the charged poise of the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gallery’s acoustic physics and pawn-less chessboard are not backdrop but instruments: curvature dictates the archiving method, missing squares literalize the erased populace. Nomadic penumbra of firelight is filtered through Mara’s crisis-trained eye, narrowing to “specific angle of fingers waving goodbye.” Spatial choreography is flawless—footfall patterns, resonance nodes, chalk arcs tracked without drift. Environment directly constrains the final choice to keep walking the memories, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the small gestures vanish?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when Mara forces survivors to repeat walks until “paths branded themselves into the gallery's acoustic memory.” Each iteration costs stamina and emotional safety, foreclosing the option to forget. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure of erasure is coherent and cumulative. The final stance crystallizes with visible price: her continued solitude and the building’s irreversible transformation into archive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: history is encoded not in decrees but in the choreography of the powerless. The pawn-less board and foot-spelled names reweight “small” into indispensable, culminating in the resonant image of whispers traveling “impossible curves.” No moralizing—ambiguity lingers in the cost of Mara's cruelty. The luminous absence of the pawns becomes the conceptual repricing that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature—sound loops, chalk dust, muscle fatigue—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short percussive clauses during looters’ intrusion, mirroring pulse. The final paragraph’s cadence reprises “walk” and “whisper,” sealing the acoustic motif. No dialogue contamination; the single spoken exchange is spare and subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “nomadic penumbra” carries triple duty—light, displacement, mood—without purple drift. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (electricity through water) and physically grounded. One clause (“the building was learning the walks”) risks personification stretch, but the pattern has been earned by prior acoustic logic and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The crisis-actor-turned-archivist angle is fresh; the pawn-less chessboard as erased citizenry offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Using footfall typography inside a whispering gallery turns architecture into memory palace—risky, but executed with causal rigor. No trope recycling; the interregnum setting is stripped of generic battle tropes, focused on gestural aftermath. The conceptual gamble pays off in a final image that feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
