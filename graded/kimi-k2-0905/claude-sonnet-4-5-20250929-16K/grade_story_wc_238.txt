<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s compulsion to speak in orchard metaphors while apology-bruised roots the contradiction inside her; the bottle-handling micro-choice (“offering… a physical prayer”) externalizes hierarchy of values with visible cost—she forfeits her protective talisman. Derrick’s refusal to forgive yet admit gladness crystallizes earned stasis without softening his wounds. One minor slip: “imperfect miracles” label surfaces twice in authorial summarizing before it is dramatized, blunting interior contradiction a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the bottle on Schubert charges the final image—truth can beautify or poison, and Mira’s relinquishment reweights the premise with social cost. Drive is Accumulative/Textural; cadence thickens through recurring tree/music metaphors that culminate in the charged hush. Every beat advances pattern without causal gaps; orientation anchors by line 5, well under the 120-word allowance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive paper dust and orchard roots function as micro-setting: paper ghosts → perfume bottle → sheet-music score form a tactile chain that constrains Mira’s gesture of restitution. Sensory funnel stays biased—sound (“invisible symphonies”), scent (ghost perfume), touch (dust motes)—mirroring Mira’s synesthetic guilt without tourist cataloging. Spatial choreography holds across the single continuous scene; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—genuine apology before demolition—tightens once when Derrick withholds forgiveness, foreclosing easy absolution; cost is Mira’s public relinquishing of the bottle/identity. Escalation is textural: each reprise of metaphor or orchard image accretes pressure until confession and refusal crystallize stance. Coincidence absent; agency resides in Mira’s decision to stay and speak, plus Derrick’s counter-decision to accept presence but not absolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Imperfect miracles” emerges organically from concrete events—exposing scandal hurt yet exposed truth, perfume enhances or suffocates—rather than authorial thesis. Final image of bottle on score offers resonant, non-literal answer: exorcism of self-myth, cost is the relic itself. Theme resists tidy moral; ambiguity persists in Derrick’s withheld forgiveness and Mira’s unended penance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Focalization stays stable in single close-third; psychic distance modulates—compressed “dust motes suspended” vs. expanded reverie on perfume—without register drift. Perceptual signature is metaphor-saturated yet character-specific to Mira’s gossip-columnist habit of translating life into imagery; Derrick’s minimal dialogue (“There’s my metaphor-addicted friend”) counters with weary dryness, maintaining voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Minimal scaffold; rhythm breathes with minor clauses that echo musical phrasing (“paper ghosts and old varnish”), matching archive motif. Information density high—each sentence advances guilt/atonement while layering sensory texture; no paraphrase loops detected. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent within sound/light orchard logic; closure image remains clear without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>7.9</question>
<comment>Fusion of celebrity-exorcist columnist with orchard-archive reparation feels fresh; no close echoes. Risk lies in metaphor density, but coherence and closure payoff justify the lyric tilt. Without the orchard/music/recording metaphors the story collapses, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
