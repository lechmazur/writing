<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Kera’s contradictory impulse—clutching others’ discarded dreams while dodging her own—surfaces in every beat; the camera-wheel click she pockets is a micro-choice that forecloses perpetual delay. The ghost’s silent invitation crystallizes her hierarchy of values: legacy > shame. Interiority is embodied (“regret tasted like copper and cloud-water”) not therapized. Cost is legible: the ghost’s cool solid hand accepts her past, ending the stall but not absolving it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Chronology is deliberately disoriented but taught in the opening clause and pays off when the wheel re-introduces sequence; orientation debt waived. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each overheard shard adds density until the pattern breaks with the wheel’s first click, reweighting her options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the joined hands reconfigure the stagnant present without false redemption, lagoon reflection as conceptual cost. Persistent constraint: stopped carousel / continuing lagoon underwrites every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Kinetic lagoon, floating stones, and mist-threaded voices are filtered through Kera’s scavenger bias; silver water mocking stillness mirrors her paralysis. The camera wheel’s plastic teeth supply micro-setting that advances film-frame-by-frame metaphor. Spatial choreography is clean: 20-foot ghost distance, pocketing wheel, approached hand. Environment narrows choice—only above-cloud detritus offers raw material for reinvention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—create vs. abandon personal legacy—signals early. Escalation is tonal/density-based: accumulating story-shards tighten the vise of unmade gardens until wheel-click forces the decisive tightening. Cost is visible: accepting the ghost’s touch means abandoning the alibi of perpetual maybe. No causal reversal, but accrual pattern break satisfies Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulate detail: scavenging others’ regrets as narcotic avoidance of one’s own stalled blueprint. Final image of blueprints “eroded but still legible” in spinning water reweights ambition from monument to modest floating plot—Conceptual Repricing without moral tag. Subtext resides in ghost’s silent tilt: invitation, not indictment. No thematic echo; avoids sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Kera; perceptual signature notices salvageable whispers and metallic taste of remorse, not tourist vistas. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“Easier to carry other people’s failures.” No head-hopping; ghost remains opaque, as required. Rhythm accelerates into single-sentence paragraph before final handshake, mirroring urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm alternates between long spirals and staccato clicks; no template cadence. Figurative layer selective—“carousel of opportunities” appears once and recurs as literal stopped ride. High density: one sentence often conveys elapsed decades and sensory bite. Line 3 mixed metaphor (weight of hours vs. decades) is hairline but closure unaffected. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cloud-scavenging above a stalled carousel reframes familiar mid-life regret trope. Specificity—the toothed plastic wheel advancing non-existent film—grounds surreal frame. Conceptual risk of timeless anti-physics lagoon pays off by closure. Not a template plot; removal of wheel or kinetic lagoon would collapse metaphoric engine.</comment>
