<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaela’s contradiction—survival-through-elusiveness versus the promise-driven need to be found—remains interior and abstract; we see her place rocks, but no micro-choice visibly risks that elusivity. The climactic “tears on her face” is declared, not embodied, so the cost feels foreshadowed rather than felt. Still, her eel-herder kinesis, undulating instead of walking, is a vivid, body-level quirk that never relaxes into stock phrasing, and her final decision to teach rather than hide lands as credible endurance. Cap stays just below 8.3 because the decisive change is not dramatized in a beat that costs her safety on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pattern’s purpose flips from retrospective explanation to prospective pedagogy, with the visible cost of “borrowed dawn” becoming “earned.” Causal chain holds—dust → math → eel mirroring → insight—but the intermediate beat where she nearly loses the rocks to the tide is summarized, not shown, softening the because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when), so no penalty. Lens stays Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frictionless world rule is learned through action—rocks slipping, Kaela’s undulating gait—never dumped. The bluff’s “memory of friction” is a micro-setting that literally lets stones stay put long enough for her sequence, thus constrains the final layout; this lifts toward the 9-gate. Aurora and eel geometries are sketched with selective, POV-colored sensory strokes (silver bodies, purple dust), avoiding tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible object positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode before the ocean takes her”—is signaled early and tightens once: the pattern is not about the past but the future, forcing her from solitary decoder to future teacher. Price is conceptual (she must abandon elusivity) rather than visceral, but it is legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required. Escalation is coherent under Causal lens; visions grow insistent because her earlier mistakes raised urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: knowledge shifts from retrospective grief to generational transmission, crystallized in the charged phrase “show humanity how to swim rather than fall.” Collapsed-star-dust and eel geometries re-enter the final paragraph with reweighted meaning, satisfying recurrence test. No final-paragraph moralizing; the single “borrowed dawn” line is image, not thesis statement. Ambiguity—whether the world will still collapse—remains intact and productive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance that can still slip inside Kaela’s perceptual bias (“her feet barely touching the ground”). Diction—“undulating,” “sacred geometries,” “collapsed star dust”—is elevated but consistent with a world whose physics has been rewritten. No head-hopping; POV remains single and stable. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for aurora awe, clipped fragments during vision barrage, mirroring stress without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong verbs (“flared,” “twisted,” “exploded”) and specific nouns (“satchel,” “bluff’s edge”) keep density high; minimal adjective clutter. One mixed metaphor—“aurora sang overhead” versus “threads of light” flaring—is fleeting, does not touch closure. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Proofing is clean; pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—“friction vanishes planet-wide”—is familiar apocalypse, but the eel-herder kinesis, rock-math-as-language, and the flip from explanation to pedagogy feel fresh and specific. Sacred geometry trope is grounded in lived occupational detail (herding eels) rather than mystic hand-waving. Collapsed star dust as pre-change cosmic compression is a neat, non-obvious world rule. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in closure; no gimmickry.</comment>
