<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Margritte’s motive—“compress eternity into a moment”—is stated once and never pressured; she never doubts, stalls, or recalibrates. Tessian’s shift from perfection to wonder is legible but happens off-stage, voiced rather than dramatized. No micro-choice under strain reveals contradictory impulses; the press keeps printing and she keeps winning. The arc lands as thematic assertion, not earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the library “learned to breathe” and drifts instead of locks position—cost is legible. Causality, however, is soft: the bottled whisper acts like a universal solvent that converts antagonist ideology without resistance or backfire. Orientation is swift and coherent; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held to end. Still, the decisive shift is narrated, not dramatized through a final embodied beat, keeping the score under the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard, cloud-sea, and crystalline fruit are rendered with kinetic specificity—books fly “not in chaos but in revelation,” glass trees “bend under the weight of fruits that contained not answers but better questions.” These images directly constrain the climax: the physical deformation of the library is the visible price of Margritte’s intervention. Frost patterns work micro-setting duty, tying dawn ephemerality to the stake of transient truth. Environment is not backdrop; it is the crucible that charges the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake is immediate: preserve predictive perfection vs. allow living uncertainty. Pressure ratchets through accumulative image density—books invert, fruits ripen in impossible colors—but the tightening is delivered via exposition (“the perfect system buckled”) rather than an irreversible on-page choice that forecloses an option for Margritte or Tessian. No tangible resource is spent, lost, or risked in the final third. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical; cost is observed, not paid by the protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—perfection as stasis, impermanence as vitality—emerges through recurring frost/fruit images rather than editorial. The final image of dawn documentation crystallizes the concept without moralizing. The piece courts an “Echo” in the line “perfection is a kind of death,” but the sentence is earned by prior orchard imagery and stands as declarative culmination, not prompt-like filler. Ambiguity remains: chaos is generative yet possibly destructive, letting the aftereffect linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual tilt—selective attention to refraction, frost geometry, iron rhythm—creating a signature cadence. Compression (“reality became negotiable”) is taught early and paid off in the uncorking beat. Dialogue is minimal, stylized but functional; Tessian’s diction is slightly more formal, marking status. No head-hop; psychic distance holds steady; prose rhythm modulates with scene temperature—short clauses under dawn chill, longer coils during argument.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled—sentence length and verb intensity rise as the orchard mutates. Occasional poetic overlay (“alphabetically inside-out”) risks Purple but stays brief and pattern-consistent. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; information density is high. Two filter-verb clusters (“that emerged wasn’t heard so much as felt”) slightly dull the uncorking beat, blocking 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating knowledge-orchard + letterpress insurgency is a fresh synthesis; the bottled whisper object and frost-cipher method feel native to this world rather than bolted on. Risky concept is followed to its end: the perfect AI curator yields without a fight, accepting erotic uncertainty—avoids tidy equilibrium. Could not swap Margritte for any rogue-artist archetype without gutting the mechanism. Deduction for proximity to Borgesian infinite-library DNA, but the industrial-press intrusion reweights the trope sufficiently.</comment>
