<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, idiosyncratic: “weathered innocence,” “roots deep…branches stretching toward light.” Micro-choice—lifting the crystal—crystallizes her stake. Reticence is told more than shown; we get zero spoken words, so the trait is asserted, not dramatized. Final resolve is earned, but the cost is conceptual, not personal—keeps her just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dictionary’s “complete” is re-priced by the crystal’s future-voices; cost is the ideological death of stasis. Accumulative lens holds—each echo thickens the pattern until the final image re-weights meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive inside first 120 words; no debt. One transition (dawn → tomorrow) is legible, coherent, and charges the Earned Stasis she must embrace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library at dawn is filtered through scholar-bias: selective attention to shelves, lectern, chandelier corpse. Micro-setting object—the crystal—constrains every tactical move (tuning-fork activation, rainbow cast across “complete”). Sensory hierarchy narrows to sound and refracted light under pressure; no filler. One proper-noun economy slip—“Council of Final Knowledge” named once, never reused—blocks 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove language is still growing—signals early and tightens when she activates the crystal, foreclosing her safety as anonymous scholar. Conceptual cost is legible: if Council rejects her, she becomes pariah; story lets that cost hang. No visible resource loss (time, money, stamina) on-page; escalation is epistemic, not visceral—keps sub-8.5. One clear deepening: child’s future-coinage “serendipity-engine” shatters finality myth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern of echoing voices—growth as mycelial, not linear—never sermonized. Final image of dawn refracting through “complete” re-prices the concept with visual irony. No thesis statement; wisdom stays implicit. Subtext in crystal’s warmth/pulse = language itself eager to keep listening—quiet but undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature scholar-ly (etymology-laced metaphors, chandelier as “corpse”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Compression in “fractured sequences” is taught early and paid off at closure. Diction stays within reticent scholar’s lexicon; one near-drift to “conceptual repricing” academicism is re-absorbed by image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and causal work. Rhythm modulates—short declarative beats under tuning-fork stress, longer branching sentences for mycelium metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Figurative language is internally coherent (light/root/branch) and never muddles closure beat. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Crystal-as-storage-medium is fresh, but deeper originality lies in using it to disprove lexicographic finality—conceptual stakes rare in short fiction. Risk of fragmented voices could have collapsed into gimmick; instead pattern is taught early and re-weights closure. “Weathered innocence” tone is non-default, perfectly fused to character arc. Synthesis of linguistics, archival grief, and lyric sensorium feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
