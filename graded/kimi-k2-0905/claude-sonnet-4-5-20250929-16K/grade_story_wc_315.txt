<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—wanting to flee yet choosing to teach—grounds every beat; the parachute-buckle tic embodies it. The moment she releases the buckle is a micro-choice that costs her the fantasy of escape and locks her into transparency with the valley. Muscle-memory traversal of the arbor shows embodied knowledge undercutting intellectual doubt. Emotional layering is concrete, never diagnostic; her final stance feels earned, not abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: radio silence → council challenge → arbor re-check → decision to teach rather than dictate. The parachute-buckle release is the visible Decisive Change that forecloses escape; cost is the lifelong weight she accepts. Orientation anchored by word 30; no later disorientation. Closure image (“leaves whispered agreements”) reweights the premise: authority becomes shared burden. Persistent constraint—three-thousand-foot drop—shapes every tactic.</comment>

<comment>Arbor-as-micro-setting: every hand-on-bark read constrains what Vera can claim; moisture angle of leaf-veins literally decides futures. Spatial choreography is spotless—steps left, duck, intersection point—tracked without drift. Starlit silver leaves mirror her internal flicker between doubt and certainty. Final sway above clouds images the precarious trust she must keep aloft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—valley’s survival vs. her credibility—tightens once when council contradiction arrives. Escalation is knowledge-based: doubt could collapse sow/harvest timing; her refutation must be transparent or trust dies. Agency: she risks authority by inviting observers, narrowing her own power. Cost legible: she forfeits solitary mystique forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: expertise must relinquish monologue to survive. “Soundless echo” motif reframes authority as listening; final leaves “whisper agreements” that recast prediction as conversation, not pronouncement. No moralizing—theme stays implicit in the choice to teach. Ambiguity preserved: valley may still misread her openness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual filter—starlight angles, leaf moisture, buckle weight. Syntax lengthens during arbor traversal, compresses during radio draft—rhythm mirrors cognitive load. No head-hop; diction stays within her technical lexicon. Voice feels singular, not committee-averaged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often conveys leaf angle, moisture, wind memory. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors are sparse and consistent (silver/echo). Rhythm breathes—long sentences for arbor drift, staccato for council threat. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or sensation. Closure line is clean, imagistic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—skyborne arbor as oracle—feels fresh yet inevitable. Trope of prophetic hermit is flipped: power surrendered, not hoarded. Specificity of leaf-reading technique grounds the concept; generic fantasy shorthand avoided. Final reconfiguration (transparency > mystique) reweights familiar trust trope into ethical stance. Risk taken with quiet ending pays off.</comment>
