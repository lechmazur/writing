<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Margit’s disciplined, observant nature is convincingly rendered through her “gaps” method and the physical gesture of clutching the boutonnière. The borrowed-memory bleed gives her a credibly destabilizing interior conflict, but the epiphany that “preserved memories aren’t preservation at all” is delivered in abstract shorthand rather than dramatized contradiction, muting the cost of her final release. Still, her choice to drop the flower feels proportionate to her accumulated stance and the story’s scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is clean: a Charged Poise moment—the dropped Edelweiss—reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (permission to forget). Causal chain holds: because the memories hurt, therefore she releases them. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One tightening at the Anna reveal narrows options neatly. Cost is legible in the final image, though the prior exposition is slightly front-loaded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The opal dock/mist twilight is sketched with selective sensory strokes that mirror the blurring of sea/sky and memory/self. The boutonnière functions as micro-setting—its crystalline stem literally storing data—constraining Margit’s choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is secure; weather and tide act causally. Economy prioritized over breadth, appropriate to length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode Ernst’s gesture—signaled early. Pressure escalates through discovery of Anna’s identity, tightening the ethical cost of carrying borrowed grief. Agency is Margit’s decision to release the flower, foreclosing the path of perpetual curation. Coincidence is absent; escalation remains coherent under Causal lens with visible price in the relinquished memories.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as ghost vs. living presence. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing—forgetting as mercy, not betrayal. Ambiguity is meaningful: we’re left with solitude but also lightness. No thematic echo in dialogue; subtext carried by gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Margit’s perceptual filter—weathered fingers, salt taste, lighthouse reflexes. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly maritime in its cadence. No dialogue, so voice remains consistent. Compression in the Zurich backstory is taught early and repaid at closure; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; metaphors (“museum of grief”) are spare and earned. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines serve as resonant brackets. Minor register lift in “crystalline structure perfect for data storage” but brief and motivated by concept; does not obscure closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Edelweiss-as-storage device is fresh yet intuitively right, marrying alpine sentiment to silica lattice. The “gaps” investigation method and nautical-twilight isolation angle a familiar grief plot into surprising terrain. Risk is moderate but successful; transformation test passes—swap flower and setting and the emotional math collapses.</comment>
