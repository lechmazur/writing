<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority glows—her habit of “stealing” light-moments is embodied in the tactile jar, her pulse, the tilt of her gaze. The shift from hoarder to witness is credible because every beat of discovery (photo of herself, moon-curtain, elder’s test) forces a micro-choice that loosens her grip. Cost is visible: she relinquishes the entire collection, foreclosing the old identity. Yet the “quietly savvy” trait is asserted more than demonstrated; we never see her actually outwit a mark on stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is intact: stolen photo → decoded flowers → moon-curtain revelation → release. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—her destiny is not a door but a threshold she must keep crossing, and the released portraits reweight the world’s hidden light. The orientation is crisp inside 120 words. Still, the moon-curtain’s physics (“liquid light poured upward”) is sprung without prior rule-teaching, a mild teleporting-prop wobble that keeps this just shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Emerald Station’s jade tiles, western bench, and skylights are sketched sparingly yet atmospherically; the color clash of emerald + amber + silver is memorable. Spatial choreography stays clean as Mira moves from bench to curtain to final arrangement. The setting never physically constrains her choices, however; it’s backdrop, not crucible, so the 9-gate stays shut.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“see versus possess illuminated moments”—is signaled early and tightened when the self-portrait threatens her self-concept. The reversal (she must give, not take) carries felt price: she scatters her life’s work. Agency is high; coincidence is decorative, not decisive. The escalation is single-tier; no secondary obstacle arises after the moon-curtain, keeping pressure just under the 8-band ceiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: perception itself is the only treasure worth stealing. Subtext lives in gesture—uncapping the jar becomes an act of surrender, not acquisition. The final image of luminous seeds drifting outward reconfigures meaning without moralizing. One soft echo: “threshold you walked through, again and again” drifts toward thesis-statement, a hairline slip that caps this below 9.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person narration keeps tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly, light-obsessed, mirroring Mira’s lens. Syntax flexes from clipped (“She waited…”) to lyric (“liquid silver, responsive…”) without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. The only micro-dip: “luminous disbelief washed through” flirts with label-speak, but the embodied follow-through saves it.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet image-rich; most sentences advance either light-action or interior turn. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors stay consistent within the optics motif. A single mixed image—“voice like rustling petals”—is fleeting enough not to dull the final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of heist beat with lyric meditation on transience feels fresh; “stealing sunsets” could have been twee but is grounded in concrete procedure (angle math, flower codes). Risk is taken—upward-pouring moonbeam curtain—yet payoff is emotionally legible. The concept travels: any city, any night, yet the details are irreducibly this station, this woman. Missing the final half-step into unforgettable imagery keeps it beneath 9.</comment>
