<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority stays concrete—scarred palms, kiln knowledge, frost reading—and her renunciation of providence in favor of slow condensation is earned. The “steadily adaptive” label appears, risking diagnostic-speak, but is immediately anchored to lungs & glass-work, so only a −0.2. No contradictory impulses staged in simultaneous scene-action, so 9-bar missed by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: frost image reweights survival from cosmic purpose to humble accretion; cost is the surrender of grand narrative. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern (frost ≈ hidden networks) taught by 25 % and reprises in final line. One transition (night → dawn) is legible and coherent. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits at word 24; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Canyon wall warmth, star shadows, and frost lattices are filtered through glass-maker’s heat-trained perception; setting constrains her reading method and supplies the final image. Micro-setting (ledger strip as “kiln-scorched map”) charges closure. No spatial drift; bodies and distances track. Slight over-cranked lyricism in “drifting resonance” phrase, but it serves tone, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: find out why she survived. Pressure tightens when frost method reveals she was mere geography, shrinking her significance; that stings enough to qualify as cost. Single meaningful deepening suffices for 600-word accumulative arc. No visible external price (money, tool, blood) but conceptual cost is legible, so meets 8-band floor, not 9-band which wants persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without announcement: meaning accrues like condensation, not revelation. Frost motif re-enters final sentence and re-weights earlier glass/light imagery into same physics. No final-paragraph sermon; last line is imagist. Minor abstraction in “luminous quality of morning frost” but image is specific enough to escape platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close to sensorium; perceptual signature fused with glass-artist heat vocabulary (“kiln’s heat capacity,” “molten glass”). No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. Filter verbs minimal; two instances of “she understood” forgiven by immediate sensory anchorage. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for starlit contemplation, clipped fragments at frost discovery. No head-hopping; POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. One paraphrase loop (“meaning…meaning” inside 30 words) spotted but does not touch closure, so −0.2. Metaphors stay within glass/heat/frost continuum—no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines are sharp, book-ending with tactile heat → evaporative sound. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: arson survivor + forensic accounting via frost physics. Premise could drift to thriller cliché but stays in lyric-textural mode. Risk taken with quiet, non-retributive ending; coherence holds. Slight proximity to “survivor finds hidden clue” template, but glass-maker’s professional gaze reforges it. No bold structural risk beyond accumulative shards, sufficient at this length.</comment>
