<comment>Mara’s interiority is rich—her skepticism, grief, and stubborn refusal to accept isolation as death feel lived-in. The embodied reaction to the seashell’s resonance and her micro-choice to press it to her chest ground her arc. Yet the sister Anya remains an off-page memory rather than relationship-as-crucible, so the relational pressure that could force a costlier stance is missing. The final renunciation (“we start with Anya’s full memory sequence”) is credible but the emotional price is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s discovery that quarantined memories can sing back as living seeds crystallizes options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—the seashell-flower duet is foreshadowed by the whispered resonance—and the final image reweights the archive from mausoleum to germinating garden. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; the reader feels the shift yet not a palpable personal loss in this beat. One tightening turn suffices; orientation anchors arrive by word 70; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>The velvet garden’s phosphorescent mist and indigo petals are sensuously selective, tethered to Mara’s ankle-clinging motion. The crystalline Archive hum is learned through action, not dump. Micro-setting rule met: the seashell-tool literally constrains the final tactic—its resonance rewrites the archive’s function—and the flower color (Anya’s eyes) charges the closing image. Spatial choreography stays clean as Chen steps from shadow; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can isolation become transformation rather than death?—is signaled early and tightens once when the shell-flower duet proves memories can stay “alive.” Agency is intellectual (Mara proposes the new method) but still forecloses the old specimen model; the cost is institutional/epistemic rather than personal-extreme. Under Accumulative lens, the density shift from frozen blooms to pulsing seeds is an adequate intensification. A visceral price (e.g., losing Anya again) would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living resonance versus dead specimen. The refrain of “tragically radiant” blooms gains new weight when they begin to sing, reconfiguring quarantine from tomb to seedbed. No moral is stated; the final image invites reflection on preservation versus continuance. Subtext in Chen’s shimmer (he carries multiple quarantines) hints at the bureaucrat’s hidden vulnerability without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person hovers close to Mara’s perceptual filter: “architecture of preserved moments,” “resonance structures that bypass language.” Syntax mirrors her scientific-poetic mind; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but natural—Chen’s “You’re early” carries subtext of shared obsession. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under wonder (“My God, it’s a seed”) without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with the scene: long, mist-laden clauses in garden description, shorter beats at the revelatory duet. Information density is high—each paragraph advances premise or image. Minor scaffold: “tragically radiant” is used twice in close proximity; the second could be cut. No mixed metaphors; “ghostly resolve” sustains tonal coherence without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The quarantined-memory-as-living-resonance concept feels fresh, avoiding typical dystopic数据-cold tropes. The seashell half and phosphorescent garden are specific to this world; swap any element and the metaphor collapses. Risk in poetic science is rewarded: resonance structures bypass language entirely, yet the story commits fully. The synthesis of grief-tech-botany lands as inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
