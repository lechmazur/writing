<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maris’s exile-return motive is crisp, but her interiority flattens into label-speak (“navigated absences, the cartography of what was no longer there”). The single decisive boat-trip is earned, yet the prior beats show no contradictory impulse in scene; visions arrive as gift, not fraught choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: valve discovery → vision refinement → new charts → boats follow. Closure lands with visible cost—she risks first voyage, nets prove method. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor’s salt-spray limestone and the valve-as-tool satisfy micro-setting gate; environment guides her staggered observational schedule and final trumpet wind-song. Sensory selection stays urgent—taste of salt, mist on skin—never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake—“fishermen won’t go out”—is signaled early and tightens once when Maris re-maps routes. Cost is legible: she stakes her life on untested charts. No secondary reversal, but single meaningful turn is sufficient under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory-loss emerges through specific maritime detail; no overt thesis stated. Final trumpet note reweights prior valve motif, offering conceptual repricing—“spaces between notes”—without moralizing. Subtext in fishermen’s silence carries weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable, with ocean-spray-touched perceptual signature (“air tasted of salt and forgiveness”). Prose rhythm subtly mirrors tide-cycles; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue minimal but natural when harbormaster speaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean read-aloud rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high—“limestone cliffs still wept” layers setting, weather, emotion. Sentence variety supports propulsion. Final trumpet image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ocean-spray archive reading is fresh; valve repurposed as epistemic tool rather than mere relic. Exile-return frame is familiar, but maritime memory-loss angle and visionary constraint feel specific. Synthesis makes freshness feel inevitable.</comment>
