<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt-driven solitude and Kael’s guarded hope are rendered through micro-gestures (turning the ink well, tapping fingers) that externalize interior contradiction; the final hand-clasp is earned because her months of “carefully reckless” isolation have visibly cost them both, making the restored collaboration feel freighted rather than facile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: the ink well reframed as “prism” crystallizes the before/after of trust restored yet paths diverging tomorrow; the causal lens holds because Maren’s solitary “unsnarling” is the necessary predicate for Kael’s decision to re-engage, and the cost—six months of silence, tomorrow’s separation—is legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The archive’s sealed containers of “final whispers” and the single lamp’s amber on glass create a micro-setting that literally houses the stakes; the ink well’s shifting reflections constrain pacing (Maren buys seconds before speaking) and charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates through the revealed method itself: each disclosed layer of harmonic grammar narrows the emotional option of permanent rupture, forcing Kael’s either/or—trust her again or lose the discovery—and the price (tomorrow’s geographic split) is fixed on-page, meeting the lens requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relationship between linguistic extinction and human connection: dead languages “sing again” only through collaborative risk, so the partners’ reconciliation becomes the living harmonic that proves the theory; no moral is stated—the prism image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—curved glass, dust motes, the war in Kael’s eyes—while diction (“carefully reckless,” “symphonies of truth”) remains within academic-poetic idiom; no head-hop, and psychic distance contracts naturally under rising emotion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm to track emotional respiration; figurative language is selective (“frozen tear” ink well) and paid off in the final “prism”; no loops or scaffold, and high information density—each clause advances knowledge or stakes—keeps momentum inside the 800-word frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The linguistic premise—extinct grammars leave harmonic overtones recoverable only through cross-temporal collaboration—is fresh; the ink well as both research tool and emotional barometer transforms a familiar reconciliation plot into a conceptual love story where trust is the experimental apparatus itself.</comment>
