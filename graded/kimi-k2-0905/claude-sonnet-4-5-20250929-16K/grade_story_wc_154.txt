<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s occupation as Pacific conflict-zone translator is dramatized: her instant recognition of “khlong,” the coral fragment she has carried through evacuations, and her reflex to catalogue detail while drugged all root motivation in lived expertise. The micro-choice to offer translation help rather than comfort shows a hierarchy of values—language before sentiment—yet the arm she slips around the child shows the same impulse has soft human limits. Interiority stays concrete (“lotus-hearted ache” is an image, not a diagnosis) and her flaws—emotional hoarding, professional overreach—surface in the gesture of beginning to “write them together,” foreclosing solitary mourning at visible cost: sharing custodianship of memory. The girl’s shrewd innocence is equally embodied: motionless legs, guarded blank face, yet trust extended with the cast; her silence is a tactic, not absence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the final image of “two translators…unknotting the past” reweights the premise—healing is not forgetting but collaborative re-inscription; cost is the irretrievable future time and emotional labor they now owe the dead. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each language fragment, coral touch, and mist bead adds density until the twilight tableau crystallizes a new moral rule-set—storykeeping is mutual. No orientation debt: by word 50 we know who (Maya, translator), where (recovery-center atrium), when (twilight after surgery). The persistent constraint—corpse of a vanished island carried in pocket—shapes every beat and final tactic: offer the fragment, share the burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (plaster cast) functions as map, archive, and bargaining table; its surface literally constrains where new text can be added, determining the joint action. Mist-clad atrium supplies sensory hierarchy—visual blur, cool skin, taste of morphine—mirroring anesthetic dissociation and forcing slow, deliberate motion that delays verbal work until rapport is earned. Coral fragment re-enters three times, each appearance narrowing options from private talisman to shared covenant to collaborative pen-holder, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean: bench, fountain, glass ceiling, small bodies—no impossible reaches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving disappearing stories—signals early with the coral fragment; meaningful tightening occurs when Maya decides to co-author the cast, trading solitary memory-keeping for joint testimony, foreclosing her exit strategy. Escalation is textural: each illegible line on the cast increases readerly and character anxiety until decryption becomes urgent; cost is the emotional labor and time they now must spend. Agency is renunciation plus attention: she gives up exclusive ownership of grief to assume shared custodianship. No coincidence; all pressure stems from language loss and material decay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation as survival tool—every act of naming is a small refusal to let worlds drown. Subtext operates in silences (still legs, guarded face) and objects (cast = palimpsest gravestone). Final image answers the thematic question “how to remember?” with collaborative inscription, a non-moral yet ethically charged stance. No platitudes; wisdom is earned through tactile specifics—coral pores, smudged ink, morphine sweetness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; no head-hop. Diction—“gauzy,” “lotus-hearted ache,” “night-flowering jasmine”—is lyric yet internally consistent with a translator who metabolizes experience through metaphor. Rhythm modulates: long, breathy sentences under morphine give way to clipped clause exchanges at the bench, mirroring clarity returning. No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate (“taste of morphine made the air sweet”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High density: single sentences do trio duty—e.g.,“Mist from the fountain kissed their faces” advances time, tactile sense, and relational intimacy. No loops; each metaphor is singular. Opening line anchors voice and object (brain coral) simultaneously; closing line resolves by image (“unknotting the past one careful word at a time”) recharging “unknot” from prompt. Register stable; no thesaurus drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Premise—translator & child co-write memory on a cast—feels fresh against flood of refugee stories; coral fragment as portable archive offers specific, non-obvious angle. Tropes (innocent child, keeper of memory) are re-cast: the child is archivist, Maya apprentice; wisdom flows both ways. Risk of sentimentality is resisted by concrete mechanics—ink, languages, plaster—making emotional payoff earned.</comment>
