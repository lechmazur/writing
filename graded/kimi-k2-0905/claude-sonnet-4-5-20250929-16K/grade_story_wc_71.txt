<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya’s perceptual acuity, perfume-shop childhood, and decision to keep returning anchor the arc; embodied contradiction blooms when the house’s exhalation relaxes her own held breath. Interiority is concrete and sense-bound, never abstract. Final renunciation—shifting from observer to participant—pays the cost of her old detachment and is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the house’s remembered grammar reweights Maya’s entire project, foreclosing passive documentation with quiet but unmistakable cost. Causal linkage is tight: each displaced object tightens the pattern until the orris-root fit detonates meaning. Orientation anchors by line 3; no latency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hammered-silver bay, breathing windows, and paint-ghost rectangle on the sill all constrain choice or charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maya’s perfume-trained nose and latent lighting transition. Micro-setting (the sill ghost) directly enables the climactic recognition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the house accept her witness?”—tightens when each displacement raises the cost of error. The reversal is the house’s exhale, forcing her stance shift. Price is felt: her prior life of detached noticing ends.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific correspondences (3-year root, 3-year abandonment) rather than statement. Final image reweights prior object-moves as prayer; ambiguity lingers whether house or woman is sanctified. No moralizing—resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is perfumer-precise: “lilac and salt,” “violet-iris scent,” “paint-ghost rectangles.” Syntax lengthens under awe, contracts under recognition. Rhythm mirrors the hush it describes; no filter-verb leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences do triple duty: advance image, deepen character, modulate cadence. Figurative language is spare and disciplined; no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold; final line lands with crystalline propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: haunted-house trope inverted into patient auto-archaeology by the house itself. Orris-root specificity and “shard of hush” coinage feel inevitable, not quirky. Risk in quiet stakes pays off via compressed lyric closure.</comment>
