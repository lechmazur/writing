<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s helix-minded interiority is concrete—her hands tremble, she spirals through code. Yet her motives plateau: we’re told she “had to complete this work” but never see the moment she commits to returning dreams; the final choice is attributed, not dramatized with cost. The predecessor’s absence keeps relational pressure off-stage. The character is strong, but the decisive turn lacks an embodied beat that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mirror fracture → new angles → protocol flip. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Maya rewrites theArchive’s purpose, not its code; the cost is the recursive entanglement she now carries. Orientation is clean within 120 words; moonlit canyon, dried creek bed, periscope mirror anchor who/where/when. The final image (spiraling code+dreams) reweights stakes, but the cost is stated rather than felt in a single charged sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon-as-skull and moon-shadowed mineral shield function as both atmosphere and tactical constraint—hiding the site from detection. The broken mirror’s fracture lines evolve from damage to optical modification, charging the final interface beat. Sensory selection is urgent: silver light, cracked reflections, synaptic static. Setting is not backdrop; its geometry literally enables the new protocol. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains tactics and charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover or destroy the abandoned dream-archive. Escalation tightens once: mirror insertion → entangled flood → protocol flip. Cost is conceptual—Maya’s identity is now braided with strangers’ summers—but it is declared, not dramatized in a visible forfeiture (no lost relationship, tool, or stamina on page). Agency is present yet internal; pressure coheres under causal lens but stops short of a visceral price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: discarded dreams carry latent value. The mirror’s fracture becomes a metaphor for multiplicity of vision; the ending reframes “broken” as evolved. No final moralizing—meaning lands in the moonlit image of spiraling code. Subtext is quiet but present: Keiko’s silence and the musician/teacher/child dreams imply critique of utilitarian science. Complexity is honored; no tidy equivalence forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s synesthetic perception—light fractures into “chaotically precise patterns,” thoughts spiral. Diction remains within an engineer’s lexicon without jargon overload. Rhythm accelerates during interface boot, then fragments into short clauses under memory flood—textured, not monotonous. No dialogue to judge; perceptual signature is distinct and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: “silver light in chaotically precise patterns” does triple sensory/conceptual work. Metaphors stay coherent—skull canyon, double helix loops—without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“abandoned dreams” twice in two sentences) but does not stall momentum. Final paragraph keeps propulsion; no clarity loss at closure. Clean copy, no scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses memory-identity SF with archeological salvage in a moonlit canyon—fresh topology. The cracked periscope-as-evolved-tool is a specific, non-generic twist that charges the climax. Conceptual commitment is total: synaptic plasticity consequences are followed to internal self-dissolution. Risky lyric compression succeeds; transformation would collapse if relocated. Minor echo of “abandoned dreams” phrase is the only hairline slip.</comment>
