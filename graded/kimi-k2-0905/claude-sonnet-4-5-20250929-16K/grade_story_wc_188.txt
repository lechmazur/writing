<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is thin: “sharp with understanding and mischief” is label-speak, not embodied. Her only micro-choice—lighting the first knot—is swept into summary, so the renunciation (“wandered on”) feels pre-ordained, not paid for. The commander’s flattening is forgivable in a 700-word piece, but Mara’s contradictory impulses (wander vs. stay) stay off-page. earns a functional 6.4 because motive is signal-early and consistent, yet lacks on-page cost or stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is legible: mosaic note → “make your own” → fireworks barrage → cracked hopelessness. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—people still hopeless, but light now carries a reweighted social cost. The price (“fortress had changed…cracked”) is visible in the commander’s wet eyes, satisfying the cost test. Minor slip: the launching apparatus appears without setup, a teleporting prop, but it does not break the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is selective and tactile: copper filings in the satchel, moonflowers that “crawl,” kerosene rag knots handled in two beats. Environment constrains tactics—starless sky forces Mara to manufacture light, the tower height dictates launch angle. “Blooming fortress” is reused as closure echo (“fortress bloomed”), charging the final image. Dock 0.2 because dusk-purple walls and glazed guards edge toward postcard, but overall the fortress functions as crucible, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reignite hope—is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful tightening: starless sky removes the usual witness, forcing Mara to become the witness. The reversal is her decision to launch, not merely perform; cost is the spent kerosene and the irreversible departure at dawn. Coincidence is absent; escalation is linear but sufficient for micro-form. Could enter 8-band if a sharper resource loss (copper gone, satchel lighter) had altered tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: manufactured hope vs. inherited hopelessness. Mosaic note and sky-message form a quiet callback pair that reweights meaning at the end. Subtext lives in gesture—commander’s loose armor, drooping bloom—rather than declaration. Minor echo penalty: “gravity of hopelessness” is an abstract tag; still, the closing image of cracked bloom keeps it from tipping into moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic—“Ash to ember, ember to sky” teaches the chant pattern early and pays off in walking-song cadence at exit. Perceptual signature is sharp: Mara notices “light that had forgotten its purpose,” a fireworks designer’s synesthesia. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure—“Watch” drops us to pure imperative. Filter verbs minimal; one slip—“she felt the fortress’s sickness”—but immediacy recovers in next clause.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density: “satchel heavy with copper filings and sulfur compounds” does world, occupation, and motive in one breath. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric chant vs. fragment—“Watch.” No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (bloom = fortress = people). Register drift absent. Minor over-writing in “serious playfulness” tag, but it does not scar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—wandering artist heals broken place—is refreshed by fireworks as engineered witness, not gift. Mosaic-hidden architect’s note is a fresh angle, turning decoration into tactical text. Risk taken: starless night could feel abstract, but kerosene knots ground it. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; removing任何一个元素 would break the logic, yet the emotional calculus is lightweight, keeping it sub-8.8.</comment>
