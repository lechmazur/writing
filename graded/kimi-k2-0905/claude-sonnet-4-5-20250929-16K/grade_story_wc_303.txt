<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Iris’s contradictory drives—authenticate vs liberate—are alive in every beat; the fern-whispers and coffee-cup futures give her interiority a sharp, idiosyncratic edge. The micro-choice to sketch the blueprint is the explicit pivot where her values crystallize and exile becomes legible cost. Only the Empire’s favour is stated more than shown, muting the scale of temptation.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore links—vision → doubt → sketch → consequence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the act of propagation forecloses imperial safety with exile felt in the final image. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible: “the difficult one illuminated” plus the ferns’ silent applause.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Velvet observatory, bruised twilight, and ice violin are not backdrop but tools that constrain choice (the violin’s fragility demands replication, the velvet gloom hides subversion). Micro-setting triumph: the coffee cup becomes a forecasting engine whose porcelain continents guide the climax. Spatial choreography remains flawless across desk–case–window triangle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dream vs empire—tightens once yet decisively: authentication offer vs propagation act. Escalation is causal and single-cycle; the price (exile, “difficult path illuminated”) is on-page. No reversal overload; one meaningful shift suffices for 700-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: possession vs proliferation, ice that survives only by spreading. Final image of ice violins in distant villages reweights earlier “silenced wonders” into liberated song. Subtle resistance to moral symmetry—Empire remains wrong, Iris’s theft is righteous—keeps complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Iris; perceptual signature saturated with synesthetic colour (“mulberry ache,” “bruised twilight”) and vegetal telepathy. Syntax modulates: longer reflective cadences contract to staccato sketching beats. No filter-verb stacks; lyric compression is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lush: every sentence advances image, causality, or interiority. No loops or mixed metaphors; “velvet observatory,” “porcelain continents” are precise. Rhythm breathes with tension—no algorithmic cadence. Final line lands with crystalline economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frozen-instrument premise is familiar, but grafting onto provenance authentication plus telepathic ferns yields fresh hybrid. Propagation-as-resistance twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of ice-crystal lattice and underground artist networks keeps the concept from sliding into abstraction.</comment>
