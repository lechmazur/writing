<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elena’s reinvention of self after the fire and her guilt-riven refusal to read the messages she ferries make her interior contradiction vivid; the moment she presses “play” and hears her younger voice inside the attic is a micro-choice that visibly costs. “Learning to trust again felt like training pigeons in reverse” is concrete, character-specific metaphor that reveals hierarchy of values. Her final decision to speak the truth to Yuki is earned by the recording’s shock and the dust-mote ritual that mirrors suspension between hope/grief. Secondary pressure from Yuki is light but sufficient for the length; the Mars chip functions more as talisman than active constraint, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the dust-mote mapping, the shoebox archive, and the cracked choir recording accrete until the final playback reweights Elena’s invented life with undeniable cost. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena’s “Now we see who comes back” crystallizes options—truth released, abandonment risked—without yet paying the social price, but the cost is felt in the attic air. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are cleanly in place by line 4 and never drift. No因果 break; the recording’s arrival is coincidence that complicates rather than rescues, fitting accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The attic skylight shaft, cross-beam, and wire pigeon architecture are not backdrop but tools Elena balances on and reads by; the Mars meteorite chip pressed in the ruined hymnal is a micro-setting that charges the final image when she holds the identical-sized recorder. Selective sensory triage—cooing pigeons, slanted light, dust swirl—mirrors her narrowed attention under guilt. Spatial choreography holds as she steps off the beam and Yuki climbs in; no floating objects. Setting constrains choice: only this attic lets her hear the choir echo through cracked rafters, making the 9-band possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Elena will keep lying to protect her invented self—tightens when the package arrives and again when the recorder plays: the damaged choir voices make her past irrefutable, foreclosing the comfort of erasure. Agency is accumulative: she does not act until the voices fill the attic, then she speaks truth, a renunciation with felt social cost. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt and Yuki’s patient presence supply coherent pressure. The price is legible—her hands shake, her ritual naming of dust patterns stalls—though not as viscerally persistent as required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulate image: dust motes and paper trails are both messages suspended in air, waiting for return; the final “who comes back” reweights every undelivered love letter she has never read. No explicit moral—hope and grief are held in the same shaft of light. Subtext operates in gesture: Yuki’s hand-crossing to take Elena’s hand after the confession carries more than any apology could. The Emily Dickinson hymn about hope, cracked and fading, supplies conceptual repricing without sermon; the reader is left to decide if hope is still “the thing with feathers” or only ash.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught early: three-part anaphora “after the fire, after Marcus, after the choir dissolved” teaches cadence that recurs in the final dust-mote triad. Diction stays within Elena’s plausible lexicon—“careful architecture of wire and wood,” “invented life”—while the choral diction of “crystalline soprano” is licensed by her musical past. No head-hopping; Yuki’s interior is never claimed. Filter verbs (“she heard,” “she believed”) are sparse and voice-motivated where they appear. The risk of lyric repetition is rewarded because the pattern pays off in the closing image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening structure; no template cadence or synonym churn. High information density: “tissue-thin messages… old-fashioned and the deliberately disconnected” layers social world, character stance, and thematic paper motif in one breath. Metaphors are consistent—dust motes as constellation, songs as ash—without mixed logic. No scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. The final line “Now we see who comes back” is monosyllabic closure that stops the rhythm exactly where the stakes crystallize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The courier-pigeon courier who never reads the mail is a fresh inversion; coupling it with a cracked choir recording of an Emily Dickinson poem about hope turns the familiar “fire destroyed my past” into a specific moral calculus about preservation versus exposure. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twists, yet coherence holds. The Mars chip in a hymnal, dust motes as star-map, and pigeon-loft in a bookshop attic are particulars that would collapse if swapped for generic equivalents. The synthesis feels inevitable only in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
