<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaia’s interiority is vivid—embodied coldness, “hot stones” in the chest—and her final “Teach me” is a credible, earned shift. Yet the mother remains a dream-figure; their reunion lacks status friction or micro-choice that would force Kaia to test her hierarchy of values under pressure. The abandonment wound is confessed, not dramatized in present beats, so the emotional cost feels inherited rather than freshly paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s pulse and “engines beginning to sing” crystallize a new apprentice pact with visible cost—Kaia surrenders her solitary exile. Causal chain holds: shard heat → universe-hop → mother-offer → choice. Orientation is taught early via sensory coordinates; the mosaic of universes is legible. One minor slack: the pocket universe appears only at the end, so the rule-set is revealed rather than tested earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s negative hum, rust-and-violet palette, and crux-point physics anchor every transition; the shard itself functions as micro-setting that constrains passage. Each universe variant (moss, water, snow) is sketched with one sensory hook that keeps momentum. Spatial choreography stays coherent—feet find moss, lungs feel pressure—so the environment actively shapes tactics. The bay’s pristine version in the pocket universe recharges earlier decay imagery, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Kaia shoulder the truth of her mother’s exile?—is signaled by the shard’s burn and tightens when the mother reveals illegality. One meaningful deepening: “the weight” shifts from abstract wound to literal apprenticeship cost. Agency is hers; she could seal the paths but instead steps into tutelage. Price is legible—she trades solitary freedom for cross-universe responsibility—though the off-stage legal threat feels slightly less visceral than the filial ache.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: love as interdimensional cartography, abandonment as protection reframed. No character moralizes; the shard’s warmth and engine song reweight “truth has weight” without restating it. Ambiguity lingers—will Kaia become exile in turn?—inviting reflection beyond the page. The concept of mapping sensation into coordinates gives the familiar mother-loss plot a fresh speculative angle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic color-smell-touch mappings (“laugh that smelled like cardamom”) and hyphenated cadence (“cyclically spontaneous”) create a lyric-science texture. Compression is purposeful—ellipses between universes taught by sensory shorthand. No head-hopping; Kaia’s diction stays within her sensorium. Under stress syntax shortens (“Teach me”) without losing voice control, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never more than one image per beat. No loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) sits in narrative, not dialogue, and fits the cerebral sensor-mapper POV. One mixed vehicle: “weight mapped themselves as hot stones” fuses abstract and concrete effectively without muddle. Clean copy; no scaffolding artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The sensory-cartographer premise reframes portal fantasy through synesthetic science; mother-as-exile across quantum petals feels fresh rather than trope-checklist. Risk taken: mosaic universe hops in <800 words, yet pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specific detail—diesel-snow scent, purple hands—prevents generic multiverse backdrop. Not quite 9.0 because the legal prohibition is sketched rather than lived, muting conceptual boldness.</comment>
