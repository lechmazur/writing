<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maerith’s quiet, jeweler-like precision and the solitary obsession with “texture into sound” feel lived-in; her body (copper veins) and micro-choices (angling the diamond, pressing bone) keep interiority concrete. The brother/daughter backstory is brief but tilts her present renunciation. No second character means no crucible, yet her final smile/press shows earned stasis. The flaw: we’re told of obsession more than shown its cost in real time—sleep, hunger, social rupture—so the emotional price is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each encoding session adds density to the bone tower, pattern break when birds reveal wave logic, cadence shift in the final hush. Orientation clean by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: the last press of the diamond crystallizes options—she will never hear Keshrin spoken again yet has made the world itself speak. Cost is conceptual but legible: the language becomes untouchable texture forever. One minor causality gap: how previous scholars’ madness manifests is told, never shown, so the stakes’ danger is second-hand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canyon’s acoustic mirror-rule and the bone tower’s porous surface are not backdrop but tools: ridges receive the diamond’s micro-incisions, echo chamber guarantees perpetual playback. Micro-setting = diamond + bone interface that literally rewrites the world. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and hearing, matching Maerith’s goal. Weather/light are used sparingly (“fading light” in final line) to time the last encoding. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. One whisker off 9 because the canyon’s “endless” scale drifts toward grandeur without grounding a single physical constraint (echo decay time, etc.).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Keshrin—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative: each successful texture-translation adds a silent “page” to the bone library, narrowing the future to either total extinction or total sublimation. The tightening is the realization that she will not live to hear it decoded; the price is her own exile from audible speech. No external antagonist; pressure is time + material decay. Agency visible every time she angles the diamond; final press = renunciation that forecloses any later reversal. Could edge higher if one beat showed a concrete loss (blood on bone, cracked tooth from vibration, etc.).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of permanence: what dies in sound survives in touch. Subtext in the starlings: information without syntax, a model for her non-semantic archive. No moralizing; the final smile lets ambiguity linger—is this salvation or solitary delusion? The idea that language can migrate medium feels freshly weighted at the end. One soft line—“she had paid a fair price”—leans toward explaining the theme; truncate it and resonance would sharpen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains jeweler-factual distance that mirrors Maerith’s personality. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, avoids emotional ventriloquism. Lexicon stays within her perceptual range (facets, grain, pores). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory: “semantic archive,” “microscopic ridges”) nudges toward authorial rather than character diction—minor but keeps it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and precise: “echoes gathered and nested” is fresh yet physical. High information density—each sentence layers process + emotional import. Zero paraphrase loops; no simultaneity errors. Opening and closing lines serve as acoustic brackets, a nice micro-echo device. One mixed metaphor—“language swallowed like a flood”—safe because it’s character thought, but it slightly jars against arid canyon imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core trick—translating phonemes into texture via a fracture that scatters sound—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Starlings as linguistic model risked twee-ness but is grounded in wave mechanics. “Bone tower as silent library” flips the usual stone-tablet trope into acoustic skin. Risk is taken and paid off: a quiet ending in a genre that usually defaults to spectacle. Only reason it stops short of 9.5 is that the “cursed diamond” madness angle is invoked, not transformed; still slightly stock.</comment>
