<comment>Interiority is concrete—"words turned every relationship into warfare" shows why silence is safety. The micro-choice to rotate the panels in the exact bee-flight pattern is embodied, not abstracted. The final nod is a credible renunciation: he accepts custodianship of others’ unspoken names, costing him perpetual solitude. No contradiction in motive; silence and caretaking braid into one continuous stance.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the list reweights Silas’s exile from self-protection to communal witness, visible cost in "bearing the weight." Accumulative lens holds—pattern of ghost keeper’s hive walk → panel sequence → list reveal—each beat thickens meaning rather than forcing causal turns. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by second sentence. Final image crystallizes new custodial identity without exposition.</comment>

<comment>Sweetwater Apiary remains tactile—crystallized honey, melted wax seals, the last good wood—each object constrains Silas’s next move. Stained-glass box micro-setting governs the climax: only its bee-panel sequence yields the list. Scorched wasteland outside the cracked windows keeps time visible—ghosts arrive because the world cracked open. Sensory hierarchy obeys beekeeper priorities: scent of propolis, smoker resin, pane color temperature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can silence honor the dead without shattering what it preserves? Escalation is accretive—each failed opening method thickens the cost of keeping the box intact. The ghost keeper’s gaze turns observation into obligation, foreclosing the option to smash-and-discard. Price is felt: lifelong stewardship of unspoken names, sealing him inside the oasis he once used to hide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence: withholding speech becomes the only way to keep human weight intact. Subtext in ghost keeper’s mute instruction—her hand-to-chest gesture reconfigures silence from armor to covenant. Final image of new wooden box refuses moral tag; resonance is in the tactile act of preservation. No echoing of prompt language; meaning stays inside honey, glass, and names.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays locked to Silas’s beekeeper sensorium—light filtered through comb-colored glass, smoker smell as memory trigger. Syntax mirrors methodical rotation of panels: short, hinge-like clauses. No head-hop; ghost keeper’s interiority accessed only through Silas’s interpretation of gesture, maintaining distance. Register holds—no drift into academic or therapeutic diction even at epiphanic beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyric—"honey darker than midnight" compresses color, taste, and lore into five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances pattern or adds sensory specificity. Metaphors stay bee-centered: box "bloomed open like petals" keeps vehicle within apiary logic. Rhythm accelerates during panel turns, then slows for the list reveal, matching breath of discovery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghosts not as horror but as archivists demanding completion of a bureaucratic kindness. Stained-glass box as combination lock keyed to bee-flight choreography—specific, non-portable invention. Silence re-cast as active caretaking rather than absence. Risk in quiet ending lands because accreted imagery (wax, glass, names) makes refusal feel inevitable, not evasive.</comment>
