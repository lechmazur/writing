<comment>Mira’s interiority is concretely textured—her guilt is felt in the canyon’s chill, her defiance in the way she “tests the canyon’s acoustic depths.” The micro-choice to keep walking toward the spire, paint-box in hand, crystallizes her hierarchy of values: truth-telling > survival. The contradiction between “innocently mischievous” and a girl’s suicide is held in embodied tension rather than psychologized. Only the final beat of “acceptance of it—whole, sharp, undivided” edges toward explanatory summary, preventing a 9+.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mira realizes the canyon “amplified,” not scattered, her guilt—an undeniable re-weighting of her premise. The cost is legible in the forged hush and the paint-box she will “never use these colors again.” Causal chain holds: each poem refracts, echoes return sharpened, leading to the single unbending truth she must carry into the ritual. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and holds without contradiction.</comment>

<comment>The bone towers are not backdrop; their acoustic properties become the engine of escalation, forcing Mira’s tactics to evolve. The pale spire’s fog “breathes,” a micro-setting that charges the final image when she walks into it. Spatial choreography is clean: abandoned brush, smooth ivory walls, mist timing track consistently. Only a hairline slip—“towers of bone rose like broken fingers” mildly clichés—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Stake—survive tomorrow’s ritual by fracturing truth—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when each poem fails to splinter the core guilt. The cost is visible: night-long exhaustion, the “forged hush,” forfeiture of her art (paint-box). Agency drives every beat: she chooses to speak, chooses to walk forward. One micro-turn—realizing amplification, not scattering—reconfigures options under Accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</comment>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of art: revelation as violence, beauty as harm. The canyon’s echo-structure literalizes the idea that truth cannot be diffracted without amplification. No character articulates a thesis; meaning is charged through the final image of Mira walking into the spire’s fog, paint-box sealed. The moral after-effect lingers: can any artist afford unfiltered truth?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</comment>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, rhythmically controlled—“vermillion and gold” vs. “sharp as a blade.” Perceptual signature is painterly: color refused, surfaces “smooth as polished ivory,” fog that “breathes.” Syntax grows breathless under pressure—“did not think… did not think…”—mirroring echo multiplication. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on narration and sustains idiom throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</comment>
<comment>Prose density is high: “her brush and paints abandoned at her feet, knowing that color had no place in this realm of judgment” does world, body, and theme work in one stroke. Mixed metaphors are avoided; bone towers, ivory, and echoes form a coherent physical logic. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences vs. fragmented echo returns. Only one scaffold phrase—“she had come here not to hide, but to prepare”—could be trimmed without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</comment>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: turns a self-care slogan (“speak your truth”) into a lethal acoustic trap where fracturing truth only magnifies guilt. Bone-canyon as resonance chamber is a concrete, non-obvious metaphor for artistic responsibility. Risk—making poetry the literal tactical weapon—pays off by failing on its own terms, re-pricing the premise. Could edge 9.0 if the daughter’s suicide had been given one irreplaceable sensory shard.</comment>
