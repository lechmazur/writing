<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid—her brittle laugh, the tactile moon rock, the micro-choice to drop the mask with the stranger—yet the “cure for loneliness” is named too diagnostically in the penultimate paragraph, a fleeting slip into label-speak that keeps her from the 9-band. The young man’s parallel ache is sketched just enough to catalyze her shift without hogging focus. Relationship crucible barely present, but at this length the solo-plus-catalyst structure is acceptable.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of moon-lit confession crystallizes options—she stays in the web but now faces it unmasked, cost felt in the hush that replaces banter. Causal chain holds: each rumor-route tightens the noose of obligation until the stranger’s arrival forces the stance shift. No orientation debt; ivy-choked station is fixed by line 3. Lens (Causal) is unbroken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The station is not backdrop but toolbox—ivy hides her, rusted cart becomes desk, moon rock is the portable altar; spatial choreography is flawless. Micro-setting object (moon rock) constrains the final choice by embodying the ledger she must decide to keep or drop. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s filter: she notes satellite latency, not birdcalls. One decimal off 9.0 only because weather/rail physics stay ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—maintain control via rumor-chain logistics while staying humanly unseen—tightens when the stranger converts abstract debt into face-to-face need. The meaningful turn is her renunciation of jocularity: she forfeits her shield (cost felt immediately in the tonal hush). Escalation is causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves anything. Could use one visible resource loss (phone battery, missed flight) to hit 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: reciprocity as both lifeboat and prison is re-priced in the final image—moon rock glows with owed favors, yet she offers connection instead of collection. Subtext is carried in gesture (she sets down the phone, picks up the rock) rather than thesis lines. The loneliness cure is left in charged ambiguity; reader feels the cost of either path.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Free-indirect style sustains a crisp, irony-laced diction that is unmistakably Vera’s—controlled chaos, cathedral, polite anarchy all stem from her worldview. Rhythm modulates: staccato logistical commands give way to the quiet final paragraph, mirroring her dropped mask. No head-hop; young man’s interior is surfaced only through Vera perceptual filter. Dialogue sparse but natural; every line advances goal or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can stage, characterize, and foreshadow (“platforms choked with ivy that crept…like curious parishioners”). No synonym loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is selective and pattern-teaching. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beats. Copy-clean; no scaffold sentences. Final third pristine, allowing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: humanitarian logistics + moon-rock economy + abandoned-cathedral station feels inevitable once revealed. Reciprocity-as-currency is not new, but binding it to lunar witness and rumor-chain anarchy is. Risk in letting climax be emotional renunciation rather than chase/fight pays off—quiet reversal feels specific to this voice. Transformation test fails if names swapped: details are irreplaceably entwined.</comment>
