<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Luka’s interior contradiction—embezzler’s pride versus self-disgust—remains concrete through body (polished calm trembling at the fox), micro-choice (placing stones to trap himself), and embodied cost (sitting in dust that coats his tailored past). Yet the “perceptively calm” label is used twice without fresh embodiment; the beat where he spreads the loot-bills on velvet could have delivered one more sensory fracture to hit 8-plus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each stone he sets (“because”) narrows escape (“therefore”), culminating in the earned stasis of staying to break the pattern. The closure image—“breathing with the dying light”—pays the visible cost of forfeiting flight. Minor waiver: orientation (who/where/when) is clear by word 60, well inside the 120-word guardrail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Train car acts as micro-setting that constrains: the loose window grants illicit entry; the creaking walls amplify his trapped breathing; the fox’s amber eyes mirror Luka’s self-surveillance. One more tactile detail of the mildewed velvet against his skin would have nudged 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he run again or stay and face inheritance?”—tightens when each marker-stone forfeits an exit route; the fox’s stare is the external pressure that crystallizes the choice. Cost is legible: he forfeits the satchel’s mythic mobility for the immobility of the rusted train.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited predation versus honest reckoning emerges through the currency’s revaluation—from trophy to mirror—without sermon. Final reconfiguration: the same territorial impulse that once stole kingdoms is turned inward to steal his own escape, a conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect stays locked to Luka’s lexicon (“aggressive expansion,” “fintech”) while syntax relaxes into valley cadence under dusk pressure. No filter-verb clusters; perceptual signature sharp in “velvet seats exhaled dust.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm; high density—one line slips “he’d convinced himself that his company’s aggressive expansion was innovation, not predation” compressing backstory and moral dodge. Zero loops or mixed metaphor; “polished calm” repeat is the only micro-redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “son confronts criminal patrimony” trope but refracts it through a startup-exec returning to a circus-wreck, making the foreign banknotes the DNA of guilt. Risky structural choice—quiet epiphany inside a static train—pays off via conceptual repricing rather than external twist.</comment>
