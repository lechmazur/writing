<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fennec’s “steadily curious” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized in a choice that costs her anything; the transliterating is busy-work, not a crucible. No contradiction or micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority lapses into editorial abstraction (“the mathematics of human hunger”) rather than embodied reaction. The hunter-tip beat is cool but Fennec’s stance toward it stays static—no visible flaw or gamble—so the ending poise feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens: kaleidoscope patterns build density until the final “yearning to understand yearning” crystallizes a resonant re-configuration. Orientation is clean by word 80; the floating workshop and acid sea ground the shard. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Fennec’s journals filling is the visible cost, the bell-unheard-yet reprices her lifelong labor. No causal reversal, but the pattern break is legible and feels final.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Brass hissing under acid, pulleys that connect nothing, cogwheels spinning without purpose—each detail is filtered through Fennec’s engineer-eye and mirrors the theme of purposeless desire. The kaleidoscope tube itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains every action; without it, no transliteration, no prophecy. Sensory economy favors touch and metallic sound over visual postcard excess. Final image of acid waves slapping the hull re-weights the workshop as a bell-jar for human hunger—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map pre-conscious desire—announced early, but pressure is static: each kaleidoscope pattern confirms rather than complicates her path. No option is foreclosed, no price paid; the hunter-tip revelation adds texture instead of tighter options. Escalation is lexical (“absolutely idiotic that this works”) rather than tactical. The final “we’re not ready” is commentary, not a costly choice under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: desire as evolutionary flux, mapping itself before consciousness. The kaleidoscope’s fractal light reconfigures the abstract into the tactile without overt thesis. Final image of “yearning to understand yearning” re-prices prior patterns, inviting reflection on recursive hunger. Avoids sermon, lets acid sea and brass stand as non-literal answer—resonant, if slightly cerebral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is crisp, sardonic, scientifically lyrical—“cartographer of want,” “vibration that would reach ears not yet born.” Syntax mirrors mechanical mind: noun-stacked clauses, percussive consonants. No dialogue to distort register; interior diction stays within Fennec’s plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature—acid hiss, brass glare, kaleidoscope shards—remains steady and character-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; short declaratives under awe, longer cadences for reflection. Metaphors are cleanly mechanical—“acid kisses metal”—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “steady curiosity” phrase repeats without new charge, a −0.2 artifact. Otherwise dense, scaffold-free; final line “acid sea carried the workshop onward” propels closure without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses retro-fantasy engineering with predictive desire-math—fresh synthesis. Hunter-tip as crystallized intention is specific, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Risk of floating junk-shop on acid sea commits fully; no retreat to safe steampunk defaults. Slight deduction for thematic echo in final paragraph articulating “yearning to understand yearning,” but transformation outweighs echo.</comment>
