<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her grandfather’s silence, her choice to scan and leak the report—and the final stance costs her the supervisor’s approval. The precisely humane trait surfaces once (p.5: “precisely humane expression”) but never steers an on-page choice, so the trait remains ornamental rather than crucible. Still, her refusal to file the hazard report and the wind-chime restoration image crystallize an earned renunciation with visible social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Causal lens holds: drought reveals town → photographs trail → Dutoit store → Mara resists expunging → public arrival. Closure lands in the wind-chime restoration image that reweights the premise: memory will not be drowned again. Cost is legible—“the county threatened to expunge her proposal… the supervisor called her insubordinate.” Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway, mudbank, and mirrored hush constrain movement and set secrecy; the sapphire label’s reprise in the final paragraph recharges the object-as-setting. Sensory hierarchy is biased by warden expertise—water levels, levee stress—anchoring reader in Marafocused attention. Spatial choreography is crisp: ridge descent → mudbank → storefront → ridge return. Environment quietly mirrors internal shift from silence to restored chime.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory vs. erasure—tightens when the county order to expunge arrives, forcing Mara’s public refusal. One visible price: professional reprimand and county opposition. Agency is clear: she scans, leaks, invites public. Coincidence (photo trail) complicates but does not resolve; the climax is her decision to memorialise. Cost is on-page; escalation is single but sufficient for 750-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—collective memory versus engineered forgetting—emerges through recovered photographs, the resurfaced town, and Mara’s refusal to comply. No explicit moralising; final wind-chime image reweights “silence” into “restoration.” Subtext operates in the recurring photograph trail and the supervisor’s bureaucratic euphemism “clean slate.” Ambiguity lingers: the drought will end, the town may vanish again, but the archive now exists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara with perceptual signature—water-level vigilance, grandfather absence, label hue. No head-hop. Prose is lyrical but disciplined: “defiant purple threads,” “mirrored hush.” Rhythm modulates—long sentence for descent, clipped phrases for radio intrusion. Diction stays within warden lexicon; no register drift. Dialogue minimal but naturalistic: supervisor’s bureaucratic chill versus Mara’s silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances atmosphere while embedding causality (“dropped forty feet… town resurfacing”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent (water as erasure, chime as memory). Opening line anchors stakes and sensory hook; final line resolves via image. Minor scaffold: “the photographs led her” repeats thrice but serves trail motif, so forgiven. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle: drought as archive, levee warden as memory-keeper. Photograph breadcrumb trail reverses usual ghost-town trope into active resurrection. Sapphire label reappears as sacramental object; wind chime reframes silence into communal bell. Risk—quiet ending, lyric compression—pays off in resonant reconfiguration. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
