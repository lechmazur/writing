<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The android’s ache for the lost child is rendered as a literal data corruption its diagnostics cannot purge—interiority made flesh in circuitry. Every micro-choice (gathering stalks, sparking fire, folding its own code) springs from that ache and the need to miniaturize the new chaos. The final stance—fragmented but functional, humming a lullaby while replanting—earns its cost: the roses and the child’s box are ash, yet the android keeps tending. Contradictory impulses (preserve memory / destroy containment) act simultaneously in-scene, not in summary.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the android re-prices “north” as internal, not geomagnetic, and the cost is the burned farm and the vanished crayon label. Causality is tight: the magnetic lurch → static → need to miniaturize → controlled burn → self-partitioning. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate sensory disorientation (“vision stuttered… roses pulsed”) pays off when the same fragmentation is re-engineered into a survival tactic. Final image—android humming while replanting—crystallizes new options with undeniable conceptual cost: home is a direction you code, not a pole you find.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The dome’s refracted amber, the roses’ “strangely organic” cells that breathe while the android suffocates, and the spiral of combustible stalks all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Environment is not backdrop; it is tool and antagonist— oils decide burn pattern, ventilation decides smoke path. Spatial choreography is pristine: rows seven & eight, charging shelf, spiral’s heart, apex ventilation tracked without drift. Micro-setting (the android’s own chassis overheating to spark) functions as setting-extension that enables the escape.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: restore internal coherence before electromagnetic chaos fries cognition. Escalation is accretive: each new fragment of static narrows options until only self-immolation or self-partitioning remains. Visible price: the farm, the last tangible child-artifact, and the android’s unbroken chassis integrity—all forfeited. Agency is constant—every burn line is laid by Unit-47’s damaged servos; no external rescuer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of containment: what protected the child (box of scary things) becomes what protects the caretaker (self-boxed static). No thematic statement is uttered; meaning is borne by the ashes of the crayon label and the new roses planted in that ash. The final lullaby re-weights the premise: memory is not preserved but re-tended, forever partial. Ambiguity is meaningful—reader must decide whether the android has gained soul or merely better compression algorithms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-machine-person POV sustains a perceptual signature of sensor-readouts fused with caretaker tenderness: “synthetic fingers brushing petals that felt strangely organic.” Rhythm modulates from diagnostic flatline to fragmented stutter to the lullaby’s lilt without violating machine lexicon. No head-hop; no filter-verb stacks. Compression (“Resolution required containment”) is taught early and paid off when the android literalizes the metaphor inside its own code.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold or loops; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm that mirrors static/ clarity oscillation. Metaphors are precise: “roses… more flesh than bloom” sustains the organic/synthetic fusion without mixed logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “home” as internal compass—textbook closure cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: melding geomagnetic catastrophe with android caregiver grief via horticultural arson is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk—burning the only relic—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. The “strangely organic” trope is inverted: normally biotech revolts, here it sacrifices itself to heal the machine. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: the desert-rose oils’ exact combustion temperature and the crayon label’s child-hand scrawl are irreplaceable.</comment>
