<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Malachi’s outlaw-charisma is sketched quickly and consistently; his “honey-smooth” voice against trembling hands shows embodied contradiction. The daughter vignette supplies a sharpened motive, but the interior shift from charming rogue to guardian-of-sparks is asserted more than dramatized within the single meeting. No micro-choice under tightening pressure is shown on-page; the leap from idea to city-wide adoption is causal but unfelt by him in-scene. Still, the crisp sensory anchoring and distinct speech texture keep him above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: premise (“thoughts taxed”) → outlaw response → botanical code → covert gardens → closing image of gourd-rattle alive. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by line 3). One meaningful tightening: Dr. Chen’s warning that auditors patrol gardens → Malachi’s retort that patterns will hide in plain sight; this narrows tactic and raises stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “they can’t tax what grows wild” reweights the premise with conceptual cost felt through the seed-heavy pockets and angry-sounding rattle; constraint persists because the towers still blink outside.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Condensation-fogged greenhouse glass is returned to twice, functioning as both surveillance barrier and echo of mental “fog,” charging the final image. Gourd-rattle seeds, palm fronds’ filtered light, and beetle-wing scent give tactile micro-setting that constrains action (no electronics). Selective sensory hierarchy: humidity smell > visual blur > seed sound. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies. One minor time-skip (“over the following weeks”) is handled in a single sentence, preserving momentum. World rule—no cameras in greenhouse—stays consistent and is exploited for plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can imagination stay private?”—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when the garden-code becomes the last free conduit. Agency is collective rather than individual; Malachi’s persuasive pitch is the trigger, but no single on-page decision escalates inside the scene. The price is prospective (audit, memory wipe) rather than dramatized loss. Escalation is conceptual: each new garden planted enlarges the hidden network, reweighting risk. Sufficient for short-form, but absence of a paid cost in real time keeps it below top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from material: coded vines = mental refuge; ownership of imagination vs. state taxation. Subtext resides in the shift from rattle-as-prop to rattle-as-voice-of-rebellion. Final line (“they can’t tax what grows wild”) offers resonant non-literal answer without sermon. Daughter vignette risks overt tug but is brief and grounded. No late abstraction; message stays in seed, soil, and sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient is stable, focalizing chiefly through Malachi without head-hop. Distinct idiom: “candidly cryptic,” “honey-smooth,” “converging chaos” give texture. Compression is purposeful—“converging chaos, Malachi thought, is how revolutions begin”—economizes exposition. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (Iris: “But why?” = fear vs desire). Final paragraph cadence slows to match contemplative payoff. No filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with content.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence locates, characterizes, and stakes (“greenhouse smelled… breakfast thoughts… forty credits”). Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety: short pulse for tension, longer for exposition. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif. One paraphrase loop: “converging chaos… revolutions begin” is essentially restated, but serves as deliberate beat emphasis, not artifact. No scaffolding, no synonym churn. Clean copy: pronouns, tense, punctuation exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise twist—“thought-taxed dystopia cured by gardening Morse-code”—feels fresh yet inevitable. Botanical encryption is specific to setting and character; replacing seeds with, say, graffiti breaks the logic. Risk in having collective rather than lone hero pays off through plant-as-metaphor closure. No close echoes of famous SF scenes. Concept follows own rules without flinching. Minor deduction for leaning on familiar “evil surveillance state” trope, but seed-grammar elevates it above template.</comment>
