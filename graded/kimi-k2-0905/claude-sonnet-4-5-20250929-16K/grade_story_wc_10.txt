<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory drives—her need to re-enter the audible world vs. her embrace of silence—are embodied in every beat: striking the fork she cannot hear, mapping her own face for music. The sister visit is not just support but a live test that forces Marina to confront whether her silent compositions satisfy human connection. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “ghost of what music had been” felt through bone, not labeled as loss. The final self-mapping is a micro-choice that costs her the last illusion that the system is only for others, earning her stasis in silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selected lens: Accumulative/Textural. The frost-panel, tuning-fork, and heat-map images layer until the final self-scan crystallizes a new cadence; each repetition adds density rather than outline. Closure is a Charged Poise: Marina’s own thermal notation appears on screen, re-weighting every prior composition as equally hers. The cost is the unspoken admission that no one else will hear her own melody—silence is no longer a canvas but a destination. Causality is intact: each compositional step is traceable to the ferry loss and the ruptured ear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conservatory is not backdrop but instrument: winterglass panels that refuse to fog even under breath become the metaphor for Marina’s irreversible deafness. The tuning-fork case is handled twice—first as relic, finally as talisman—its silver tarnish echoing the frost that never melts. Spatial choreography is flawless: sensors are clipped, tablet angled, breath withheld, all tracked without drift. Final image of spectrum bands refracted onto perpetual-winter roses fuses setting with emotional cost, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence itself be transmuted into shared art? Pressure tightens when the system must work on Claire—failure would prove the project is solitary masturbation. The heat-map’s D-minor output with major lifts is the single deepening that proves translation possible, foreclosing the option that Marina’s world remains unshareable. Cost is borne on-page: Claire’s trembling finger on the score makes the silence audible to Marina for the first time through another’s body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of the title: marvels are shaken (hearing lost, colleagues drowned) yet remain marvels because they generate new form. Subtext lives in gesture: Claire’s silent “It’s perfect” is more piercing than any spoken praise. The winterglass conservatory’s refusal to melt mirrors the irreversibility of trauma, re-weighted when Marina maps her own contentment—silence becomes generative, not absent. No moral is stated; the final notation is simply allowed to exist, leaving the reader to feel its minor key.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Marina’s sensorium: we feel fork-vibration in bone, see color-cascade but never hear. Syntax lengthens during calibration, fragments when the fork is struck, mirroring silent percussion. Diction is precise—A-440, D minor, thermal topographies—yet never expositional because filtered through her engineering eye. No head-hop; Claire’s emotion is legible only via heat-flare on tablet, keeping POV chaste.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe: opening clause suspends across frost-pattern, then three short beats of palm-press, breath-fail, glass-cold. No scaffold; “perpetual frost patterns that never melted” does not rephrase elsewhere. Metaphors are spare and physical—frost as cathedral, heat as map—never layered into purple. Final line “She began mapping her own face” is monosyllabic, letting the starkness serve as cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit—thermal micro-expressions scored as music—feels inevitable yet fresh; no prior story has used deafness to invent a new musical notation. Winterglass that will not fog is a material invention that concretizes irreversibility without magical realism. Risk is taken by making climax silent: reader must read musicology off a screen, yet tension holds. Transformation test passes: swap ferry trauma for any loss and the entire emotional mechanics collapse.</comment>
