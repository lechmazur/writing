<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s grief-driven obsession is concrete—every beat (archives, dive, journal opening) is filtered through synesthetic fragments he can’t fully access. The inherited synesthesia is shown, not labeled, and the brass key as “lodestone” externalizes pull without cliché. Final endurance—returning to the lamps, now seeing amber sound—earns its cost: he gives up solving the mystery and accepts witness. Interior contradiction is light; mother remains idealized, so the arc flirts with one-note, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the gold-green-violet ribbon rises, reconfiguring the entire quest from “solve” to “witness” with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—key tag → archive → journal → luminous vow release—each because/therefore step narrows options. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no lens drift. The final harbor-bell amber image pays off the mother’s synesthetic thesis without explanatory blob.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Harbor, wreck, and lantern sky are economically layered; each sensory pick (cold water stealing breath, rust-cathedral) serves Marcus’s narrowing attention. The waterproof cases labeled “Thunder/Indigo” let setting supply plot assets, not postcard color. The key tag and vacuum-sealed journal function as micro-setting that gate the climax. Only nit: no tactile detail of brass in the dive itself, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will he recover the color of sound or drown in the attempt?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the hull groan forces ascent. The luminous vow release is coincidence-allowed (wreck settling) but complicates, not resolves; Marcus still must choose witness over possession. Cost is visible: he surfaces “unsure,” forfeiting certainty. One beat shy of a second tightening keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—some mysteries are meant to be witnessed, not solved—emerges solely through image (rising ribbon, amber bell) without sermon. Mother’s synesthetic marriage vow translates love into chromatic risk, reframing Marcus’s archival “truth” as sterile next to lived chromatic witness. Final image reweights the opening lanterns: they were always the answer, not the distraction. No thematic echo sentence; resonance is pure visual reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s sensory bandwidth; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens underwater (brine suspension) then shortens at surface gasp, mirroring pressure. Word choice (“meteor hush,” “lodestone”) is idiosyncratic yet within Marcus’s poetic cognition. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. One filter verb cluster (“he saw it”) in the climax is the lone hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Figurative control peaks in “cathedral of rust and barnacles,” exact and fresh. Only a single adjective stack (“slow-burning stars”) risks purple, but context justifies. Copy is clean; pronoun antecedents track through underwater choreography.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic dive into a sunken sound-library is fresh; the wedding-vow-as-color experiment reframes maritime ghost lore into perceptual sci-fi. Brass hotel key repurposed as archive mnemonic feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risk—lyric stillness instead of physical showdown—pays off in the amber bell beat. Transformation test fails if Marcus were any other night-worker; specificity is total.</comment>
