<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her pragmatic acceptance of the rose’s death, the talismanic weight of the brass tooth, her lock-picking credo translated into social action—yet the cast of twelve children blurs into a chorus; no individual child exerts pressure or challenges her, so the relationship crucible remains cool. The promised “stop hiding” moment is dramatized as communal light-beaming, a credible renunciation of solitude, but the cost (tomorrow’s consequences) is only projected, not tasted. Micro-choices (row cadence, flashlight angles) reveal values, but the emotional plateau stays level; we witness no contradictory impulse mid-scene. Still, the arc from private grief to collective agency is legible and earned, satisfying the 600-word scale.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse blaze re-weights the lock metaphor—Mira becomes a “locksmith of light,” social rather than mechanical. Cost is visible in the projected fallout (“tomorrow there would be questions, maybe consequences”) and the brass tooth’s warm press against her hip, a tactile legacy now repurposed. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: rose→tooth→row→light sequence layers density until the pattern breaks into public radiance; causality is lyric, not transactional, and holds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and never drift; the single transition from alley to harbor is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The fire-escape micro-garden, the brass tool worn “smooth from decades,” the moon-slick harbor, and the splintery boathouse planks are all filtered through Mira’s locksmith gaze—every surface is something to be read, picked, or cultivated. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: five-story descent, alley, dock, boats, lighthouse, return. Weather (full moon, wind-shadowed water) directly shapes the tactic of reflective light-beaming. Sensory economy favors touch and sight, mirroring a lockmaster’s tactile precision. The lighthouse interior evolves from “dark” to “blazed” under the children’s converging beams—an environmental state-change that mirrors the thematic unlock.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—illuminating the city’s overlooked children—surfaces early and tightens through the single escalation: private ritual (rose death) → communal risk (illegal lighthouse lighting). Agency is collective but Mira-led; the rhythm of oars literalizes “instilling change” as forward motion against tidal resistance. The reversal is the moment the lighthouse glass answers back, turning their clandestine lesson into a public beacon; options narrow—there is now visible evidence that will provoke response. Cost is projected rather than immediate, keeping pressure just sub-threshold for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the translation of mechanical unlocking into social illumination; no character lectures us on “light = hope.” The brass tooth’s reprise at the end (pressed warm against her hip) quietly recalibrates its meaning from personal keepsake to communal master-key. Subtext operates in gesture—silent distribution of scavenged flashlights, the soft laughter of refracted beams—avoiding moral statements. The final image (moonlit oar-trails) offers a charged poise: change has been loosed, consequence not yet paid, resonance lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira; perceptual signature is locksmith-centric—“internal architecture,” “resistant mechanisms,” “gaps” she can slip through. Syntax flexes from lyrical compression (“silver-black water rippling”) to tactile precision (“brass tooth worn smooth”), mirroring her dual nature: caretaker and technician. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction test is waived; interior diction remains within her plausible lexicon. The accumulative anaphora of “how to…” and “dipping and rising” teaches a rhythmic pattern that pays off in the synchronized row home—voice as oar-cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, loop-free; no scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—light as lock-pick, oar-stroke as persistence—avoiding purple overload. One mixed image: “quivering hush” is abstract, but the clause is brief and functional, not clarity-breaking. Filter verbs are minimal; most perception is embodied (“brass tooth pressed warm”). Rhythm modulates: short beat openings accelerate the midnight descent, longer clauses slow the lighthouse tableau. Clean grammar, no simultaneity errors, paragraph cuts tight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-to-lighthouse conceit feels fresh yet inevitable; the social inversion of picking locks by flooding them with light offers a non-obvious synthesis. Children as “neighborhood shadows” risks trope, but their collective anonymity serves Mira’s crucible rather than stereotype. Risk is taken: a 750-word piece skips confrontation, opts for lyric communal act; the gamble lands because the pattern is taught early (Gran’s credo) and reweighted at closure. Detail is specific to this harbor, this tooth, this moonlit night—universalized through precision rather than generic uplift.</comment>
