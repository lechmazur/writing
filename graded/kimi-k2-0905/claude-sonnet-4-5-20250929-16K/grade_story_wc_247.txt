<comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—mourning lost sound while discovering new rhythms—are embodied in her trembling grip on the filmless camera and the tears that catch moonlight. The final renunciation of needing to be remembered is earned by the dock-side choreography that turns the harbor into an instrument; the cost is legible in her salty cheeks and the camera left on the planks. Celeste’s quietly charismatic status is shown, not told: her murmuring hands draw Marina back from the edge twice, and her refusal to vocalize maintains the power asymmetry. Micro-choices—framing ripples, adjusting an aperture that will never click—reveal a hierarchy that values witnessing over recording.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the two women freeze mid-dance under moonlight, having reweighted music itself as somatic rather than acoustic; the cost is the unspoken knowledge that concert halls will never call again. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory translation (ripple = rhythm, wind = tempo) layers until Marina’s body becomes the score. Causality holds: because Celeste insists the camera teaches sight, therefore Marina finally sees her hands as conductors, not pianists. No orientation debt; who/where/when is nailed inside 40 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The harbor’s moonlit surface is not backdrop but metronome: wave-intervals dictate the choreography’s tempo, and the dock’s wooden vibration supplies bass Marina cannot hear but can feel through bare feet. The camera’s frost and weight recur as micro-setting, constraining her to manual adjustments that retrain finger dexterity. Spatial choreography is immaculate—Celeste’s signing silhouette never blocks the moon-path, allowing the final image of overlapping shadows to read as stacked staffs of silent music. Light is treated as tactile: pearls scatter, shadows sustain, reflections cue timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Can Marina re-enter music without sound?—tightens when the filmless camera forces her to externalize rhythm through motion rather than memory. Escalation is textural: each harbor pulse (lap, gust, glint) adds a layer of证明 that silence is full, culminating in the dance that forecloses the piano forever. The visible price is the camera abandoned on the pier—an object whose purpose has been metabolized into muscle memory. Agency is present; no coincidences intrude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: translation is not substitution but revelation—music was always kinetic, not acoustic. Subtext operates in the camera that never clicks yet advances the beat each time Marina’s fingers spin its rings. The joyful sorrow modulation is earned: exhilaration in discovery braided with the ache of an art form renounced. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing—two shadows conducting moonlight become the score the world forgot to ask for.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is synesthetic-sighted: moonlight “spills like scattered pearls,” wind is “visible patterns across the water’s surface.” Syntax lengthens during discovery, then fractures into short kinesthetic bursts—“She set down the camera and began to move”—mirroring tempo shifts. No head-hopping; Celeste’s interiority is guessed at only through gesture, maintaining POV modesty. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“seemed to murmur”) and sustain the hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold or loops; each sentence advances image or kinesthetic knowledge. Figurative density is high but patterned—“scattered pearls,” “slow adagio”—teaching the reader to read moonlight as notation. No mixed metaphors; water/wave vehicles stay mutually coherent. Strong verbs (“disturb,” “race,” “pulse”) replace adverbs. Final line cadence—“where silence learned to sing through hands that refused to be still”—resolves with percussive spondee that enacts the claim.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise risk— Deaf choreography coaching a deafened pianist—avoids cliché by refusing triumph or cure; the victory is conceptual repricing of music itself. Harbor-at-night recasts a stock noir locale into a percussive instrument. Camera-without-film flips nostalgia into training tool. The non-obvious synthesis: silence is not absence but interference pattern, a physics metaphor made visceral. Bold, yet every metaphor is grounded in palpable dock vibration or moon-shadow geometry.</comment>
