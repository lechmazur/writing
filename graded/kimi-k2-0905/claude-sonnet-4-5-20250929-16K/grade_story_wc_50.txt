<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Interiority is concrete—her preference for “observant” over “reflective” crystallizes stance—but emotional contradiction is told abstractly (“mystery and understanding weren’t enemies”). The final renunciation (sealing the cavern) is earned by her winter-long investment, yet the cost is stated, not embodied: we see no moment where the ache of secrecy registers in body or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visit layers new sonic data until the rebuilt timer triggers the resonant reconfiguration. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she forecloses acclaim with the bronze click—cost is felt in the phrase “she alone understood,” though slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Marble cavern is never postcard: gold veins redirect both light and sound, constraining her nightly lamp angles and thus her discovery path. Micro-setting (the timer’s velvet cloth, frost on leaves) keeps texture tactile. Final image of sealed bronze doors re-uses the ingress prop, now re-weighted as silence-preserver.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—private comprehension versus public revelation—signals early. Escalation is accumulative: each session densifies the echo-archive, tightening the stakes of disclosure. Midnight lamp session supplies the one meaningful deepening. Cost is intellectual solitude; visible but not visceral—hence not quite 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of secrecy as stewardship emerges from her choice to seal, not state. The echo-harvest motif re-prices knowledge as something to be buried, not brandished. Final image answers the thematic question—wonder stored, not spent—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she custodian or hoarder? That counter-reading is invited, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—“noticing locks by what surrounded them”—colors every sensory filter. Syntax stays controlled, rhythmic variegation in paragraph lengths supports cadence of discovery. No head-hop, no filter-verb clusters. Voice modulation under pressure: the cavern’s sonic overload compresses sentences effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory data, tool action, and concept (“she clapped once… seven different angles”). Zero paraphrase loops, no metaphor muddle. Minor scaffold in “understanding bloomed slowly, like ice melting…”—a stock comparison—but it sits in a lull, not the closure beat, so −0.1 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—acoustic marble archive harvested by a lock-smith—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes (sealed cave, ancient device) are transformed through her locksmith’s gaze and sonic science. Risk of quiet ending paid off: the sealed doors become a conceptual repricing rather than a gimmick. No close echoes of familiar scenes; specificity is irreproducible.</comment>
