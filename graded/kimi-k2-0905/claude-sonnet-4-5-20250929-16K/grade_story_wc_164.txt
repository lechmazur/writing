<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Calla’s interior contradiction—cheerful speech against unsmiling eyes—embodies the “cheerful gloom” mandate, yet her micro-choices (planting the seed, pressing glass) are reactive rather than vein-open; the final covenant (“I’ll remember you”) is earned but the cost feels conceptual, not embodied. Childhood motive is thinly cued; no tactile price (bleeding knee, lost tool) anchors the turn. Voice remains consistent and occupation-specific, but diagnostic tag “melancholy optimism” nearly slips into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bracelet-vine crystallizes her vocation’s cost—bearing witness is itself a path she must keep walking. Causal chain holds: swallow-seeds → vine-maps → transliteration → insight → covenant. Orientation anchor (who/where) clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Slight softening: the “why” is answered conceptually (“paths need repetition”) but no live option is foreclosed on page—cost is felt yet not paid in dramatic currency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Geode-cave is never static backdrop; crystal walls pulse approval, seeds sprout in mineral dark, and crater glass warms—each tactile shift cues internal change. Spatial choreography clean: swallow perches, seed drops into palm, vine wraps wrist, all tracked in continuous motion. Light/reflectivity motif mirrors epistemic theme without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the vine-bracelet) constrains final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing final erasure of forgotten paths—signaled early and tightened once: realization that repetition, not catastrophe, decides existence. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than reversal; cost is existential (she must shoulder infinite paths). Swallow complicates but does not resolve; no fake antagonist. Escalation is single deepening, sufficient for lyric-accumulative lens, though price could be sharper on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: memory is performative, a path exists only if repeatedly enacted. Subtext in swallow’s “too much understanding” eyes and foam-dissolving image avoids moralizing. Final covenant reframes earlier “conjecture” into ethical duty. Cheerful gloom tone sustains thematic ambiguity—beauty and impermanence held together—without tidy aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Calla’s perceptual bias: she reads emotions as “luminous script,” notices iridescence before threat. Syntax mirrors tidal ebb/flow: long liquid sentences for cave description, clipped fragments at revelations. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Distinct rhythmic signature—“cheerful gloom” iterated through vocal brightness vs. sensory chill—earns high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: comma-rich cadence for shimmer, staccato beats for seed-drops. Metaphors stay within optic/sea register, no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective stacks (“soft rainbow light, beautiful and cold simultaneously”) risk purple but serve tonal paradox. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; information dense. Final line seeds/sang/vanished triad delivers closure image with propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory-loss with cartography via sea-foam metaphor—fresh synthesis. Temporal swallow as chronologic courier + crater glass as emotion lens = speculative tools that grow from theme, not ornament. Cheerful gloom tone is risk-laden polarity, executed without wobble. Conceptual repricing at end makes inevitable hindsight: bearing witness becomes infinite pilgrimage. Specificity of “transliterates emotions” could veer gimmicky yet stays integral to insight beat.</comment>
