<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt and the swallowed truth are interiorized through trembling hands and the accidental smudge; her decision to recalibrate sensors is earned by the delirious confession and carries visible cost (“certainty is what killed her”). Contradictory impulses—need for scientific rigor vs. need to honor Eva’s margins—act simultaneously in the final beat. The only drag: “had swallowed a truth” is half-summary; full embodiment would push this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the smudge and recalibration reweight the rule-set of forecasting itself. The causal chain (ignored margin → death → fever confession → sensor reset) holds under a Causal lens with persistent cost—false positives now accepted. Orientation is clean (aurora dawn, station deck by line 3). No lens ambiguity; the final image crystallizes an irreversible operational change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting: handled, smudged, back-lit, it constrains the final choice and charges the image. Mountain air sharpness and aurora fade provide sensory specificity filtered through Mira’s professional meteorologist gaze. Spatial choreography is minimal but clean—window, desk, doorway—never violating presence. Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with the margin that killed Eva—tightens when the smudge literalizes error. One meaningful deepening: “certainty is what killed her” re-prices the cost of false positives. Agency is renunciation of the old threshold; pressure coheres under Causal lens. Cost is legible: professional credibility will suffer, but Mira accepts that price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truthful uncertainty emerges from concrete particulars—smudge, aurora fade, sensor recalibration—never abstract assertion. The final image reframes the earlier “fault-tolerant” method as moral cowardice. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the pale blue absence. The reprise of Eva’s margins-from-edges philosophy reweights the stake without thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains meteorologist-perceptual signature: barometric pressure, data anomalies, aurora spectra. Syntax modulates—“like a bruise,” “pale blue absence”—without register drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“seemed to glow”) are minimal and motivated by translucent paper effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: “probability margins too small to warrant alarm” compresses science, stakes, and moral failure in seven words. Rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks that mirror dawn lightening. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. “Swallowed a truth” is the only minor cliché, but it’s earned by fever metaphor and doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Freshens the familiar grief-driven redemption arc by making the pivot a professional protocol change rather than emotional catharsis. The smudge as irreversible error is a specific, non-obvious image. Risk: lyric accumulation could feel cold, yet the aurora-to-absence fade humanizes. No close echoes of canonical avalanche stories.</comment>
