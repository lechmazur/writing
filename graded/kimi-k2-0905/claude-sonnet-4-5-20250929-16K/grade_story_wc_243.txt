<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to others’ memories while fleeing her own—are dramatized in the thermos-opening beat; the locket’s arrival forces a visible micro-choice (kneel, ink, write) that costs her detachment. Interiority stays embodied (“fingers trembling,” “air tasted of salt and sweetness”) and avoids label-speak. The final covenant shift is earned because the beat sequence shows her prior mechanical method becoming untenable once Maya’s face re-enters the frame. Cap at 8.7: no second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets remain N/A and the cost, while felt, is not compounded by interpersonal stakes.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the walnut-ink card sentence crystallizes a before/after stance with undeniable conceptual cost—“not because they’re all we have against death, but because they’re how we recognize we’ve been alive.” Causal chain holds: locket arrival → jetty return → ink ritual → covenant transformation. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Single transition (descent/ascent jetty stairs) is legible and tight. Accumulation cap not triggered; artifact-free at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Jetty, tide-pooled wood grain, and salt-sweet air are filtered through Mira’s archivist gaze; the roses constrain timing (“impossible for such a late hour”) and mirror her late blooming. The thermos of freshly boiled walnut ink functions as micro-setting/tool that enables the decisive inscription. Spatial choreography is clean: descent, kneel, ascent track without drift. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image (“roses released their fragrance into the darkness”) and constrains the ritual beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. confront personal memory—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once the locket re-weights every prior archival act; the ink inscription is the visible, irreversible trade-off that forecloses pure detachment. Escalation is accumulative: density of sensory detail and emotional charge intensify toward twilight rather than via external reversals. Cost is legible on-page (she writes the card, dons the locket), though second-party opposition is absent, keeping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: small moments acquire weight only when personally risked. The walnut-ink motif darkens into permanence, re-pricing her life’s work in the final sentence without moralizing. Subtext operates through object handling—thermos, locket, card—rather than exposition. No thematic echo penalty; the insight is earned via concrete ritual, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual quirks (ink chemistry, rose timing). Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then compresses at the card inscription, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullets N/A. Diction remains within her scholarly yet sensory lexicon; no register drift. Patterned repetition (“small moments had become simply weight”) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric charge, and causal push (“the ink was made from these facts: hulls gathered last autumn…”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances stance or stakes. Figurative language is spare, precise, and coherent. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid twilight description to the staccato card inscription, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Archivist-as-ink-maker is fresh; the self-mailed locket from forty years prior supplies a non-obvious causal trigger that feels inevitable once revealed. Transformation test fails if Mira is swapped with a generic mourner, confirming specificity. Risk is taken in quiet lyric mode rather than plot twist, but coherence remains intact. Slight deduction for familiar “scatter ashes at jetty” image, though rose-overgrowth detail re-specifies it.</comment>
