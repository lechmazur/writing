<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The weaver’s interiority is evocative—her whalebone reverie and boundary-less trap feel lived—but she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything; the final resignation is foreshadowed, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the realization is delivered as reflective summary rather than embodied conflict. The calcified weights are gorgeous, yet their handling never forces her to adjust tactics or risk loss; the story tells us she is trapped, but the page never makes her sweat under that trap. Characterization is strong on texture, weak on agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry reveal re-weights the task from collection to guardianship, and the cost is the infinite expansion of duty under starlight—felt, not declaimed. Orientation is secure inside 120 words; place, time, and POV remain single-scene stable. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each weight-glow deepens pattern rather than hard plot turns. The lens holds, but the climax is entirely internal image; the causality of “understanding” lacks a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path, so the cost is conceptual more than lived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, cracked lamp chimney, and calcified burdens are tactile, specific, and return to charge the final image; the grotto’s metallic ribs literally steer her posture and lantern placement. Starlight and snowmelt are economically reused to mark time and refract lamplight. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: metallic taste, oxidized smell, shingled hush layers all serve the fractal motif. Setting constrains the only method—orientation of burner—so environment is integral to beat-by-beat action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she gather the ungatherable weights?—is signaled early; pressure accrues via density, not reversal, as each alcove reveals deeper recursion. The single meaningful tightening is the recognition that collection unweaves existence; this is a conceptual, not tactical, narrowing. Cost is present but abstract: the endless task itself. Escalation is textural (pattern-thickening) rather than option-closing; no credible loss of tool, time, or social credit alters later moves, keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of recursive responsibility emerges from concrete imagery—coral-like weights, bronze-threaded shame—never from thesis statements. The final image reconfigures the premise: witness itself becomes the burden, a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier alcoves. Subtext lives in silence: the unspoken daughter’s name calcifies into geography. Complexity is honored—no moral is offered, only the luminous tapestry of shared pain—so resonance lingers without tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the weaver’s perceptual filter; diction is controlled, rhythmic, and fractal-tinged (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) without purple drift. Syntax lengthens and contracts to mimic breath of silence under starlight. No head-hop or register drift; reliability is stable. Voice is distinctive enough to be quoted; the cracked chimney as “branching tributaries” shows perceptual signature rather than decorative metaphor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or knowledge without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and taught early—fractal, shingle, whalebone—so later saturation feels earned rather than overwritten. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay physically coherent. Occasional adjective stacks (“infinite branches of small resentments”) flirt with density but serve the fractal conceit and never obscure causality or dull the closing glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fantastical premise—metaphor made weighable in a bronze lung of earth—feels inevitable rather than gimmicky because every image internalizes the fractal rule. The grotto as externalized shame deposit is fresh, and the lamp-orientation method turns metaphor into mechanic. Risk is taken with plotless lyric structure; the poem of accretion succeeds because closure reconfigures the task itself. Transformation is high: swap any detail and the whole lattice collapses.</comment>
