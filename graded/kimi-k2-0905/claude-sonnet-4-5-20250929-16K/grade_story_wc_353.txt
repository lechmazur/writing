<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and particular; her symphonic thinking is shown through wire-strumming, not labeled. The bleeding fingers, the choice to keep strumming despite pain, crystallizes cost on the page. One contradiction—she both “remembers when sound existed” yet concludes music never died—goes unacknowledged, a hairline flaw that keeps her just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: stress-crack patterns, wire tension, and grove-wide sway build density toward a Conceptual Repricing—“music had simply changed the instrument.” The ending image of the hedgehog dreaming of unheard sound visibly reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds; no orientation debt; closure is earned and legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The alder grove is filtered through Mara’s professional attention to vibration; every bark stroke and root sway is purposeful, never postcard. The porcelain insulator’s crystalline feel and the stress-crack map function as micro-settings that constrain her precise wire tensions. One minor over-explanation—“vibration lived everywhere, patient and invisible”—is the only line that slackens the otherwise tight sensory weave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove beauty can exist without sound—tightens when copper wire begins to draw blood; the tightening is visible, felt, and alters tactics (she cannot stop). Agency is continuous: every strum is a decision that narrows later options; painful fingertips are a persistent constraint shaping the crescendo. Cost is on-page and legible; escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, satisfying its lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: empathy as literal sympathetic resonance between living and dead wood. Subtext lives in gesture—silent birds moving to unheard rhythm—never in commentary. The final reweighting (“music had simply changed the instrument”) offers a resonant non-literal answer; no moral is stated. Complexity is embraced: silence is both loss and liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s synesthetic perception; diction—“symphonically minded,” “crystalline quality”—is controlled and within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates with wire-tension crescendo; sentences lengthen then fracture in the final paragraph, mirroring the grove’s settling. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “copper wire threaded through the insulator” does double duty as tool and image. Only one mixed metaphor—“music…like water through stone”—is soft; it passes because the sonic/fluid trope is later literalized via vibration waves. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Final line lands with crystalline brevity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The Silence that devours sound yet leaves vibration is a fresh conceptual twist; execution commits fully without retreat. Stress-cracks-as-sheet-music transforms a static motif into an active scoring system, an inevitable-in-hindsight move. Risk in choosing an accumulative, near-plotless structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Hedgehog dream ending is bold, specific, and earned.</comment>
