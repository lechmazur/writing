<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s ageless vigilance and miniature scale are shown through tactile ritual (grinding ink, touching scrolls) that externalizes her regal humility; the final fade into memory crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—her “careful hand,” the library’s last exhale—never slipping into label-speak. The only limit: we glimpse contradictory impulses (guardian vs. saboteur) but they are asserted more than dramatized in a single beat, keeping her short of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the rune’s truth reweights Orian’s reality off-stage while Kael pays with her existence, cost legible in “the library exhaled its last breath, and she with it.” Causal chain holds: because she cannot leave, she weaponizes marginalia; because the library dies, the final Chronicle crossing is irreversible. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“diminutive titan…tended the ancient temple library”), well within the 120-word guardrail. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at termination.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dying library is not backdrop but tool: gossamer scrolls, backward-flowing spring, and translucent walls progressively constrain Kael’s options until only one sending remains. Sensory triangulation—ink’s “purple-black iridescence,” columns “threading with luminous cracks”—is filtered through her custodial gaze, never touristic. The final image of void “where lost things go to dream” recharges earlier spatial cues, meeting the 9-band gate; micro-shortfall is the absence of a tactile object that survives to the last line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: when the library’s dissolution accelerates, Kael’s tactic shifts from slow seeding to a final, irreversible message. The price (her extinction) is felt on-page, but the external pressure plate (Orian’s reaction) occurs off-stage, slightly muting the visceral cost at the decisive beat. Still, the causal linkage between library decay and urgency is unmistakable, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory’s fragility versus the indelibility of truth, enacted as a librarian sacrifices her eternal present to correct the future. The rune of drift, ink, and collapsing archive form a returning constellation that reweights meaning when “the stars remember what mortals forget.” No moralizing final sentence; the thematic resonance is the aftershock of Kael’s vanishing. Complexity is preserved—her victory is also erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays pinned to Kael’s perceptual radius: diction (“regally unpretentious,” “faded parchment”) mirrors her custodial modesty, while syntax lengthens and softens during the dissolution, mimicking exhalation. No head-hop; temporal leaps (“longer than kingdoms remembered”) are authorial but justified by her immortality. Reed-pen scratch, ink iridescence, and library sigh create a hushed, incantatory rhythm that peaks in the final luminous fade—distinctive, controlled, and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, each sentence advances image or stakes. Density is high—“she herself was more ancient than most of the texts”—yet clarity never wavers. The only hairline slip: “across the pause of shifting constellations” is briefly ornate amid otherwise spare temporal cues, but the phrase is earned by star-chart payoff. Closure line is unmarred by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The miniature immortal librarian sabotaging a false king via marginalia in a library that unwrites itself is a fresh synthesis of archival fantasy and temporal sabotage. Tropes (lost heir, ink magic, collapsing sanctuary) are reconfigured through Kael’s scale inversion and the rune-as-algorithm. Risk—quiet dissolution instead of heroic exit—pays off by making erasure the heroic act. The concept commits fully; no retreat into generic spectacle.</comment>
