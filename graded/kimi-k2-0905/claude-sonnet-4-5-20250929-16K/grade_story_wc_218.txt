<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s calmly fatalistic interiority is vivid and consistent; the diary, copper, and oak choices externalize her “nothing to lose” stance without therapy-speak. However, because no second character shares the scene, relational crucible and status pressure are absent, leaving her arc a solitary, if credible, renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “The secret isn’t domination. It’s listening” re-weights the whole premise with undeniable social/ethical cost. Causal chain—diary insight → copper graft → green mist → cracks halt—holds under Accumulative lens; one tightening beat suffices. Orientation is clean by word 75; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Living stone pillars that grew from the earth like ancient teeth” and the pale-green mist shift anchor the world in tactile, evolving specificity. Temple fractures, copper wire, and root choreography all constrain later tactics; the orchard–pillar symbiosis literally props up the climax image. Micro-setting (diary, copper loops) charges the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the temple before death—tightens once when copper graft stops the cracks; cost is the labor/stamina she pays with her dwindling time. Agency stays on-page: every drill hole and wiring act narrows options under her “nothing to lose” stance. No reversal beyond that single intensification, but at this length one is sufficient and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges via living circuitry: human humility before cross-kingdom cooperation. Final line reframes “dying well” as ecological listening—earned, unsentimental. Diary and mist motifs accumulate meaning without overt symbolic nudging; ambiguity lingers about who will keep listening after her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Marina’s perceptual filter—“brazen calm,” mineral pores, green-tinged mist—creating a distinct scientific-mystic texture. No head-hop; diction remains within her capable but non-expert lexicon. Compression in the montage weeks is taught early and paid off in the final stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is sparse and precise (“ancient teeth”). No scaffold loops, filter stacks, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety propels the montage and the final quietus without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fusing palliative arc with geobotanical architecture feels fresh; the copper-wired oak graft as “acupuncture for geology” is an unforgettable, risk-taking image that crystallizes the theme. Premise could have slid into eco-allegory, but specificity of diary mechanics and mineral mist grounds it.</comment>
