<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elijah’s embodied terror and Maya’s subsequent mission are vividly rendered, but the retrocognitive merge is stated more than dramatized; we’re told “memory seized her like a fist” rather than shown contradictory impulses colliding inside one body. The final vow to testify lands as credible renunciation because the diary encryption has already exacted a price—her involuntary possession—so the cost feels earned even if interiority during the merge is summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s hands spell WITNESS TESTIFY REMEMBER, a Charged Poise that reframes her archival distance as moral obligation. The diary’s consciousness-transfer rule is taught early and paid off at the lagoon; the lens is Causal (decoding → possession → obligation) and holds without ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image—she can no longer be a detached keeper—so the ending satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The obsidian lagoon is returned to in both 1952 and present, its glassy surface literally constraining parley logistics and symbolically recharging the final debris-message. Micro-setting (Elijah’s driftwood alphabet) functions as tool and stage; without it the encoded communique and Maya’s later imitation would fail. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—heat, black sand, shell edges—filtered through archive-trained attention to durable fragments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—tightens once: the decryption that was meant to preserve evidence turns into lived endangerment when Elijah’s consciousness hijacks Maya. That tightening is visible, felt, and irreversible; it forces her stance crystallization from observer to witness. Agency is present, cost is on-page, so escalation meets the lens under the 8.0 band even without multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—archive as activism—emerges through the encryption device, the lagoon’s dual-time usage, and the final debris spell, never sermonized. Subtext lives in sheriff’s hat-removal and Elijah’s trembling hands: law hesitating, resistance terrified. Final image reweights earlier archival solemnity into public testimony, satisfying the non-literal resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice stays in close third with controlled psychic distance; diction (“yellowed like old teeth,” “searing determination”) is concrete, archive-tinged. No head-hopping; even during merge Maya’s perceptions remain the filter. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under possession, longer reflective sentences on the zeppelin—without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent (glass, teeth, cracks) and serve pressure. One near-scaffold: “memory seized her like a fist” is familiar phrasing but is immediately followed by specific sensory takeover, so artifact does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive civil-rights archive thriller; the cipher-as-consciousness-storage twist feels inevitable once revealed. Risk in merging two eras inside one body is bold yet coherent. Could edge higher if the merge mechanism were grounded in one unforgettable sensory rupture rather than a summary metaphor.</comment>
