<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prince’s obsessive, self-taught resurrection quest is vividly interiorized—his trembling hands, nightly neglect of food, tears on the coat—so his drive feels lived-in. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. knowledge of forgery, duty vs. theft of lab parts) stay active in scene, not summary. The final smile carries credible cost: his heirloom sword gone, father’s censure, the creature itself a “bitterly sweet” hybrid that can never live outside the cave. Only minor safety-hedging keeps him from 9.0: he never confronts the king in moment, and his scientific errors carry no real failure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is sound: tattered robes → egg purchase → clandestine lab → 43-day trial → bioluminescent hatch → father confrontation → charged poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prince cradles an impossible life-form whose song reweights the palace’s meaning, foreclosing his earlier despair while binding him to perpetual secrecy. Cost is visible—“traded his ceremonial sword,” father’s disgust, the creature’s cage-dependency. Orientation lands by line 4 (who, where, when), transitions are smooth, lens stays situational/accumulative without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace–stalactite complex is not backdrop but active constraint: swaying groans dictate quiet work, crystal wall offers the outside darkness as mirror, copper incubators must be stolen from medical bays. Sensorial hierarchy matches crisis—smell of moth-eaten velvet, metallic bone glint, clockwork clicks fading under the first “music.” Micro-setting (laboratory, incubation chamber) directly shapes tactics: every temperature dial, nutrient line, and lamp angle alters survival odds. Final image—song refracted through crystal—makes environment participate in the thematic repricing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle beauty in a mechanized void—clarifies early and tightens through each failed calibration; options narrow to “succeed with hybrid or accept silence.” One decisive turn: the first pinhole into shell commits him irreversibly; no reset is possible. Escalation is accumulative: each stolen tube, skipped meal, and microscopic glimpse raises emotional and social cost until the hatch crystallizes the stakes in one glowing body. No external coincidence resolves tension; success itself is imperfect, so pressure stays coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific images—pressed flowers, fiber-optic feathers—rather than editorial: “can artifice birth authentic wonder?” Subtext is carried in gestures: king’s whispered “What have you made?” contains both awe and reproach, never moralized. Final image (song wavering through crystal) answers the thematic question without dictating a moral, leaving reader suspended between triumph and captivity. Complexity is honored: no tidy ethical ledger, only an ambiguous heartbeat in a metal world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight inside the prince’s perceptual filter—he sees light refract “like fiber optics” because his mind is half mechanical; diction never drifts into king’s brass register. Syntax lengthens in calmer lab passages, fragments under surgical tension; rhythm tracks breath. No head-hopping; father’s interior is left opaque, read only via whisper. Voice-specific metaphor—“clockwork servants clicked”—reinforces worldview without self-conscious poetry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high density: one sentence often paints sound, smell, and symbolic tilt (“steam-driven fountains produced water on precise schedules. Everything worked… nothing sang”). No filter-verb clusters, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“quaking reverie”) risks register drift but is earned by fairy-tale frame and pays off in closure cadence. Minor paraphrase loop near “he wept… tears falling onto coat” costs −0.2, not enough to touch ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Extinction-resurrection tale is familiar, but grounding it inside an inverted stalactite kingdom powered by clockwork freshens the lens. Choice to birth a hybrid, not the true warbler, twists romantic trope into post-natural fable without preaching. Specific detail—copper incubation chamber lined with thermal regulators—creates tactile authenticity that transcends allegory. Risk in blending biotech and steampunk pays off; failure would have been sentimental, but piece commits fully.</comment>
