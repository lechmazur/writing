<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marin’s “adaptable archivist” trait is convincingly embodied: she keeps tea, labels by timestamp, and calmly rebraids causality. Interior contradiction is light—she never doubts her mission—yet embodied patience and micro-choices under impossible physics feel individual. Closure gains resonance because her warm methodical nature is the only tool that could parse Chen’s absence-code; the cost is the quiet erasure of her single-timeline memories, felt as new notebook entries she didn’t write. Still, emotional layering stays rational rather than raw, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: 3:47 hiccup → door → seal → rope pattern → timeline merge. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged registry and new notebook entries make the before/after legible, paying the conceptual cost of ontological doubling. No teleporting props, no outline drift; every artifact is pre-planted (thermos, seal, rope). The moment she steps back at 4:23, the world’s gain is her loss of singular past—cost is visible in the fresh ink she didn’t author.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Clock-tower mechanism room is more than postcard: grinding gears narrow her attention, pendulum shaft geometry literally hosts the door, and the impossible curved shelves constrain movement. Micro-setting objects—walnut door, wax seal, ceremonial rope—are handled tactilely and become the crucible for choice. Final image of warm tea beside alien notebook entries fuses body, tool, and environment. Missing a 9+ only because the rope’s physical properties (heat, light) are stated not sensed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—heal the university’s ontological split—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as Marin learns Chen didn’t fail but encoded instructions in absence itself. One tightening: realizing the seal pattern equals rope braids forces the final reconfiguration; refusal is impossible without erasing Chen again. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—her own timeline identity is overwritten, shown by alien notebook entries. Pressure stays causal and coherent; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: absence is a preservative, not a void. Subtext in the redacted footnotes and crossed-out names lets silence speak louder than archives. Final image reweights “clarity” as coexistence of contradictory records—no moral stated. Warmly methodical temperament becomes thematic engine: order is love applied to chaos, even when chaos is two timelines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marin’s perceptual filter—selective attention to gears, timestamps, braids. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly formal mirroring an archivist’s precision without academic excess. No head-hop; compression during braid-work is taught by earlier clock-tick pattern. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains distinct through idiosyncratic noticing of negative space.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “reality seemed to hiccup” compresses world-shift without cliché. No filter-verb stacks, no loops; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—wax “pressed into red wax” avoids redundant noun. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges “translate confusion into clarity” with earned irony now that clarity includes contradiction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired “hidden door in clock tower” motif and makes it ontological surgery. Chen’s absence-as-instruction and the rope-as-timeline-loom feel inevitable in hindsight yet fresh in concept. Risky structural choice—entire plot is rebraiding a rope—earns emotional stakes because the university’s split is personal to students’ memories. Specificity of archival negative space transforms a familiar fantasy frame into a meditation on historiography.</comment>
