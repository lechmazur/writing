<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s shift from caravan daughter to starless cartographer is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—pressing against stone, feeling ambered hush as “texture”—that externalize her obsession. The interior contradiction (fear vs. wonder) stays live in scene, but the oracle remains off-stage, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is N/A; head-count stays clean. Final Earned Stasis is credible: she smiles in absolute dark, having forfeited family, safety, and literal daylight. Cost is scaled to length; still, the oracle’s motivation is inherited rather than self-revealed, capping the arc just below the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: “She sat in her marbled hush… began to map…” reconfigures meaning while the price—eternal starless exile—is legible. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; silence thickens like sediment until it crystallizes into map-medium. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“The ridge fort shuddered…”), well inside 120-word allowance. One soft spot: the oracle’s booklet functions as off-stage info dump; its rules are accepted rather than pressure-tested on-page, a micro-causality gap that holds the score below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Storm-battered fort, flaking gold leaf, and dying star act as micro-setting objects that literally constrain choice—wind blocks exits, booklet-pages delimit knowledge, last star times the hush. Tactile specificity: “centuries of weather had worn the mortar away” grounds scale without catalog bloat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s merchant-eye: value is ascribed to gold leaf first, temperature second. The 9-gate is missed because environment never physically endangers her (no broken stair, collapsing beam), so setting shapes tone more than tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake = learn to navigate the coming dark. Escalation is textural: each vanished star layers Silence-density until the hush becomes navigable medium; final pulse of the last star is the tightening beat. No reversible antagonist, but that fits Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of entire sky—so price is legible but not corporeal, holding the score under 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as preservative amber, cartography without sight. No thesis statements; final line (“began to map…”) offers non-literal answer. Oracle’s booklet acts as silent mentor-text, letting theme stay implicit. Ambiguity—will anyone follow her map?—is purposeful and resonant, but the absence of a second viewpoint keeps thematic counter-pressure light, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices “flaking gold leaf,” “texture” of hush, wind “clawing”—all merchant-child, value-and-surface bias. Prose rhythm mirrors rising stillness: longer sentences as starlight thins, then clipped final clause when darkness arrives. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Just misses 9 because one clause drifts toward editorial omniscience: “She understood suddenly…” which nudges interpretation rather than pure perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers silence-as-substance without metaphor pile-up. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“hush” thrice in 5 lines) but the repetition is pattern-taught, hence waived. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One register hitch: “conceptual repricing” is editor-meta vocabulary, not Maren’s, but it appears inside closure beat and slightly jars the lyric register, keeping the score under 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: starless navigation via silence-cartography reverses typical survival trope (characters chase light). Risk—slowing plot to meditate on absence—pays off through accrued texture. Oracle-as-posthumous-mentor avoids living-guide cliché. Transformation test fails slightly: caravan dropout + apocalypse could swap names/places, but the specific sensory inversion (silence = map) provides enough novelty to stay above 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade>
<comment>Oracle appears only as corpse and marginalia; she exerts influence but makes zero on-page choices. Setup present, development and payoff absent; cap 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Booklet is handled in opening discovery, mid-scene study, and final inscription; gold flakes literalize “crumbling knowledge” and mirror star-disintegration. Irreplaceable—no other object conveys oracle’s authority. Closure beat: Maren writes on its pages, tying cost to object. Slight swap possible (any old journal?), but gold-leaf fragility is thematically specific, holding 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Ambered hush is named early, thickens perceptibly, and becomes literal map-medium at climax; without it Maren has no orienting tool. Tight causal pressure: each star-loss intensifies hush until navigation is born. Meets all three gates; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>“Mildly obsessed” justifies abandoning caravan, living in ruin, writing in dark; obsession is label-stated but enacted through micro-choices (watching star for three days). Cost visible—family, safety—but trait never complicates or backfires, capping below 7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Retelling oracle’s summaries occupies two reflective blocks that anchor method; without them Maren could not “map” silence. Action enables climax but is internally dramatized, not external, so misses higher band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Method is set up via oracle’s notes, rehearsed when Maren writes her own entry, and pays off in final line. Mechanics remain abstract—how does one “compress” silence?—but linkage to closure is explicit, earning high-mid score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Fort supplies isolation and wind howl that produces hush, but stones never physically threaten or limit exit. Setting functions as resonant shell more than active constraint, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>One-star deadline creates ticking clock; final extinguishing triggers climax. Time is tracked (“three days,” “past weeks”) but not used to foreclose intermediate options, so tension accumulates rather than spikes, high-mid.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Mapping desire is voiced early, conflicted against family abandonment, and fulfilled in closing image. Want vs. cost (loss of sky, society) is dramatized through lived exile. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Marbled hush” is seeded in paragraph four, modulates from awe to acceptance, and titles the final stance. Tone directly charges the last image; removing it would collapse emotional cadence. Meets all gates, high essential.</comment>
