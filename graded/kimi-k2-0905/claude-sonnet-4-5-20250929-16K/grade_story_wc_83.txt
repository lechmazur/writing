<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Amal’s survivor-grief is vivid and embodied (scarred palms on glass, the geode pressed into skin), but the turn from hunted to hunter is reported rather than dramatized; the final smile feels unmoored from any micro-choice that proves she accepts the coming devastation. Interior contradiction is asserted (“rational part…died”) rather than lived in-scene. Competence is shown (equations, array tuning) yet struggle is rhetorical, not tactical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a clean Charged Poise: the geode’s pulse + approaching coherence beneath make the cost of awakening legible without exposition. Causal chain (geode → detection → theory → smile) holds, but the middle “theory” beat is summary, not scene, so the tightening is intellectual, not visceral. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation cap applies: one off-page reversal (colleagues leave) is thin causality support.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The floating observatory is sketched with tactile specificity (cooling breakers, humming gyros) and matters instrumentally—altitude drops as power diverts, linking setting to stakes. Micro-setting rule met: the geode’s lattice functions as the story’s terrain. Desert below is atmospheric but static; no spatial choreography issues. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis-narrowed perception. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses invoked only once each.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—releasing dammed futures—signals early and escalates via data spikes and altitude bleed, but agency is observational until the final smile; no narrowing fork forces a tactical choice. Cost is conceptual (paradox risk) rather than dramatized loss. Pressure is accumulative/textural: density of ghost-futures builds effectively. One meaningful deepening (coherence becomes “awakening”) satisfies the lens. Could use one beat where she must sacrifice life-support or data to proceed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—violence as quantum vandalism—emerges through concrete particulars (wedding ash, purple crystals, pooled potential) rather than thesis. Final image of survivors-to-be reweights prior devastation without moralizing. Subtext in geode=keepsake/amplifier is quietly handled. Resists tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers. The “bleak exhilaration” refrain is the only near-echo of prompt language, mildly blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyrical-scientific, consistent with grief-mad physicist; perceptual signature strong (“equations screamed into the dark”). Compression taught early (“gyroscopes humming while breakers cooled”) and paid off at breaker re-set. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays inside lexicon. One register drift: “mathematical ghost of unused potential” edges academic but fits obsession. Rhythm mirrors systems flicker well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—most sentences dual-job. Mixed-metaphor guard passed. One paraphrase loop: “bleak exhilaration” appears twice without re-inflation; allowed as motif but still redundant. No scaffold clutter. Final image sharp; no artifact within closure beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Occasional elevated diction (“quantum-locked”) is motivated; clarity preserved.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—quantum echo of stolen futures pooling into spacetime bend—is fresh, non-obvious, fully committed. Geode-as-detector and observatory-as-isolation-chamber are specific syntheses, not checklist items. Emotional core (survivor’s inverse vengeance) is humanly particular. Risky tonal pairing of scientific rigor with grief-mad lyricism succeeds. Transformation test: story collapses if geode swapped for any crystal. Proximity check: no close echoes of published scenes.</comment>
