<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s dissolution-into-light choice is foreshadowed by the “bound release” lullaby and tracked through every shard-orbit; the cost is felt when “she felt herself growing thinner.” Interiority stays imagistic, never diagnostic. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the table, but the single-mind arc is complete and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final sunrise lands on the page, Elara’s last fragment vanishes, and the conceptual cost—she binds the world only by unbinding herself—is unmistakable. Causal chain holds: lullaby → shard-gather → dawn-pull → community-song → her extinction. Orientation is taught by word 40 (“In the mirror world…”) and the mica window anchors space throughout. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern tightens to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s skeletal trees, floating glass shards, and mica sheets are not backdrop: the dawn-threads must wrap the trees to re-ignite them, and the window is the literal aperture through which meaning passes. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices light, texture, resonance, because she is light and glass. Spatial choreography stays coherent as fragments orbit, exit, and return. The setting constrains the final tactic and charges the last image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle what had been lost”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the dawns will not stick without people, forcing Elara to spend her last coherence. Cost is visible on the page (thinning fragments) and shapes the final renunciation. No reversals beyond the single decisive shift, sufficient for 700-word scope. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-per-beat, coherent under the lyric-accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse paradox of community versus self: the lullaby about “wrapping something tight so it could break free” is literalized when Elara’s total dispersal becomes the glue that re-braids society. No moralizing sentence distills this; the final image of sunrise without the memory-keeper lets the reader re-weight the premise. Subtext operates through the dawn-thread gesture alone. The emotional after-effect is concrete—wonder tinged with irrevocable loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a glass-bright, moth-soft perceptual signature—every verb choice (“shards…floated…like luminous moths,” “dawn-threads slipped through the mica like light through water”) belongs to a being who is herself refracted light. Rhythm modulates: long hypnotic sentences for orbital drift, clipped fragments at the thinning end. No dialogue, hence no voice-convergence risk. Patterned elision (“woven dawns,” “bound release”) is taught early and paid off in the final line without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, world-rule—without metaphor pile-up: “the trees stood skeletal and dark…branches reaching toward a sky that never brightened” is one clean stroke. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physically coherent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating urgency; paragraph lengths narrow as fragments tighten, propelling to the luminous last line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “mirror world in endless night” trope is inverted: instead of a hero restoring daylight, the memory-keeper must dis-integrate to weave stolen past-sunrises into present life. Glass-shard consciousness and song-as-gravity are fresh syntheses that grow inevitably from the communal lullaby seed. Risk is high—protagonist abolition as victory—yet causality and emotional clarity remain intact. Specificity of alchemical orchard, mica window, and dawn-thread mechanics prevents generic overlay.</comment>
