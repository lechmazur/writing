<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s engineer-daughter identity is cleanly anchored to the patch and paternal memory; her micro-choice to re-scope the investigation from structural to meteorological is visible and stakes-shift the mission. Interiority stays concrete (“breath catch,” fingers on patch) without label-speak. Yet the evacuation epiphany is confessed rather than dramatized, so the cost feels second-hand; the “hazy precision” refrain never collides with a personal price that would foreclose her path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth’s “breathing” reweights the entire mystery from crime scene to atmospheric warning system, cost felt in the humming metal. Causal chain (charts → vortex → evacuation) holds; orientation is swift (Porto Velho day-four). One minor scaffold: “she’d been searching for without knowing it” teleports the wind charts into her path; still, the reveal changes tactics immediately and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) stays coherent to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Container geometry is tactile—“rust-orange walls,” “metal canyons”—and constrains movement and perception; wind pressure is made legible through stacked papers, ballast stones, sensor digits. The father’s patch micro-sets as body-adjacent setting that charges the final touch. Spatial choreography stays clean across vertical levels; no impossible positions. Environment directly shapes the investigative method, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand the silence—tightens when wind charts reveal a living atmospheric trap; the meaningful deepening (pressure differential still rising) narrows Mara’s goal to urgent documentation. Agency is observational rather than interventionist, fitting the lens, but the evacuation back-story lessens felt jeopardy; the price is conceptual, not personal. Still, the foresight lesson is earned and forecloses any “crime” reading, so closure cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—foresight as listening to systems rather than blaming accidents—emerges through wind-pattern particulars and paternal memory, never sermonized. The final “containers hummed” image reweights the earlier silence from horror to warning without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers on human adaptability, satisfying complexity. No motif is forced; charts and patch recur because they must.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—engineering numeracy, filial nostalgia—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under analytical pressure, shortens at sensor reveal, mirroring cognition. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction (“vortex point,” “ballast stones”) that feels profession-true. The “hazy precision” refrain risks template cadence but remains purposeful to tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences twin observation with inference (“columns of light that seemed to measure the emptiness”). One paraphrase loop—“documenting everything with hazy precision” appears twice with identical wording—dings rhythm. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic echo, tightening cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Collapse-by-microburst in a vertical container favela is fresh; treating resident wind ethnography as survival foresight flips standard disaster tropes. Specificity—ballast stones, tri-lingual warnings—grounds the concept in lived logistics. Risk lies in quiet observational arc, but coherence justifies the choice. No derivative echo detected; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
