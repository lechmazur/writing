<comment>Marta’s damaged hands and growing compulsion to sing feel embodied; the ash-note marks force her to act. The “seraphically mundane” label is asserted, not dramatized, so the full 9+ gate fails. Yet her quiet refusal to leave and the bolt-on-step gesture crystallize a credible, cost-bearing stance. Interiority stays sparse but consistent; the pacing of restored sensation parallels her decision to reclaim sound, earning the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens is accumulative/textural: each latent ash-mark layers density until the silence becomes unbearable, forcing Marta’s sung defiance. The bolt placement on the staircase lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—an earned, visible cost that reweights the fortress’s silence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality or prop teleport. Closure image is quiet yet legible: she sings, the stones carry it, the cost of forgetting is now paid in memory and voice.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt stone, perpetual snow, and four piano-leg dents are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through Marta’s labor. The bolt micro-object constrains her pocketed guilt and finally charges the closing placement. Spatial choreography on the spiral staircase is immaculate; each ash-mark is discovered through physical kneeling and tracing. Environment mirrors interior thaw: as feeling returns to hands, the fortress’s acoustic freeze begins to break under her hum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—is signaled early; escalation is the accretion of twenty-three ash notes that convert abstract guilt into a compulsion to sing. One meaningful tightening: management’s piped music forces Marta to move her humming to off-hours, highlighting the stakes of sonic forgetting. Cost is visible: she risks employment and emotional exposure by singing; the fortress may expel her. Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than confrontation, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as an acoustic debt that must be paid in voice. The ash marks and bolt transform from forensic clues to ritual offerings; silence is reframed from safety feature to moral erasure. Final image of frostbitten hope is non-didactic—Marta’s hum costs her anonymity and lets the stone remember. Complexity lingers: the hotel remains profitable, guests still prefer oblivion, yet one worker refuses erasure.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Marta’s perceptual filter: “her damaged hands gripping the brass railing,” “half-sensation of nerve regeneration.” Diction is controlled, lyrical but not purple; rhythm accelerates during discovery of ash notes, then softens into hymn cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested. Free indirect style is clean: “She would remain, and she would sing” carries both narrator punch and character vow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no metaphor clutter. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening sentence sets cathedral cadence, later sentences tighten during discovery beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor quibble: “seraphically mundane” leans ornate versus Marta’s otherwise grounded register, but it appears once and does not dilute clarity. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Converts familiar “haunted hotel” into acoustic memorial; ash-note tally and bolt offering feel specific to this story. The notion that safety can murder memory by enforced silence is a fresh ethical angle. Risky accumulative structure holds: no external antagonist, climax is a quiet placement of a bolt and a hum—yet tension sustains. If names and places swapped, the memorial math (23=voices) and nerve-regeneration clock would collapse, proving tight integration.</comment>
