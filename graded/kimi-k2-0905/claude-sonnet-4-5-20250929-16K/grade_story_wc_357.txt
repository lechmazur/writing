<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s goal is crisp and personal; her flying skill is shown, not told. Interiority stays concrete (“stomach lurched,” “breath caught”). The final decision to confront the council is earned by the canister discovery, but the emotional cost is stated rather than embodied—no lingering tremor or tactile memory of grandmother’s voice—so the arc feels competent, not yet piercing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: inversion → water clue → echo → canister → council plan. Orientation is swift: planet, skiff, orchard stakes inside 80 words. Closure is a Decisive Change with social cost—family name restored, but risk of council reprisal is implied. One minor slack: the canister’s exact mechanical leverage (how it proves theft) is off-stage, keeping the beat just shy of irreversible punch.</comment>

<comment>Floating arches, rising irrigation, and water-sphere chamber are sensory, plot-functional, and unique. The inverted orchard is not mere backdrop—it funnels flight path and reveals the buried arrow. Micro-setting (broken arrow tip) becomes the literal key to the past. Only the skeletal tree at First Orchard drifts toward generic; still, environment constrains every maneuver, qualifying for 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—family survival—surfaces early and tightens when the echo names the buried treaty. The one-hour inversion clock visibly narrows options; failure means burial under returning gravity. Escalation is linear but effective: each water lane taken forecloses others. Cost is present (risk of crash, social exile), yet the final price feels prospective rather than paid, capping intensity just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of stolen resilience emerges through action, not sermon. The echo chamber literalizes historical erasure; the crossed-out name is visceral evidence. Final image—“echoes remember everything”—reweights prior beats with conceptual cost. Avoids explicit moral, but resonance is slightly blunted because Kael’s next move is announced, not dramatized, leaving thematic aftershock competent rather than haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual filter is pilot-technical (“engines whined,” “water always knew”). Syntax tightens under stress—short clauses during inversion, then longer glide home. No dialogue, so voice carries all; occasional lyric uplift (“thunderous silence”) feels earned. One filter-verb cluster (“she heard voices”) could be trimmed, but texture remains controlled and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety mirrors gravity shift—fragmented in flight, fluid in revelation. Information dual-loads: “water didn’t rise or fall but hung suspended” simultaneously paints setting and signals anomaly. Only minor tic: repeated “she” opener in final paragraph; not enough to dull momentum or breach 9- threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Inside-out orchard with pollinator pilot navigating by inverted water streams is fresh, yet grows logically from agrarian SF. The acoustic archive of betrayals reframes standard “lost treaty” trope into planetary geology. Risk is taken—entire action during gravity flip—yet executed without clarity loss. Could push further if the social mechanics of treaty renewal were as weird as the physics, but still lands above 8.5.</comment>
