<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his dawning recognition that “someone had taken Dessen’s real story… and wrapped it in fantasy” is embodied in the bent gnomon he turns in his palm. The contradiction between chasing magic and uncovering grief is held in scene, not summarised. Micro-choice—photographing the maps, pocketing the broken sundial—crystallises his hierarchy of values. Cost is felt: the legend quest is renounced, replaced by a colder, archival duty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal linkage is clean: false legend → radio silence → maps hidden beneath myth → salvage decision. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Marcus walks away with the ruined sundial and the truth, foreclosing the treasure hunt. The bent gnomon reweights the premise: time is not to be navigated but mourned. Persistent constraint: the harbour radio’s return mocks the earlier silence, sealing the cover-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Canal water, diesel shimmer, crumbling charts—each detail is filtered through Marcus’s disillusionment. The broken sundial acts as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: it is literally impotent for “telling time,” forcing him to adopt documentation over divination. Spatial choreography is clean: deck → pilot house → hold → dock, no impossible moves. Tone of “serene upheaval” is sustained by amber reflection against industrial ghosts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus seductive myth—tightens when the radio silence signals the myth’s intentional architecture. One decisive turn: Marcus shifts from seeker to salvager, narrowing his options from quest to evidence-gathering. Cost is legible: the Compass of Veiled Hours is revealed as hollow, replacing wonder with grief. No coincidence; every escalation is driven by his uncovering of Dessen’s maps.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the danger of glamorous falsehoods that bury ordinary atrocities. Subtext lives in the bent gnomon—grief literally breaking the mechanism of measurement. Final image reweights the premise: “truth required a different kind of seeking… for what had been deliberately darkened.” No moralising; the silence after the radio crackles back is the conceptual repricing of public forgetfulness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—industrial decay read as “question mark” waters—belongs to a cartographer of myths. Diction (“diesel shimmer,” “amber reflection”) is specific and consistent. No dialogue, so voice distinction and quote mechanics are N/A; narrative rhythm mirrors his methodical sifting without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong verbs (“crackled,” “dissolving”) and concrete nouns (“gnomon,” “charts”) keep density high. One scaffold loop: “architecture of lies” is repeated twice in close proximity; second use could compress. Mixed metaphor risk—“serene upheaval”—is justified by tonal payoff. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds through the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inversion of treasure-hunt trope into archival revelation feels fresh; bent sundial as grief memorial is specific, not stock. Synthesis of canal-history cover-up with myth-making offers a non-obvious angle on conspiracy. Risk lies in lyric compression of time, but closure stays legible. Could not swap Dessen’s maps/sundial for generic props without breaking logic.</comment>
