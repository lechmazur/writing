<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—hot grief cooled into glacial patience—drives every micro-choice (quiet steps, map folds, renunciation of gear). Her sister’s death is never exposited; it surfaces only as embodied tension in the breath-cloud beat, giving the final “we move” its cost. The “horizon mapper” label is earned through tactile use of moonlight and magnetic stone, not diagnosis. Only cap: no visible flaw in closure choice itself, yet the group’s collective agency slightly dilutes the single-POV intensity demanded at 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: seventeen winters of mapping → viaduct magnetic window → lunar meridian convergence → exodus beat. Closure is Earned Stasis: freedom refused as wildfire, embraced as glacier, with the frozen lake mirror repricing their prison into a boundary they now own. Persistent constraint—discipline itself—shapes every tactical choice and is visible in the final “softly purposeful steps.” No orientation debt; lens taught by 120-word mark and never loosens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Basalt columns, frozen lake surface, and moon-track reflections are not backdrop but navigational tools that constrain when and where they can move. The magnetic viaduct’s hum is felt in the body (“familiar pull”) and literally masks their exit. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the lake’s mirror becomes the closing image that reweights captivity into self-possession. Spatial choreography is pristine—no impossible positions across ten-mile night trek.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective escape without triggering Directorate scans—tightens when the magnetic window is shown to be fleeting; any mis-step re-exposes them. The patient/glacier ethic itself becomes a second, internal stake: wildness must stay caged until the right moment. Escalation is accumulative: each quiet footstep under the humming viaduct adds density to the cost of discipline. Cost is legible in the final image: their prison lake is now behind them, but they still whisper, still walk softly—freedom not yet consumed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “patience as revolution” emerges solely through action and image—no character ever spells it out. The glacier metaphor is introduced early, returned in the final line, and reweights the sister’s death from waste to legacy. Subtextual irony: the captors’ confiscation of instruments forced a superior, bodily navigation system. Final mirror-image lake offers conceptual repricing—sanctuary converted to launching point without moral tagline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual signature—magnetic tingles, moon-angle calculations, grief-flattened affect. Syntax is rhythmic yet controlled, mirroring “restrained wildness”: longer sentences collapse into staccato directives under pressure (“we move”). No head-hopping; group interiority is filtered through Kael’s reading of their breath-clouds. Filter verbs serve voice (“she felt the familiar pull”) rather than dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence cadence, zero template runs; information density high—“Each family carried only what they could bear” simultaneously reveals limit, discipline, and emotional restraint. Metaphors are coherent (water beneath ice, glacier) and never mixed. Minor scaffold: “softly purposeful steps” is repeated verbatim at open and close; because it functions as deliberate thematic reprise, penalty waived. No figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of planetary magnetism, lunar navigation, and basalt geology into a practical escape tool feels fresh yet inevitable. “Patient revolution” trope is inverted—slowness is not moral virtue but tactical superiority forged in prior defeat. Specificity of the moon-path/magnetic interference window is non-portable: this escape could not occur in any other setting. Risk in quiet, anti-thriller pacing pays off via closure image that reconfigures meaning without explosive payoff.</comment>
