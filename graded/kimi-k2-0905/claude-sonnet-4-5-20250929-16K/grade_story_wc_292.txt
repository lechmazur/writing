<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s inherited mission is clear, but her interiority stays general; “generations of inherited frustration” is told, not embodied. The copper nail momentarily externalizes resolve, yet no contradictory impulse or micro-choice undercuts her, so pressure never tests her idealism. Dr. Yoon’s shift from fatalism to collaboration is credible because the formulae visibly pierce his apathy, giving the beat sufficient cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: decoded poems → nail → correction factor → decision to publish through poetry. Closure is a Decisive Change— they commit to dissemination—paid for by Yoon’s renewed risk of reprisal and Mira’s exposure. The single transition up the spiral stairs is seamless, orientation is locked before word 120, and no information teleports.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Station, storm, and nail are rendered with tactile specificity; the copper’s patina under the scope is the micro-setting that literally carries the world-saving math. Rain from the “wrong direction” keeps climate stakes sensory. Spatial choreography is clean; only the cliff’s exact relation to the landing zone remains generic, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem Voss’s science before more ships die—surfaces early and tightens when the etched factor proves publishable. Agency sits with Mira’s push and Yoon’s risky yes; option set narrows from “stay exiled and silent” to “covert publication with personal peril.” Cost is legible: professional ruin, possible arrest. One meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—legacy, silenced women in science, knowledge smuggled through art—emerges via the nail-to-verse trajectory without sermon. Subtext in Yoon’s trembling hands says more than any manifesto. Final image of “truth through storms” risks slight aphoristic lift but lands because the prior stanzas have earned poetry as vessel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Mira; perceptual signature skews cartographic—“coordinates and warnings,” “pre-shift maritime charts.” Occasional lyric pulse (“sky churned with colors that shouldn’t exist”) fits her archival romanticism. Dialogue is sparse, utilitarian, differentiated by Yoon’s clipped exile cadence versus Mira’s eager archival diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-pressure revelation beat is lean. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Minor filter verbs (“She explained,” “he whispered”) don’t stall momentum. Opening line anchors stakes and place; final line offers resonant cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Jet-stream diaspora and maritime cryptography feel fresh, yet the “exiled scientist on metal tower” setting and “poems hide math” device echo familiar tropes. Specificity of the copper lighthouse nail and the stanza-cipher redeems the blend, producing a synthesis that would break if relocated.</comment>
