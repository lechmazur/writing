<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—trailing spines, retrieving the diary, speaking missing prepositions—each aligning with her linguist identity. Interiority stays concrete: the harmonic shift “like a note in the wrong octave” is felt, not labeled. The final smile and whispered agreement embody earned stasis: she accepts perpetual rescue cycles with visible fatigue. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of 9-band depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mountain’s whispered twelve extinct languages crystallize Mira’s acceptance of endless disturbance, cost felt in her returning to translate again. Causal chain holds—traveler’s tear → diary research → harmonic linguistic bridge → students released. Orientation is swift: “Tuesday…Codex Mountain” anchors who/where inside 40 words. One minor scaffold: “She smiled” paragraph restates rescue philosophy already shown.</comment>

<comment>The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but instrument: shelves flicker between existence and memory, prepositions root in “soil layers of time,” constraining how Mira can speak to free the students. Sensory triangulation—obsidian study, humming spines, coffee still steaming across days—grounds the impossible physics. Cartography of Hours shelf literally flickers, charging the final image of unheard symphony. Micro-setting (botanical diary pages) functions as tool-as-setting, handled twice to shape tactics.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“repair the traveler’s temporal tear before students are lost forever”—is signaled by paragraph 3. Pressure tightens once: Mira shifts from observation to linguistic intervention, foreclosing the option to simply contain the rift. Cost is legible: traveler forgets again, students return disoriented, Mira resumes endless vigil. No visible resource loss alters later tactics, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern of necessary forgetting: the library teaches only by erasure, rescue succeeds by accepting recurrence. Final whisper in twelve extinct languages reweights the opening “note in the wrong octave” into acceptance of perpetual dissonance. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via diary’s circular etymology and traveler’s hollow eyes. Ambiguity lingers: is forgetting mercy or curse? Complexity embraced without false balance.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s linguist sensorium: she tastes certainty, hears harmonic shifts, speaks “missing prepositions.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“She needed to renegotiate…She began to speak”—then relaxes into longer cadence post-rescue. No head-hopping; traveler’s interior accessed only via Mira’s interpretation of his “hollow with recursion” gaze. Distinct perceptual signature sustained across 800 words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “temporal prepositions—those strange verbal flowers” compresses botany and grammar in one image. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (mountain as symphony, diary as root system). One mixed vehicle: “harmonic shift—like a note in the wrong octave” is immediately anchored to physical sensation, so coherence holds. Final line spaces itself as coda, ear-tested for resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: temporal rift repaired not by tech or magic but by speaking grammar that lacks prepositions—linguist-as-surgeon. Library of unlearned lessons reframes amnesia as pedagogy, turning a trope into thematic engine. Risky structure—rescue succeeds yet problem recurs—earned by early establishment of cyclic mountain logic. Specificity of monk-etched root systems makes abstraction feel lived; no interchangeable parts.</comment>
