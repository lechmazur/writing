<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s grief-quest is credibly embodied—camera clicks, paint-stained fingers, the tremor when she reads Iris’s post-script—yet the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“she understood now, finally”). No second character on stage, so status/relationship crucible is waived; the micro-choice to keep returning is visible and costs sleep & years, but the flaw-to-mistake linkage is static rather than compounding. For 600 words, the endurance stance is proportionate; still, the epiphany feels slightly telegraphed rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dawn-return + palette-filtered photographs → final decoded note. One clean transition from night desk to cliff; orientation anchored by ferry timetable. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—palette inscription reweights every prior sunrise shoot as two-way conversation; cost is the unending commitment to “keep painting with light.” Persistent constraint (ferry only at midnight/dawn) shapes her schedule and tactics; no causal contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Archipelago functions as micro-setting: ferry schedule dictates life, cliff vantage enables photography, triangular islands mirror triangle of palette wells. Fog “pressing like a living thing,” honey-thick sun through scratched yellow pan—tactile, selective, POV-filtered. Palette itself becomes final “place” where secret is found, satisfying the 9+ gate that an object charges the closing image. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: convert absence into translatable presence before grief erodes. Pressure tightens once: empty aureolin pan → final inscription reveals Iris engineered the curriculum all along. Cost is the endless apprenticeship to dawn; option to “move on” is foreclosed. No external antagonist; escalation is accumulative density of sunrises, not causal reversal—sufficient for lyric frame but never risks a higher-stakes test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: light-as-language vs. paint-as-cipher. Final re-pricing converts “absence” from wound to collaborative medium—eloquent without moralizing. Subtext resides in shutter-click, ferry horn, scratched metal—never exposition. Clean avoidance of thesis statements; the closest (“longing could be captured...”) is buried mid-paragraph, not final, so no Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Lush yet disciplined lyric third-person tightly bound to Marina’s perceptual filter: “sky spoke in coded hues.” Rhythm modulates—long clauses for fog, staccato clicks for camera. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Palette note is only italic, not spoken, preserving register. Diction stays within coastal-island vernacular and photographic lexicon; no corporate intrusion. Filter verbs are minimal and justified (“looked like honey”)—pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe. One paraphrase loop: “she would return tomorrow...and the tomorrow after that” −0.2. Otherwise high density: ferry rule + palette mechanic + grief vector in three lines. Metaphors consistent (honey, gauze, amber) and physically coherent. Closure sentence (“small, certain sound”) is uncluttered, letting image resonate. No mixed metaphors at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Familiar missing-lover trope made specific through maritime夜班+ferry constraint and “painting with light” photographic conceit. Risky second-person address inside palette inscription pays off by retroactively vitalizing every prior frame. Synthesis feels inevitable: palette as Rosetta stone, dawn as postal service. No derivative phrasing or stock scene echoes; specificity of aureolin yellow, archipelago triangle, librarian night desk feels idiosyncratic.</comment>
