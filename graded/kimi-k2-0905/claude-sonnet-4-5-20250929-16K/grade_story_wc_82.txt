<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira’s grief is embodied through tactile micro-choices—selecting gems, polishing, folding—yet her interiority occasionally slides into abstract “luminous torment” labels that feel diagnostic rather than lived. The thousand-crane vow supplies motive, but the pivot from paper to dream-gem lanterns is driven by craft insight, not visible internal contradiction; the decision to share the method with islanders arrives as gracious gesture rather than stance forced by pressure. Earned stasis is present—she stays in the garden, pouring tea among the lights—but the cost is implied, not dramatized on her body or voice in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diamond crane’s ignition re-weights every prior lantern, making the daughter’s shadow live in communal light; cost is felt in Mira’s quiet pour, enduring while ascending. Causal chain holds—each polished gem records a dream, each crane accumulates until the thousandth crystallizes the inversion of private grief into shared garden—no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is clean; who/where/when anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating island tea garden, glass basilica, and steam-kettle micro-climate are not postcard backdrop—they constrain action: the basilica’s optical “descends while ascending” mirrors Mira’s paradox and charges the final image when its refracted light ignites the cranes. Tool-as-setting (gem-polishing pavilion) offers tangible workspace that shapes dream-recording mechanics; proximity of chamomile and silver-needle plants keeps scent in sensory rotation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as visitors traverse tiers and cranes sway on threads.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into bearable form—signaled in paragraph 2; escalation is accretive, each lantern tightening the density of recorded dreams until the thousandth crane crystallizes the communal shift. No external antagonist; pressure is internal/time-based (thousand-crane vow) and visibly costs Mira’s nights of polishing/folding. The final illumination is not luck but the logical cumulation of her craft; options are reweighted when private grief becomes public garden she must maintain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of fragility—paper and dreams—into resilient light; no moral is stated. The basilica’s paradox and the “descends while ascending” motif reprice grief as a perpetual duality rather than problem to solve. Final image of Mira pouring tea among the lanterns offers quiet conceptual repricing: grief is not vanquished, it is housed. Subtext in communal adoption of craft suggests healing is social labor, yet this remains implication, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter—gem surface under thumb, scent of steam, refracted mockery of dawn—without head-hop. Syntax grows clipped during polishing beats, lengthens during reflective passages, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction evaluated through interior diction: “crafty, more true” reads as her self-address, not narrator intrusion. Register holds steady, no academic drift; filter verbs serve voice, not dilution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; short percussive sentences during gem work, longer lyrical curls for optical phenomena. Metaphors are grounded—basilica “frozen music,” cranes “between memory and lantern”—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “descended while ascending” recurs four times; because it is taught as optical rule and repriced at closure, drift is minimal. Information density high; each sentence layers craft step with emotional charge. No typos, pronoun clarity clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing origami cranes with dream-recording gems feels inevitable yet fresh; no genre template matches. The basilica’s paradoxical motion is not gimmick—it supplies the story’s central metaphor for grief’s stasis-in-motion. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in luminous final image. Specificity of chamomile scent, moonstone opacity, and diamond imperfections keeps world from drifting into generic floating-isle fantasy.</comment>
