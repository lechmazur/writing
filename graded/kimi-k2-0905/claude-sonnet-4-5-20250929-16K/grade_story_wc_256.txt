<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Karim’s shift from detached curator to invested co-creator is embodied in micro-choices (nodding against judgment, staying up all night). The bell ringer’s “powerfully gentle” trait is shown—fingers dancing on unfamiliar gear, shoulder touch that crystallizes alliance—never labeled in interior monologue. Interior contradiction surfaces when Karim whispers “What are you doing?” even as she surrenders controls: curiosity wars with grief. Their joint renunciation of “perfect destinations” costs her the safety of scientific detachment, felt when the lab “finally hums with purpose” under dawn light.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the corrupted sounds are re-valued into testimony, not loss. Causal linkage holds throughout: because the grid stabilizes, the stranger arrives; because Karim stays open, the lens refracts loss into geography; because they co-build, the lab’s purpose is reborn. The miner's lens recurs with rising stakes—first a wrapped relic, then a metronome for layering, finally a golden projector of new meaning. Cost is visible in the predawn exhaustion and the irrevocable pivot from therapy to testimony.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Acoustic-reconstruction table, carbide lens, and dawn-lit monitors function as micro-setting that constrains action: only this lab could refract corrupted data into pilgrimage routes. The lens’s golden shadows dance across walls, charging the final image when Karim sees “landscapes that existed only in memory” yet feel real. Spatial choreography stays clean: stranger enters, places lens, claims controls; Karim stays seated until she stands to collaborate. Sensory selection narrows to sight and sound—no smell or temperature—mirroring the auditory premise.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can lost sounds become connective tissue? Pressure tightens once: from worthless noise to usable map. The decisive turn is Karim’s invitation “Help me rebuild this,” which forecloses the path of starting over. Cost is the irrevocable pivot from clinical therapy to vulnerable testimony, felt in the dawn-hour fatigue and the bell ringer’s earlier exile from the gardens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: absence can be re-inhabited rather than erased. Subtext lives in gesture—lens placement, shoulder touch, dawn light—never in exposition. Final image reweights the premise: pilgrimage is not travel to a place but attendance to what’s missing. No moral is offered; the resonance is the audible hum of a lab that now testifies instead of cures.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Karim, perceptual signature filtered through acoustic metaphors: she “mourns” data, hears “echo,” feels the lab “hum.” Voice modulates from skeptical curtness (“We’re closed”) to wonder-filled brevity (“What are you doing?”). No head-hopping; bell ringer’s interior remains opaque, revealed only through graceful action. Rhythm accelerates across long sentences during synthesis, then contracts into the quiet final line.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful—“golden shadows,” “texture of connection”—never clustering to obscure causality. High information density: one sentence layers lens, silk, arrival timing, and stakes. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; props stay tracked.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise flips corruption from flaw to feature—fresh angle on data-loss trope. Bell ringer’s occupation (extinct bell ringer) is specific, not archetype. Transformation test fails if lens becomes generic lamp; here its refraction is irreplicable. Risk: quiet ending with no physical confrontation, yet Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly.</comment>
