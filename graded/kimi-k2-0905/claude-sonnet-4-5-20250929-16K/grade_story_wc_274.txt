<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is evocative—guilt, filial piety, archival obsession braid believably—but the “activation core” appears as a pocketed talisman rather than a tool earned or fought for, muting the sense of flaw-driven mistake. Her contradictory fear/need is declared (“bravely conflicted”) more than dramatized in mid-action; we’re told she trembles but see no fumbling mis-choice that would cost her before the climax. The final decision crystallizes legacy pressure, yet the beat lands lightly because earlier micro-choices never backfire, so renunciation feels pre-ordained, not hard-won.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain: meteor-letter → recognition → network discovery → activation is lucid, escalating both risk and possibility. Closure is cleanly on-page (“She pressed transmit”), a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the Authority’s reality will shatter. Orientation is swift; broken-dome snow is cinematic by line 3, anchoring who/where. One soft spot: the core’s prior seventeen-year inert carry never poses a prior test; inserting it now feels convenient rather than earned, nudging credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Snow fell perpetually through the broken dome overhead” immediately bodies the library in a single, memorable image. Cold is not backdrop—it disables retrieval tech, mandates gloves, shapes Kael’s hush-breath urgency. Shelves of crystallized data cores act as both vault and latent weapon, charging the final transmission. Spatial choreography stays clean: hand-to-vault-to-terminal path is trackable; only the “echoing” descriptor is slightly over-milked across four mentions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release versus protect forbidden histories—announced with the first glimpse of contraband seal. Pressure tightens once Kael realizes networks still live; options narrow to transmit or betray her mother’s sacrifice. Cost is implied rather than dramatized (no Authority guard appears; job loss or execution remain hypothetical), so escalation feels intellectual, not visceral. Still, the final beat makes the trade-off legible: silence is foreclosed, global chaos invited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as moral duty emerges through ice→data→light imagery without authorial sermon. Subtext thrives in gestures: palm on vault feels like a palm on a coffin lid, reconfiguring archive from tomb to seed. Final image of “blood returning to sleeping limbs” re-prices dormancy as agency, tying personal and civic awakening. No tidy moral—only the unveiled cost of breaking silence—keeps resonance ambiguous yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings tightly to Kael’s perceptual filter: frost patterns as text, snow-muffled acoustics, throb of ice under skin. Syntax lengthens in cold calm, then fragments into “She pressed transmit,” mirroring neural spark. No dialogue, so voice purity is high; only minor filter-verb clusters (“She felt,” “She understood”) dull immediety. Overall, a crisp, atmospheric signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Most sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere); momentum breathes well. But “dizzying quiet” recurs four times, sliding toward mantra; “echoing library” appears thrice without fresh angle. Metaphor stack in one clause (“glacial tombs,” “crystallized data cores,” “frozen conscience”) risks purple bruise. These loops don’t obscure causality but dull the final third’s freshness, capping ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Information-Purge ice-library is a fresh crucible; linking maternal handwriting to frost-cipher feels non-obvious and specific. Dormant cold-data networks convert setting into insurgent infrastructure—an inventive synthesis. Yet the revolutionary climax replays familiar “upload truth to world” beats; the core as pocketed MacGuffin leans generic. Still, local details (snow through broken dome, frost as code) particularize the template enough to feel memorable.</comment>
