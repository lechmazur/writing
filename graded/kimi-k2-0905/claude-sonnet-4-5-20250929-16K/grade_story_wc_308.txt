<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skimmer’s centuries-long stillness is dramatized through micro-choices—waiting, listening, humming—that externalize her discipline; the contradiction between ossified body and roaming consciousness is embodied every paragraph. The hunter-pulse’s shift from frantic loop to spacious wandering is shown, not labeled, and the final quiet arrowhead proves the cost of her teaching. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the table, so the arc is strictly interior, yet it earns its renunciation-stasis. Interiority stays concrete—“she felt something else: a pulse left wandering”—avoiding diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: density of echo imagery increases until the final “eternal song” reweights stillness as victory. Closure is a Charged Poise—the arrowhead’s new quiet reconfigures the canyon’s sound-map and confirms the skimmer’s lifelong premise with felt cost: she remains frozen, now sharing the vastness she once occupied alone. Causality is coherent: arrowhead arrival → pattern read in birds → harmonic hum → pulse released. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by sentence three.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers, dust layers, and perpetual echo are not backdrop but tactical instruments—she uses their resonance to perform the rescue. The arrowhead’s flint and the birds’ wings are micro-settings that constrain method; remove either and the appraisal fails. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound: sound first, touch implied, vision last. Final image—“dust settling fresh upon her shoulders”—crystallizes setting and stance simultaneously.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the skimmer free the pulse without moving? Escalation occurs when the birds’ scatter-and-regroup pattern sharpens the hunter’s unfinished chase, tightening her task from passive reception to active teaching. Cost is legible: she gains a companion but forfeits solitude—dust freshly settling implies eternal continuation of her stasis. Agency is attention-based; no physical act, yet the harmonic hum is an irreversible intervention.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—stillness as motion—emerges through echo imagery rather than assertion; no moralizing sentence appears. Subtextual ache: the hunter’s inability to stop chasing mirrors living cultures that became bone towers, hinting history is a loop until taught new resonance. Final image reweights earlier “endless echoes” into shared song rather than solitary prison. Ambiguity lingers: is this transcendence or deeper entombment?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays tightly filtered through the skimmer’s auditory bias; no head-hop. Syntax grows longer and more sonorous under emotional pressure—“she showed it what she had learned through centuries”—mirroring expanding resonance. Lexicon stays within her experiential range: harmonic, frequency, flint, echo. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Compression in “she waited with weathered resolve” is strategic, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm mimics canyon reverb: periodic enjambed clauses that fold back on themselves. Information density high—“coating itself in the dust of countless seasons” compresses time and material change in one verb phrase. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay sonic or mineral. One paraphrase loop mid-story echoes the pulse’s circularity and is pattern-taught, hence waived. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses geomythic landscape with psycho-acoustic rescue; not a stock ghost story. The innovation: consciousness as sonic pattern transferable through flint and birds. Transformation test fails if canyon and echo mechanics removed—core is inseparable from setting. Risk—static protagonist—becomes the thematic engine rather than bug. Specificity: “folded into itself like prayers spoken in rounds” freshens both acoustics and religiosity without ornament.</comment>
