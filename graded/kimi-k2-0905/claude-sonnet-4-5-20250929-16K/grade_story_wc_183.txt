<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Isla’s interiority is vivid—her grip on the emerald card, the shifting memory of the twins’ ages—yet her motivations stay abstract: “recapture what she’d lost” never converts into a concrete micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The final surrender is lyrically rendered but causally abrupt; we see no prior beat where she actively rejects an alternative path. Still, her perceptual signature (scientist’s precision colliding with ontological vertigo) remains consistent and compelling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden rewrites her name-tags, making identity negotiable at undeniable cost—she drops the card, forfeiting singular self. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog thickens, memories rewrite, carousel horses accrue menace until the final image reweights reality. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by word 60, well under the 120-word threshold. The only causality hiccup is the leap from “telling tales” to literal portal—nevertheless, the pattern of narrative-as-method is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the emerald card’s exact green becomes the garden’s key, fusing object and environment into one constraint. Fog is not backdrop but pressure—breathing “wool,” canceling distance, forcing circular walks. Carousel horses mid-gallop provide a frozen-motion image that charges the final living flowers. Spatial choreography stays clean; the ship’s deck never dissolves into white-room vagueness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the twins’ teaching before memory erases it—is signaled early and tightens as each retelling fails. Escalation is textural: fog thickens, twins age/regress, card glows brighter, foreclosing the option to leave. No visible price is paid (no injury, forfeited tool, or social loss), so the climb into 8-band is blocked, but the accrual of ontological pressure is legible and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as permeable chimera, solace found in surrender to flux. Subtext lives in gesture—dropping the card is wordless assent to self-dissolution. No moralizing; the garden’s final nametags silently reweight the premise. The emotional aftereffect lingers: reader feels the vertigo of owning every version of oneself at once.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is scientist-poet: precise diction (“cellular identities,” “ontological”) yet lyric cadence (“breathing wool,” “unkindled solace”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments under shock. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct: “fog pressed close, a presence rather than an absence.” Experimental compression (“trapped freedom,” “blissfully aberrant”) is taught early and paid off in final surrender.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable; figurative language is selective, never floods a single beat. Occasional elevated register (“negotiable, permeable, blissfully aberrant”) risks template cadence, yet the pattern is voice-motivated and consistent. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds texture or knowledge. Final line—“she was the discovered”—nails the cadence shift required for closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: genetic chimera + memory erosion + narrative-as-key converts stock amnesia trope into ontological heist. Risky second-person imperative (“Tell it differently”) is earned by prior metafictional setup. Garden of name-tagged flowers is specific to this tale; remove it and the closure collapses. Emotional specificity—scientist mourning the loss of singular self—grounds the conceptual flourish.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: identified as twins’ discoverer by line 3. Development: her retellings are attempts to re-access their teaching, shaping middle beats. Closure: she becomes the discovered—name-tags bear her identity—so the role flips with cost. Meets all three gates; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Handled in opening, mid-walk, and final drop; color literalizes the garden portal. Irreplaceable: no other object could serve as both key and constant. Glow intensifies under fog pressure, altering her forward move. Cost: surrendering the card = surrendering singular self.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Concept named early, revisited via fog’s comfort that never warms. Shapes stakes: she accepts non-warm solace by embracing merged identity. Moderate causal pressure; not a tactical tool but an emotional frame that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Trait labels the twins initially; Isla later embraces it by stepping into the garden. Enables final action—dissolving borders—but lacks visible price prior to that moment. Functional across two beats, not three.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Every retelling is a recapture attempt; fog responds, tightening the loop. Final success is release, not capture—redefining the term. Drives multiple beats; could not be swapped for “search” without breaking causal arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>“Tell it differently” directive signals method; each story-thread is a key-turn. Mechanics matter: the garden only opens after enough variants are tested. Closure linkage: narrative threads literally unlock the portal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Fog constrains movement to circular deck; carousel horses supply frozen-motion metaphor for stalled identity. Micro-setting charges final image when living flowers replace wooden steeds. Spatial pressure shapes her decision to step off the ship.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Memory shifts (twins’ ages, card origin) create micro-clock: each morning reality re-sets. Time is not cumulative but iterative, tightening the need to act before self erases. Affects tactics: she accelerates storytelling as recall fragments.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Desire dramatized through repeated tellings and forward steps into thicker fog. Conflict: want to hold singular self vs need to surrender to multiplicity. Cost visible when she drops the card—forecloses return to old identity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Tone established in opening: ship offers infinite walking yet no arrival. Modulates: wonder → vertigo → surrender. Charges final image: stepping into garden is both imprisonment and liberation, capturing trapped freedom in crystallized stance.</comment>
