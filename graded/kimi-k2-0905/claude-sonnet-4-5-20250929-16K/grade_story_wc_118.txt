<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian’s interiority is poetically rendered—“listening to walls,” “archive of echo”—but remains observational; no micro-choice visibly alters her course or costs her anything. The remembered Caroline functions as a secondary pressure source, yet the historian’s stance stays static: she merely transcribes, never risks. The final act of copying is too gentle to register as a renunciation with on-page cost; the emotional price is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the historian’s ledger crystallizes the “bronze quiet” aftermath, reweighting human absence as archival duty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each artifact layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in the phrase “amber suspension of aftermath,” yet the story stops short of showing how this cost constrains her next breath; the price is conceptual, not tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The silo library is rendered with tactile specificity—“rust patterns like ancient script,” “spirals against its wall”—and the tilted axis subtly guides spatial perception throughout. The tapestry fragment returns to charge the final image, its dragons seeming to writhe in peripheral vision, mirroring the world’s off-kilter spin. Environment and micro-object together constrain the historian’s posture of listening, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving human resonance—arrives early but stays abstract; pressure accumulates through density of artifacts rather than narrowing options. The tightening is lyrical, not tactical: the historian never faces a fork where preservation costs her safety, time, or hope. Escalation is atmospheric; cost is cosmic, not personal, keeping the score just below the 7.0 threshold for visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory as the last gravity in a world whose axis has cracked. The dragons’ spiral and the diary’s burnt edges echo this tilt without sermon. The final image—“amber suspension of aftermath”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: history is fossilized motion, endlessly weighed but never resolved. Complexity lingers; no moral is stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose carries a distinct, antiquarian cadence—“cylindrical tomb of abandoned books,” “amber suspension”—that feels owned by the historian’s archivist sensibility. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mimic the spiral shelves, then tighten into single-line verdicts. No dialogue appears; narrative voice stays consistently elevated without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong: rust as script, tapestry dragons as living periphery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty—e.g., “enough remained… dreams began to fail” compresses exposition into sensory ash. Occasional elevated diction (“torqued reality,” “conceptual spindle”) risks register excess yet remains within the historian’s erudite ken. One paraphrase loop—“silence that followed noise… bronze quiet”—is minor. Closure line is clean, no artifact touches it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “displaced axis” as cause of dream-death is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mythic and cosmological stakes. Medieval tapestry plus post-apocalyptic silo feels inevitable in hindsight, not stitched. Risk lies in the lyric-accumulative structure itself; it pays off through final reconfiguration rather than plot twist. Specificity of burnt diary texture and dragon weave keeps the premise from drifting into abstraction.</comment>
