<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Layla’s embodied freeze–thaw cycle is persuasive: the lavender cutting set-down and palm-flat-against-glass micro-choice anchor her survival calculus. The photograph handled twice provides externalized contradiction without slipping into label-speak. Yet the interiority edges toward therapeutic summary (“the body keeps score”) and the renunciation is more atmospheric than tactically paid; the cost is felt but not foreclosed with visible consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pearl of stillness crystallizes while the automated light sweeps “emptily,” repricing her endurance with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each lavender cutting, each freeze counted in waves, accretes until the final breath-echo. The lighthouse keeper obsolescence motif is seeded early and paid off in the empty sweep, tightening the frame. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors arrive by line 4 and remain legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass conservatory wall, potting bench soil under nails, and salt-wind-scented rosemary function as micro-setting that constrains her propagation choices. The automated beacon’s mechanical sweep contrasts vegetal persistence, recharging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys her gardener gaze—texture of crumpled photo soft as cloth, lavender stems “delicate,” soil moisture checked by finger. Spatial choreography is clean: potting bench → glass wall → cliff edge and back, no impossible moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she stay present for the incoming children without shattering—is signaled early and tightened by the helicopter pass that forces the palm-flat ritual. Agency is renunciatory: she endures the somatic spike, re-anchors, returns to cuttings; the cost is breath and time, visible on page. No reversal beyond the micro-turn of freeze-to-thaw, but within 750 words one meaningful deepening suffices. Coincidence (coast-guard copter) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of persistence versus automated emptiness emerges from the lighthouse-to-solar-panel obsolescence and the living arboretum that still needs human touch. The pearl image reweights at closure: stillness is not healing but layered accretion of continued breaths. Subtext lingers in the empty sweep of light across water—technology moves on, grief remains manual. No moralizing; the final “enough” refuses tidy uplift while still granting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains a horticultural perceptual signature—every noticed detail is growth, soil, scent, salt impact on leaves. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in calm, staccato fragments (“Sweat prickled her neck. The potting soil blurred.”) under helicopter surge. No head-hopping; distance stays close to Layla’s physiology. Lexicon stays within gardener register; “propagating lavender from cuttings” sounds like her expertise, not authorial showing-off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is natural; paragraph cuts are purposeful—each advances knowledge or emotional charge. Figurative language is spare and coherent: photo “soft as cloth,” stillness as “pearl,” no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “She could plant... She could teach... She could stand...” but the anaphora reads as deliberate prayer-list and recurs at closure, earning its repetition. No artifacts in final third; information density high—one sentence often performs setting, character, and thematic resonance simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-to-arboretum leap refreshes the familiar trauma-garden trope by yoking obsolescence of human caretakers to vegetal persistence. Freeze-thaw as pearl-layering offers non-obvious metaphor for PTSD management without clinical jargon. Risk is quiet—no plot twist, only accreted breath—but coherence remains. Could swap Mediterranean herbs for another coastal flora without breaking armature, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
