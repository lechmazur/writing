<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—need to atone vs. dawning acceptance—threads every beat; the flute’s weight “comfort and accusation” embodies it. Micro-choices (mapping, uncasing, playing) tighten because/therefore chains. Earned endurance at the end forecloses restoration path with visible cost: “she would return…harvest these moments…until the flute gave out.” Mentor loss, ward loss, and relic decay are felt in body, not label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shimmer reveals entropy, not culpability, reweighting her guilt into witness. Causal lens holds throughout—flute degradation drives the final image; driftwood markers and canyon acoustics are set up, used, paid off. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no teleports. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “witnessing that passage without looking away.”</comment>

<comment>Thunder-echo range is not backdrop but active constraint: silence pools that “dissipate” sound dictate the threshold’s location and the flute’s test. Canyon wall under her palm, weighted case, and amphitheater of silence charge the final image. Driftwood markers integrate body, tool, and terrain; no white-room syndrome. Spatial choreography clean—left-hand passage, three-walled heart—all tracked.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she reopen the lost world—tightens when flute note stretches instead of echoing, narrowing options to witness only. Agency drives escalation: her decision to keep playing after seeing the shimmer crystallizes the shift from rescue to documentation. Cost is visible: “the gilded flute itself was fading.” One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular: driftwood born on ocean now points to silence—endings as natural redistribution. Final image reweights failure into elegy without moralizing. “Graceful collapse” is never named aloud; enacted via canyon hush and reed decay. Conceptual cost—guardianship replaced by witness—lands as felt aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mira’s perceptual filter: “silence here accumulated weight, pressing down like snowpack before the break.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath of flute passage; diction rooted in her lexicon—avalanchingly, threshold, gossamer. No filter-verb stacks. Dialogue absent; voice remains coherent, modulated under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene—long sentences for silence compression, staccato for marker spotting. No scaffold or synonym loops; “she’d…she’d…” repetition is purposeful ellipsis signaling obsession. Metaphors (snowpack, bridge) stay physically coherent. Information density high—“ocean-smoothed pieces she’d gathered from the distant coast” does triple world/character/backdrop duty. Closure line crisp, unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of acoustic canyon with inter-world portal feels fresh; driftwood as signposts to silence pockets is specific synthesis. Guardianship post-mortem via entropy rather than error avoids redemption arc cliché. Final reconfiguration—failure transmuted to witnessing—grows inevitable from reeds’ triple-reality decay. Risk of quiet ending paid off by charged poise.</comment>
