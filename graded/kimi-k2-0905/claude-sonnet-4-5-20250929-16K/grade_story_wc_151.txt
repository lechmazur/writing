<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is consistently concrete—tracing chalk, folding the letter to a thumbnail square—yet her contradictions (digital implant vs. analog faith) stay summarized, not dramatized. The clipboard lineage and “digital suicide” want hint at deeper flaws, but the 800-word scope keeps them gestural; we see no micro-choice where her resolve actually wobbles. Still, her tactile rituals and final moment of “writing tomorrow’s codes” earn a credible renunciation with felt cost. Characterization is strong for length, but the absence of a live opposing force keeps relationships from becoming crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (stained glass, chalk dust, graphite vanishing under scan) thickens the stake—analog persistence in a digitized world—until the final sweep of boot across chalk crystallizes the cost. Causality is implied ellipses rather than explicit “because,” but the pattern is taught early and lands in a Charged Poise. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (clipboard’s vanish-ink) shapes tactics and the final image reweights meaning without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The golden arcade is not backdrop; its stained-glass satellites and dormant projectors supply both resource (secrecy at dawn) and metaphoric pressure (obsolete infrastructure). The clipboard functions as micro-setting—its graphite-invisible surface literally constrains the transfer of identities. Sensory selection is urgent: dawn light, boot smear, thumb-folded paper—each detail is handled, not catalogued. The final image of “marks that would last just long enough” recharges the arcade’s transient ownership, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving analog identity channels—tightens once: from decoding chalk to committing new names before courier arrival. Agency is renunciation: Maya smears the code, accepts perpetuation of erasure. Cost is visible: the chalk’s destruction + her graphite traces that will fade. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening pattern (each analog artifact is more fragile) reweights the stake; no reversal is needed. The climb toward 8.8 is barred because the cost, while felt, is not yet personal—Maya risks no imminent capture or loss in this beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “meaning exists in margins” is never stated—only enacted via chalk, thumb-fold letter, vanishing graphite. The stained-glass satellites and obsolete projectors quietly reprice the digital future as spiritually empty. Final image of ephemeral graphite reconfigures the premise: resistance is measured in hours, not history. No moralizing, no echo—just particularized loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual filter—numbers become “rabbit, moon,” courier’s footsteps “carry conspiracy.” Syntax flexes with pressure—“She pressed her graphite harder”—shortening as dawn expires. No dialogue until final exchange, and it carries subtext: “Anything today?” = entire counter-network status check. Voice is lyrical yet precise, no head-hop, no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long sensorial sentences at calm dawn, then clipped beats as courier approaches. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances either setting, character, or stakes. Figurative language is sparse but grounded—“messages in bottles traversing an ocean” fits world logic. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line recharges earlier motif of vanishing marks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia (digital omninode vs. analog resistance) is refreshed through postal nostalgia and childhood sidewalk code—specific, lived, not trope checklist. The clipboard’s anti-scan graphite property feels inevitable yet new. Risk taken: quiet accumulative structure instead of thriller beats; payoff is conceptual reprice rather than rescue set-piece. Synthesis exceeds premise familiarity.</comment>
