<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marina’s quietly-driven trait is shown through night-long painting, not label, and her micro-choice to paint the glass directly (not the cathedral wall) crystallizes her arc with cost. The contradiction between public muralist identity and need for private, moon-soft witness is felt, not stated. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses daylight approval and accepts that her art will blaze only at dawn/dusk. No second character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; headcount stays within limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seasonal light-density and postcard pattern tighten until the rose-window etchings reweight the premise. Closure is Charged Poise—the pavilion panels now carry a living double-image whose cost is the permanent loss of noon-time brilliance. Orientation anchors who/where/when within first 100 words; no penalty. Causality intact: because she traces the hidden etchings, therefore she repaints her own medium. Cost is legible in the final image of “soft shadows holding their own luminescence.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion glass functions as micro-setting: its shifting spectral angles literally constrain where and when her mural can be seen, charging the final image. Autumn light is not tourist décor but tactical—only slant-light reveals the cathedral’s secret garden. Spatial choreography clean: stairs climb, platform perch, finger trace all track. Weather and season evolve causally from February frost to October honey-light, mirroring her internal quieting. 9+ gate missed only because environment does not foreclose a live option at the climax; it illuminates, not blocks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answer grandmother’s question or fail the residency—signaled early. Tightening occurs at twilight when hidden etchings flip her premise: flowers don’t await darkness from weakness but from preference. This narrows her options to painting for slanted light only, a visible trade-off. Cost is the forfeiture of mass daylight visibility—felt on page. Agency is contemplative (tracing, painting) rather than explosive, fitting Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “waiting for darkness” rather than explicit tag; final image reweights prior postcards without moral. Subtext lives in gesture—painting on glass is a literal refusal to “bloom” under full sun. Ambiguity is preserved: reader may read flowers/artist as equally choosy. No final-paragraph thesis, no echo of prompt language. Minor nudge down because theme is relatively single-note; complexity is atmospheric rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Marina’s perceptual filter: she “notices,” “traces,” “understands,” never exceeds her knowledge. Syntax grows shorter under nocturnal intensity (“She painted moonflowers…”) mirroring her narrowed focus. No head-hopping; cathedral interior described only as she climbs. Diction (“honeyed pools,” “umbral tenderness”) remains within artistic lexicon without purple drift. No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on internal voice coherence—sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long-hyphenated sentences for slanting light, clipped fragments for night work. Information density high—each sentence layers pigment, season, and emotional tilt. No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase risk—“honeyed pools” echoed by “honey-light”—but spaced enough to read as motif return, not loop. Prose propels to final image without overwriting. Meets 9+ quick test save for single near-repeat; capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fusion of night-bloom botany + stained-glass discovery feels fresh; postcard inheritance trope is familiar but re-energized by hidden cathedral etchings. Risk of preciousness avoided because revelation is tactile—fingertip on engraved glass. Final mural on pavilion panels rather than cathedral wall offers specific, irreversible twist. Not 8.5+ because premise-combination, while elegant, is incremental rather than paradigm-shifting.</comment>
