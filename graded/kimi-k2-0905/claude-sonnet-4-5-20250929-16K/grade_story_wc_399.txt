<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s calm, self-sacrificing resolve feels consistent and specific; her “strangely honest” stance and half-mask as void-touched mark her without cliché. Interiority stays concrete—she weighs the cost of consecration through bodily sensation and stone rhythm. The decisive renunciation is foreshadowed early and paid in the final breath, giving her arc visible cost. Flaw: the prophet is a static oracle, exerting pressure but revealing no interior contradiction to mirror Maya’s own.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: prophet arrives → Maya demonstrates parapet language → consecration offered → sacrifice accepted. Orientation is swift—place, time, and stakes anchored by line 45. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Maya’s consciousness fuses into stone, foreclosing her future; cost is legible in “part of me will have to remain here.” Micro-turn inside the scene tightens when the prophet confirms sacrifice is required, narrowing choices cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Desert-pavilion-stone network is sensuously particular: silk walls translating wind into “hushed conversations,” stones breathing underfoot, dunes singing low frequencies. Selection obeys Maya’s trained attention—she never catalogues, she reads. The kinetic parapet evolves from backdrop to collaborative partner, constraining her footfalls and ultimately ingesting her, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp: prophet sits, Maya circles, stones rise—no geographical drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving walker knowledge—faces a single, irreversible cost: personal erasure into stone. Escalation is steady: first the echo is declared fading, then consecration is shown, finally the sacrifice is exacted. Agency remains with Maya; she initiates the demonstration and consents. Cost is visible and conceptually weighty, though emotional punch is slightly muted because the prophet’s stake is abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory preserved through embodied sacrifice—emerges via ritual action, not statement. Subtext operates in tactile metaphors: mask = partial void, stone = archive, sand = forgetting. Final image of “echo of wisdom” living between footsteps offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No overt thesis or closing sermon; the story trusts the consecration to speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hug Maya tightly; perceptual signature is vivid—“peripheral awareness,” “soles of their boots,” “sand thinks.” Syntax flexes from lyrical to spare when stakes sharpen, mirroring her narrowing focus. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Diction stays within her desert-reader lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace—long cadences for dunes, clipped fragments as stones pulse. Figurative language is selective: two metaphors (dunes singing, silk murmuring) frame tone without clutter. No synonym loops or template cadence detected; sentences advance at least two jobs (texture + motive). High information density keeps 740 words feeling spacious yet taut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geomantic tech with mystic archive feels fresh; “conjured clearings” reframe knowledge as spatial act is inventive. Premise twist—walker becomes the archive—escapes sacrificial cliché by embedding it in tactile stone grammar. Risk lies in quiet ending; coherence is maintained, but emotional jolt could be bolder. Still, specificity of desert grammar prevents swap-out test failure.</comment>
