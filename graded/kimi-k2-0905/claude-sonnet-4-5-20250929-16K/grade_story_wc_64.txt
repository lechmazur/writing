<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s quiet caretaker persona is credibly inhabited—her humming at the gate, the tender shelving of records, the decision to plant Helena’s rose all flow from a consistent interior stance. The only flaw: the climactic interior beat (“the uncharted echoes weren’t sounds but the reverberations of a love…”) drifts into diagnostic-speak, blunting embodied cost; a −0.4 there keeps her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s resolve to plant the rose reweights every prior caretaker act into witness-bearing, and the cost (accepting lifelong stewardship of a stranger’s grief) is palpable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—stars, silo, tapestry threads accrue until the border cipher snaps the pattern—and the final image crystallizes options without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment and object constrain choice: the silo’s curved ceiling funnels starlight onto the workbench, forcing Mira to read by it; floorboards respond under finger pressure, cueing the hidden box. The cobalt metallic surface drinking starlight becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image when Mira carries the letters out into that same starlight—an irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the dead be faithfully tended—tightens once: the tapestry cipher forecloses the option that Castellan was merely eccentric, replacing it with the obligation to bear witness. Cost is visible on-page: Mira’s all-night labor, the ache in her knees, the decision to graft a living rose onto the grave—agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: caretaking as resistance to erasure. The rose image at the end offers Conceptual Repricing—love’s truth measured not by marriage but by lifelong refusal to forget. Subtext in the letters (social class cruelty) refracts through Mira’s micro-choice, creating lingering irony about who gets memorialized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s sensory funnel: “cobalt surface drinking starlight” is perception-specific; no filter-verb clusters. Syntax lengthens during untangling, then fractures into short clauses as cipher emerges—rhythmic control mirrors cognitive load without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“velveteen gloom settling like moth wings”—survives because it is taught early and reappears in the final line, paying off. Information density high; each sentence advances caretaker ethos or cipher mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cemetery caretaker + textile cryptography. The “treat loose tapestry threads as cipher” is non-obvious yet inevitable once floorboards yield love-letters. Risk taken with quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist, and it heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
