<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s claustrophobia is vividly embodied (“breathing through the tight bands”) and directly complicates her descent; the micro-choice to kneel and press stone while panic screams is credible. The interior contradiction—fear versus the need to stay—drives every beat. The “wistful rebellion” close is earned because her endurance has visibly cost her (shaking legs, gasping). No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; headcount stays clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the key’s retrieval reweights space itself and her own limits, cost paid in the snap-back collapse and trembling exit. Causal chain holds: organ tone → corridor contraction → compass indication → spiral trace → dissolution → key. Orientation anchored by word 40 (starlight, nexus, five corridors). No lens ambiguity; accumulative/textural pattern taught early (starlight silver rain, breathing walls) and held to final starlight line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The nexus is tactile, not postcard: “walls breathing inward,” stone cold & thrumming, starlight pouring like silver rain. Micro-setting rule met: the compass and flagstones function as handled environment that literally reshape under her palm. Spatial choreography is crystal—five corridors, shrinking entrance, impossible depth—all tracked without drift. The final image of starlight following her out recharges the opening motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the lost key—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the corridor visibly contracts, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accumulative: each organ note narrows physical space and widens dimensional possibility, price felt in rising panic. Agency remains hers: she kneels, traces, reaches through void. Cost is on-page: collapse, gasping, shaking legs. One meaningful tightening suffices; no false coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “space itself revolts” reframed as liberation for the claustrophobic. Subtext in the organ’s lonely defiance mirrors Mara’s own. No final moralizing; last line starlight following her out reweights earlier silver rain into quiet triumph. Ambiguity lingers—she now possesses a tool for further trespass, cost not yet paid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyric, consistent: “origami nightmares,” “silver rain,” “starlit void” stay within adventurer-scholar lexicon. Perceptual signature—measurements that shouldn’t exist, impossible geometries—colors every observation. Rhythm accelerates under pressure (fragments like “Reality snapped back”) then exhales at close. No dialogue, hence no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density: “compass point trembling in her grip” does double duty—object state + emotional leak. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors disciplined: starlight as silver rain taught early, paid off in final line. One mixed moment—“wistful rebellion coursed through her veins” skirts label-speak but is rescued by immediate embodied action (kneeling, pressing stone).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fantasy of dimensional rebellion is familiar, but fusion with claustrophobic protagonist gives fresh inversion: shrinking corridors become ally, not threat. Compass-as-key-finder and organ-as-space-revealer are specific, non-obvious mechanics. Final image of starlight following her out feels inevitable yet unforeseeable. Risky premise fully committed to, not hedged.</comment>
