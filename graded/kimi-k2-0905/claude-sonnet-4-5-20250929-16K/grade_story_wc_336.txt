<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Esme’s gardener-poet interiority is consistent and specific; her patient observation and “subtle craft” credibly ground the cosmic graft. The only flaw is that the final beat registers more as serene completion than as a costly renunciation—her body aches but no path is foreclosed, so the Earned Stasis feels slightly under-charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, color, song) thickens until the seed becomes a palimpsest of worlds. Closure is a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, wonder preserved—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a sharper physical forfeiture would have pushed it to 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The worn-smooth shears, wet stone parapet, and waterfall’s “radiant hush” act as micro-setting that literally steadies the crossing; without their tactile anchoring the braid would collapse. Final image of seed tucked “where reality grew particularly thin” crystallizes the spatial logic—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—save the tree’s wonder—tightens once when Esme threads essences; the narrowing is the act itself, cost her exhausted body. Escalation is quiet but legible; no reversal, yet the accrual of color-song-memory makes the stake feel increasingly fragile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges intact: stewardship of beauty against entropy. Subtext lives in gesture (shears pocketed, seed hidden) rather than statement; final smile reframes the eternal orchard queue as quiet defiance. Avoids moralizing, though the word “wonder” is used twice—borderline echo, not fatal.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Esme’s synesthetic perception; diction (“luminous coral-gold,” “roots and branches cared nothing for boundaries”) is poetically heightened yet consistent with a pruner who privately names sensations. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences during weave, clipped “She stood” at end—precise control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence layers image or stakes. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“radiant hush” taught in paragraph 1) so payoff is earned. No mixed metaphors; “braiding invisible branches” keeps arboreal logic intact. Final line lands on monosyllabic cadence—“The work, as always, continued”—perfect exhale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fantasy of inter-world grafting feels fresh because it is staged as horticulture, not portal quest. Risk—quiet lyric handling of cosmic stakes—pays off. Minor deduction for familiar “last seed” trope, but transformation into essences-collecting praxis rescues it from cliché.</comment>
