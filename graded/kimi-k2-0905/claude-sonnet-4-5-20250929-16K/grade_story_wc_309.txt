<comment>Teryn’s interior contradiction—clinging to “inefficient” hand-drawn sigils while failing algorithmic exams—drives every beat; the moment she unstraps the keystone and feels its accommodating pulse, her choice to climb is already legible. Micro-choices (strapping, unstrapping, palm-press) embody her hierarchy of values and foreclose the Academy path with felt cost. The glow that “remembers” literalizes her flaw and final proof, earning the quiet epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in muscle burn and mist-acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone’s fit crystallizes “lingering luminance” and reweights her self-definition from failed student to keeper-of-wonder; the heartbeat in stone is the visible cost. Causal lens holds throughout—each mist-step and hand-press is therefore-linked to the final accommodation of impossibilities. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Teryn had failed…”) and spatial clarity never wavers. No lens ambiguity; the ending image persists longer than physics allows, making conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Environment (the icebound spire) directly constrains the final action—only the keystone’s exact wedge can seal the apex fracture, making setting a tactical actor, not backdrop. Micro-setting of the folly stone in her hands recurs as charged object, its vine motif mirrored in tower carvings. Sensory hierarchy follows POV: mist accepts weight, ice refracts “brilliant dimness,” stone hums. No static catalogue; every detail is filtered through Teryn’s bias toward beauty-over-efficiency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove that slow, beautiful magic still matters—tightens once: the keystone must reach the spire before efficiency wardens erase the last “impossibility.” Escalation is causal: because she climbs, the spire re-illuminates; because the spire glows, her self-worth is re-priced. Cost is visible—muscle burn, societal erasure, and the Academy’s incoming audit—foreclosing return to old life. No coincidence; mist walking accommodates her need, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges concretely: beauty as non-negotiable sacred resistance to optimization. The keystone’s lingering luminance reconfigures the meaning of “failure” into stewardship of wonder. No final-paragraph thesis; the image of light refusing to forget is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity remains—Academy will come—yet stance is crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Teryn’s perceptual signature: algorithms “flow,” sigils “breathe,” mist “accepts.” No head-hop; diction stays within her lexicon of artisanal craft. Rhythm modulates—short clauses during climb, longer lyric cadence at glow-spread. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor (“light learned to remember”) is character-bound, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “wedge-shaped stone carved with vines and laughing faces” does world, backstory, and emotional cargo in one breath. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stance or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“mist as solid ground”) and paid off at closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; final line is a quiet cadence release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope—failed mage seeks lost tower—reframed through anti-efficiency aesthetic. Lingering luminance as measurable physical property feels fresh; “automatist exams” updates magic-school critique. Synthesis is specific: grandmother’s folly keystone is irreplaceable; generic “mystic artifact” would break logic. Risk taken in quiet, anti-climactic victory—no spell battle—yet coherence holds.</comment>
