<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her palm on glass, breath crystallizing, headache from nonlinear logic—yet her decisions remain reactive until the tree-cameo fusion. The “inherited herself backward” realization is relayed as narrated epiphany rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure, softening the cost. Still, her perceptual signature (greenhouse glass, bathroom tiles as thinking chamber) is memorable and character-bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mara naming herself on the tree reweights the premise that curators are pages in a non-chronological book. Cost is felt—“quiet in her chest…waiting for the right time that had already passed.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern is taught early (“simply complicated”) and paid off. Orientation is clean by line 5; lens held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, crystallizing breath, and cameo blank act as micro-settings that constrain choice—she can only “think” in the bathroom, the cameo only fits one tree-gap. Sensory selection mirrors disquiet: luminous fruit, carved bark, pale shell. Asteroid orchard rules remain consistent, learned through action. Final image of grandfather-eyes in mirror re-uses bathroom micro-setting to charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand the archive before it unmakes her—tightens when undocumented tree and cameo force a single fusion act. Escalation is accumulative: each tree bears paradoxes that narrow her options to participatory inscription. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts being “simply a page.” No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological and coherent under lyric lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—inheritance as self-authored, nonlinear text—emerges via cameo, tree, and bathroom motif without moralizing. Final mirror image reweights earlier “simply complicated” scrawl into lived wisdom. Subtext resides in unfinished carving and unwritten name: curation is co-creation across time. Resonant ambiguity lingers: she may already be the grandfather she meets in reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mara’s temporal vertigo. Prose rhythm mimics spiral inheritance—sentences lengthen, contract, repeat key phrases (“simply complicated,” “brightened disquiet”) with purpose. No head-hopping; diction stays within curator-academic lexicon. Voice peaks in white-tile bathroom breakthroughs, cadence shifting with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dense lyricism risks purple overload yet stays tethered to concrete nouns (pistachio shell, pomegranate, fig). One paraphrase loop—“simply complicated” repeated four times—subtracts without breaking closure. Mixed-metaphor check clean: silver fruit blooming backward is internally consistent. Final third free of artifacts; earlier synonym churn (“luminous…brightened…glow”) remains within pattern taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Hesperides myth + time-spiral genetics + curator-protagonist who inscribes herself into the collection. Risky nonlinear premise commits fully; payoff feels inevitable yet unforeseeable. Specificity of pistachio-shell cameo as inheritance key is unforgettable. No template echo; concept could not survive relocation to generic setting.</comment>
