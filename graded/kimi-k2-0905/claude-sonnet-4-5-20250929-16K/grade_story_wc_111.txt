<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—tracing cracks, polishing marbles—while her pragmatic deception and long-game sabotage spring from a single plausible grudge. The final act of planned neglect and resurrection shows a hierarchy of values (truth over job security) with visible cost in the cracked, sun-lit marbles. Marcus exists mostly as echo and witness, so relationship pressure is light; the real crucible is her wager with the garden itself. That wager lands as credible endurance, not epiphany, keeping ambiguity alive.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: every hedge inch gained overnight is a direct therefore of her resumed care after deliberate starvation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no drift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—sensor “luck” re-priced as reciprocal recognition—felt cost is the public exposure of her clandestine archive and the gamble she could have lost. Persistent constraint: the cracked marbles remain, future seasons still hang on her aging hands.</comment>

<comment>The maze functions as both map and clock; marble placement at each junction turns abstract space into memory circuitry. Cracked marble surfaces mirror hedge fissures and the gardener’s own skin—texture returned to at four pressure points. Tool use is tactile: apron cloth, polishing motion, dirt under nails, all grounding botanic technocracy in manual labor. Final image—sunlight in fracture veins—recharges every prior buried seed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove gardens remember—signals early and tightens when she stakes her career on overnight resurrection. One meaningful reversal: deliberate decline → explosive regrowth, triggered by her resumption of care. Cost is legible—public humiliation risk, garden death risk, her last professional breath. Coincidence absent; algorithmic “luck” is undercut, not relied on.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: measurement vs. memory, botanic sentiment vs. data luck. Subtext lives in the cracked marbles—private record resisting institutional theft. Final copper-vein image reweights “failure” as testimony, offering no moral, only witnessed reciprocity. Ambiguity sustained: sensors still can’t see love, yet love demonstrably alters graphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person selective stays close to Elara’s tactile diction: “canvas apron,” “botanical dyes,” never venturing into Marcus’s head. Syntax mirrors methodical patience—long sentences for excavation, staccato for sensor speak. Perceptual signature is gardener’s: noticing root girth, petal count, soil warmth. No dialogue clutter; each spoken line advances the institutional threat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse and earned—“cracks into copper veins” charges closure. Information density high: one sentence toggles past sabotage, present polish, future wager. Minor filter verbs remain voice-justified (“she watched”) rather than clutter. No artifacts touch the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise freshens dystopian trope—gardens as quantified sentiment economy—through tactile mini-archive of painted marbles. Risk taken: withholding explanation for three weeks to let maze falter, trusting overnight reclamation to feel magical yet causal. Specificity of painted notations and dye chemistry anchors fantastical element in manual craft. Not quite paradigm-shift, but elegant inversion of data-ruled world via vegetal intimacy.</comment>
