<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to order while feeding books to a tide-basin furnace—remains embodied and specific; the moment she straps the scroll into the creel, her pulse syncs with gear cogs, showing cost without label-speak. The only drag is that the grandmother is invoked more as mythic backstory than as a lived relationship that pressures present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the scroll’s ink-that-is-water rewrites “preserve” from stasis to cyclical forgetting/remembering; cost is the surrender of linear memory itself. Causal chain holds: dream cue → find creel → smelt stable pages → gear syncs heartbeat → accept tide-self. Orientation is taught early (glass walls, bronze cogs) so disorientation serves, not obscures, the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is not backdrop but hydraulic engine: shelf migration and copper basin literally narrow Maren’s options, forcing the smelt. Micro-setting objects—creel, titan-gear—constrain every reach and fold; their salt-dark weave and cog pitch return in the final heartbeat sync, charging the closure image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep wonder without tomorrow—tightens once: when Maren chooses to destroy the last stable pages to create a mutable scroll, she pays the irreversible price of perpetual forgetting. Escalation is situational but coherent; no reversal is needed because the single deepening (accepting contradiction) forecloses the path of fixed knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox ritual itself: preservation through surrender, wonder through cyclical loss. The refrain of “winter-sun serenity” modulates from dread to earned poise without moralizing; the final scroll’s shimmer is the non-literal answer that reweights the entire premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crisp: Maren’s attention sorts by salt-smell, gear pitch, and shelf drift—never a generic catalog. Syntax tightens under pressure (“She fed the stable pages into the basin as water rose around them”) then loosens into lyric fold-through-dimensions; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between short percussion beats and tidal long sentences; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“shelves that migrated like schools of fish”) so it pays off rather than muddles. Zero filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The disappearing-tomorrow premise could feel gimmick, but here it is braided to librarian exo-tech and lunar hydraulics, creating a singular schematic. Risk—destroying fixed text to save wonder—commit fully; the conceptual scroll that is ink/water/light is a fresh inflection impossible without the tide-rules established in paragraph one.</comment>
