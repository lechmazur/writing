<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Elena’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness are anchored to the chess-hubris backstory, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“I understand that curse intimately”) and the climactic absolution is declared rather than dramatized with contradictory impulse. The micro-choice of plucking the silver thread is crisp; the final confession is coherent but not tested by an opposing impulse, so the change feels asserted, not earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the village restarts when Elena utters self-forgiveness, cost visible in her remaining exile. Causality is soft—thread-pull → letters appear → labyrinth solved by confession—more allegorical than because/therefore, but the pattern is consistent with the accumulative-lyric lens. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. The price (still exiled, free) is legible, so the ending holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The frozen village is rendered with selective, sensory economy: ivy mid-growth, dust motes suspended, thunder caught in lull. These micro-details constrain Elena’s movement and charge the final thaw; the chapel’s slanted light becomes the stage for the tapestry decoding. Spatial choreography remains clean; the setting’s temporal rule is taught early and paid off at closure. The tapestry itself functions as micro-setting/tool, its platinum threads warming under her palm to release time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she restart time by forgiving herself?”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the final thread sequence demands unconditional self-forgiveness, foreclosing her former self-image. The cost is conceptual (permanent exile) rather than viscerally dramatized; agency is intellectual, not tested by external opposition. Escalation is single-step but coherent under the allegorical lens; still, the lack of live antagonistic pressure keeps tension moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete image-pattern of frozen time = unforgiven regret; no moral is stated, only the final image of rain washing the labyrinth from memory. The tapestry’s shift from decoration to instruction reweights the meaning of “woven hush” without editorializing. Subtext resides in tactile gesture—thread-pull as self-interrogation. The ending invites reflection on whether collective forgiveness could restart communal time, avoiding tidy prescription.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elena; perceptual signature is precise—chess lexicon (“winnow away distraction,” “mapping strategies”) colors her noticing. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, avoids filter verbs; “fingers tracing…ivy hung suspended” shows immediacy. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register remains consistent; metaphoric layering (“village existed in the space between one heartbeat and the next”) is purposeful, not ornamental, and paid off in the final heartbeat of rain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences vary in length and opening, creating natural read-aloud cadence. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “frozen” and “thread” recur with evolving meaning, not repetition artifact. Metaphors stay coherent (amber silence, platinum labyrinth) and do not obscure causality. One near-template—“her fingers already fidgeting productively”—is isolated; otherwise diction is specific, verbs strong, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combines the hoary “village frozen in time” trope with chess-strategic cognition and textile cryptography, yielding a fresh fusion. The emotional engine—self-forgiveness as cosmological reboot—is non-obvious and committed to fully. Risk lies in allegorical causality, but coherence under the lyric-accumulative lens keeps it from gimmickry. Specific detail (silver thread whispering loose) prevents abstraction from becoming generic.</comment>
