<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celestine’s interiority is lush and embodied—her breath, spine, dancer’s stance, micro-gesture of palm or tilted head all reveal a mind negotiating chastity-as-power while craving self-definition. Contradictory impulses (reflect vs. become) coexist in the same beats, culminating in the earned renunciation of her ornamental role. The cost—her future safety inside the court—is legible in the guards’ instinctive retreat. Voice stays singular; no stock “courtesan” shorthand intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism-light she now carries inside visibly reweights every prior performance; the guards’ flinch is the felt social cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each echo she harvests intensifies the density of her stance until the final crystallized poise. Causality is internal but coherent: because she untangles the threads, therefore the sanctuary manifests and her identity is recast. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and paid off at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, snow, and dawn light are not backdrops—they are tools: the snow’s blankness offers a writable surface for her map, the emerging crystalline geometry literally guides her footfalls, and the pearl dawn color becomes the story’s final charged image. Micro-setting (her body as dancer’s stance) constrains every gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices temperature through breath, geometry through peripheral shimmer, never catalogues for atmosphere. No props teleport; prism sanctuary grows logically from traced patterns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-authorship vs. court’s mirror-role—signaled in paragraph 1. Tightening occurs when the threads of expectation physically resist her hands, translating social pressure into tactile friction; cost is the loss of protective anonymity (guards recoil). Agency is continuous: she chooses kneel, trace, pull, gather, walk out. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal needed under Accumulative lens. Escalation is density-driven, not causal-turn, and remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of chaste erotic power becoming autonomous creative power; no explicit thesis stated. The prism sanctuary’s final internalization is a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior “performance” as rehearsal for sovereignty. Subtext lives in gesture—snow traced rather than spoken. Final smile is non-literal answer: not victory but unmaskable self-possession. Wisdom is earned through harvested memories of maternal refusal and founder’s tears, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Celestine with controlled psychic distance; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is dancer: joints, breath, peripheral shimmer, geometric footpaths. Syntax lengthens during suspension, fragments during thread-pulling, mirroring breath. Metaphor regime (“threads of frozen time”) is consistent and legible. No dialogue, so evaluation is for narrative voice only; voice sustains elevated register without purple drift. Filter verbs minimal and justified (“she felt it dissolve”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “snow began to shimmer differently, reflecting not moonlight but something deeper, more prismatic” packs world-shift into one sentence. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language peaks at sanctuary arrival yet stays coherent—“echoes hanging like fruit” is fresh and paid off by literal gathering. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for dawn arrival, short clause for guards’ recoil. No typos or tense slips. Opening and closing lines act as frame and hinge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: courtesan-as-prism, chastity-as-refraction, memory-as-harvest. Space-between-breath used as literal timeslip technology rather than metaphor. Risk—lyric accumulative structure in under 800 words—pays off because pattern (trace-gather-carry) is taught early and closure reweights all prior light imagery. Could not swap setting or character without collapsing concept. Avoids both stock fantasy court and stock feminist rebellion templates; instead invents interior cosmology of performed autonomy.</comment>
