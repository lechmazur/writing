<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—killer’s daughter turned rose-weaver—grounds every beat; the father’s scarred hands performing gentleness under her instruction crystallizes the earned change. Micro-choices (canvas pressed, blossom opened, blade sheathed) carry visible cost and re-weight their relationship without therapy-speak. Only the father’s motivation for arriving “world gone madder” is declared, not dramatized, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bounty hunter kneels, sheathes the blade, and plants canvas—an on-page stance shift that forecloses the gun path with undeniable cost under the Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric but coherent: each scrap of canvas carries prior stories into soil, pattern taught by 25 % and paid off when father’s knife-silence reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“glass dome… desert rose farm”). No lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dome itself acts as constraint—climate, visibility, social fragility—forcing the father to lower his weapon; roses breathe and lean, charging the final image. Ballast canvas scraps evolve from debris to ethic medium, their freighted histories literally planted, a micro-object that alters tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices petal curl, dust weight, holster creak, never tourist-catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuity vs. armed survival—tightens once: knife moved from gun to soil, narrowing future options. Escalation is accretive: each canvas scrap and rose nod increases density until the blade-sheathe beat crystallizes cost. No coincidence; pacifism is tested by father’s restiveness, not external threat. Price is felt on-page in the whispered metal-on-leather and roses leaning toward both.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: continuity is grown, not guarded; thorns can be refused. Subtext lives in gesture—knife returned, not raised—and in dome-filtered light that makes killer’s hands amber, not bloody. Final image reweights earlier tower-fall chaos into cultivated order without moralizing. Complexity intact: pacifism is risk, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is concrete and lyrical: “sand came from airship ballast sandbag scraps, torn canvas… soaked up stories.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences under dome hush, then clipped “I don’t.” No head-hopping; father’s interior is read only through Mara’s senses, maintaining distance. Knife-sheathe cadence mirrors rose-opening: steel whisper / petal unfold, a patterned acoustic echo that pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: single sentence delivers origin, history, and ethic function of canvas. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (dome as “amber sanctuary” holds). Filter verbs serve lyric compression, not hedging. Final line “roses leaned toward them both, learning” is textured, not ornamental, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic pacifist horticulture via narrative-soaked canvas is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet ending pays off through Charged Poise. No trope recycling—tower-fall is backdrop, not plot device. Specific detail (ballast sandbag manifests, escape trajectories) grounds novelty in lived world.</comment>
