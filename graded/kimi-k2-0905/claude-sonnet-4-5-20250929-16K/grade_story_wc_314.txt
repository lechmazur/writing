<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—logic vs. intuition—but the shift from denial to acceptance is declared (“Understanding struck her like lightning”) rather than dramatized through a visible micro-choice that costs her something tangible right there on the page; the sentimental trait is shown via keepsakes yet never forces a costly decision, so the arc feels foregone rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the green flame release crystallizes her new stance and carries conceptual cost—she exits carrying “nothing visible” yet everything changed. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the starling pattern, crystal, and flame build density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. One minor scaffold—two adjacent sentences restate the “perpetual dawn” idea—dulls the peak image (−0.2), keeping it just outside the 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains the final action—its geometric perfection triggers the irreversible flame experiment—while the kaleidoscopic waterfall and copper-apple orchard supply vivid, POV-filtered sensory detail without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects track. Environment actively guides the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing the formula—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the starling pattern offers the missing ingredient and the crystal’s dissolution forces a one-way flame act that forecloses return to pure rationality. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the crystal and her prior epistemic stance. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; a second tightening beat would push it above 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—harmony of logic and intuition—emerges through the starling image and flame act, not thesis statements. Final image of “head and heart” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the secret keepsakes adds texture. One soft echo of “eternal moment” slightly thins resonance (−0.2), but complexity and ambiguity remain intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharp—“geometrically flawless…made her chest tighten”—and diction stays within the alchemist’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to the staccato flame invocation. No head-hopping or register drift. A single filter verb cluster (“she reminded herself”) is minor (−0.1).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; figurative language is selective, not stacked. One paraphrase loop on “perpetual dawn / eternal moment” costs −0.2. Otherwise clean syntax, strong verbs, no scaffolding. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The starling murmuration-as-script conceit refreshes the familiar “scientist learns to feel” arc; synthesis with alchemical flame crystallizes the premise. Specific sensory detail (copper apples, emerald harmonics) prevents generic overlay. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than twist—but execution is coherent and memorable.</comment>
