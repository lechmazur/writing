<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Isla’s interiority is vivid—her shift from sidewalk whimsy to mandala-maker is embodied through the damp stone under her knees and the warm tile in her palm. The micro-choice to place the fragment crystallizes her value hierarchy: meaning over certainty, shared grief over solitary art. The mother’s arrival feels inevitable rather than convenient because Isla’s practiced social perception (reading grief in posture) triggers the invitation. Cost is palpable: the mandala’s “gaps” now include the daughter-shaped absence that can’t be filled, only honored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the syncopated breathing at the end reconfigures both women into a provisional family of mutual recognition. Causality holds: the tile fragment’s warmth (physical memory) is the because that lets Isla offer the mandala as forward motion, not nostalgia. The empty-center mandala image lands with conceptual cost—meaning is now the negative space itself. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (spiral sand, echoing drips, mist layers) escalates until silence becomes tactile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the grotto’s parabolic acoustics turn ambient drip into a second score, forcing Isla’s breathing to slow and match the mother’s. The damp stone literally colours the sand, making every ridge darker—environment altering artefact. Mist is not backdrop but timing device: it thickens only after the tile fragment is laid, signalling phase shift. Final image of “slow, strange rebirth” is charged by the acoustic hush that now feels breathable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the possibility of meaning—tightens when the tile fragment’s arrival offers either proof of irretrievable loss or raw material for new pattern. No reversal, but deepening: the mandala’s deliberate gaps convert external chaos into internal necessity. Cost is the acceptance that the daughter will never see it; this forfeiture is dramatized by the mother’s “face crumpled and reformed,” a visible price. Escalation is textural, not causal: each coloured ring makes the silence heavier, compressing options until only shared breath remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the equivalence of mess and message—no aphorism, but sand pattern + acoustic hush literalize it. The tile fragment’s cracks become the map they couldn’t draw, a Conceptual Repricing that makes brokenness the new ink. Subtext in gesture: handing over the shard is adoption, not confession. Final image refuses redemption, offering instead “beautiful, necessary confusion,” an earned wisdom that sustains ambiguity without nihilism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Isla’s perceptual filter: “lilac unease” is her synesthetic shorthand, never authorial flourish. Compression taught early—“the unlearning had begun three weeks ago”—signals lyric ellipsis will be paid off. Rhythm mirrors breath: longer sentences during sand pouring, staccato when fragment is laid. No head-hop; mother’s grief is read through posture and wool texture, staying Isla-embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances either sand pattern, acoustic texture, or emotional stake. Figurative control: “mist finding a new shape” is precise—mist literally reshapes visibility. High-density line: “the mess wasn’t meant to be cleaned up or solved. The mess was the message” compresses thesis into two monosyllabic beats without moralizing. Final line “meaning began its slow, strange rebirth” avoids adjective excess; strangeness is already justified by prior acoustics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk artist + mandala + cave acoustics = collective meaning rebuilt from sensory disorientation. Risk in using “unlearning” as off-stage apocalypse pays off by making the grotto a petri dish for new epistemology. Tile fragment reweights from relic to stylus without exposition. Conceptual boldness: meaning as negative space is non-obvious yet inevitable once the mandala’s holes are literal.</comment>
