<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—needing to decode her parents’ spatial logic while fearing what she’ll find—stays alive in every tactile choice: kneeling at the table, tracing grain, deciding not to open the logbook again. The micro-choice to leave the book closed renounces the fantasy of parental repair; that renunciation costs her the comfort of certainty and is earned by the preceding grain-reading scene. Featherly determination is shown, not labeled, in the way her fingertips “whorl” with her father’s persistence. Only the mother remains a cipher, but that absence is thematically justified and does not flatten the central conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds through repeated “mapping” motifs—corn maze, flight log, oak grain—until the final image reweights “distance” from mathematical to existential. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s step through the prism dissolves the terrace, crystallizing that sacred = irreversible. Cost is legible in the dissolved planks and the prismatic fragmentation of memory; the price is the irreversible loss of the return path. Orientation is taught early (“drifting prism terrace…shifting panels”) and pays off when the same light fragments carry her loss away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as both macro-setting and micro-constraint: its “slow-breathing glass” panels physically separate, forcing Maya to walk forward because no wall will hold her back. The salvaged oak planks anchor her father’s tactile history; the grain’s knot becomes the map she reads, literally guiding her to the logbook revelation. Light and wood evolve from backdrop to active agents—light dissolves the return path, wood withholds parental presence. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her kneel, trace, stand, and exit without drift or impossible geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some thresholds feel sacred—tightens when the grain-reading reveals that her parents’ entire marriage was an attempt to meter “necessary distances.” The deepening occurs at the logbook page: “Some distances aren’t navigable…only surrender.” This forecloses the possibility of familial reconciliation and reframes the maze trauma as an irreversible crossing. Cost is visible: the terrace’s dissolution literalizes the price of irreversibility. Agency is interior—renunciation rather than confrontation—but still active, as she chooses forward motion instead of lingering among the fragments.</answer>

<comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation of spatial metaphors: maze, flight paths, grain, prism—each redefining “distance” as emotional survival. The final image reweights the concept: sacred threshold = irreversible crossing. No moral is stated; instead, the dissolved light-beams perform the repricing. Subtext sits in the unopened logbook: renunciation is louder than revelation. The emotional aftereffect—loss as geometry—lingers without sentimentality.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Maya’s perceptual filter: she notices wood grain, light shift, floorboard creak—never exposition she couldn’t sense. Rhythm modulates: long, breathing sentences mirror the slow prism shifts; shorter clauses under final pressure (“She did not look back.”). Diction remains within her father-haunted lexicon—“whorl,” “salvaged,” “featherly”—no academic register drift. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she felt the terrace beginning to drift”) they serve immediacy, not exposition. Voice is specific enough that swapping “Maya” would break the texture.</comment>

<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical or emotional information. Metaphors are coherent—grain as river, light as breath—and never clash. High-density line: “The table's grain swirled around a knot like water around a stone. She followed the pattern, let her mind drift into its whorls, and began to see.”—three jobs in one motion: setting, metaphor, epiphany. Opening and closing lines are architected: opener anchors the dream-physics; closer delivers the irreversible step. No scaffolding, no synonym churn, no register drift.</comment>

<comment>The “corn-maze trauma → parental cartography of distance” synthesis is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric, non-realist terrace—pays off because the spatial logic stays consistent and the final dissolution recharges the premise. Familiar trope (child lost in maze) is inverted: the maze worked exactly as designed; the child’s return is the catastrophe. Small deduction for echo of “butterfly effect” phrase; otherwise, specifics (weather codes, grain analysis) are idiosyncratic to this family.</comment>
