<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bell tuner’s cryptic stillness and ritual walking create a coherent, if opaque, interior logic; her patience is shown through embodied action (three days of heel-toe circuits) rather than label. Yet she never faces an on-page contradiction that forces a costly choice—her success feels pre-ordained, so the “earned” bar for 9+ isn’t cleared. The townspeople’s abrupt reversal is observed, not filtered through her stakes, keeping her arc flat. Still, the micro-choices (where she strikes the fork, when she stops) remain consistent with the trait set, satisfying the 7-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the town humming while her footsteps fade reweights the premise—collapse averted, cost transferred to her perpetual exile. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork strike + footfall adds density until the pattern break (true bells) signals restoration. Orientation is swift—archway, three-week clock, keystone ritual all within 120 words. No teleporting props or soft resets; the price is the tuner’s endless departure, felt on the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Environment is filtered through the tuner’s sonic bias—cobblestones as percussion, wind in doorways as search-party—so detail is selective, not tourist. The archway and chapel bells constrain her method: she must walk the laid stones and strike local resonant surfaces. Micro-setting (ebony fork, keystone) functions as tool-setting that charges the final image when she pockets it and leaves. Weather is absent, but the “wild hush” evolves into “possibility” without symbolic overstatement, sustaining atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—town extinction—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the three-week clock. Escalation is textural: each circuit layers frequency until the pattern break (true bells) reweights absence into presence. No antagonist is needed; the fracture itself is the pressure. Cost is conceptual—the tuner’s perpetual exile—but still legible on the page, meeting the 8-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sonic metaphor: shared rhythm as communal life-support; restoration demands solitary sacrifice. No character articulates the thesis—the final image of fading footsteps silently reweights prior material. Ambiguity lingers: will the town remember the cost? The tuner’s anonymity keeps the moral complex, avoiding tidy closure. Subtext in the townspeople’s hesitation (Marcus unhitching his cart) shows belief catching like tuning, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the tuner’s perceptual lens: sound dies, stones drink light, hush holds breath. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the walking cadence, teaching the pattern early. No head-hopping; townspeople’s reactions are externally observed, maintaining distance. Diction—“discordant chime,” “wild hush,” “spider-silk balance”—is consistent and purposeful, not purple.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet musical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“wind moved through vacant doorways like something searching” does dual duty for atmosphere and stakes. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences alternate with clipped percussive beats mirroring the tuner’s steps. One mixed metaphor (“secrets that rippled like heat above summer cobblestones”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—itinerant sonic healer prevents ghost-town collapse by walking—feels fresh, not a trope re-skin. The fork-as-black-hole-for-light and footfall-as-stitch transform familiar revival arcs into sensory ritual. Risk is quiet: no villain, no twist, yet specificity of method and stakes keeps it from generic allegory. Could push higher if the tuner’s personal cost were more viscerally foregrounded.</comment>
