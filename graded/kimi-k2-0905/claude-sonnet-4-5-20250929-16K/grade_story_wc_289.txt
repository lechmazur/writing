<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mei Lin’s renunciation of her archive is earned: eleven years of hoarding letters flips to active release when the spiral re-weights her identity. The ache-typology (“longing, regret, hope deferred”) risks label-speak, but the embodied moment of tying each letter offsets it. Jun’s parallel arc is slighter—his decision to write his own letter is declared, not dramatized—so the full 9+ gate stays shut.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final “prismatic quiet” re-configures Mei Lin’s vocation with undeniable cost—she forfeits her secret archive. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each letter tied = density increase that re-weights stake. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 3). The lens ambiguity test is waived because the lyrical pattern is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lotus temple + lily pond function as micro-setting: the wet stone path underfoot guides her slow relinquishment, and the golden pond surface mirrors the final release. Sensory hierarchy is biased to reflective surfaces and water-light, matching the thematic “prismatic.” Spatial choreography is tight—satchel → spiral → pond arc. The spiral’s reed-and-twig construction is specific enough to resist swap; it constrains the literal tying action that resolves the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keeper of secrets must release them”—tightens once: the spiral’s appearance forces the archive into public view. Escalation is accumulative: each letter tied = rising visibility + social cost (strangers reclaim their past). No reversal, but the tightening forecloses the private-archive option. Cost is visible in the final image: her empty satchel vs. the community weeping beneath the letters.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: fragmented letters → communal reintegration = “nothing lost, only waiting for arrangement.” The thrush-nest spiral re-weights the premise at closure, achieving CR. Subtext operates in silence—Jun’s drip of water, the quiet tying gesture. No final-paragraph moralizing; the bells’ crystalline fracture offers non-literal answer. Minor slip: “thread that connects all things” flirts with thematic echo, but it’s buried mid-scene, not at end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays close to Mei Lin with consistent perceptual signature: “weathered satchel,” “prismatic reflections” = her optic. No head-hopping; Jun’s interior is inferred through gesture. Syntax lengthens in cadence with the spiral’s upward motion, then contracts at the final bell. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Jun’s “You feel it too” carries subtext of shared complicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“storm pulled them from everywhere. Walls, forgotten drawers, the mud beneath old houses” packs world-building into one sentence. Metaphors stay internally coherent (nest ↔ longing architecture). Rhythm accelerates during the tying sequence, then breathes at the golden pond. No artifact touches the closure beat; the final line’s “crystalline notes” is earned, not tacked.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The love-letter ghostwriter who must release her own archive is a fresh synthesis; the public-art spiral as nest is an inevitable yet unforeseen form. Risk taken: quiet lyric accumulation instead of dramatic confrontation, and it pays off. Transformation test pass—swap Mei Lin for any other archivist and the emotional logic collapses. Specific detail (forty-three envelopes, each ache-typed) prevents generic feel.</comment>
