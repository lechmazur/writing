<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mirela’s ghost-stance is coherent—altruistic, consistent, and tied to the bell/chalk—but her interior contradiction is only asserted (“something in her refused to disperse”) rather than dramatized in a present-tense micro-choice. Kess’s turn is sharp and embodied, yet the community chorus stays abstract; no secondary character exerts live pressure on her. The final “I can rest now” registers as renunciation, but the cost is collective, not personal-g spectral, so the emotional price feels diffuse rather than ghost-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each dawn message adds density until the merchant offer triggers a single tightening that reweights the sharing economy. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the unanimous vote refuses private wealth and the nebula-light image reconfigures their moral rule-set. Cost is legible—“I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY” burns on the plaza—but the ghost’s own stake dissolves rather than scar, so the price is social, not personal. Orientation is clean by line 20; no causal breaks; one shard boundary at “That night…” is sign-posted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Low-gravity droplets, floating rock arches, and butterfly bells are tactile, selective, and mirror the communal drift/tether tension. The copper bell and chalked words act as micro-setting objects that constrain tactics—pollination failure, message permanence—charging the final image. Sensory economy favors nebula light and orchard weight; no exposition dumps. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the square, domes, and orchards.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collective survival of the sharing economy—is signaled early and tightens once: merchant ship offer vs. communal refusal. Escalation is accumulative: each chalk message adds social pressure until the vote forecloses individual wealth. Cost is conceptual—future scarcity risk assumed together—but no personal resource is forfeited on-page, keeping the price abstract. Agency is distributed; ghost prompts, humans decide, so protagonist pressure is dilute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: collective memory vs. capitalist temptation, carried by chalk and bell rather than stated. Final image of settlers writing new dawn messages reconfigures inheritance as ongoing practice, not moral. Subtext in Kess’s seed-hoarding silence and the ghost’s inability to disperse adds emotional layering. Avoids sermonizing; no thesis sentence appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays stable, filtering perception through cosmic orchard imagery that matches communal stance. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences for nebula dawn, staccato message caps for urgency. “Brambled with hope and grief” is idiosyncratic and apt; no register drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture alone—maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, lean, and propulsive; every sentence advances communal stakes or atmospheric charge. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay consistent with low-gravity orchard physics. Final line “continuing the ghost’s work” is crisp closure image. Occasional elevated cadence (“bridges of rose and gold”) is earned by pattern and pays off in resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spectral horticulture + anti-capitalist refugee commune feels fresh; ghost uses chalk not terror. Butterfly bell as pollinator and memory object repurposes pastoral trope into sf ecology. Risk of sentimental communal uplift is skirted by refusing merchant cash and keeping future precarious. Conceptual repricing at end makes the premise irreversible without this exact inheritance ritual.</comment>
