<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is textured—her palm-weighing of coins, the hush-whisper “Show me which frequency”—and her final renunciation of certainty is earned through iterated micro-choices. The “quietly enthusiastic” trait stays embodied rather than labeled. A hairline slip: “stellar doubt gnawed” is slightly diagnostic; tightening that line would hit 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new wavelength harmonizes “deep in her chest,” reconfiguring her purpose with felt cost. Causal chain—coins → frequency → prophecy → witness-role—holds under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. One tiny loop: “decisions matter not in their outcomes but in their making” is stated twice; trimming the second keeps 9+ within reach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The amber-lit deck, corroded coins, and static bursts are sensuously specific and feed directly into Kael’s choices (receiver tuning, coin-casting). Micro-setting—the console’s metallic clatter—constrains the next frequency pick. A hairline over-reliance on visual amber; one tactile or olfactory hit in the final third would nudge 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find purpose via backwards prophecy—tightens once: frequency seven-theta-nine fails to satisfy, forcing the three-sigma-six shift that crystallizes her witness-role. Cost is legible: she forecloses personal certainty. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; a mid-scene external jeopardy (dying receiver capacitor?) could escalate into 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—meaning resides in the act of choosing, not the outcome—emerges through coin-casting and backwards prophecy rather than assertion. Final image of coins as “small decisions, each a universe” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Avoids sermon; ambiguity lingers. Minor echo of the stated thesis keeps it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature—“amber silence,” “crystalline interruptions”—is consistent and cadenced. Syntax breathes with the static bursts: short bursts → longer lyrical lines. No head-hop or register drift. A single 9+ hairline: the phrase “universe still learning to expand again, uncertain but persistent” edges toward authorial flourish; if diction stayed inside Kael’s sensorium, 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (photographs in reverse, newborn colts) are apt and varied. One mixed micro-image: “static bursts came faster now, each one carrying fragments” could imply speed of sound; tightening to “arrived closer” avoids physics hiccup. Otherwise line-level control is publish-ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Backwards prophecy + coin-casting as decision-engine is a fresh temporal conceit, fully committed to and internally consistent. Collapsed-universe setting serves the thematic question rather than vice-versa. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final Charged Poise. Slight overlap with Ted Chiang-esque time-inversion tropes, but the tactile coin ritual and witness-role reconfigure the material into something memorable.</comment>
