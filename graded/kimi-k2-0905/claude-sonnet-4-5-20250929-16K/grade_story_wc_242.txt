<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iris’s interiority is concrete—her ritual of wetting the finger, the pad of notes, the bootleg electric bill—yet her contradictory impulse (cultivating distance to enable reunion) is asserted more than dramatized in scene. The final smile is a micro-choice, but the cost of her nightly labor feels conceptual rather than embodied; we see no fatigue, doubt, or personal price. Secondary callers are sketched with swift particularity, but their pressure on Iris is vicarious, keeping her arc slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mosaic pattern (call → reflection → next call) is taught by 25 % and resolves in the Charged Poise of the final ring: “Right place.” The wrong-number engine is causal: each call accumulates names that Iris later redeploys, tightening the loop. Closure carries conceptual cost: the endlessness of the task is legible in the closing image of her waiting smile, proving nothing ends. One minor scaffold: “The loop had begun” is a touch outline-ish, but the beat lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-bulb tunnel and glass disc function as micro-setting: the disc’s prismatic shadows literally guide Iris’s finger, constraining every musical intervention. Sensory economy is high—wet finger on glass, copper wires breathing—without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is crisp: shelf, receiver, pad track across beats. The harmonica disc reappears in the final sentence, charging the Charged Poise with inherited memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can distance be converted into reunion—signals early and tightens as Iris collects names, then spends them. Escalation is accumulative: each wrong number adds one more entry to her covert phonebook, narrowing her own options (she must stay underground to deliver). The price is opportunity cost: she never emerges, never calls her own estranged person. One hairline slip: the brother’s misdirected voicemail is recounted, not dramatized, muting the felt cost a notch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: second chances travel through obsolete infrastructure. Subtext resides in the glass disc’s ghostly overtone—music older than the callers—implying generational continuity. The ending resists moralizing; the endless ring is a resonant image, not a lesson. Minor echo: “teach endings how to begin” borders thesis-statement, but it is buried mid-story and earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays consistently at poetic distance; no head-hop. Syntax is lyrical but disciplined—parallelism in “through copper wires… through veins… through distances” teaches the accumulative pattern. Perceptual signature is Iris’s tactile precision: wet finger, smooth dial, clean receiver. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven (“Tell me about the last good day”), each line bait for reconnection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: short declaratives for call openings, longer cadences for reflection. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“tunnel seemed to breathe”—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “collector of estrangements both deliberate and accidental” compresses vocation and moral stance in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; no filler adjectives. Final line varies sentence length to deliver the tonal cadence that recharges “loop.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses obsolete tech (rotary phone) with obsolete music (glass harmonica) to create a fresh myth of reconnection. The wrong-number-as-portal trope is transformed by Iris’s deliberate cultivation, not luck. Specificity of bootleg electricity and grandmother subway busker roots the fantasy in lived history. Risky accumulative structure pays off: the endless ring feels inevitable, not repetitive.</comment>
