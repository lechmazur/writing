<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cornelius’s truth-wilting affliction is dramatized in micro-gesture (trembling fingers) and steers every visible choice; the final dawn ascent carries earned cost in bone-deep fatigue. Interiority stays concrete—philosopher’s chip warm against ribs—never sliding into label-speak. One flaw: no contradictory impulse is allowed to surface mid-repair; the hum remains too pure, so the arc feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each box restored layers density until the braided dawn chorus reweights covenant vs. corrosion. Closure is a Charged Poise—Cornelius exits up-spiral, boxes still singing below, fatigue and contentment co-present—so cost is felt without tidy resolution. Orientation anchored inside 80 words; single scene, one meaningful tightening (silent → silver lullaby) drives the cadence shift. No causality gaps; metaphoric logic stays internally consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Violin-curved chamber, brass shells, dawn-amber glow—every sensory choice constrains acoustic possibility and thus the repair tactic. Micro-setting (philosopher’s chip as needle) literally pierces the invisible threads, so object-as-setting qualifies for 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is pristine: spiral down / bench / ascent up track cleanly. Only minus: exterior street never anchored, but that absence serves the sealed-resonance conceit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><pressure>Dominant stake—theft of song vs. covenant duty—signalled in paragraph two and escalates box-by-box; each restoration narrows the remaining night-energy until dawn becomes the final boundary. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than fight: Cornelius endures exhaustion to reweave rather than replace. Tightening is textural—silence accumulates then releases in layered chorus—so Accumulative lens is served; cost (body wilt, chip warmth fading) is visible on final stair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory vs. entropy, form vs. function. No explicit thesis; final image of braided melodies “older than midnight” reweights prior material with conceptual cost—song survives corrosion but only through mortal fatigue. Subtext in gesture—trembling fingers, warm chip—carries the moral load. Ambiguity lingers: will next midnight return? That unsettled charge is exactly the right resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: acoustic metaphors for every motion, perfect-fifth readiness, dawn-amber color shift—diction stays inside repairman’s sensorium. Rhythmic control peaks at “Box by box…reclaiming the light” where anaphora mirrors the iterative task. No head-hop; single POV stable. Line-level variance: long breath for chamber description, staccato for pin-action. Filter verbs (“he could see”) are voice-motivated, not hedging.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm swings from cathedral cadence to tight pin-click without monotony; sentence openings vary. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (resonance chamber as violin) and pays off in closure choir—no penalty. Zero loops or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk: “covenant of rust” repeated thrice; because it accrues liturgical force, no deduction. Information density strong—each line advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: music-box restorer + philosopher’s stone shard + acoustic metaphysics. Midnight as literal song-thief feels inevitable yet new. Risk taken—entire conflict is metaphysical silence—yet clarity never blurs. Specific detail (garnet eyes, perfect fifths) prevents generic fantasy gloss. Could swap names and city, but acoustic covenant is inseparable; premise transformation saves it from template.</comment>
