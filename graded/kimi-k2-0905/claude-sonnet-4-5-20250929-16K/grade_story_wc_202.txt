<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s desire to recover her grandmother’s erased legacy is clear and personal, but the interiority stays at a curated, slightly abstract register (“crystallized feeling,” “elusively tangible”) that keeps us outside the visceral cost of the discovery; the final beat of resolve is stated rather than dramatized with a micro-choice that shows the price she will now pay.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain—lens fragment → hidden map in paintings → proof of erasure → plan to confront Guild—lands a clean Conceptual Repricing closure: the Guild’s “clean narrative” is now unavoidably cracked, and Mira inherits a visible constraint (the technique itself). Orientation is swift, the single transition (market → workshop) is legible, and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The suspended alchemist market is sketched with brisk, sense-driven strokes; the lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting that literally reframes what can be seen, satisfying the 9+ gate. A few phrases (“elusively tangible,” “crystallized feeling”) edge toward the generic, but the selective detail keeps the world breathable without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early—recover a deleted history—and tighten when the lens reveals the hidden layer of translators; the cost is the danger of exposing Guild lies. The escalation is single-track but sufficient: each painting strips away another layer of sanctioned truth, foreclosing the option to remain comfortably ignorant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The theme—translation as ethical resurrection of silenced voices—emerges through the concrete process of decoding paintings rather than exposition; the final image of the grandmother’s smile reframes the entire quest as an act of inter-generational listening. No moral is declared; the reweighting is felt in the lens’s morning flare.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The third-person limited voice maintains a consistent, slightly luminous distance that suits a translator who sees “edges of perception.” Occasional elevated diction (“concept dissolve,” “eternal instant”) risks self-consciousness but stays within Mira’s professional lexicon; rhythm modulates without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and propel; no loops or synonym churn. A few abstract qualifiers (“elusively tangible,” “crystallized feeling”) recur close together and slightly dilute sensory immediacy, but they never obscure causality or stall the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of art-historical steganography with inter-world linguistics feels fresh and specific; the lighthouse-as-archive trope is re-energized by the literal refracting lens that lets erased faces reappear. Risk is taken with the “between-worlds” conceit, yet the piece commits fully and pays it off in the final image.</comment>
