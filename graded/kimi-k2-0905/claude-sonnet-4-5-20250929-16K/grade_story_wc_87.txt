<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“regret made visible,” “merrily melancholic in its decay”) and the crack-in-compass crystallizes her self-sabotage. The decisive paddle to James is earned by the memory chain and micro-choice of pocketing the cracked compass. Cost is felt: “years lost” and the broken engagement. Slight over-articulation in “this was what it meant when expectations collapse” nicks realism; still, the contradiction driving her is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she commits to the crossing while clutching the broken compass—cost is visible, lens is causal. Orientation is clean by 120 words; single-scene default met. One minor causal leap: James’s text arrives exactly at dawn, a polite coincidence, but it complicates rather than solves. Accumulation of compass + utility-pole imagery tightens the final image without soft reset.</comment>

<comment>Salt-breeze utility poles and fog as “regret made visible” filter through Marina’s navigation mind; sensory hierarchy obeys her trained attention. The cracked compass constrains her reading of north and is handled twice, charging the final image. Spatial choreography across dock → kayak → inlet is coherent. Environment never takes over plot duties but guides the paddle route; authenticity meets economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—align heart with action—arrives early and tightens once: “Current’s tricky… hesitate and you’ll get pushed back,” forcing full commitment. The backlash of regrets is declared, then dramatized by dawn departure and solitary paddle; price is the solitude and stalled years. Escalation is single but sufficient for 750-word scope; no artificial reversals. James off-page keeps antagonistic pressure abstract, yet water current localizes the test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from compasses literal and makeshift (utility poles): imperfect tools still point toward necessary risk. No explicit moral; final image of poles “marking the shore she was finally brave enough to leave” reweights earlier childhood game. Subtext in cracked compass = cracked self-trust is understated. Epiphany is earned through concrete paddle, not sermon. Slight risk of symbolism convenience in “flickering faith” label, but resonance stays grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays interior to Marina; diction (“merrily melancholic,” “gravitational force”) mirrors her nautical precision and emotional drift. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during paddle launch, matching urgency. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; free-indirect slips are clean. Register holds without pseudo-philosophy aside from one flagged line. Distinct perceptual signature: utility wires as “simple stars” is idiosyncratic and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is compact and image-dense without purple patches; “fog roll across the water like regret made visible” is earned. Few filter verbs; sentences layer time and sensation (“She’d driven through the night…”). One paraphrase loop: “She could still read… she could still find north” could compress. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line offers resonant release with no cadence clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Broken-compass-as-crippled-instinct is fresh, and utility-pole navigation literalizes the theme of improvised guidance. Kayak-to-ex-lover crossing inverts traditional quest by making emotional risk the uncharted channel. Framing regret as gravitational force gives physics to emotion without gimmick. Premise is familiar (return to forsaken love) but inflected through mariner specificity and cracked instrument. Not radically new, yet synthesis feels particular to this voice.</comment>
