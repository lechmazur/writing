<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya’s survivor-guilt and rule-bending itch are concrete early; the bolt-chest fusion is a sensed, embodied cost. Interior contradiction (“mischievous” vs. caretaker of fragile fungi) shows in her choice to shoulder paradoxes. The leap from spam texts to volunteering feels slightly compressed; one more micro-beat of resistance or bargaining would lock motivation. Still, her final stance is legible and paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: spam → bolt arrival → threshold encounter → volunteer → bodily anchor. Mosaic shards (cellar, fault-line glimpses, cosmic negotiation) are taught by 25 % and cohere under a causal lens. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: bolt fused to sternum, luminous spore-cloud stabilised. One warp: the narrative skips how she deciphers “threshold” location—encyclopedic presence feels hand-wavy, but not fatal.</comment>

<comment>The mushroom cavern is handled as both ecology and emotional barometer; humidity sensors, pulsing glow, and salt-crusted bolt give tactile triangulation. Micro-setting (the fault-line slit) literally constrains her final placement—she has to stand there to bolt herself to the multiverse. Grandfather’s naval anecdote seeds the salt-bolt with remembered pressure, paying off when she weaponises that memory. Sensory choice stays filtered through Maya’s grower-eye, never tourist catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep reality from folding—emerges at midpoint and tightens once: volunteer or fold. Escalation is a single crescendo rather than successive reversals, but agency is clear; she steps forward, shoulders infinite promises, and is pinned by the bolt. Cost is both visceral (implanted metal) and existential (eternal sentinel). Because escalation is one-shot, it doesn't enter the 8.8 band, but remains coherent and sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “pressure reveals/transfigures” arises from specific imagery: fungal growth, naval bolt, grandfather’s aphorism, and her final crystallisation. No character sermonises the thesis; instead the bolt literally becomes a diamond-hard pivot holding paradoxes. Subtext stays in object choice and body cost. Final smile (“a portal, not a pyramid”) offers a crisp conceptual reprice without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited anchors firmly in Maya; no head-hop. Glitch-text orthography is consistent, pattern-taught, and paid off when she crosses the threshold. Perceptual signature—grower’s humidity awareness, spore-light shadow pulses—differentiates attention. Grandfather memory and naval lexicon layer her diction without violating POV. Occasional elevated phrases (“concepts became physical”) flirt with editorial distance, but stay within tolerable range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Repetition is minimal; sentences vary in cadence, no template runs. Figurative language is selective (pressure/diamond motif) and coherent. Information density high: one line can set scene, mood, and world rule (“Lies now left sticky residue…”). Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line re-illuminates motif. Two minor simultaneity slips (“She held… as she pressed…”) but actions remain sequential. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing pyramid-scheme trauma with quantum-promise cosmology is non-obvious and specific to this voice. Bolt-as-anchor and bioluminescent farm are fresh lenses on multiverse trope. Compression keeps concept from over-explaining; emotional core survives transplant test. Risky orthography and causal mosaic structure enhance, not distract. Only near-echo is “promises as physical shards” which recalls other magical-realist debt tales, but bolt-body fusion reweights it.</comment>
