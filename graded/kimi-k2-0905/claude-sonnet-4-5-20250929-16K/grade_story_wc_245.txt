<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—grief mapped as topography, dowsing as movement. Contradictory drives (hunger for stillness vs. fear of feeling) coexist in-scene, not summarized. The final stillpoint is earned by the preceding tactile trail; cost is the completed melody that both wounds and steadies her. No diagnostic labels, no stock phrasing; every beat is skin-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each musical note absorbed is a pattern beat that thickens emotional density until the cadence shift in the silent clearing lands as Charged Poise. Closure is unmistakable—“the hidden center where her love and grief occupied the same coordinates”—with conceptual cost: mapping must end in stillness, not escape. Platinum ring cools, forest resumes song, re-weighting the whole syntax. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by touch within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but instrument: frequencies shatter glass, bark whistles, moss absorbs footfall. Micro-setting = Mara’s skin; the platinum ring constrains every directional choice until it quits. Final clearing’s absolute silence is the charged environment that forces the stillpoint stance. Sensory economy is strict—no tourist catalog, only vibrations she can feel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find stillpoint inside grief—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accretive: each musical note tightens the emotional coil until silence becomes the irreversible stance. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and atmospheric. Cost is legible: the melody completes, ending her cartographic quest—she forfeits the map for presence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from tactile particulars: maps made of skin, songs absorbed through palms. No abstract statement until the final line, and even that is image, not moral. Stillpoint reconfigures meaning: love and grief are non-dual, not reconciled but co-located. Resonance is emotional, not prescriptive—reader left inside the resumed forest symphony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is perceptual signature: syntactic rhythm mimics dowsing steps—lean, directional, no wasted beat. Lexicon stays within Mara’s haptic world: “vibrations that mapped territories,” “syntax of sorrow.” Compression is taught early (“ultrasonic forest sang”) and paid off in the final silence. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat; free indirect slips are clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is spare yet lyrical; each sentence advances either physical motion or emotional density. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent (compass ring as dowsing rod, grief as canyon). Final paragraph slows cadence to match stillpoint without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: blind cartographer who maps emotion by touch + ultrasonic forest that sings above human hearing. Trail-of-musical-notes is a literal breadcrumb built from wife’s half-remembered melody, not decorative quirk. Stillpoint as non-dual grief/love center avoids familiar “acceptance” trope. Risk stays coherent—no late rule patch, no sentimentality.</comment>
