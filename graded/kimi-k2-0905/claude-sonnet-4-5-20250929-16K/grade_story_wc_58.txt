<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—documenting absence while seeking healing—is vivid; her micro-choice to steady Thomas’s hand reconfigures both stakes. Thomas’s tremor and retained thread embody credible flaw and competence. The final intimacy costs her detachment, earned by prior causal chain. Only the “geography of healing” line flirts with label-speak, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Thomas re-grips the thread as compass, Marina forfeits neutrality—cost is legible in the shared hush. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of described absences tightens into one reclaimed presence. No orientation debt; garden and bench anchored by line 5. One transition (garden to bench) is legible and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bronze leaves, camphor, crimson silk—selective tri-sense detail mirrors internal decay/transformation. The thread functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Garden’s autumn shadows externalize lonesome splendor without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: satchel, bench, leaf spiral tracked throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Marina’s detachment versus healing engagement—tightens when she chooses to steady Thomas’s hand, foreclosing observer stance. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each recited absence sharpens the risk of her own disappearance. Cost visible: she misses the last ship symbolically by staying present. No coincidence; escalation is causal under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “absence as unfinished map” emerges through concrete particulars—thread, tremor, missed ship—never abstract sermon. Final image of thread-as-compass reweights earlier carpet pattern without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: healing may be another form of exile. No thematic echo in closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Marina’s perceptual lens: “she could smell,” “she described.” Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short declaratives at climax. No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior accessed only through gesture and reported speech. Distinct idiom: “cathedral abandoned to starlings” is character-specific, not writerly flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid garden sentences to staccato dialogue beats. No loops or synonym churn; each image advances stake or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple density. One mixed metaphor—“valleys that might collect something other than grief”—barely grazes clarity, forgiven by immediate tactile recovery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of “obituaries for the living” is fresh angle on grief-map trope. Transformation of weaver’s tremor into new loom avoids disability-as-lesson cliché by retaining struggle. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off in final compass image. Could dock for faint echo of “cartography of healing” meme, but specificity of thread reclaims it.</comment>
