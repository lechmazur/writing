<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The novelist’s grief-riven paralysis is viscerally embodied in her trembling grip on the seashell, her micro-choice to “open her notebook” at the nexus is the earned pivot that forecloses endless mourning and makes the writing act feel like a costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into therapy-speak; the contradiction between needing closure and refusing it is held in scene, not summarized. The stranger’s cameo is the external pressure that crystallizes the hierarchy: continuing > finding. Only the daughter’s drowning is relayed in retrospective summary rather than dramatized memory, a slight flattening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist chooses to “write the final chapter,” solemnizing fragmentary hopes instead of pursuing reunion; the cost is the forever-absent daughter, legible in the shell pressed to the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of cameos builds density until the stranger’s line reframes the search itself as sacred. Orientation is clean—mist, rocks, three rivers—by word 80. No causal break; the seashell’s spiral re-enters as the charged object that reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “feral nexus” is not backdrop; its six-direction current physically impedes the swimmer and later becomes the metaphor for multidirectional grief, directly charging the final image. Mist is used to blur vision but sharpen auditory detail—gasping stranger—so environment dictates perceptual hierarchy. Spatial choreography is flawless: upstream → rocks → notebook on lap. The seashell functions as micro-setting; its spiral constrains the closing gesture, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“can she finish the book without knowing the ending?”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each cameo layers a fragment of hope until the stranger’s declarative twist deepens the stake from finding to sanctifying. Cost is visible: the act of writing while clutching the shell accepts perpetual absence. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: the search is the sister, fragmented kindness is the only reunion possible. Subtext lives in gesture—shell spiral equals DNA spiral, unrepeatable daughter. Final image of “whisper of closing pages” becomes hymn, a Conceptual Repricing that sacralizes incompleteness. Avoids overt allegory; ambiguity lingers, inviting counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to novelist; perceptual signature is aquatic—everything “dissolves,” “currents fight”—matching obsessional metaphor bank. Rhythm swells then condenses into short declarative beats as she writes, mirroring decision. Free indirect style is clean: “she didn’t know what her character truly wanted.” No head-hopping; dialogue虽然只有两句，但带有subtext（stranger察觉到重量）。No filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “mist transformed everything into suggestions” advances atmosphere, theme, and stakes simultaneously. No synonym loops; figurative language is sparse, deliberate. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line “whisper… became a hymn” resolves by resonant image. One mixed metaphor “smoke through fingers” is minor. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with white-water then stilles at notebook opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Familiar grief-to-art arc is re-angled through aquatic nexus as literal training ground and metaphor for multidirectional memory; cameo mechanic freshens “muse” trope. Risk of experimental refusal of reunion is rewarded and paid off. Specificity of river race in mist, spiral shell as DNA proxy, lend non-generic charge. Slight proximity to “writer unblocks” template keeps score from 9-band.</comment>
